   <p>Among the guests who arrived in our city, yesterday, was General Edward Salomon who commanded the 82nd German Infantry Regiment of Illinois during the Civil War. General Salomon, whose present home is San Francisco, is an old Chicagoan and well known here, and we are glad to greet him on an occasion which is so important to Chicago. General Heinzmann and a number of the General's old comrades were at the Union Station to welcome him and were quite surprised to hear the General call every one by his name, not forgetting even one during the absence of many years. By special invitation of the comrades of the General's regiments, the 82nd and the 24th, A. C. Hesing and Henry Greenebaum joined them, for both of these gentlemen are personal friends of the General and both of whom were responsible to have brought into existence those German regiments. Then, preceded by the flag and banner of the 82nd Regiment, the party arrived at Fink and Heinzmann's tavern where speeches of welcome were delivered. Complying with a request Mr. Hesing recalled the years when General Salomon lived in Chicago, and how he (Hesing) induced the governor to attach the Chicago enrolled Scandinavian company to that of the 82nd Regiment, thus making the regiment complete. To this General Salomon replied, that Mr. Hesing was to be accredited with more noble deeds rendered the 82nd Regiment, for he had formed, also, a company of the "Hesing Sharpshooters". At the same time another company, composed exclusively of members of the Jewish faith, was brought into existence through the efforts of Henry Greenebaum who also furnished the company with funds for the purchase of equipment. A warm tribute was paid to Mr. Hesing by General Salomon for his services to the German people of Chicago: "Of the Germans of Chicago ever forget the valuable services rendered them by Mr. Hesing, they would prove the most unappreciative people upon this earth. I have followed the German history of Chicago, although far away, therefore I can give an unbiased opinion." Captain George Miller in his speech also glorified "Den alten Hesing", as he used to call him. To this Mr. Hesing replied, that he did not feel entitled to all the credit given him; what could he have done without the energetic support of the Germans? It is true, he said, that the position he holds now was due to his own merits and had earned him great respect of the American people. President Cleveland's visit to Chicago inspired him to put a banner above the entrance of the Staats Zeitung building which bears the inscription: "Americans of German origin were always faithful, and will remain always faithful to the union".</p>
