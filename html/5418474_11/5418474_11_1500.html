   <p>One of the best known German-Americans of Chicago, William Vocke, passed away yesterday. A heart attack ended a career, which, in respect to love for the country of his birth and everything that is German, and the adherence to his adopted country, could serve as example to all Americans of German extraction. A seemingly not very dangerous throat malady, which attacked him a year ago, compelled Mr. Vocke to remain in bed last Thursday. After an improvement in his condition yesterday morning, all of a sudden in the afternoon, a relapse occurred, and by evening he was laready dead. William Vocke was born on April 4th, 1839 in Minden, Westphalia, the son of a high government official. After his father's death, as a 17 year old youth, alone in the world, Vocke went to New York, and soon afterwards, in the year 1851 to Chicago. His first occupation was that of a carrier for the Illinois Staats Zeitung, But the ambition of the clever young man was directed towards something higher, and he studied law in his leisure hours. The acquaintanceship with Professor Henry Booth who at that time was one of the best known jurists of Chicago, proved of great advantage to him because he interested himself in the highly talented youth. After a few years, Mr. Vocke obtained a position as collector with the Real Estate firm Ogden, Fleetwood &amp; Co., but soon the Civil War broke out, and Vocke joined the Northern army. Having participated in a number of battles, he retired from the army as a captain, returned to Chicago, again entered the services of the newspaper for which he worked as a carrier, but this time as a local editor. Later he accepted a position with the city police. Previously he finished his law education and in the year 1867 passed his examination to become a member of the bar. He began to practice in 1869. In the year 1870 he was elected to the legislature, and made a name for himself through the issuance of a decree. The "Burnt Record Act" necessitated on account of the big fire in Chicago. He also took part in 1872 at the extra session of the Legislature.</p>
