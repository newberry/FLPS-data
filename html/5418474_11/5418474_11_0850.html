   <p>Our homeland is temporarily defeated and is suffering under the heavy blows of fate. History teaches us that liberty for the people can never be gained except at the cost of great sacrifices. The highest objective for our homeland is a Germany free in every respect. The segregation of the people into classes, as unfortunately has been the case in Germany, is unworthy of a progressive people and therefore had to be crushed by force just as anything should be that is obsolete and reminiscent of slavery. No matter how hard the internal struggle is at present, Germany will not remain prostrate and inactive, for the intelligence with which these people are endowed cannot be suppressed, but will help in the resurrection of a free German people with spiritual strength. Together with internal and external peace, and the friendship of all other nations in the world, there will also return an indefatigable will to achieve reconstruction, which will promote prosperity and which is, to a marked degree, the characteristic trait of the German nation.</p>

   <p>Even if Germany has to adjust her boundaries, those who are separated from the fatherland will always do their part and will always be loyal to their homeland, to which they owe their culture and customs. Let the haters of everything German (and they are certainly not burdened with intelligence) rave and slander and suppress. I will say this to these stupid maniacs, that nobody can take away from the German people their achievements and accomplishments in science, by which the whole world has profited. This fact will surely be reckoned with at the peace conference, and America, especially, will have a word to say about it, for it is to the best interests of this country that Germany, as a people and nation, occupy that place among peoples which it deserves. Therefore, fellow citizens, both men and women, who, by your intelligence and industry, have helped to make this country what it is, let the wolves howl. Nature did not provide any better means for them to make themselves recognized for what they are, but, with all their howling, they will not prevent our homeland from living again in peace without hate. To ourselves <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in particular, and to the rest of the world, a new and free Germany will be born, which may remain the freest nation of them all.</p>
   <p>Brothers and sisters, for your own sake and for that of your adopted country, learn to be proud of your origin. Do your duty toward America to the best of your ability, for this land, your new home, means the most to you, but stand up for your rights and do not apologize for your origin. Be proud of what the German-Americans have contributed to this country and to its development. Let me mention only a few things. Among 1,740,000 farm owners there are 585,000 of German descent, and these produce more grain than all others combined. Are these industrious people not the greatest asset to this country? And German diligence, knowledge, and perseverance make even a better showing in industry. Only people as blind as bats fail to recognize the assets which America has gained by the influx of the Germans. Preserve your customs and habits; love your native tongue; keep a German newspaper lest you forget to think in German and, by doing so, America, our new home, will profit, for German customs and habits have proved to have more moral effect in this country than all other good or dubious remedies put together. If our native land was hated by many nations, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>certainly it was not the German people who were to blame, and, by celebrating peace here we will at the same time celebrate the resurrection of a free Germany. President Wilson will redeem his promise at the conference table, and will remember his statement that he respects the German people but did not have any confidence in their government. Let us, therefore, not become discouraged. The world will be so arranged that every nation will be given the opportunity to prove its worth. In this way neither our native land nor our new homeland will be at a disadvantage.</p>
