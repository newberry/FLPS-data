   <p>Dr. Gertrude Ferber arrived here this morning from Washington, D. C. and registered at Hotel Bismarck. Miss Ferber is the business manager of the Carl Schurz Society of Berlin, Germany, which was founded by Mr. Erkelenz, a member of the German parliament.</p>
   <p>Its purpose is to create a better understanding between the people of the United States and those of Germany.</p>
   <p>Miss Ferber came to America to become acquainted with this country and its people. She has already visited New York, Philadelphia and Washington and intends to visit Detroit and Cleveland. She will return to Germany in December.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ferber came as a guest of the Hamburg-America Line and will return as a guest of the North German Lloyd.</p>
   
   <p>Questioned about the purpose of her trip, Miss Ferber said: "In my capacity as business manager of the Carl Schurz Society, I had an opportunity to become acquainted with Americans who stayed in Germany last summer and who were guests of this society.</p>
   <p>"With some of them I became well acquainted and I shall pay them now a visit; at the same time I am eager to study the customs of this country. My visit is strictly private and has not the purpose to collect money for the Carl Schurz Society."</p>
   <p>This society gives help and advice to foreigners who are sojourning in Germany.</p>
   <p>Among the Americans who - according to Miss Ferber - were guests of the society last summer were Mayor Walker of New York, Senator Wagner, Richard Reinhardt of Kansas, the editors of numerous American newspapers, and other personalities well known in America.</p>
