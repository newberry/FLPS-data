   <p>At the invitation of the German section of the Socialist party of Chicago, several members of the German Reichstag lectured in the North Side Turner Hall on German socialism, the economic relationships in Germany, and on the impressions which they had received during the course of their short stay in the United States. After some songs by the Gesangverein Freiheit, Kurt Marx, a member of the party and an author and speaker, undertook in a long address to introduce the guests to the audience.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was Kurt Rosenfeld, an attorney from Berlin. He began his lecture by recounting the impressions which he and the other members of the commission [the delegation to the Interparliamentary Conference] had received with respect to the United States in general, and the economic life here in particular. It was believed that the United States was a real wonderland as far as its industries were concerned, he said, but it had not been possible to get a real picture of the situation. Astonishment was the first and the lasting <span class="page-break">\2</span>reaction which he and the others had experienced, especially with reference to industry. Perhaps they had come to a "wonderland," but its industries were kindergarten stuff when compared with those of Germany. He went into details about their visit to the Stockyards, where everything is "on the line," and where the advantage of division of labor is so clearly demonstrated. Everything went like clockwork, and yet one could not get rid of the impression that the reception and entertainment committee desired to show only the bright side, and not the dark. And so they had tried to find the dark side on their own hook. They recognized that in the great slaughterhouse industry the worker is really just a cog in the huge machine; that not the foreman, but the machine itself is responsible for the speed-up, and that the same holds true for other industries also; that economically the American workers are better off, and yet they are exploited far more than the German workers.</p>
   <p>The speaker then went into detail concerning the German Republic and its prospects. It is by no means perfect, he said, but by its own efforts it is drawing closer and closer to perfection, no matter what obstacles are put in its <span class="page-break">\3</span>path. The Republic was proclaimed, and the Republic will endure. There is much that does not deserve to be called model; the form of government is not responsible for this, however, but certain circumstances and conditions, especially the failure of the bourgeois parties to co-operate.</p>
   <p>The speaker was repeatedly interrupted by shouts and applause, especially by shouts of "Hindenburg!" Mr. Rosenfeld explained that the Monarchists and Communists had put Hindenburg in the saddle, but that it must be conceded that the former field marshal remained true to the pledge that he had given the government in power, and that he had undertaken nothing that might lead to its downfall. The hope of the Monarchists that the monarchy might be restored is ridiculous. The last feeble ray of hope for such an outcome vanished once and for all when Wilhelm II fled for Holland.</p>
   <p>The second speaker of the evening was Wilhelm Sollmann, who gave a clear and illuminating description of the situation in Germany. He made no attempt to hide the difficulties under which the present form of government in Germany is <span class="page-break">\4</span>still laboring, but he called attention to the fact that even in the United States progress was gradual at first, and that even here things are still not perfect or free from flaws. Germany's collapse happened overnight, though many had long foreseen it, and it was a question of hastily rearing a new structure on top of the ruins. It was a question of finding one's way in the midst of indescribable chaos, and that is no easy task. The refining process was completed nonetheless, although it was very slow. Germany will some day become a model republic; the republic will develop out of the people, and this is the work of socialism. Not by crude violence will the world be transformed, but by the power of words, by ideas, and that is the thing which welds comrades together, and which will some day enable Germany to rise out of the ruins and ashes, a greater nation than ever before.</p>
   <p>It was with great anticipation that the audience awaited the address by Frau Louise Schroeder, delegate to the Reichstag. With glowing words she portrayed the progress made since the collapse of the monarchy in the movement to emancipate women. (By emancipation of women is meant woman suffrage, which will <span class="page-break">\5</span>certainly be a blessing to Germany some time.) It was the women, she said, who were Germany's mainstay in its hour of greatest need. They were the ones who worked in the munition factories,....and who kept the wheels of German industry turning. They endured hardships just as much as the soldiers in the trenches. Again and again, by word and deed, they inspired the German people to stand by their colors, and in the new German Republic they continued to exert themselves to the utmost in their effort to aid Germany in its recovery.</p>
   <p>The deputy Carl Hildebrand, former Prime Minister of Wuerttemberg, and Dr. Paul Loebe were the last speakers. They were brief, and in their remarks followed the main points made by those who preceded them on the speakers' platform. Hildebrand emphasized that Germany should not have signed the acknowledgment of [war] guilt in the Versailles treaty.</p>
   <p>Today the German guests will take the opportunity to learn as much as possible about Chicago under the guidance of the members of the citizens' committee. Yesterday they made a visit to the mail-order house of Sears-Roebuck &amp; Co., and <span class="page-break">\6</span>met with a very friendly welcome from Mr. Julius Rosenwald, chairman of the board of directors, President C. M. Kittle, Vice-President Max Adler, A. B. Schmidt, and C. B. Henderson.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wirth spoke this noon at a luncheon of the Chicago Council of Foreign Relations, in the Sherman Hotel, and tomorrow will be the guest of honor and main speaker at the luncheon of the Chicago Association of Commerce in the La Salle Hotel.</p>
   <p>The following delegates to the Interparliamentary Conference in Washington accepted the invitation of the local citizens' committee to visit Chicago.</p>
   <p>Paul Loebe, President of the German Reichstag; Dr. Joseph K. Wirth, former Chancellor of the Reich and member of the Reichstag; Wilhelm Sollmann, former Minister of the Interior and member of the Reichstag; and the following members of the Reichstag: Franz Bartschat, Karl Hildenbrand, the Reverend Adolf Korell, Frau Tusnelda Lang-Brumann, Dr. Fritz Mittelmann, Hans Rauch, Dr. Kurt Rosenfeld, <span class="page-break">\7</span>Frau Louise Schroeder, and Frau Christine Teusch. The representatives of the German minority parties in Poland were Herr Graebe and Herr Krajczyrski, while the representative of the German minority in Czechoslovakia was Herr D. Medinger.</p>
