   <p>In answer to a question pertaining to recruiting, it was decided yesterday, that the German American regiment will only accept applicants who were either born in Germany of those who are descendants of Germans. Mr. Naef, the president of the Columbia Park Association offered his beautiful park to the "Agitation Committee" <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for the 5th or 12th of June, if it is considered desirable to arrange a picnic for the benefit of the Regiment-fund. Mr. Dewes declared: it will hardly be necessary to resort to such measures in order to obtain the necessary means for the regimental equipment, but nevertheless, the offer deserves consideration.</p>
