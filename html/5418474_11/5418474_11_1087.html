   <p>Gustave A. Brand, the well-known city treasurer, again proved himself to be a public benefactor by donating two wonderful works of art to the church of St. Paul, Fullerton Avenue and Orchard Street, Dr. George L. Scherger, pastor. These are copies of Hofmann's "Christ on the way to Golgotha" and Rubens' "Descent from the cross". They will greatly enhance the beauty of the church of St. Paul.</p>
   <p>The consecration of these paintings will take place next Sunday, June 16th, at 8 P. M. Everyone is cordially invited. It is going to be a twofold solemnity; on the one hand, homage to Herr Brand, and on the other hand, memorial services for the late Pastor Jacob Pister, to whose memory Hofmann's picture is dedicated.</p>
   <p>All Germans should take part in this meeting.</p>
