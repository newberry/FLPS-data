   <p>Yesterday, on the evening of the day when the body of Paul von Hindenburg, President of the Reich, was laid to rest in the Tannenberg monument, the German Consul General of Chicago held a memorial service in St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church, at the corner of Fullerton Avenue and Orchard Street. As was expected, the throng at this memorial service was so large that the Church itself and the adjoining Sunday-school rooms were not large enough to hold all those who wished to pay their last respects to the universally revered field marshal and statesman.</p>
   <p>For this occasion the wall behind the altar of the Church was draped with the flag of the President of the Reich on the left, the Swastika banner on the right, and the American flag in the center. Under the pulpit hung a picture of the great dead. The lights were draped in black. At this ceremony, held by the local Germans to show their esteem for the "Father of the Fatherland," the diplomatic representatives of foreign nations were present, as well as representatives of the American Army and Navy, and one representative of the American Red Cross. Many of these were in brilliant uniforms.</p>
   
   <p>All the consuls were there, under the leadership of their dean, Commendatore Castruccio, the Italian Consul General. Representatives of the city, county, and Nation were also present.</p>
   <p>While the organist, Charles Espenshade, played the mighty strains of Beethoven's "Trauermarsch" (Funeral March), the color guards of the veterans' associations and of the national societies marched in. Representatives of the Deutscher Krieger-Bund (League of German War Veterans), the Verein Deutscher Weltkriegsveteranen (Society of German World War Veterans), the Deutscher Krieger-verein (German Veterans' Society), the Krieger-Kameradschaft (Veterans' Comradeship), the Marine-Bundes (Marines' Association), the Landwehrverein (Landwehr Society), the Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Militaervereine (Austro-Hungarian Military Societies), the Stahlhelm (Steel Helmet), and the Bund Der Freunde Des Neuen Deutschland (Society of the Friends of New Germany), were present at the ceremony, taking their position near the chancel.</p>
   <p>An instrumental quartet played the hymn, "Wenn ich einmal soll scheiden, So scheid" du nicht von mir" (If I ever have to go away, Do not leave me). Then the pastor of the Church, Dr. [George L.] Scherger, began the ceremony by reciting the passage from the Psalm, "Es sollen wohl Bergen weichen." [The quotation is actually Isaiah 54,10: "Mountains shall depart." Perhaps Psalm 46.2 is meant.] The Schiller Liedertafel joined with the Schleswig-Holsteiner Saengerbund in singing, under the direction of Reinhold Walter, Beethoven's "Hymne An Die Nacht" (Hymn to the Night), which found its echo in the hearts of the audience. Then came the reading of the Scripture by Reverend A. F. Muensterman, president of the Evangelischer Pfarrerverband (Association of Ministers of the Evangelical Lutheran Church), who selected passages from John, Chapter 9, and the Ninetieth Psalm. The incomparable "Vater Unser," by Schubert, was sung with great feeling by Mrs. Dorothea Derrfuss. A second reading from the Bible followed, this time by Reverend Louis W. Goebel, vice-president of the Evangelische und Reformierte (Evangelical and Reformed) Church, who read from the Ninety-first Psalm. The playing of the song, "Es ist bestimmt in Gottes Rat," by the horn quartet, a moving prayer by Timothy Lehmann, president of Elmhurst College, and the singing of Schubert's "Sanctus" by the choir, led up to the funeral sermon which was given by the Reverend Dr. Scherger.</p>
   <p>In his references to history, Dr. Scherger sought to show the pure German character of this great man. By the holding of this memorial service in connection with religious services, sufficient homage already had been paid to the deep piety which was an inseparable part of the life of the President of the Reich. Hindenburg's chief characteristics, his faithfulness to duty, his love of the German people, and the firmness of his character, were described by the speaker, who drew examples from the eventful life of the deceased.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the sermon, Mrs. Dorothea Derrfuss sang another solo, "Meine Seele ist stille zu Gott".</p>
   <p>With the simple words of the Lord's Prayer, and the bestowal of the blessing by the Reverend Herman T. Schick, the ceremony reached its climax. Few were unmoved by the beauty of these words and the notes of "Ich hatt' einen Kameraden" (I had a comrade). A bugle call was sounded to the dead warrior and field marshal, lying in his last resting place, the grave.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the ceremony the organist, Charles Espenshade, played the funeral march from "Siegfried," while the crowd streamed out of the Church.</p>
   
   <p>About five thousand persons took part in the ceremony. Two thousand seats had been provided in the Church proper, and one thousand in the basement.</p>
   <p>A detachment of police directed traffic perfectly.</p>
   <p>Celebration in Old Heidelberg Inn</p>
   <p>Late last evening, in the Old Heidelberg Inn on Randolph Street, George Hessberger and his Bavarian Concert Orchestra gave a special program in memory of the dead President of the German Reich. The conductor, who himself took part in the World War, and was decorated a number of times, spoke a few thoughtful words, while the music played in a subdued manner. In the course of the memorial program, the well-known "Ave Maria" by Gounod, the Soldiers' song, Ich hatt' einen Kameraden" (I had a comrade), the riding song "Morgenrot" (The Red Sky of Morning), and others were rendered.</p>
