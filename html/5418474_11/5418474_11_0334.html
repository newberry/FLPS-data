   <p>In our country most people look upon the racial theories of the German National Socialists with hearty disapproval or superior smiles. Actually they have no reason to do this, for very similar phenomena are to be seen right here. Nationalism is again putting forth splendid blossoms, poisonous blossoms. In the Saturday Evening Post of April 20 there is an article called "Immigration Crisis," by Martin Dies, which is a masterpiece of narrow-minded nationalism, of ignorance and stupidity.</p>
   <p>Dies is the Representative of the Second District of Texas in the House of Representatives. He is a member of the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, and hence is a specialist, so to speak, in this field. In his article he first summarizes the history of immigration. He states that in 1790 <span class="page-break">\2</span>the country had 3,172,444 inhabitants, all of whom, with the exception of the Pennsylvania Dutch, spoke English. From 1790 to 1860 the population rose to 31,443,321. The number of immigrants had reached four million. They came from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Germany. Then the article states, "At the end of this period, the racial unity of the United States was intact."</p>
   <p>Dies is, therefore, of the opinion that the immigrants from Northwestern Europe, the English, the Scotch, the Irish, and the Germans, are of the same race. This is not entirely true. The English are a mixed people, and are descendants of the Britons, the Normans, and the Germans. In the Scotch the Celtic element is predominant, and this is even more true in the case of the Irish.</p>
   <p>Dies lays emphasis, however, on the common language, which is probably admissible evidence. If you take this into consideration you can admit that Dies' <span class="page-break">\3</span>statement with regard to racial unity is somewhat justified.</p>
   <p>He then reports that until 1880 only five per cent of the immigrants came from Southern and Eastern Europe, but that after this time a considerable majority of the immigrants came from these countries. There were over eight million of them during the period from 1890 to 1910. With regard to this Dies writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"Industrial greed which subordinated the ultimate good of the country to the immediate and temporary profits that cheap pauper labor seemed to promise, combined with that maudlin sentimentality which has ever been the curse of our nation, and the principal source of the ills [Editor's note: The exact phrase used by Mr. Dies was "many of the ills"] which we have brought upon ourselves, dictated this unwise and destructive policy. Today, as a result of this policy, we have more than 40,000,000 people of foreign stock in our midst."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>This is very edifying. And so Mr. Dies is of the opinion that the people whose fathers and mothers, or even grandfathers and grandmothers, came from Southern and Eastern Europe, do not belong here. They are of "Foreign Stock". Of this racial theory there is nothing to be found in the Constitution or in the statute books. The theory has existed however, among certain parts of the population, that is,among the most narrow-minded and bigoted.</p>
   <p>In his article Dies gave special attention to certain amendments to the immigration law by which certain harsh features of the law should have been eliminated. There is no need to deal with these remarks in detail. Only one more passage from the article should be quoted. This is as follows:</p>
   <p>"If our Nation had recognized the dangers inherent in its immigration policy, and had promptly excluded the twenty million or more aliens that have since swelled the ranks of labor, agriculture, and business, it is reasonable to <span class="page-break">\5</span>believe that the unemployment problem would never have assumed such serious and unprecedented proportions. In fact, it is not improbable that a surplus of labor would have remained unknown in our generation."</p>
   <p>The statesman from Texas has produced a masterpiece of absurdity monumental in its proportions. With a superficiality and stupidity that seem almost superhuman, he figures that we would have had no unemployed if we had refused admittance to twenty million immigrants. Doesn't Mr. Dies know that there are still enormous areas of land in the United States which have scarcely been settled? Doesn't he know that not one hundred and twenty million, but about a billion and a half people would be living in this country if it had the same density of population as Germany, for example? And yet Germany is by no means the most heavily populated country in Europe.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Dies would only look up the statistics on this subject, he would learn that the "native" Americans whom he prizes so highly are unable even to preserve their present members and that, as the result of voluntary birth control, <span class="page-break">\6</span>they would die out if the population were not continually renewed and rejuvenated by immigration. Today it is well known that every sound and normal human being is an asset to the community, and that a people has no more valuable possession than its human material. For other peoples these are commonplace, but the statesman from Texas has not heard of them yet.</p>
