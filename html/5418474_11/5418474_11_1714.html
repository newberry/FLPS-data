   <p>Death has again torn a gap into the dwindling group of old Chicago settlers. This time it is John Weckler, who died yesterday at his home at 519 Sedgwick Street, 85 years old.</p>
   <p>Weckler came in 1836 from Germany to Chicago, where he lived all his life. He earned his living at first as a woodcutter, but saved industriously and opened in 1841 the historic "Kinzie Street House", which was located on Kinzie Street between La Salle and Wells Streets. It became the first hotel on the North side and at the same time the meeting place for all Chicago, Germans. The deceased is survived by five sons and four daughters, all grown up.</p>
   <p>The funeral will be next Sunday at 9:30 A.M. at the St. Michael's Church, Cleveland Avenue and Eugenie Street.</p>
