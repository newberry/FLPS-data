   <p>Death claimed a man of Chicago's population, who enjoyed the general love and respect of its citizens, Johnny Hand, and who was intimately connected with its musical and social life. There was a time when no festival, whether public or private, could be thought of without Johnny Hand and his orchestra. His music was heard at weddings in the best known Chicago families like General Phil Sheridan, Potter Palmer, General Fred Dent Grant, George M. Pullman, and many others. In later years, johnny Hand did not wave the baton any more. His sons followed in his footsteps taking their father's place, but he did not disappear from the memory of his many acquaintances. That was proved by the number of mourners who appeared at his funeral. Played by his orchestra, his boys, was Schuman's "Traumerei". It sounded sadly through the room filled with beautiful flowers, in which his body lay in state, and deep mourning was noticed not only on the members of his family, but even the little grandchildren. It affected everybody to have to take leave of the mortal remains of the beloved conductor of the great city, in which he grew up. Pastor R. A. John conducted the funeral service at the home, after which the orchestra played Massenet's "Elegie". When the funeral procession started towards Graceland cemetery the orchestra, playing a funeral march, was at its head. Many prominent citizens came to accompany the old friend on his last way. Among them were as honorary pallbearers: Charles G. Dawes, John J. Mitchell, Bertram Winston, Charles Balatka, John P. Riley, Adolph George, August C. Bournique, Dr. Florenz Ziegfeld and George Stevens. The actual pallbearers were: G. H. Riley, William Brown, Martin Ballinann, Clarence O. Jones, Frank Schrage and Herbert Peters.</p>
