   <p>The Democrats of Chicago have chosen Heinrich Raab as Superintendent of Public Schools and so announced his nomination yesterday. As a fact, there is no other schoolman in Chicago fit for this job, which Heinrich Raab was holding already for several years to the greatest satisfaction of the community.</p>
   <p>Heinrich Raab is a humanitarian and scientist, at the same time an experienced educator and practical schoolman. He was born and raised in Germany. He brought with him to this country the thoroughness of the strict German educational system, which he knew how to mix skillfully with the broad-minded spirit of American teaching.</p>
   <p>For us Germans, Heinrich Raab is a man to be proud of, and every Chicago German should give his vote to him.</p>
