   <p>The collections for the Eckener fund were discontinued several days ago. [Doctor Eckener, commander of the Zeppelin dirigible during the first aerial trip around the world.] The results justify the pride of all who have been associated with the drive, the donors as well as the collectors who dedicated their labors to the cause. The members of the committee deserve congratulations. The success exceeded the expectations of many. In the main it was accomplished by the leaders and their officials who displayed such an unselfish interest, giving time and effort in unstinting measure.</p>
   <p>The sum in itself, which was attained by such concerted effort, is not as important as the large number of contributors. May the results of this collection help in furthering the progress of the Zeppelins!</p>

   <p>The Abendpost has received protests from the Chicago Eckener Testimonial Fund and the German group of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair. Severe criticism has been expressed about a letter published under our caption "Vox Populi," October 2. In this "Voice of the People" column, the alleged business methods of the treasurers of both organizations were spoken of in a derogatory manner. The editorial staff of the Abendpost hereby declares that the publishing of this letter was involuntary and unjustified because the writer did not divulge his true identity. This in itself is a transgression on our inflexible, iron rule. How this oversight on our part occured, is still an unexplained mystery. The management considers it its duty to acknowledge this error and to express its profound regrets.</p>
   <p>In common with Chicago's Germans, we share in the enthusiasm brought about by the outstanding success of this drive and we thank all who worked for this cause.</p>

   <p>[An account published on November 10, 1929, lists $14,912.53 as the total. It is not stated whether this represents the final sum at the close of the collection, or drive.</p>
   <p>[In regard to the anonymous letter: The writer declared after contributing money to the Hindenburg drive and the German group of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair, he was deluged by announcements from various investment houses, etc. He further stated that the Germans should not use such honorary offices as a means of providing a private income from other sources.
