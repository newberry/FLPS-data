   <p>Highly interesting materials were sent from Berlin to the Travel Exhibition, which will be held at the Stevens Hotel.</p>
   <p>Since over 350,000 Americans traveled abroad last year to study in foreign countries,we should expect that this exhibition will be a splendid success.</p>
   <p>In the first place, the exhibition will present the development of travel methods from the most primitive beginnings up to the modern times. It will show how Indians traveled on snow-shoes and on horses; how the pioneers used covered wagons and how mail was delivered in early times. It will show the way caravans travel over the desert; still used today by the Japanese; the modern steamer developing from a canoe, crudely fashioned by hollowing out a tree trunk and the development of airplanes.</p>
   <p>Furthermore,films will present the romance of traveling and the wonders of far away countries. Greenland and Italy, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Japan, the United States and other countries of the globe will be presented in word and pictures.</p>
