   <p>The chairman of the State Central Committee, succeeded with his persuasiveness to reconcile Mr. Altgeld, with the prevailing situation. The Ex-Governor promised him to meet his previous accepted obligations, namely, to take part in the opening campaign meeting, and to discuss the most vital issues of the day.</p>
   <p>Altgeld's change of mind and the resumption of his obligations has restored unity in the camp of the Democratic Party apparently. Both the State and the County chairman of the Committee, expressed their confidence that the opposing party will, find at the election a solid Democratic phalanx. A united democracy is equivalent to a victorious democracy. ..Altgeld's change of mind is by no means a welcome report for the Republicans because it destroys their beautiful dream of fighting at the election against disunited opponents.</p>
