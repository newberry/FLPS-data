   <p>The Democratic party vigorously denies that Ex-Governor Altgeld has taken an unfriendly attitude towards the candidates on the county ticket. Ex-Judge W. Prentiss, known as Ex-Governor Altgeld's right hand man in local party affairs, made the following statement yesterday: "The whole gossip about a quarrel between Altgeld and the County leaders is nothing else but a Republican campaign lie, which is to create the impression by the voters that there is no unity among the Democrats. The fact is, that Mr. Altgeld, is not at all antagonistic toward the county candidates. It is just as desirable for him, as it is to the candidates that they come out victorious. Mr. Altgeld will give a number of speeches in favor of the county ticket, as soon as he has finished his political discourses in Missouri."</p>
   <p>This will end the Republican gossip that discord prevails in the Democratic camp.</p>
