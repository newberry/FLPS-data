   <p>One of the best known and most respected German citizens of Chicago, Louis Nettelhorst, died last evening - after only a two days sickness, at his home at 46 Wisconsin street. Whoever knew the deceased, and which German of Chicago did not - will receive the news of his demise, with great sorrow. - Because Louis Nettelhorst was one of those Giants, of indestructible strength, for whom, seemingly, there could be no physical suffering, and for that reason he did not pay any attention to the deadly malady, which got hold of him several weeks ago, and continued to attend to his professional business. Only Sunday did he consent, to have a physician called, but on Monday he went back to work as usual, but was compelled to go home during the day, - Dr.Matthai and Dr.Geiger, who were called, recognized at once, that he was suffering from a deathly kidney trouble, and in spite of all the assistance given, there was no help. Yesterday evening he lost consciousness, and three hours afterwards, he breathed his last, without being able to say farewell to his sorrowing family. Nettelhorst was striken with the Flu two years ago and could never overcome the effects of this malevolent sickness. Mr.Nettelhorst was born in Bremen, on February 4th, 1857. He received a good education, became a business man and emigrated to America in 1870.
