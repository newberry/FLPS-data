   <p>The formation of the Turner-Regiment is progressing rapidly, so reports Captain Bloch with pride.</p>
   <p>Among the men who wanted to join, are many who served in the German army. There is such a large contingent of artillerists, that the leaders contemplate to separate them and form a battery. This would surely be a valuable addition to the National army. The recruiting (training) will be continued at the Northside Turnhall, until further notice. The Independent Order of Honor, i. e. the gentlemen who conduct its affairs, have offered to give a festival on the 15th or 23rd of May. The net proceeds will be given to the treasurer of the Turner regiment.</p>
   <p>The female patriots of the temperance Club, "Christian Women" urgently requested of General Miles, that he prohibit the use of intoxicating beverages among the troeps at the camps.</p>
