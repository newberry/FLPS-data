   <p>The undersigned, treasurer of the Sigel Agitationskomite herewith respectfully submits a report on the receipts and disbursements. In paragraph A is a detailed account of money received for drinks, for admission ribbons, etc. In paragraph B is a detailed list of expenditures. Mr. Rosenthal, who was in charge of admissions, also had a number of tickets made for his own convenience, and placed them on sale at various bars, realizing $39.50 in this way. His net receipts were increased by this amount.</p>
   <p>From this report it is evident to the German public of this city that the Sigel festivities were anything but successful from the financial standpoint. It was a great mistake to select the Fourth of July as the day to hold the Sigel celebration. As usual, quite a number of fires were reported in the afternoon of this Independence Day, and that fact kept thousands from attending the picnic. At the same time we had to compete with many other <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Independence Day picnics. For instance, thousands of our fellow citizens of German descent were at picnics in or about Chicago--in Haase's Park, Waukegan, Oak Forest, etc. And it is for that reason chiefly that our celebration was a fiasco, not one tenth of the expected attendance appeared. Our citizens still have the opportunity to save the reputation of Chicago's Germans by making direct contributions to the Sigel Fund.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>Heinrich Greenbaum.</p>
