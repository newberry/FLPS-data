   <p>The once abundant flow of emigration from Germany has now almost entirely discontinued. When economic distress was severe, subsequent to the founding of the German Empire, five of every hundred thousand citizens determinedly forsook their native home to find a new existence for themselves and their families across the ocean. Since to the economic conditions mentioned, is attributed the extent of emigration, its decrease would be an indication of the improved conditions over there. Hence we have an uninterrupted downward trend of tired Germans emigrating. In th 80's from five per thousand of the population, it fell to only 2%, ten years later, in 1893, then to less then 1%, and, finally only to 0.28%, which brought to this country, about 18,545 persons from the "Fatherland". To judge, by the discouraging statistics, of the future of German Culture in North America, it would be sad indeed, were it not, that we are not concerned with their political divisions at home, but we primarily consider the fact of their German origin and language, a culture they possess in common. Hence, it does not appear necessary to expect the waning of German culture here. On the contrary, it blossoms and grows, and its strength is constantly increased by the addition of immigration from German -speaking countries. The totals have reached about 13,000 annually, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and in May of this year alone, there came to North America 7,982 persons, who claimed German as their mother tongue. Considering these figures for the year, they will give a good picture of the size of immigration, which approximatly has kept around these figures for ten years.</p>
   <p>In spite of all pessimistic prophecies, we must state, in view of 75,000 yearly, new arrivals, German-American Culture has an expanding rich future here and will effectively counteract the leveling process of their English environment. The German press, schools, churches and societies will continue to prosper and to work. However, the vociferous belittlers of German Culture and its deserved credit in the development of North America, may consider it a mote in their own eyes.</p>
