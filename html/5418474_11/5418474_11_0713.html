   <p>Baron Eric Von Bergen, German art expert of the collection of paintings owned by Prince Ludwig Ferdinand of Bavaria, arrived in Chicago yesterday and registered at the Palmer House. He plans a round trip through America for the purpose of inspecting different American Art Galleries. He declared frankly, that he is surprised at finding the cultural progress, which this country has made in the last few years. He also commended highly the American painting collections, although he said that in his opinion, the collections contained many pictures, not because of their artistic value, but more for the sake of the name of the artists.</p>
   <p>Baron Von Bergen intends, above all, to go to California to make a thorough inspection of the Rembrandt portrait which was only recently discovered and hitherto unknown. Another picture was painted over the original. This portrait was sold by a Russian peasant women to an art dealer in Los Angeles for a few dollars. The value of this portrait is estimated at the present time at $30,000.</p>
