   <p>The School Board Committee for Music Institition resolved yesterday to recommend for the seventh grade of the Public Schools the introduction of the third book of the Cecilia-series and for the eighth grade the provision of the second book of the Beacon-series as instruction books. Mr. G. Katzenberger, head instructor for the Music in the High Schools, was cited before the Committee to justify himself of the accusations that he misuses his position by forcing his Assistants to take private instruction from him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Katzenberger assured this statement to be untrue, he never had even an idea of doing such a thing. The Committee appointed Mr. Katzenberger, Mr. Cox,and Mrs. Blackman, to work out a system that will enable the class-teachers to acquire by June 1897 the necessary preliminary knowledge to conduct later the Singing Instruction independently.</p>
