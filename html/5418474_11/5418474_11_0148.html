   <p>Admiral Schley is today (and for the next two days) the guest of the City of Chicago, and he certainly will not have to complain about his reception and treatment. The German Chicagoans are unanimously "for Schley" and a delegation of 25 as representatives of the German clubs will greet him.</p>
   <p>The Americans are often accused of being rough materialists and to have a mind and understanding only for outer greatness, to honor only visible success. But how is this with Schley?</p>
   <p>The guest for whom the heart of Chicago beats warmly is a retired admiral. He left the active service; he has no offices or honors to give away, and he is a comparatively poor man. Right: he has won a sea battle! He was the commander-in-chief of the American squadron on July 3rd, 1898, when it destroyed the Spanish battleships. But that war lies far behind us; three and one-half years have passed since that feat of arms, and one has learned to judge calmly about the whole affair; there are today many people who deplore it and very many who do not like to talk about it. If Schley was recognized from the start as the victor of Santiago, there, on his visit, he might receive the same outward honors, but it would be different. Because the earned recognition was denied to him, because he was persecuted and because he showed himself so modest and discreet in contrast to others, the heart of the people of Chicago beats to gaily for him. The reception concerns just as much the "Man Schley" as the victorious general.</p>
   <p>Because the well-earned laurels were denied to the admiral, the people give him double honors.</p>
   <p>A people that feels and acts like this cannot have grown dissolute entirely with materialism, as is said so often.</p>
