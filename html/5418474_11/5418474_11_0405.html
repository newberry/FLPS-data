   <p>The agent of a German steamship company makes the interesting prophesy, that very soon a large part of the German immigrants will devote their efforts to farming in the New England states, especially to the cultivation of fruit and vegetables. The agent visited all the great industrial centers and the surrounding farm districts. He is convinced, that these districts can absorb almost the whole quota of German immigrants which will amount according to the new laws, to 45,000 people. These suppositions are not unjustified.</p>
   <p>The farmers in Western and Central Europe are accustomed to intensive methods, and such methods are especially necessary in New England. The accessibility of the neighborhood markets increased immensely, because of the phenomenal growth of the cities, and the distance is shortened through plans to build county roads and through the use of automobiles. The habits of hard work and economy and the habits of working jointly should be added, are advantages which are readily expected of the German Immigrant.</p>
   <p>It is also encouraging for them, that other immigrants who were not quite so fitted <span class="page-break">2</span>for farming were successful in New England.</p>
   <p>Several centuries ago, farms which were deserted by the descendants of former colonists, or were sold at a ridiculously low price, were obtained by Scandinavian immigrants. Later Italians and Poles followed and finally Russian Jews.</p>
   <p>But although New England is small, hilly, rocky, sandy and swampy, yet it always had also much fertile, productive and easily accessible lands, whose cultivation would return a plentiful profit.</p>
   <p>Many descendants of the former colonists are still farming, and undoubtedly would work the farms much more intensively, if they could employ the necessary help. Those German immigrants, who are willing to manage New England farms, but are not in the position to buy a farm, will find plenty of opportunity for work upon other farms.</p>
