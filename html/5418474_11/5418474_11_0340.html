   <p>Immigration to the United States has almost come to a standstill. There are few countries which have filled their quotas, and there is no indication that this situation will change in the near future. Nevertheless, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins has appointed a committee to study the immigration problem. This committee has now submitted a report which contains several noteworthy recommendations.</p>
   <p>First of all, the committee recommends the enacting of laws to facilitate the deportation of alien criminals. Next, the existing laws are to be so amended that the immigration of immediate relatives of person already living in the United States will be facilitated. An attempt will be made to do the same thing for persons who have been persecuted because of their religion, their race, or their political views. This can be done without any change in the existing quotas.</p>
   <p>Lastly, the committee recommends that every effort be made to stop illegal immigration. If, however, a person has entered the country illegally, has lived here for years, and has proved himself to be a good citizen, the officials are no longer to have the right to deport him. The committee has proposed an interval of five years in which deportation is possible in such cases. After this interval has elapsed the immigrant has the right to legalize his entrance into this country after the event.</p>
   <p>There is no fault to be found with these recommendations. On the other hand, there is a recommendation of the committee which is open to question. The committee advocates the appointment of an official whose duty it is to be to Americanize immigrants as quickly and completely as possible. Such an official is superfluous. The local school authorities in the great cities already do so much to aid immigrants in their transition to the American way of life that it is quite unnecessary to create a Federal office for this purpose. The only thing that it would mean would be more officials, more officeholders, more expenditures, and higher taxes. For this very reason this recommendation will be very favorably received by the politicians; the taxpayers will have a very different opinion of it, however.</p>
