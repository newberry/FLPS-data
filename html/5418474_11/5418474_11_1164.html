   <p>An old German American, of the old stamp, who in the years of prosperity played a prominent part in the business life of the city and enjoyed a good reputation, Herman Otto Lange, for many years president of the Ferguson &amp; Lange Foundry Co., died yesterday after a long illness at the home of his son-in-law, Walter F. Klein, 5401 Wayne Ave., at the age of seventy-six years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lange, who lived in Chicago since 1909, was born in Bromberg in 1855. His parents were Louis Lange and Pauline Lange, nee Braun. He visited the Junior college in his home town, emigrated to America in 1870 and settled first in Muskegon, Mich. There he filled the position of cashier of the Merchants National Bank for six years, and joined later the lumber firm, Torrent, but was also interested in several other mercantile undertakings. On October 15, 1882, he was married to Ida M. Torrent. Four children were born to them: Marguerite, now Mrs. Walter F. Klein; Nellie, now Mrs. E. Atwood; Florence, now Mrs. T. I. Robinson, and Liston.</p>
