   <p>In response to a call issued by the directors of the German Emigrant Aid Society, some thirty or forty prominent German ladies assembled yesterday afternoon at the hall of the society, on LaSalle street to tender their assistance for the proposed fair. After the object had been stated by Mr. Adolph Schoeninger, the ladies proceeded to the election of officers, which had the following result: Mrs. D. E, Bluthardt, president; Mrs. A. Johnson, Secretary; Mrs. Beck, treasurer. After a great deal of friendly discussion as to the best means of making the proposed fair a great success, an exeutive committee of four for each district of the City was appointed, whereupon the meeting adjourned.</p>
