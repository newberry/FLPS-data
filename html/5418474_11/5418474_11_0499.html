   <p>The United States has ceased to consider itself as a haven of refuge for the oppressed and distressed. They have limited immigration by certain laws, which are in reality directed against those needing help. It is therefore, obvious that it was useless to emphasize the fact, that the Europeons do not emigrate on account of unbearable conditions, but because they desire to improve them, as has been done by the Commissioners of Immigration, who were appointed in 1907 to prepare for Congress a detailed report about the immigration question. Even less appropriate was their statement that, due to this fact, the whole problem of immigration is merely economic and can not be considered from a sentimental viewpoint. Indeed there remains very little sentimentality in these laws, neither are they the result of sane economic measures. For this reason these laws have failed to meet the expectations of their originators, that is, they have not prevented, and not even diminished the immigration of undesirables. This, should have convinced the commissioner that such legislation is particularly wrong.</p>
   <p>The proposals made by the commission are concerned chiefly with an <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>"educational test" for the immigrants with the exclusion of all unmarried, untrained workers, with the limitation of immigrants from each country, and, finally, with an increase of the amount of cash required of each newcomer. It was left to Congress to use any or all of these proposals.</p>
   <p>The whole report contains nothing new, and hardly deserves the attention of Congress. The "educational test" has been frequently discussed and considered as worthless. Even more stupid would be the refusal of young and single workers, because they are the most useful and are no competition to trained workers. It would be likewise foolish to regulate the number of immigrants from each country. Such regulations, even if it could be carried out, could not stand the test. At times there would be too great a supply in the labor market. Experience has demonstrated that emigrants know best, when to come or to stay. Immigration automatically diminishes when times are not prosperous. Finally, it would be "malicious" to increase the amount of cash required to enter the United States. Since every immigrant can be returned to his mother-country within three years after landing, if he commits a crime, or if he becomes a subject of charity, it seems unnecessary to make it harder for those without means.</p>
