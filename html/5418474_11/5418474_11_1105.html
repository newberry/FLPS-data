   <p>Judge George Kersten, 3740 North Harding Avenue, died yesterday of pneumonia. He was almost eighty-one years old. The funeral will take place next Saturday in St. Clement's Church, on the corner of Orchard Street and Deming Place.</p>
   <p>With George Kersten a man has departed this life who not only made a name for himself among the Germans of his generation, but also earned distinction as a judge; for he was active as a judge no less than forty-seven years, and of these he was judge in the criminal court for almost twenty-three.</p>
   <p>Kersten was born March 21, 1853, in Chicago. His parents came from Mecklenburg. His first education he received in the then well-known German-American Institute <span class="page-break">2</span>of Strandau. He then attended Eastman's Metropolitan Business College to prepare himself for a business career. Things turned out differently, however. In 1883 Kersten was appointed police judge of the East Chicago Avenue police station, after he had studied law in his free time, taken his bar examinations and had been admitted to the bar.</p>
   <p>In 1903 Kersten was elected judge of the Circuit Court for the first time; he was assigned to the criminal court. There, as we have said, he remained the rest of his [active] career. He tried many important criminal cases of that time. He was the first to give a heavy sentence to a kidnaper.</p>
   <p>Kersten belongs, moreover, to that group of jurists who worked together to eliminate inefficiency in the workings of the criminal court, and to make the swift sentencing of criminals possible.</p>
   <p>In 1925 Kersten's strength gave out. After years of strenuous activity he <span class="page-break">3</span>was forced to retire to a sanatorium for the sake of his health. He recovered his health, to be sure, but could no longer perform his duties as judge and therefore resigned.</p>
   <p>Kersten was a member of the Democratic party. He was once the candidate of this party for the post of sheriff of Cook County, but was defeated. After that time he never sought any position other than that of judge.</p>
   <p>He is mourned by his widow and one daughter, Mrs. Lillian Borkenhagen, of Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>Kersten belonged to the Free Masons, was president for some time of the Chicago Schuetzenvereins (Rifle Club), and was a member of the Germania Maennerchor (Male Chorus), the Orpheus Maenner Chor, and the Plattdeutsche Verein (Low German Society).</p>
