   <p>Ex-Governor Altgeld expressed himself about the local election campaign just recently finished: "According to my opinion, there are three factors, which are responsible for the defeat of the Democrats. First, the complete negation of the silver question; second, the doubtful reputation of some candidates; third, the president's visit to the peace festival.</p>
   <p>"Since the silver question was pushed into the background completely, the loyal defenders of the same were puzzled and refused to support the "yellow" ticket. I called the attention to this in vain. Besides, some old Democrats were not at all satisfied with the candidates nominated.</p>
   <p>It can not be denied, that many were influenced by the frenzy of war to vote Republican, who really belong to us."</p>
