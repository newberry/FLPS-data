   <p>In San Diego, California Rudolf Brand was called by death at the beginning of this year. Mr. Brand, who was the President of the United States Brewing Company, resigned his office to spend the evening of life in leisure. It was not permitted for this always active man to enjoy the well deserved rest. The news of his demise on the shores of the Pacific struck his relations and his many personal friends like a thunder clap. Mr. Brand leaves his widow, a daughter of Karl M. Gottfried, and two sons, Philip Rudolph, and Alfred Brand. His widow and son Alfred were with him in California. Philip Brand was attending to his extensive business interests. He told, yesterday evening, a representative of the Staats Zeitung that the remains of his father will be brought back to Chicago. The funeral will take place Thursday. Mr. Brand settled first in Los Angeles but decided, a few days ago, to move to San Diego. He and his wife took the train while Mr. and Mrs. Grommes made the trip by automobile. Shortly after arriving at San Diego, Mr. Brand became ill <span class="page-break">2</span>and died in spite of immediate medical attention. On the first of August it would have been fifty years since Mr. Brand entered a small brewery in Gutersblum, Germany as an apprentice to learn the business. In 1868 he came directly to Chicago. He found employment with the Busch and Brand Brewing Co. In 1871 the buildings of the Brewery were destroyed by fire. In 1878 the Brewery after being rebuilt, moved to Elston Ave. Mr. Busch died in 1874, and the name of the firm was changed to Michael Brand Brewing Company, which name it carried until the fusion with other establishments, and the founding of the United States Brewing Co. In spite of the demands made upon him by the management of such a large business Mr. Brand found time to devote himself to public office, among positions being that of city treasurer and member of the School Board.</p>
