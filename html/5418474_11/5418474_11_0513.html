   <p>After a considerable standstill, the German immigration has become alert once again. The influx of Germans at the port of New York, during the month of March was quite heavy compared with recent years. These immigrants comprise excellent human material, destined for the Western part of the country. Heavy immigration has also been reported from Baltimore, adding that many of the newcomers - mostly bound for the West - are prospective farmers, provided with sufficient funds to purchase farms, preferably in Kansas.</p>
   <p>Men who will engage in agricultural work are especially welcome in this country. Not even the overly alarmed American industrial workingmen, raise protest against that type of immigration - they who live in constant fear of foreign labor competition. This is plausible because farmers do not increase competition of American labor, on the contrary, they become consumers of the products of American industry.......</p>

   <p>The large German immigration to this country is a sign that the Germans have revived their preference for the North and the West of the United States which can be regarded as a salvation for themselves as well as for us.</p>
