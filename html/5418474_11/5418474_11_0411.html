   <p>The dilatory political tactics pursued by the leaders of the House of Representatives in dealing with the immigration bill have given rise to a strong feeling of disgust on the part of the opponents of the measure. They have become convinced that the discussion of the bill was again postponed for the sole purpose of inconveniencing Congressman A. J. Sabath of Chicago and others who would like to leave Washington.</p>
   <p>Primary elections will take place in Illinois on next Tuesday. Sabath is a candidate for renomination and he would like to come home to cast his ballot. But he let it be known today that he would remain at his post and support the opponents of the bill in their fight against the measure. The friends of the bill are not to be allowed to succeed in their aim to get rid of him [Sabath] by the use of dilatory tactics.</p>

   <p>Sabath further declared that the propaganda to restrict immigration is aided and abetted by British interests. These circles believe that Britain will get away with the lion's share of the immigration quota if the determination of the number of admissible immigrants from every nation is based on the census of 1890. This would mean that the income of British shipping companies would be correspondingly increased.</p>
   <p>In the minority report submitted by Sabath and other opponents of the Johnson Bill, the chief complaint is that the measure is primarily directed against emigrants from Southern Europe. The report contains a table which shows that of the many censuses which might have served as the basis for determining the number of immigrants, there is not one which gives Germany greater advantages than that of 1890, the census chosen in the Johnson Bill.</p>
   <p>Sabath figured out that based on the census of 1890, the German quota would amount to 45,229; based on that of 1900 the quota would amount to 43,081; and on that of 1910, to 40,172; and on that of 1920, to only 28,705. The Congressman from Chicago bases his opposition against restricting immigration from southern Europe on the fact that during the last few years <span class="page-break">3</span>500,000 American Negroes have left the South to come North, and that European labor is needed to fill their places. In addition, he cites the protests from forty manufacturers' organizations against restriction of immigration.</p>
   <p>The whole question of immigration is still in a state of chaos, despite the fact that the House is about to accept the Johnson Bill or a similar measure. The present law remains in force until June 30, and no one can foresee what measure Congress will enact in its stead.</p>
   <p>Those in favor of restricting immigration have made so many changes in the original form of the [Johnson] Bill that the latter has now become a regular patchwork. The bill that will be accepted in the Senate will be so basically different from that passed by the House that Congressional committees of both Houses will be compelled to debate for hours until a bill is agreed upon which could be submitted to the President for his signature.</p>
