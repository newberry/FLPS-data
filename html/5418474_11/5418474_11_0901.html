   <p>Ten thousand of Chicago's German Americans gathered in and about the Auditorium theater last night in a war demonstration. From this meeting and its several overflow meetings messages of assurance and sympathy were sent to Kaiser Wilhelm and Emperor Franz Joseph.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were adopted calling on the public and the press of the United States to consider the situation conservatively, thoughtfully, cautiously. Men representing the German population of the state addressed the meeting and its overflow sections with speeches which varied from the white hot temper of Teutonic patriotism to the most careful conservatism.</p>
   <p>Five Thousand Parade Streets.</p>
   
   <p>At the close of the meeting members of the audience and the large gatherings in Grant Park, Congress Street and Michigan Avenue, paraded the streets more than 5,000 strong behind the German colors and the American flag chanting "Die Wacht Am Rhein." At the North Side Turner Hall the paraders held a second meeting, where a collection for the German cause was taken.</p>
   <p>Austria-Hungary was strongly represented in the meeting. The big crowd was orderly and obedient to the commands of the officers of the police and fire departments.</p>
   <p>Cable To Rulers.</p>
   <p>The cables dispatched from the meeting were voted by acclamation from the cheering audience. The first read:</p>
   <p>"To His Imperial Majesty, Kaiser Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary:</p>
   <p>"In the largest German mass meeting ever held in Chicago the Germans and Austrians of this world city assure your imperial majesty, whose venerable brow ever inspires all men to love and veneration, of undying love and affection."</p>
   <p>This message was approved and greeted with "bravos" as the chairman rose to read the following message:</p>
   <p>"To His Majesty Wilhelm II, German Kaiser, Berlin:</p>
   <p>"The German-American citizens of Chicago, assembled in as great a massmeeting as this world's city has ever seen, assure your majesty in the name of the 2,000,000 Germans in Illinois of our unchangeable love for home and fatherland."</p>
   <p>The meeting was held under the auspices of the German-American Alliance, with Ferdinand Walther, president, presiding. When the meeting opened at 8 o'clock all the 4,000 seats in the auditorium theater were filled and a sea of faces looked up from Michigan Boulevard and Congress Street.</p>
   <p>Patriotic Music Stirs Crowd.</p>
   <p>The fervor of the audience gathered fire from the music of Ballman's orchestra, playing marches sacred to the memory of many a field of German victory. The Rev. Alfred Meyer spoke for more than an hour, discussing the significance of the controversy and the treatment of the news in the American newspapers.</p>
   <p>"We have war because of English jealousy," he said, as nearly as his rapid fire German may be translated into English text. "The trade of Germany has increased two and a half times in five years. England has seen that only war might disturb the balance of trade."</p>
   <p>Kaiser's Peaceful Instincts.</p>
   <p>The minister spoke of the peaceful instincts of Kaiser Wilhelm and pointed to the forty years of German peace. He charged England had added fire to the ancient hatred of the French and laid at the foot of the English throne the blame for the world war.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Mr. Meyer's utterances drew wild applause from the audience. Women enthused with the love of fatherland stood up in their seats to wave kerchiefs, men with the sword scars of the duel and veterans of the Franco-Prussian War,came to their feet with hoarse "bravos" shouted with choking emotion. The orchestra struck up "Radetzki", the march made memorable by the conflict of Dueppel in Denmark in 1869. The Auditorium roared with cheers.</p>
   <p>Girten Analyzes Situation.</p>
   <p>Former Judge Michael F. Girten presented an analysis of the war situation in German phrase, which most accurately might be translated as an issue of "meat and murderers." He attacked the right of Servia to assume affront at the demands of Austria-Hungary on account of the anti-Austrian plots and the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne.</p>
   <p>Cites Belgian Incident.</p>
   <p>Judge Girten recounted the incident of the Belgian plot of Du Chose against the eye of Bismarck and cited the promptness with which Belgium suppressed the society and the periodicals held responsible. The judge praised the Kaiser as a man of peace, declaring in German idiom that he had "backed down" frequently in the last quarter of a century to avoid war. He charged England and France could have avoided war by refusing to let Russia go on with an extension of "that protection of a certain brand that has been extended to the Finns and Poles."</p>
   <p>(Note of Junior Clerk: Just beside this above mentioned article, pictures inserted five columns wide by twelve inches of two parades and of four speakers, two of them in speaking pose. Under pictures, following text.)</p>
   <p>Thousands of patriotic Germans marched through the streets of the district last night, singing their national songs and waving German and American flags. The night parades came as a finale to a demonstration and parade in Grant Park in the afternoon and a huge mass meeting at the Auditorium Theater, attended by 10,000 in the evening. Two hundred reservists of the German army, passing through Chicago from various cities in the west on their way to the front, assembled in Grant Park, sang, listened to speeches, and drilled in the park.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers who addressed the mass meeting at the Auditorium were former Judge M. F. Girten, the Rev. Alfred E. Mayer, William Rothmann, and Carl Swanzig.</p>
