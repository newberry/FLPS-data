   <p>After weeks of continuous and strenuous work by the German press to enlighten the American public about the true position and action of the present war, we seem to be in the same position, where we started. A mountain of hate, libel, lies has been built against Germany in this country in place of recognition she believed herself to be entitled t services which Germany has rendered America. Some correspondents of American newspapers were honest enough to admit that Germany did not wish for war. American fugitives and correspondents have left no doubt, that the news spread by Germany's enemies of the cruelties in Belgium were absolutely false. The result of all this work of spreading the truth and real facts has been very negative. The lies of the French and British campaign seem to be believed by the majority of the American public. The words of Bismark, "Each population has the Government, it deserves" have been changed into, "Each country has the newspapers it deserves." It is the soul of the population, and their big headings are their expressions. The English American newspapers bring big headings on their front pages about the death of the German crown prince, the distruction of his army and all news, which comes from Paris, London, St. Peters <span class="page-break">\2</span>burg, Belgium and Serbia, while the news from Berlin to its ambassador at Washington, of which nothing as yet has been contradicted seems to be lost in the columns of their news. The London and Paris reports have been found false daily by reporters at the front lent no such enlightenment appear in the American -English press. An honorable exception recently was made by Vanderbilt, the present chief of the finance dynasty to a newspaper reporter. "No country has such deep interest in the life and the existence of Germany as has the U. S. A. Germany has been our best customer and its destruction would be a great calamity to this country. It is the greatest scandal of the Twentieth Century, that great Britain has taken a hand in this War. The British population has no interests in this War, their Statesmen have crovoked. They have nothing in common with a chauvinistic France and a barbaric Russia. Our sympathy is with a country, which has proved itself by its high culture, intelligence and work, to be worthy to take first place among the European powers.</p>
