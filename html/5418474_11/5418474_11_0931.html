   <p>In to-day's session of the Alliance of American instrument makers, Mr. Charles Truax, a local manufacturer held a speech, in which he asserts that the surgical instruments which are made in England, France and Sweden are good while these of German-make are bad. It appears that the goal of the German instrument makers consists in the fact that they endeavor to produce their merchandise for the cheapest possible sum, in order to be the lowest bidder in this international competition.</p>
   <p>The fact though, that many of our Anglo-American doctors import their fine instruments from Germany, because they consider them superior to our and foreign products, Mr. Truax never mentioned. Probably this very fact induced him to launch such an attack. His lecture brought about a lively debate.</p>
