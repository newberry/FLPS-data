   <p>On October 6, it will be two hundred and fifty years since the first unified German immigration group set foot on American soil. They were not the first Germans to come to America, for individual Germans had come before. Two of the latter, Peter Minuit (Minnewitt) and Jacob Leisler, had already made a name for themselves. Peter Minuit came from Wesel, arrived in the year 1626 in New Amsterdam, now New York, became director of the colony of New Holland, and later founded New Sweden with Fort Christiana. Jacob Leisler came from Frankfort-am-Main, acquired a great reputation in New Amsterdam, was at times its executive official, called the first congress of American colonies, but finally fell victim to envy and enmity, and was executed in 1691.</p>
   <p>During Leisler's years in New Amsterdam, a young German attorney, Franz Daniel Pastorius, fell in with followers of pietism, (in his native city of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Frankfort-am-Main) who were promoting the settlement of emigrant Germans in William Penn's American colony. Pastorius was enthusiastic about the idea, traveled to numerous German towns in the interest of the plan, and brought it about that a group of German Mennonites, mainly from Krefeld-am-Rhein, together with their families, boarded the ship "Concord" for America. When, on October 6, they arrived in Philadelphia they met Pastorius, who had preceded them. He considered himself their leader and held himself responsible for their fate and for their further well-being. Although William Penn did not fully live up to the letter of the contracts signed, although the German group had to struggle hard for its existence in Germantown, which was named after them and still retains its name today, the hardy and diligent Germans finally managed, under Pastorius, to assert themselves, to earn respect and, in the course of time, to attain a modest prosperity.</p>
   <p>The landing of the Krefeld Mennonites on October 6, 1683 should therefore be regarded as the beginning of German immigration into the United States. What this immigration meant to the development of the whole country, from the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Great Lakes to the Rio Grande, is known to every American of German blood and to those of other blood who have studied the political and cultural history of the United States and have preserved an unbiased opinion, uninfluenced by propaganda.</p>
   <p>There has been, and still is, a tendency to minimize the part of the Germans in the growth and present greatness of our country. This is, in part, the fault of the Germans themselves, who were too modest to make much of their achievements and accomplishments in the interest of the country, or were too honest and steadfast to play politics, a profession which is often dishonest. Since it is so, in this country, that only he may claim success who permits himself to be carried upward on the waves of the political parties, and since the German is known to be a bad diplomat and a still worse politician, he has been pushed to the wall wherever feasible, no matter what his value to the state may have been. His achievements, often extraordinary, were either look upon as commonplace or remained unmentioned and even suppressed, while the German considered it beneath his dignity to announce them with blasts <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>from a trumpet.</p>
   <p>This failure by their own fellow citizens, and even leading men of the government, to recognize German services to the country will be given an especially bright illumination by the projected Pastorius celebration in Philadelphia. The executive board, in making preparations for a celebration to last several days, has, as is quite natural, invited the President of the United States, the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania, the United States senators of that state, and a large number of other prominent persons, and, naturally, the German Ambassador. The representative of the German Reich considers it his duty to come to the celebration. He is even expected to mention its significance in a brief address.</p>
   <p>In contrast to all this, it is deplorable that some of the highest officials of our own government, who were invited, apparently do not consider the celebration important enough to honor it with their presence. The President of the United States turned down the invitation with the statement that he <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>could not spare the time for it. But it is known that Franklin Delano Roosevelt has found ample time to seek respite from his undoubtedly great task of combating unemployment by taking weekend cruises lasting several days. Washington is only a few hours away from the place of the festival. This trip could be considerably shortened by a plane, and the celebration is to last from Friday to Saturday or Sunday. It is not just an ordinary celebration, not the centenary of a club, but a celebration with which the political and cultural significance of all Germans of this country is interwoven. To stay away from it means showing disrespect to these Germans who deserve respect, and who will regard such absence with astonishment and surprise, perhaps even with bitterness, because it comes from the White House.</p>
   <p>The President is not the only one who declined. The Governor of Pennsylvania, Gifford Pinchot, will not be present. His absence will, however, not be particularily painful to the Germans. Although his state is inhabited largely by people of German blood, he has never been a friend of the Germans. Another man who likewise declined is Senator James J. Davis of Pennsylvania. Whether <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>his colleague, David A. Reed, will come is not yet known. With his familiar attitude against everything that is German, his absence from the Pastorius celebration may be taken as a sign of his usual tactfulness.</p>
   <p>The Germans of the United States should take a lesson from the refusals received and stop, once and for all, obscuring their own light; they should rather hold it up, on every possible occasion, to the personalities who matter, so that, in the future, there will be no similar setback by the spokesmen and representatives of the American people.</p>
