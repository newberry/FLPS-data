   <p>A meeting was held yesterday at Ohio and La Salle Streets to form a battalion of the militia. Major Ernst von Danden presided. The organization intends to form a battalion of three or four German companies, one Swedish, and one Polish company.</p>
   <p>Von Danden told the assembly that he had written to Adjutant General Hillard in order to incorporate the battalion in the militia, and had been informed that the quota of eight thousand men was already filled, that no more arms were available, and that the only chance to become affiliated with the militia would be to replace some companies, if the latter disband--which happens occasionally. Hillard, unfortunately, had promised the first two available companies to the sixth battalion; therefore, it may be advisable to become affiliated with that battalion.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy discussion, the assembly decided that Mr. von Danden should write to the Adjutant General, stating that, under the circumstances, it is deemed preferable to form a battalion which is not already a part of the militia, and that a request for a permit from the governor be made.</p>
