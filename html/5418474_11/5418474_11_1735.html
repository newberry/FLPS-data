   <p>On Labor Day union members of all the trades marched through the city. About 30,00 people tock part in the parade. Governor Altgeld spoke at Kuhn's Park and was received with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>He said: "As Governor of this great State, I have come here to pay homage to labor which is the foundation of states, which builds cities and constructs railroads, develops agriculture, creates industries, and commerce and is the bedrock of our civilization. Labor guided by intelligent leaders has made our Nation great, and has developed Chicago into the marvel city of the world. Labor without prudent leadership is useless. At present we are in the throes of an industrial and commercial depression. As a result of abnormal conditions, we find super-abundance on one side, and hunger and privation on the other. Employers and laborers suffer alike. Countless diligent workers seek jobs, and almost as many business men live under constant apprehension, lest they lose their business through bankruptcy. This sorrowful plight is the result of wrong political <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>leadership, here and in Europe, of the depreciation of money, and of the devaluation of property connected therewith. Property value has diminished, but the debts have not; they are still at par."</p>
   <p>The speaker then admonished the audience to face this distress with fortitude, and heroically, in conformity with our American ideals.</p>
   <p>The State cannot give work, but the city and the Drainage Canal will absorb many of the unemployed. The only pressing issue is to save the laborers and their families from dire want. It is the duty of all the municipalities to see to it that no one starves. But this is only a temporary solution. The workingman must strive to improve his situation even after the panic, but it must not be done by resorting to violence.</p>
   <p>The speaker then dwelt on the subject of labor's support of the Government and declared that it has always been the mainstay of the nation.</p>

   <p>"The revolutionary attitudes, which have been ascribed to labor during the various phases of our American history, were not inspired by the labor party.</p>
   <p>"I give credit to organized labor for having consistently refrained from associating itself with anything which might jeopardize public peace. The improvement of labor's position cannot be realized through violence, it can only be accomplished through intelligent, patriotic co-operation."</p>
   <p>The Governor then advised that the factional forces should combine, and therewith ended his speech.</p>
   <p>His address at Ogden's Grove was held in a similar vein.</p>
