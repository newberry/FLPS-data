   <p>We quote from the latest reports on immigration issued by the New York German Society: During the month of October 47 ships arrived in New York with 7,714 steerage passengers. There were 36 ships which brought 2,598 Germans to America. Of these steerage passengers 2,351 had been in America before; of the Germans, 608 had been in America before. Thus the actual number of immigrants amounted to 5,363, and among these were 1,990 Germans, who arrived in New York.</p>
   <p>Most of the German steerage passengers sailed from Bremen, Hamburg, and Liverpool. During the month of October, 1874, 12,049 steerage passengers reached New York--4,335 more than came this year. Also, in 1874, there were 3,879 German immigrants--1,281 more than the present year's arrivals.</p>
   <p>From January 1, to October 31, 1875, 92,471 steerage passengers arrived in <span class="page-break">\2</span>New York; among them were 25,608 Germans. During the corresponding period in 1874, 137,635 steerage passengers were recorded, and of these 40,188 were Germans.</p>
   <p>Immigration during the first ten months of the year [1875] showed a decrease of 45,164; the immigration of Germans decreased by 14,580.</p>
   <p>The great decrease in immigration, particularly into New York harbor, is also shown by the following official figures.</p>
   <p>During the first eleven months of 1875 a decrease in immigration of nearly fifty per cent is recorded as compared with the previous year's immigration.</p>
   <p>The number of immigrants for the last five years is as follows:</p>

   <p>The German and Irish immigration shows a decline of fully fifty per cent. The Italian and Scandinavian immigration also shows an extraordinary diminution. Immigration from Russia did not diminish in the same ratio. This class of immigrants--mostly German Mennonites--is comparatively prosperous and they generally settle in the Western states, since the Russians seeking our shores are usually farmers.</p>
