   <p>Abendpost Closes the Collection To-night. [This is an item published several times in the Abendpost. Lieutenant Berge and his crew, after capturing the British Liner "Appam" on the high seas and evading the English fleet, brought the vessel to Norfolk, Va. As a reward for this daring and successful venture, a collection headed by the Abendpost was started by Chicago Germans. Transl.]</p>
   <p>As the hour of departure for Lieutenant Berge and his brave men cannot be foretold, it behooves us to close the collection this evening. Thus far the sum of 1,200 marks has been realized. The Abendpost will mail a check for the total amount to Lieutenant Berge tonight. Since our last statement of accounts went to press, the following sums have been received:</p>
   <p>Ladies' Club of former Soldiers of the German Army and Marines, $5; John <span class="page-break">2</span>Trebes, $1; German Veterans of Chicago $10. This makes the total amount $320.25.</p>
