   <p>Henry G. Weber, a Chicago born German, triumphant as a musician, a man of great accomplishments although only twenty-eight years old, will make his debut as orchestra leader of the Chicago Civic Opera Company and appear at the Auditorium during the coming season.</p>
   <p>When Herbert M. Johnson, business manager of the Opera company, was in Europe scouting for prominent musicians, he heard about the talented Mr. Weber, grandson of Henry Weber, founder of the Henry Weber Wagon Works, who settled in Chicago in 1836. Mr. <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Johnson notified President Samuel Insull, and thereupon the latter made the young man assistant conductor. In the course of time, Mr. Weber will lead the large orchestra of the opera company and thereby one of his innermost wishes comes to fruition.</p>
   <p>Although a native Chicagoan, Mr. Weber is not known as an orchestra leader in the United States, but in Germany and Austria he acquired fame, especially in Bremen and Vienna, where he lived and studied for several years.</p>
   <p>His father, George A. Weber, had retired from business, sold his wagon factory to the International Harvester Company, and lived at Prairie Avenue and Forty-seventh street, where Henry G. Weber was born. During his early years, his parents went to Vienna. There young Mr. Weber studied in the public schools, and later at the Gymnasium. [Gymnasium in German, represents a high school, which ranks between <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>our high schools and universities. Particular stress is laid on languages, notably Latin and Greek. The Gymnasium is a government school, but tuition is not free. Students passing the upper grades need only serve one year in the army instead of three. Translator]. As a youngster he showed exceptional musical qualifications; being an excellent pianist. He gave his first concert when barely nine years old.</p>
   <p>He was a gymnasium student when War was declared. This represented a difficult period for him and the family. "We were interned," said Mr. Weber, "and could not leave Austria." "Eventually, we experienced financial difficulties, and had to sell our possessions. Every week, a painting, rug, or vase, was brought to a pawnshop. Even my piano had to be sold. I gave music lessons, and it was then that I resolved to become an opera conductor."</p>

   <p>The family succeeded finally in 1919 in obtaining money from the Red Cross in Switzerland to pay for the return journey to America. Here, Henry visited the Chicago University, and also continued his musical studies. In 1921, he returned to Vienna, studying at the Music director's class of the Academy of music. It so happened that dissention ensued involving the principle of the institution and the orchestra leader, and the "Masquerade" [an opera,] was scheduled for the next day. Mr. Weber now had an opportunity. He gave such an exemplary performance that he was forthwith retained as conductor.</p>
   <p>Soon after, Mr. Schillings, manager of the largest opera company in Berlin, invited him to conduct the opera, "Freischuetz." Mr. Schillings made him an offer to become assistant director, but Mr. Weber declined, going to Bremen instead, where he functioned as orchestra conductor at the City opera house. During the last week of his activities there, he conducted six operas in five days.</p>

   <p>Mr. Weber, who lives at the Windermere hotel at present, said: "It was always my greatest desire to be a music director in the United States, and I am highly elated to appear with such a large assembly as the Chicago Civic Opera Company in my native city."</p>
