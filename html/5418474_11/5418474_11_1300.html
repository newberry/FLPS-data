   <p>Emil Miehlke, the president of the German Military Society of Chicago, died suddenly of heart failure. While traveling in Germany, as a delegate of the Chicago military society, he suffered a heart attack, but during the course of the journey his condition greatly improved, so that he was able to participate at all the receptions and arrangements in the old Fatherland. Returning to Chicago, he again became ill; nobody believed, however, that a serious complication would ensue. But, though only 47 years old, he succumbed suddenly today.</p>
   <p>The deceased was connected closely with the development of the German Military Society of Chicago. He had also been the unobstrusive benefactor of many local Germans.</p>
   
   <p>Miehlke was born Dec. 7, 1879 in Bramberg, Germany, and emigrated to the United States 30 years ago. Here, he devoted himself to masonry and prospered to such an extent that after a while, he became a contractor.</p>
   <p>He was a member of the German Military Society, without interruption for 27 years. For 18 years he was its president. He also represented his society at the Central Union headquarters of all the German military societies and participated at all the meetings...</p>
   <p>All those who ever applied to him for help received generous assistance. He enabled many to escape misery in the old Fatherland, and to establish themselves in new homes in the United States.</p>
   <p>To all those who knew him more intimately and who were indebted to him, his death will certainly cause sincere grief. He is survived by his wife, Anna Miehlke, and seven daughters.</p>
