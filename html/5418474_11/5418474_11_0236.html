   <p>The Cincinnati Yolksfreund reports: "About six o'clock last evening Schambeck's Company arrived here from Chicago, via the Cincinnati and Chicago Air-Line Railroad, leaving the train at the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad depot, Since the saddles and baggage of this stately cavalry contingent had been immediately transferred and sent on, the travellers were forced to lead their horses through the streets. Captain Schambeck had telegraphed to the local United States Quartermaster, requesting that official to make the necessary arrangements to care for the soldiers and their mounts. The Quartermaster ordered that the horses be taken to Benjamin Jennifer's Livery Stables, at the corner of 12th and Walnut Streets.</p>
   <p>There the horses were fed and bedded, but neither meals nor sleeping quarters were supplied for the men. Some goodhearted and patriotic citizens saw the men standing on street corners, heard their bitter complaints about the ill treatment of the Government, and took some of them to the Turnhalle, and others to nearby halls, where the tired troopers received meals and then were lodged in boarding houses. So local citizens had to care for United States soldiers, while it is the duty of the United States' Quartermaster to provide for them. This is just another example of the deplorable and harmful negligence and disorder which prevails in all branches of our war administration.</p>
   <p>Schambeck's Company consists of 102 members, all Chicago Germans who have seen service in the Old Country. They are strong, lanky men, and have all the necessary requisites to effective service in the cavalry of our army.</p>
