   <p>In various places throughout the country, diverse attacks against German-language instruction in our public schools are becoming increasingly frequent. An explanation for this objection may be found in the American people, who delight in displaying crass contrasts showing excessive economical tendencies probably due to hard times--as opposed to former profligate spending. Another small minority has its honest doubts whether instruction given in its present manner is actually beneficial. The most prolific cause for this attitude may be explained by the fact that many--not necessarily only the English-speaking Americans--conclude that German immigration has reached its apex; that German-Americanism is not anymore an increasing power; and that it is declining and, therefore, no further consideration is required. And, lest we deceive ourselves, in most places where German-language instruction was inaugurated in our public schools, the American element tolerated it because of the German <span class="page-break">2</span>vote rather than because of a genuine acknowledgment of the importance and justice of the cause.</p>
   <p>Indeed, since the great crash in 1873 German immigration diminished perceptibly. There was hardly enough of an influx to balance the mortality among older German-Americans. To this must be added that a large percentage of these immigrants consist of people with obstinate, "cosmopolitan" views, and little inclination to maintain a strong German-Americanism. The new arrivals even regard with ill-concealed hostility the inherent German-Americanism found here, irrespective of the mutual German interests which are at stake. Even in St. Louis two German socialists of the school board voted against the continuance of German-language instruction in the public schools. So, obviously, one need not be surprised if the English-speaking Americans consider themselves justified in showing definite antagonism toward the rightful demands of their German-speaking co-citizens.</p>
   <p>A strong, constantly increasing German immigration would be the most effective <span class="page-break">3</span>means to prevent this ever-growing depreciation of Germanistic endeavor. In this respect one must place hope in Bismarck. If he [Bismarck] continues in his Manteuffel style in the same manner as during recent years, then we may expect another mass emigration from Germany, similar to the one which so greatly augmented and strengthened German-Americanism in the middle of the century. This will become particularly apparent, if our American industrial and economic conditions show renewed activity.</p>
   <p>In the interim, Germanism in America must maintain its fought-for position and protect it as well as it can. The problem is not quite as simple as it was prior to 1870. Since that period our immigrants represent greatly divergent classes--much more so than formerly--and they cannot be assimilated into anything resembling a composite whole. Probably someone managing a fairly large German newspaper in America, can verify this by his own particular experience. After all, the contributions (always unsigned when gruff) sent by readers show the most divergent views. There are among the contingent of 1848 some irreconcilables, clenching their fists if, perchance, the editor overlooked <span class="page-break">4</span>the title of "His Majesty" or "Holiness" in some reprinted article; and, while these forty-eighters condemn much that is typically American, they nevertheless insist that it be extolled above the "old rotten Germany".</p>
   <p>The very antitheses are the German immigrants of the present decenium, who preserved undimmed the sentiments of a youthful, vigorous and fervent character as of yore, and still manifest the exuberant enthusiasm for the war of 1870, including the passionate esteem for the "Heroic Greybird" [Kaiser Wilhelm, I]. These veterans of 1870-71 swell up with terrible dignity when reading anything that savors of slight doubts about the unsurpassed beauty of the new, happy, splendid Prussian-German nation.</p>
   <p>Their opponents are represented by the most recent immigrants who think no more of Kaiser Wilhelm or Bismarck now than did the banned French republicans about Louis Napoleon a quarter of a century ago. These anti-Bismarck Germans consider themselves transients in America and cannot understand whatsoever, why some Germans regard America as their rightful home. To this number must be <span class="page-break">5</span>added the questionable citizens of two continents who are only interested in staying in America for five years--long enough to become citizens--so that, thereafter, upon their return to Germany, they may mock at military servitude. Included in this questionable group are the Catholics who cannot abide by the Prussian May-Laws; yet, any thought for preserving a strong German-Americanism is entirely alien to them; finally, there is that almost insignificant number of non-political fugitives, who became bankrupt during the German billion dollar swindle [war indemnity: France paid five billion francs to Germany in 1871], and migrated to America to regain their fortunes, but who show no vestige of interest in the cultural endeavors and the unification of the German-speaking citizenry.</p>
   <p>The German papers in America face the difficult problem of representing these diverse components of German-Americanism as a single unit of the Nation.....The German press thus teaches, entertains, and brings to the fore the interests of the classes it represents.....It is on par with the schoolteacher who has many pupils of various ages in his class and must teach all, at once.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>It will be conceded in the main, that the German-American press is justified in looking with pride upon its accomplishment--the dissemination of culture.</p>
