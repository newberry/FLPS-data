   <p>Ex-Governor Altgeld informed the leaders of the Democratic party, that he will be back in Chicago about October 1st, and will then be ready to take active interest in the coming election campaign.</p>
   <p>The candidate for State treasurer, Mr. Dunlap, conveyed this information to the party leaders, and added that Altgeld, has frankly indorsed the whole program of the Democratic party. Republican newspapers had spread the report that Altgeld is opposed to the Democratic platform, but there is no foundation for this assertion.</p>
   <p>Altgeld's offer to speak for the party will be unquestionably and gladly accepted.</p>
