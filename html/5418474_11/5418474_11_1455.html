   <p>The Germans of Chicago have suffered a very great loss. One of the best known, most capable and most active representatives of Germanism, Mr. Eugene Niederegger, died yesterday after a short illness. Modest in his manner, he had the confidence of all Germans, who sought him for advice. For many years he took a leading position in all German movements in this city. He was 63 years old, born in Ulm Wurttemburg, educated as a merchant, and served one year in a Wurttemberg Infantry Regiment. He came to Chicago at the age of thirty years, and established himself under the name, Niederegger and Thomas as a wholesale merchant of wines and liquors. A great friend of social life and German manners, he joined the Schwaben Club in 1883, and was for 25 years a member of the board, for the greater part, as its president. At the last general meeting he was made an honorary president. He was also an honorary member of the Senefelder Song Club and very often their president, which office he kept till his death. He belonged to the German Free Mason Lodge, "Myrthra", also the Germania Encampment No. 40, the new Chicago lodge of the O. O. F. No. 506, the Chicago Turner Club, the German Veteran Club of Chicago and was an extraordinary member of the German Press Club of Chicago. In the Chicago branch of the German American National Federation he held the position as treasurer for years, and he also belonged to the United <span class="page-break">\2</span>Societies for Local Self Government as an executive member of their board. Four years ago he had the great honor to be elected president of the Goethe Memorial Club and he dedicated the statue on last June 13th to the Lincoln Park Board.</p>
