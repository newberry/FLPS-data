   <p>The Germans and the Scandinavians choose as a rule the west and north west as their domicile, the Italians and Irishmen remain east of the Mississippi; the English and the Scotch are usually engaged in trade or craftsmanship and are therefore to be found in cities of big industry. The Russian immigration is increasing greatly; according to statistics of the last 50 years, the immigration from that country was altogether only 38,000 from 1820 up to the present time.</p>
