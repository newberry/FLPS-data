   <p>Last night in the Art Institute the opening of modern German works of art took place with a large crowd in attendance. The exhibition has been arranged by the New York lover of art, Mr. Hugo Reisinger, with the sanction and protection of the German Emperor. It is destined to give the American public an idea of the position and progress of the present German art.</p>
   <p>The show was a great success in an artistic and social way. About five thousand invitations had been sent out and only a few of the invited were absent. From the start to the finish a great crowd of visitors pushed through the five halls of the southern wing of the Art Institute. All nations and social classes were represented. The American and German element was equally divided. The German Ambassador, Count Bernstorff, had sent a telegram with his regrets for being unable to appear personally. Also, Governor Dineen and Mayor Busse excused themselves. Consul Dr. Paul Roh acted as host, and he was assisted by General Frederic Dent Grant of the Federal Army, Mr. W. M. R.</p>
