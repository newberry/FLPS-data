   <p>The Silver problem has disrupted to such an extent our monetary system and business life, that finally all organizations of German-Americans all over the country decided to select a commission of prominent German-American manufacturers, business men and bankers, to study from the bottom our deplorable business-situation and find a sensible solution towards normal conditions. This German commission has been in session during four months in Washington and came to the conclusion, that there is no remedy for our economical ills, as long as the value of merchandise is different in every State of the Union. The Chambers of Commerce of all States should get together to stipulate a standard value of any kind of merchandise for the whole country. After this has been accomplished, it will be easy, to regulate the standard value of silver in the United States and subsequently also abroad in all commercial relations on the worldmarket.</p>
   <p>We agree with the findings of the German commission but doubt that there is enough feeling of responsibility in every state towards the general interests of the Union and the American people, in order to create the harmonizing effects as described above.</p>
