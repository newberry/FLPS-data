   <p>After an interruption of two years, naturalization of Germans, Austrians, and Hungarians will be resumed in Chicago on next Friday. In Cook County there are no fewer than 3,700 applications on file. All were made before the United States declared war, i.e., before April 6, 1917. Since all three courts, the Federal, District, and Superior Courts, will consider these applications, they should be able to dispose of them within the next few months. The District Court will begin the work.</p>
   <p>According to law all applications were to have been submitted to the Department of Justice at Washington for thorough examination. Because the Department was overloaded with other work, it could not give these applications any attention until the armistice was signed. The work of examining was begun about November 15. The applications against which no objections are raised are forwarded to the local Bureau of Naturalization, where they are again subjected to a very severe examination. The Bureau then sends a list of candidates eligible for citizenship to the proper court, so that the court can summon them for the <span class="page-break">2</span>prescribed hearing.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. H. Wagner, the supervisor of the Bureau, calls attention to the fact that applications are disposed of in the order in which they arrived here from Washington, and not in the order in which they were sent to the Department of Justice. Mr. Wagner said that the applicants would be duly notified, and that it was useless to attempt to get further information from him, since he has none to give. He also stated that if one person had to wait longer than others, it was no indication that the application had been rejected, but only that the examination of the application had not been concluded. Candidates who are guilty of offense against any laws of our country will, of course, not be admitted to citizenship.</p>
