   <p>Consul Praises America.</p>
   <p>"America is the first country which has acknowledged the necessity of rebuilding its cities. It not only builds houses, it builds cities. Office and business sections are separated from factory sections, garden and representative sections become more and more pronounced. From this, Germany could and should learn. Germany of today needs,more than ever, city builders instead of architects."</p>
   <p>These striking words, spoken by the German Consul General of Chicago, Dr. Simon, at the Chinese dinner at the Realto Gardens yesterday, which the Celotex Company had arranged, were approved by all the German experts. Also the American architect, Irving K. Pond, was present.</p>
