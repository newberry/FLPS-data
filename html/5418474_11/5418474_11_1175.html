   <p>With the death of Augustus W. Nohe, known under the nickname of "Fire-Escape Gus," a man passed away who, at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, played quite a role in local and State politics. He was to the State Legislature the same as "Hot-Stove Brumer" and "Bathhouse" John Coughlin were to the City Council.</p>
   <p>Born in Germany, he came to America in his early years, spent some time in the East, and settled in Chicago in 1878. Here he took an active part in politics and was elected soon after his arrival alderman of the old 10th ward, which at that time was Billy Lorimer's bailiwick. Later he became a member of the State Legislature, in which he distinguished himself by submitting a number of bills against large corporations. One of the bills proposed to make compulsory the installation of fireescape <span class="page-break">2</span>ladders on large factory buildings, and this was what brought him the nickname of "Fire-Escape Gus."</p>
   <p>Nohe was severely criticized because he himself owned a fire-escape ladder business at that time, but he did not bother himself about it and admitted laughingly the truth of those arguments.</p>
   <p>Nohe became a rich man, but after losing large amounts through unfortunate speculations in the stock market, he lived in very modest circumstances of late. For the last twenty years, very little was heard of him publicly. In 1917, he was examined as a witness in the defunct La Salle Street Trust and Savings Bank, a financial institution founded by Lorimer, and of which he was a director.</p>
