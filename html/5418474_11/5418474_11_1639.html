   <p>Between Governor Altgeld and Criminal Lawyer A. G. Trude, threatens to break out, before long, an open enmity on account of the leadership of the Democratic mass of voters. Mr. Trude is seeking a union between the silver and gold democrats, in which case he intends to get the nomination as a "compromise-candidate for the office of mayor."</p>
   <p>Mr.Altgeld is opposed to a union, and least of all does not want to hear of such a compromise basis. There also might be a lively competition between the two Gentlemen for the Democratic nomination of U. S. Senator. Mr. Altgeld demands the nomination, as an additional endorsement of his administration, by the accredited representatives of his party. Mr. Trude wants it as a certification of his claim to the role of a leader.</p>
