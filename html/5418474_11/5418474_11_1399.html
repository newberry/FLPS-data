   <p>A great loss to the German Methodist congregations of Chicago and suburbs has been caused through the death of the district director, the Rev. August Julius Mulfinger, D. D., who died very suddenly on the morning of January 27th. The funeral services were held in the Wesley church January 29th. The large church overflowed with mourners. About fifty pastors participated in the ceremonies. Bishop Thomas Nicholson of Chicago, and district supervisor Pastor J. A. Jandre from Milwaukee, Dr. A. Clark and Dr. J. Hingley expressed words of comfort. Pastor W. Esslinger read the prayers. The earthly remains were interred in Rosehill cemetery. Dr. Muflinger was the son of a Methodist minister and was born in Quincy, Illinois in 1862. He graduated from the German Wallace college in Beren, Ohio, and the preacher's seminary in Evanston, Illinois. He entered the Chicago German conference in 1881 as minister and served the following congreations: Sandwich, Illinois; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Champaign, Illinois; Went-worth Avenue, Chicago; Center Street, Chicago; Second Congregation, Chicago, and was for eleven and one-half years superintendent of the Chicago district. He was a famous pulpit orator and an indefatigable worker to whose heart the welfare of each individual was dear. The resident bishop will be obliged to appoint a successor to Dr. Mulfinger.</p>
