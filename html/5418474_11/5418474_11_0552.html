   <p>The "Real Americans" have finally succeeded in finding an excuse for their aversion to manual labor. They claim they do not wish to compete with "Foreigners" in this respect. The greater the number of "Aliens" coming to the United States, the greater is their antipathy to compete with these semi-Barbarians. A local newspaper makes the following statement: "Our inexhaustible resources and our many inventions have made it possible for millions of Americans to earn their livelihood as employers, clerks, agents and businessmen, without getting their hands dirty as their forbears did.</p>
   <p>However, it is evident that not the natural resources and inventions, but the "Foreigners" have made this possible, because the Irish, the Germans and the Southern-European immigrants are doing the hard manual work---such a general trend for business, the exploitation of all natural resources and the working-class, cannot be found elsewhere. Under the directions of Americans, the millions of immigrants were used differently than is the case in Europe.</p>

   <p>More than a dozen of prosperous states have replaced the great grass-covered plains and the virgin forests in less than fifty years. The United States has become the granaries of the Old World. Industry has likewise developed to such an extent, that they could control the world markets if the absurb tariff would not prevent it. Credit for such results is due to the "Foreigners" who did the greatest part of the work.</p>
   <p>In view of these facts it seems resonable to expect, that the "Americans" would be exceedingly grateful for these advantages....The same newspaper also remarks that "the American men and women are becoming physically inferior, due to the lack of muscular work and that this accounts for their inability to raise large, strong and healthy families. Besides, large families are no more desirable. The average citizen is satisfied with one or two children and many do not want any."</p>
   <p>However, it is not true that their physical inferiority is caused, by lack of muscular exercises. The young men are strong enough to take part in the most strenuous sports and athletic exercises, and the young girls can dance all night through, without complaining about fatigue.</p>

   <p>The "Yankees" are not too weak to raise a large family, but they are too fond of ease... If a man desires children and expresses his wish he is considered inhuman. The women are the bosses and they take advantage of this. They disregard their duties, which nature imposed upon them, but not the cruel man.</p>
   <p>Even the "Yankees" take these conditions at times seriously. They are afraid for the future of this country and its institutions, if the half-civilized mobs from the east and south of Europe, to a ever greater degree displace the "Angelo-Saxon" element.</p>
   <p>This causes them to demand stricter immigration laws.</p>
