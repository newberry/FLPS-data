   <p>"Permit me to send you a report about the results of our appeal, to the German-Americans to collect funds for a 'silver laurel-wreath' for the Emperor William I, the victorious. We mailed about 700-800 copies of the appeal to editors of German papers in America.</p>
   <p>"Many of them were kind enough to send us a copy of their paper containing the appeal, but most of them returned the appeal with unfavorable remarks. I also received letters and cards threatening with bombing, hanging, and what not.</p>
   <p>"Several hundred copies of the appeal were sent direct to different societies, associations, clubs, etc., but most of these ladies and gentlemen answered either in the negative or not at all. They were requested to support this undertaking by arranging concerts, theater-performances, etc. for this purpose. Only one person declared himself willing to sacrifice his time and talent for this purpose with great pleasure, and this is an outstanding American, a director of music in Chicago, Professor Silas G. Pratt.</p>

   <p>"As stated in the appeal, the time limit for contributions expires June first, but up to this time since the appeals were mailed, the later part of March, only a total of $2.00 has been collected, being sent from Columbus, Ohio.</p>
