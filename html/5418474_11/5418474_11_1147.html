   <p>Not many Men's Singing Societies can, like the Senefelder Singing Circle, be proud of counting among their members a man who, as a singer, faithfully cultivated the German song for more than fifty seven years.</p>
   <p>I refer to Joseph Stein, the well-known cigar manufacturer, who attended to his trade for thirty years and is a living example of the fact that a good cigar belongs to a good singer.</p>
   <p>For forty years Mr. Stein lived at the same address, namely; 3035 N. Racine Ave.</p>
   <p>Joseph Stein was born Jan. 19, 1856, in Hildesheim, Hanover, Germany; he has just recently celebrated his 76th birthday. In Oct. 1883 he emigrated from his old homeland to America and lived temporarily in New York and Pittsburgh, coming to Chicago in 1884. Mr. Stein was a delegate to the United Men's Choruses for seventeen years, and at the present time is the vice-president of the Senefelder Singing-Circle; also Grand Master of the Lessing Lodge No. 557 A.F. and A.M.</p>
