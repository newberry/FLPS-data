   <p>After the nomination of Fred. Busse as Postmaster of Chicago, it was announced from Washington that William Boldenweck has been nominated as Assistant Treasurer. In German circles this has caused much pleasure. The nomination is the result of an understanding between the Illinois Senators Cullum and Hopkins. The office had already been offered to Robert M. Simon, the former Real Estate Registrar but had been refused. Mr. Boldenweck is Secretary and Treasurer of the Brookman Manufacturing Company and has been in the mason and Real Estate business. He is 55 years old and was born in Bettingen, Bavaria and came to Chicago with his parents at the age of 3 years. He learned the plumbing business but was employed later as a bookkeeper.</p>
   <p>He was Mayor of Lake View before it was annexed to Chicago. He also served as a drainage Commissioner and member of the Schoolboard. He is a member of the Germania Men's Choir, the Swaben Club and other social and business associations. He lives in the Lessing Apartment House.</p>
