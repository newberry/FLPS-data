   <p>Above the tower of the German castle floated yesterday the gorgeous colors of the empire. About its base and stretching far away in solid masses, the German citizens of the republic gathered to do honor to the day. From the speakers' stand German noblemen, commissioned by the Kaiser himself, spoke to the people in their native tongue, and stirred into life strong patriotic memories. From the same stand American citizens told of the noble part the sons of the Fatherland have played in the development of the United States.</p>
   <p>Two thousand singers, massed in bands of red and white and black, sang "Die Wacht am Rhein," and half a dozen bands played patriotic melodies. But above all sounded the deep, full voiced "Hoch!" "Hoch!" of the cheering crowds, and more eloquent then spoken words was the sturdy Tueton spirit which showed it self in the hearty enthusiasm which marked every incident of the day. Already for hours the German-Americans from Chicago, St. Paul, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and half a dozen smaller cities had been gathering about the German Building.</p>
   <p>The great German Chorus, of 2,000 voices slowly filed into their seats. As the various societies took their places at the rear of the singers' stand they planted their banners against the top railing, and at 2 o'clock it was ablaze with color. One of the first of the societies to arrive was the German veterans, their commander, Roderich von Mannstein, proudly wearing the Black Cross on his coat. A few minutes later, under the blue and gold banner of the Knights and Ladies of Honor, a hundred women, wearing sashes of the Stars and Stripes, marched in military order to their seats. The singers dressed in black, white, and red and seated so that they formed the flag of Germany. Below were the children, all in white, back of them women in gowns of red, and still farther to the rear the men forming the black stripe of the flag.</p>
   <p>Shortly after 3 o'clock Herr Wermuth, resplendent in a uniform of gold, crimson, and blue, walked out to the speakers' stand. With him were President Halle and Mayer Marrison. Director G. katzenberger climbed up into his seat and waved his magic baton. At the signal 2,000 singers arose in their seats. Again the baton was raised, the the children in waiting started to sing "Deutschland, Deutschland uber Ulles." As they sang the stronger voices of the women took up the strain, and then a splendid bass came from the seats of the men singers. As the proud chorus arose to the skies, the patriotic melody stirred the hearts of the Germans who looked and listened from the stand before the castle and from their seats came an answering echo. Then when they had finished from the massed thousands came the cry of "bravo".</p>
   <p>Chairman Halle of the Citizens Committee, in a brief speech declared the exercises opened, and was greeted with further cheers. Then from the north came the sound of martial music. Marching under stained and tattered banners, the Stars and Stripes among them, with a military band playing "Das Fatherland" at their head, came the men of the Deutscher Krieger Verein. Again a thrill of patriotic pride went through the crowds, and three cheers went up as they halted before the castle.</p>
   <p>Herr Harry Rubens was introduced to deliver a welcome on behalf of the German-Americans to their brothers from the Fatherland. As he began the sound of another band playing to the south broke in and drowned his voice. He stopped and the crowd parted to make way for the famous Von Bulow Band. They played for five minutes, while Chairman Halle vainly endeavored to stop them and give Herr Rubens a chance to finish his address. When they had finished there was a roar of laughter and then Herr Rubens continued. As he progressed cheer after cheer met his patriotic sallies. Then he called for attention and Herr Wermuth, the Imperial German Commissioner, in his military uniform, and Baron von Holleben stepped forward. In hearty Teutonic fashion Herr Rubens presented each of the distinguished Germans to their countrymen. Then he called for an old-time greeting to the Fatherland and its representatives.</p>
   <p>"Hoch!" cried Herr Rubens, and at the word 5,000 hats and as many waving handkerchiefs filled the air, while such a volley of sound went up as only sturdy Germans, stirred by patriotic impulses can make. After the Von Bulow musicians played again "Die Wacht am Rhein," the German Ambassador, Baron von Holleben, was introduced. He urged his countrymen to hold dear the memory of their Fatherland and their mother tongue. "Never," he said, "let these memories be forgotten," and from the people rose up the answering shout of "Never, never!"</p>
   <p>Carl Schurz was the next speaker. When he had finished there were cheers and cries of "Hoch" that sounded as far as the crowd was massed. The celebration continued in the evening at Festival Hall.</p>
