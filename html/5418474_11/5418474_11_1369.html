   <p>With Henry Ofenloch, who died yesterday in his home, 1719 Larrabee St. at the age of 80 years, one of the oldest settlers of the city passed away. He was born in 1855 in Buerstadt, Hessen-Darmstadt and came to Chicago at the age of nine years with his parents and nine brothers and sisters.</p>
   <p>When President Lincoln issued his call to arms, he ran away from home and hurried to the colors. As member of Battery M of the First Illinois Light Artillery Regiment, he took part in the whole war, and distinguished himself in the battles of Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Chicanooga, etc., through his bravery. After conclusion of peace, he returned to Chicago, where in 1870 he married Miss Elizabeth Moreriser, but scarcely had he established his home at 1719 Larrabee St., when it was demolished by the great fire.</p>
   <p>Ten children were born to the union, of which four, one son and three daughters, Mrs. Elizabeth Wasserzier, Mrs. Martha Schuh and Mrs. Catharine Schneider, together with the sorrowful widow, three sisters, 15 grandchildren and <span class="page-break">\2</span>four great grandchildren survive him. Among those children who preceded him in death was the former fire captain, George Ofenloch. The funeral will take place Thursday at 10 A.M. from St. Michael's church to St. Boniface cemetery.</p>
