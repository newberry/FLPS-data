   <p>Julius Goldzier is running again for Congress, and as he is the only man, that understands our troubles and knows how to represent our stand-point, politically, commercially and socially, we just have to run along with him and vote for him at the coming election.</p>
   <p>There is hardly a German in the 6th district who does not know personally Mr. Goldzier. He has shown at many occasions his skill to take care of business worries and labor interests. Therefore, we recommend the re-election of Mr. Julius Goldzier to all German Democrats of Chicago.</p>
