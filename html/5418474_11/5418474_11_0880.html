   <p>The American Press does not cease to attack the German ambassador for publishing the memorandum, submitted to the Department of State, and to announce his intentions as wanting to influence us German Americans to take up a position against our, the American, government. The untruthfulness of the American Press, its aim to distort facts, is clearly shown again. They forget that at the time when the German government acknowledged the right to export firearms, they accused us German Americans of treason, in spite of the fact that we took up a position against the measure, and one of our charming colleagues went even so far as to propose that the German Americans and Irishmen should be disfranchised. This proves that we did not need any encouragement on the part of the German Ambassador to express our indigantion over the un-neutral as well as inhuman arms trade. The renewed baiting, which rages in the columns of the Anglo-American Press not only against the German Ambassador, but also against the citizens of German descent, seems in some circles, as we can notice from exchange newspapers, to have caused an uneasiness which can only be called a weakness of the knee. We feel obliged to call out to them, that we, in the fight for right, in the fight for the moral esteem of our adopted, and the justified interest of the country of our birth can not be intimidated. We must stick together closer than ever before. Not only Germany's interests are at stake, but also our future in the country of our choice. And if hesitation, if a weakness should overcome us, let us remember our brothers in the old fatherland. We read in a newspaper from over there: Awonderful word has been coined by the war in the German Country, a word, that, like no other one, expresses the sublime spirit, and the firm will of our German brothers for the final victory, the words: "hold out to the last". These are wonderful words, which at this moment rule sixty six million Germans and reminds them to put forward the maximum of strength and endurance, not to waver a moment, and to carry it through even in the face of the greatest obstacles. "Hold out to the last", this should also be the pass word for us German Americans, which shows us the road on which we have to walk, firmly and with strong steps, not only in the interest of the slandered, and from all sides persecuted, land of our birth, not only in our interest and for the future of our children, but also in the interest of this Republic, to which belong our strength and our deepest feelings.</p>
