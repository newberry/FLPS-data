   <p>Henry Lutzenkirchen, a well known German, of the 22nd ward, who enjoyed the special favor of Robert T. Burke, is to be appointed Secretary of the Building Commission. Although the city council has not made any appropriation this year for the position, it is the mayor's wish, that same should be filled, and therefore will request the city fathers to fix the salary of a secretary subsequently.</p>
   <p>A. W. Cook is definitely selected for the position of City Engineer, and Henry Stuckart for the position of Street-Cleaning Superintendent.</p>
   <p>The appointment of both is expected in the next few days.</p>
