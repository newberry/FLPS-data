   <p>In Democratic circles, there have been so many candidates for the Mayor's office, mentioned, that it appears that none of those proposed so far, should be taken seriously. Of Carter Harrison, it is said for instance, he does not want to become a Mayor again, but he prefers to obtain the position of City Director of Public Works, to show his knowledge and fitness in that office. That Drainage Commissioner Alexander J. Jones, Judge Shepard, or Fred Eldred should really try, to obtain the candidacy seems unbelievable. It seems more probable that these gentlemen, to insure for themselves, a certain number of Delegates, to prevent the candidacy of Judge Payne. As actual candidate for the nomination, so it is claimed, Ex-Governor Altgeld would be proposed, and amid "Hurrahs" elevated on the shield.</p>
