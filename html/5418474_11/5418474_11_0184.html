   <p>Mr. A. Georg, the President, introduced Mr. W. Vocke as the festival speaker, who said among other things: .....</p>
   <p>In the hour of enthusiasm, caused by the outbreak of the Civil War, originated our 24th Regiment of Illinois. Colonel Hecker, who, as even envy must concede him, always has been a brave soldier, resigned after three months as a volunteer under Sigel in St. Louis, and on the initiative of a few prominent Germans like Schneider, Butz, Hesing, Rapp and Brentano he came to Chicago to organize a regiment consisting exclusively of Germans. By the middle of June there were already eight completely equipped companies under arms. These later were joined by two other German companies, the Lincoln Rifle and the Union Cadet Company, which already had seen military service in Cairo.</p>
   <p>The regiment was then complete, and , after a short period in the instruction camp in Alton, it was sent to Missouri. In many hot encounters, in the largest <span class="page-break">\2</span>and bloodiest battles that were fought during our more than three years of service in the western war theatre, as well as in the outstanding campaigns, our regiment always took its honest share as the history of the Civil War and as the blood-soaked plains of Perryville, Stone River, Duck Gap, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, Buzzard Roost, Resacca, Kenesaw Mountain, etc. will indicate (and as those in our midst who still mourn a dear kinsman can fully attest.)</p>
   <p>And the few, who are still assembled here, have come.</p>
