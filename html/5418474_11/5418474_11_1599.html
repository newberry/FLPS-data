   <p>A large volume of 1000 pages, containing all his speeches, actions, messages and interviews, about the important political and social questions of the day, including his dissertations on the coinage problem, the replies to Carlisle, Schurz and Cockran, his opinions on "Government by Injunction," his various addresses on the subjects of railroads, monopolies, the eight-hour-movement, pensions, problems of taxation, etc. In short, everything which Mr. Altgeld said in public or for publication.</p>
   <p>Most of his political and campaign speeches, etc. are known, since they were published by the daily papers; so probably only a few will be converted to Mr. Altgeld's ideas, but those who wish to peruse the matter once more will now have an opportunity to see the other side. Many of his claims and beliefs <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>are not so well known, so it should prove an interesting study. Price $2.50, at George S. Bowen &amp; Son, 79 Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
