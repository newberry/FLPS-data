   <p>The Thursday Club of the Germania Male Chorus has been quite successful in its efforts to obtain funds for the equipment of the Turner regiment. So far $1200.00 has been pledged by various signers. At yesterday's meeting of the Club it was decided to organize a press-bureau for the purpose of obtaining proof, so that American papers may note that public opinion in Germany and German-Austria is not more favorably inclined towards the Spaniards than the Americans.</p>
   <p>A meeting was called yesterday at Franklin Hall, at 18th and State Street under the leadership of Mr. William Reisenegger as a protest against an English alliance, which is at present advocated in certain circles. Ex-City Treasurer Kilbassa acted as chairman of the proceedings and Assistant-Police Attorney Ingenthron delivered a great speech wherein he gave reasons to justify the objection. It was then edited to appear as a resolution and will be submitted to the representatives of Illinois in the Senate.</p>
