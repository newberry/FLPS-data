   <p>At a meeting held by the German-American Citizens Association, the following protest resolution against the nationality clause of the immigration law has been accepted, a copy of which had been sent to each member of the Senate. Moreover, Mr. Deneen the United States Senator, had been requested to propose the withdrawal of this clause in the Senate.</p>
   <p>The text of the protest resolution is as follows: "The German-American Alliance of the United States considers the Nationality Origin clause, in its present form, exceedingly unjust, unwise, and detrimental".</p>
   <p>This clause is a direct misrepresentation of our historical past, a denial of our eventual future, and furthermore, it indicates a misjudgment of the nation's efforts in maintaining our national standard. It leads, undoubtedly, to</p>

   <p>dissatisfaction and discord among the majority of the people, whereby the quality of the citizenry diminishes rather than improves, which is obviously the goal of the defenders of the new measure. The German-American Citizens Alliance is fully in accord with the attitude taken by President Hoover; namely, that the present nationality clause by which immigration quotas are regulated is not a sufficient foundation for that act. It is the duty of the representative body, in the opinion of this Alliance, to revoke that newly created clause, or else, postpone the application of that measure, while, in the meantime, a satisfactory solution may be effected.</p>
   <p>The German-American Citizens Alliance deems it of utmost importance, in the interest of our country, that Congress should act promptly when it convenes in a special session, and thus avert further complications. Since it is within the Senate's jurisdiction to take the initiative, this Alliance places hope in that body to use its influence toward a satisfactory solution of the immigration clause.</p>
