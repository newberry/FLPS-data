   <p>With the mobilization of the armies in Southeastern Europe, a question has risen to face the American industrial world, which we would like to have answered by the Nativists. The war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia has not yet reached the dreaded dimensions, the armies of Germany, France, and Russia are yet waiting; still the owners of Pennsylvania's coal mines, smelters and other industrial enterprises are looking with great anxiety into the near future. In Pennsylvania there are more than one half million Austro-Hungarian citizens employed, the overwhelming majority of them subject to military service. If these workmen should be called to the colors, and if they should answer the call, the operation of most of those industries are endangered. In a telegram from Pittsburg, great fear is expressed, and it is pointed out, that no substitute can be found for those who are leaving because the annoyances, which as a rule had to be endured by the immigrants at the ports of landing, have actually restricted their numbers. And Pennsylvania will not be suffering alone. Not only Austrians, Hungarians, and Servians will return to their old homes, when the world conflagration starts.</p>

   <p>Germans and Russians, Roumanians and Bulgarians, Italians, Frenchmen, and Greeks, will feel compelled to lend their arms which have so far stood in the services of American industry to their respective fatherlands and with this migration, at least till the close of the war, the immigration of men capable of working will cease altogether. Only now will the nativists, who not only deny the value of immigration, but also consider it to be dangerous, awake to the fact that this country can not progress without the foreign laboring masses. Mines which will have ceased working, the stopped engines of the factories, the cold smokestacks, will teach the haters of foreigners, and especially those opposing immigration, that a hostile attitude against immigration is identical with the hostile attitude against the economic life of this country. With the loss of foreign working classes, the opponents of immigration undoubtedly will recognize the value of immigration, and with this acknowledgement, there will be a change of sentiment in favor of the at present, and no doubt also in the future, detested, but certainly very much needed "foreign hordes".</p>
