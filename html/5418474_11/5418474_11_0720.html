   <p>Dr. Oskar von Miller will arrive tomorrow morning,.... accompanied by his daughter, Mrs. Lulu von Bomhard.</p>
   <p>He visited the World-Congress of Engineers in Tokio, and then travelled to San Francisco. After leaving Chicago he intends to visit Detroit, Niagara Falls, and New York before he returns to Germany.</p>
   <p>Dr. von Miller is an authority on industrial museums, and his ideas on the subject were put to a practical test in Munich. This German museum inspired Julius Rosenwald to create a similar institution for Chicago. Originally known as the Rosenwald Industrial Museum, it is now referred to as a museum of science and industry. The Fine Arts Building in Jackson Park is being renovated at present, to prepare it for its future mission.</p>
   <p>Waldemar Kaempfert is the director of the museum now being built.</p>
