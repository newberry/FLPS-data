   <p>The contribution of the German-Americans is certainly of the utmost importance. They form the largest single element of the non-English groups. Perhaps half a million of Chicago's total population is of German ancestry. Chicago has always been classed with Cincinnati and Milwaukee for its German complexion. The first German to settle in Chicago as early as 1831 was the baker and grocer Mathias Meyer, the second was Morris Baumgarten. After the Black Hawk war Chicago grew rapidly, having a population of 4,170 in 1837 when it received its charter. Among these were several Germans, most of whom had come from Buffalo and Detroit and lived on the north side, then called New Buffalo or Dutch settlement. Several Germans also lived on the South side. On January 1st, 1839, a German Protestant church was organized with 16 members and 67 souls. There must have been just as many Catholics as Protestants of German origin at that date. The Chicago directory of 1893 contains 62 German names. Among these are the names of Nicolas <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Breudel, the first German justice of peace who came to Chicago in 1836 as the leader of a circus band and was the best known music master until 1851. John B. Busch who was the first German blacksmith who left a fortune at his death. We find several of these names on the list of members who established St. Paul's Evangelical church. Between 1839 and 1842 the population of Chicago increased very slowly, by only a few hundred. But at the end of the forties by thousands. It was in 1848 and 1849, after the German revolutionary movements that Germans came in large numbers, so that by 1853 there were over 22,000 German inhabitants in Chicago. At first the German element seemed very shy and lacking in leadership, but in 1843 the Germans held their first political meeting in Chicago, Karl Sauter presiding. The afterwards so famous German leader Gustav Koerner of Belleville, then a member of the Illinois legislature, was congratulated on his stand in regard to the Illinois and Michigan canal. In 1844 another German meeting was held in which sharp attacks were made on the know-nothing party. In 1846 the first German newspaper, known as the Chicago Volksfreund was issued, which was issued, changed into the Illinois Staats Zeitung under the leadership of George <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Schneider and which was for many years a newspaper of extraordinary power and value. The early Germans took little interest in politics but after 1848 a superior type of German immigrants came, men of superior education, men of the type of Carl Schurz and Gustav Koerner. The bigotry and fury of the know-nothing party organized to fight foreign influence, aroused their violent opposition. Then came the repeal of the Missouri-compromise and the Kansas-Nebraska Bill. Almost to a man the German element opposed this and became strongly anti-slavery. It was Germans like Koerner and Schurz who were from the first staunch supporters of Abraham Lincoln and who had a decisive influence in helping nominate him for the presidency when the Republican convention took place in the Wigwam at Chicago. When the Civil War broke out the German element sent its sons to fight for the North. It was especially the German Turners with their fine training who helped save the Union. The history of the German Turners is of great interest. Organized by Turn-father John in order to build up the strength of Prussia in her fight against Napoleon; the first men to bring this movement to America were two German students, Karl Follen and Karl Beck. They established the first men to bring this movement to America were two German students, Karl Follen and Karl Beck. They established the first system of gymnastic training in America. Follen subsequently became a famous professor and preacher at Harvard University where he taught the first German classes in America.</p>

   <p>Physically and intellectually these thousands of Turners formed a remarkable body of men, filled with courage and self esteem and exerting a great influence in Chicago. It was these men who fought so bravely in the Civil War that the wife of Jefferson Davis said to Karl Schurz long after the war was over, that without their help the North would not have won the war. They laid the foundation for athletics in which America is today too greatly interested and were the first people in modern days to develop physical culture in the spirit of the ancient Greeks. Along with these we must emphasize their love of freedom and individualism, which strengthened our Americanism.</p>
   <p>The Germans have surpassed all other racial groups in their cultivation of music and their part in the development of the musical life of Chicago is surpassed by no other element.</p>
   <p>In 1869 Chicago had reached a population of 273,000. There was a wonderful prosperity in which Germans shared. Many public offices were then held by German-Americans. Gustave Fischer was sheriff in 1868, General Salomon, clerk of the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>county court and many more. The German element has become more thoroughly Americanized than any other un-English group except the Scandinavians. Their Americanism has been that of Washington, Jefferson, Webster, and Lincoln. American ideals of liberty and democracy had a strong appeal for them. The German idealism has vastly benefited and inspired America and Chicago in the past. The German-American must not drop the torch he has held uplifted or allow the light to grow dim!</p>
