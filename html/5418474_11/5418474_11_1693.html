   <p>After a long lasting illness, Dr. Friedrich Koch died in the Presbyterian Hospital yesterday.</p>
   <p>All Germans of Chicago will deplore the death of this remarkable man, who, socially and professionally won the love and administration of the community. Dr. Koch was born in 1840 in Godensburg near Kassel, Germany; studied medicine in Marburg and went in 1867 as physician to Mexico. On account of bad health he returned to Germany in 1870 and finally in 1872 immigrated to the United States.</p>
   <p>He soon settled down in Chicago as physician and married Miss Anna Fischer, the daughrer of the farmer, Otto Fischer at Elmhurst. Dr. Koch has lived since on this farm with his family. He is survived by his wife and five children.</p>
