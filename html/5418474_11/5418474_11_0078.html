   <p>The thirty-ninth annual meeting of the American Home society was held at Farwell hall on Saturday.</p>
   <p>The Germans</p>
   <p>Mr. Goebelman spoke for the German population. He pointed out that there are five million Germans in this country who should have the gospel preached to them, as they will have much to do with the future destiny of the land. Their influence will become stronger every year. It is vain to whine about their Sabbath breaking proclivities, without doing something to meet them.</p>
   <p>They are intelligent, and should be directed in the proper direction. The majority are not infidels, but might be called indifferentists. The only way to reach them is to preach to them through their own language. The emergency should be met by the enlargement of the German branch of the home mission.</p>
