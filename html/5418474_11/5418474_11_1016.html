   <p>As soon as the news was circulated that Germany had taken possession of Marshall Islands (hoisting the German flag) the approximately 10,000 brown inhabitants of the Gilbert Isles are looking forward with great expectations to the advantages which will come from German Prussia, and will include their people too. (This is a report brought by the telegraph)....To us German-Americans the imperial isle hunting is quite amusing and highly interesting because it is the direct result of the bitter resentment with which the "great man who directs the destiny of the German Reich" honors us. That seventy year old head conceived the idea that German immigrants settling in this country are simply "lost to the German nation". Of course, he has no more conception of this thing than the blind person has of colors, but that does not matter. To the worshippers of this idol, his moody whims are still commands. Therefore they continue to "establish" and "hoist", for this pleases the "old man". He won't live forever, and when his time comes, the whole childish toy play which keeps him amused now, will be put on the shelf. The time will then be here once more, when German-Americans will be the only Germans outside the Reich, who will perpetuate the German mode of living and its customs, and who will remain true to its color in any situation which may arise</p>
