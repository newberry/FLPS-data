   <p>The Chicago Militia, which was on duty during the last big strike, did not get its pay yet. According to Governor Altgeld's statement, a special session would have to be called, in order to make the necessary amount for the pay available.</p>
   <p>An extra session would cost the State of Illinois $50,000,00. For this reason, Governor Altgeld is trying to interest one of Chicago's larger banks in advancing the Militia pay until next January, when the legislature is meeting again.</p>
