   <p>The Federal Immigration office has published a report, which gives the following statistical figures:-</p>
   <p>Since October 1820, a total of 17,113,997 persons immigrated to the United States. Out of this total, Germany sent 4,484,480 immigrants. Ireland sent 3,641,480 persons, Scandinavia, 1, 086,344.</p>
   <p>The remainder of the total were immigrants from various other parts of Europe and Asia. While this immigration took place, the American population rose from 9,633,000 to 62,622,250 souls (census of 1890).</p>
   <p>Considering the relatively rapid increase of German elements in this country, it is safe to say, that 25% of the American people are of German extraction.</p>
