   <p>Out of the yearly tabulation of the General Commissioner of Immigration, interesting figures can be quoted, which are referring to the latest immigration and emigration of Germans in the United States. The report, of course, embodies only the fiscal year of July 1st, 1920 to June 30th, 1921. During that time 7,321 immigrants and visitors from Germany came to the United States; 6,014 went back to Germany, there-fore, only 1,307 more Germans from Germany immigrated to this country than those who emigrated. Entirely different is the relation to the Austrians and Swiss. 5,045 Austrians immigrated to this country and only 1,511 emigrated. 7,631 Swiss immigrated and only 1,518 emigrated.
