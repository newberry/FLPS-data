   <p>Of the heroes who fell fighting for their adopted country, about 100 German-Americans soldiers sleep in the quiet cemetery of Waldheim. For this point a large number of our German citizens, with their families, started yesterday morning in carriages or via the Galena Division of the Chicago and North-western Railroad. The proceedings were somewhat informal in character, as no particular order of ceremonies had been pre-arranged; but the committee of arrangements, consisting of Mr. Henry J. Lenzen, Maj. John Kloy, and Capts. Theodore Schultz and Peters, assisted by a number of others, took charge of the decoration, and all due honor was paid to the graves of Teuton's brave and fallen sons.</p>
