   <p>"Battling Pete"came to Chicago, with his parents, from Germany, at the age of ten. After finishing school, he started his career by becoming a building contractor.

Having filled several smaller <span class="page-break">2</span>offices, he was appointed by Mayor Dunne, in 1906, as Building Commissioner.</p>
   <p>In 1912 he was defeated as president, however, he served as County Commissioner for the next two years. His political career included a lively dispute with the Civil Service Administration.</p>
   <p>About 15 years ago he retired. He is mourned by his widow, Mary Bartzen, four sons and three daughters.</p>
