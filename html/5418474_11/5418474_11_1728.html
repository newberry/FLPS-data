   <p>Our readers will be agreeably surprised to find in this paper a picture of our former Editor-in-chief, who died two years ago. In publishing it, we not only accede to the requests of many of his admirers, but we also perform an appropriate act of piety thereby.</p>
   <p>Hermann Raster was, undeniably, the most prominent of America's German newspaper men; a standard bearer and pioneer, and a no more fitting tribute can be paid to Mr. Raster than the one given to him by his longtime associate, our present Editor-in-chief Wilhelm Rapp, when he wrote about the 25th journalistic anniversary of Raster, on January 1, 1877: "The German-American Press, starting from a modest beginning never would have reached its present stage in a quarter of a century had it not been for the fortunate circimstance that men, such as Hermann Raster, dedicated his life and soul to it; and no one has done more for the spiritual uplift of the Germans and the resulting there- from German influence upon America."</p>
   <p>Hermann Raster was a rare factor in journalistic circles. He was versatile, and had a thorough knowledge of all the debated questions. His style above all was comprehensible, clear, logical, and popular; never doctrinal nor plagiarist; these were Raster's gifts, envied even by his adversaries. His influence grew throughout the years during which he was associated with the Staats-Zeitung and his collaboration was a great factor in the rise of the paper to its present state of eminence and in the great increase of its circulation. More than that. The Illinois Staats-Zeitung attained an extensive and profound influence upon Germanism and upon other German papers which sought inspiration and council from the editorials of these two journalistic Dioscuri: Raster-Rapp. The Staats-Zeitung became the pattern of our German-American journalists, and Raster was the guiding star for many an editor of a small weekly.</p>
   <p>What really made Raster so outstanding in politics and such a reliable leader in civic matters must be attributed to his love for this country. It was not that inane, apish love which readily glorifies the grotesque, cankerous growths of party politics. It was that genuine affection, which is prepared to censure, when improvement is necessary. He was so totally different from those whose ideals showed no vestige of American patriotism, and who not knowing what else to do, became newspaper writers. Of course, as a matter of prudence, they champion American ideals as much as necessary, but if one studies their writings a little closer, one discovers the German in them. In Raster, we find the opposite; he was a genuine American. It is regrettable that certain German-American newspaper men wish to serve the interests of this population, but yet suffer with nostalgia, and yearn for the moment when they can leave this country. Raster was not of that class. His sentiments, his very life, and thoughts belonged to the land of his choice. And so it should be with every German-American, above all, if he thinks he has a mission to perform as a journalist.</p>
   
   <p>In order to perpetuate the memory of Hermann Raster, we had his picture published and thereby we also comply with the often expressed wish of our readers. A biography which was published in Berlin last year, has now been reprinted here. The attractive booklet contains the picture of Raster, his biography, and many of his private letters, as well as his last, letter from Cudova, wherein the now sick man bids farewell to his readers: "It may be for years and it may be forever."</p>
   <p>It was forever! Everyone who knew Raster; everyone who sought instruction or diversion in his editorials....will want this booklet as an addition to his library, and we are enable to offer it to our readers for the reasonable sum of 50 cents.</p>
