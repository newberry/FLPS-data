   <p>Under the auspices of the "Germania Men's Choir" last night in their magnificent building at North Clark Street, a splendid banquet took place in honor of the newly elected congressman, Julius Goldzier.</p>
   <p>The great scientist is so greatly favored by all concerned, that even a great number of Republicans attended the banquet. The general attendance was enormous. Several good speeches were made and a great number of humorous witty and ingenious toasts were brought out in honor of the celebrant.</p>
