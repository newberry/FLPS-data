   <p>Since yesterday Dr. Gustav Boess, Mayor of Berlin, is a guest of our city. As Dr. Boess informed us that he intends to bring greetings from the homeland and Berlin to the many German-speaking clubs in Chicago, we resolved to welcome him on Friday, October 4, at 7:30 in the evening, at the Atlantic Hotel.</p>
   <p>At that time also the German Day Committee, consisting of delegates from Chicago's German clubs, will have its general session there.</p>
   <p>All German-speaking associations are therefore requested to appear in corpore, with their flags, for the evening reception.</p>
   <p>We ask the song divisions particularly to sing a welcoming song at this occasion</p>
   <p>Appear in large numbers and show our guest that we are staunch and faithfully united.</p>
   <p>Every German heartily welcome.</p>
   <p>J. W. Kobalter</p>
   <p>President of the German Day Committee.</p>
