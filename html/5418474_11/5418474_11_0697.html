   <p>On a trip through the United States, which brings him to Chicago, Detroit and the Niagara Falls, and is made in the interest of promoting travel between America and Bavaria, Councellor Dr. Goetz, of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while stopping in Chicago, registered at the Bismarck Hotel.</p>
   <p>The visitor was a guest of Rufus Dawes at the World's Fair grounds and spoke in the Administration Building about Munich and its beer industry, which is quite an opportune subject to talk about. The buildings, which are in the course of construction for the World's Fair, were the cause of many enthusiastic outbreaks of admiration on the part of Dr. Goetz, especially the Museum of Science and Industry, which through the financial help of the deceased Julius Rosenwald, was equipped after the pattern of the German Museum in Munich, Germany.</p>
   <p>Dr. Goetz expressed his surprise at the progressive spirit of Chicago, declaring that mostly, only reports of crimes committed in our city reach the German public.</p>
