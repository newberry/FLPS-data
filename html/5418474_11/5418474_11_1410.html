   <p>Chairman A. Wacker, chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission, married Miss Ella Todtmann, his private secretary, yesterday. The rite was performed in the home of the bride's mother, Mrs. Pauline Todtmann, 5216 Glenwood Avenue, in the presence of all the members of both families, by Reverend Rudolph A. John. In compliance with the wishes of the bride and groom, the celebration was very simple. After the ceremony, a wedding breakfast was served, whereupon the couple embarked upon a honeymoon.</p>
   <p>According to a statement by Mr. Wacker, Miss Todtmann served as his secretary for five years during which he had ample opportunity to learn to know her. She too takes great interest in the Chicago Plan and will, therefore, be an able assistant to him.</p>
