   <p>Fred Busse, widely known as "our Fred" ("unser Fritz") and as a promoter of German customs and a staunch champion of personal liberty, passed away after a protracted illness.</p>
   <p>Although a native of America and a son of our city, "our Fred" never denied his Germanic origin, but emphasized it at every possible opportunity.</p>
   <p>Fred Busse rose from the bottom to become an outstanding figure in the political life of our city and state. The people repeatedly turned to him with confidence, and it is generally agreed that he would have emerged as victor in next year's election for mayor. Fred Busse served two terms as State Senator. He was treasurer, postmaster and finally, in 1907 he was elected mayor of Chicago. As mayor, Fred Busse showed the warmest interest for the city, exhibiting sound common sense and a widespread activity and energy. He hated wholeheartedly the policy of procrastination which characterized the Harrison administration.</p>

   <p>When a real necessity arose, he participated without delay. It was mainly due to him, that the communication question in the constantly and rapidly developing city was solved. If Busse had remained in office longer, he would not have supported dilatory subway plans, but would have built the subway.</p>
   <p>Now "our Fred" has forever withdrawn from the political field and from the battle of life and is entitled to rest in peace.</p>
