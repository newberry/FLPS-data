   <p>In the same church at Hill and Orleans Streets, where he was ordained into the Roman Catholic priesthood twenty-five years ago and in the same parish school hall where a banquet was tendered him following the ordination, Rev. Alexius Grass, O. S. B., prior and director of St. Leander's College at Pueblo, Colorado, celebrated his silver jubilee yesterday.</p>
   <p>Father Grass is a child of St. Joseph's parish, where he was born in 1860, and it was in St. Joseph's German Roman Catholic Church that he was ordained and where the celebration of his silver jubilee was held yesterday. Hundreds of his old school mates and friends of his early youth were in the large congregation which filled the church, when solemn high mass was celebrated at 10:30 in the morning by Rev. Mr. Grass.</p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Margaret Grass, mother of Rev. Mr. Grass is still a member of St. Joseph's parish, which was once the largest in Chicago, and lives at 343 Rush Street. Rev. Mr. Grass will remain in Chicago for several weeks during the vacation of the college with which he is connected.</p>
