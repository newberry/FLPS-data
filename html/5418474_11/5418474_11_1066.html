   <p>A large and enthusiastic mass-meeting of the Germans of Chicago was held on last evening in the north side Turner hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Butz was nominated as chairman of the meeting by Mr. Dietsch and unanimously elected and on taking the chair said he was not prepared to make a long speech, for his heart was too full of the glorious results of the war. The speaker begged leave to present Dr. Von Holst, who would move in detail to bring before the assembly the results which had been accomplished.</p>
   <p>Address by Dr. Von Holst</p>
   <p>Dr. Von Holst, referring to the decorations around him, referred to the German flag as containing black, the color of death, red suggestive of the streams of blood which had flown, and white, the color with which the peace would be bound. Through blood and death the victory had been won, and the heart had a right to rejoice. The French who have let loose on Germany the hordes of the desert call us barbarians because we have with full vigor carried on this war. They claim that we have ruthlessly carried on this war, and that we would not lay down our weapons until we <span class="page-break">\2</span>possessed Alsace and Lorraine; but we were obliged to conquer these provinces in order to secure ourselves against the inroads of the nation calling itself the bearer of civilization. For two hundred years, France has been fighting herself internally, and now they find fault because we have done that which she has not been able to do for herself - given France back to herself, which all the previous rulers of France had failed to do, but each brought her nearer to destruction. They claim that we want to destroy France. Cultured nations can only destroy themselves.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dietsch then came forward and stated that the main cause of the meeting was to collect funds, and proposed to take up collections.</p>
