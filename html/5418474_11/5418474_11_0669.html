   <p>A group of Saarlanders, the first, consisting of one hundred persons--men, women, and some children--departed today for New York. Tomorrow at midnight they will begin their ocean trip on the fast steamer "Bremen," of the North German Lloyd, for the old homeland, where, as is well known, a referendum is taking place which will decide the future fate of the Saarland. More persons who have the right to vote will depart after Christmas.</p>
   <p>Besides many relatives and friends of the travelers, Consul General Dr. Jaeger and Vice-Consul Dr. Strack came to the LaSalle Street station to say goodby to those leaving for Germany. Herr Joseph P. Martin, president of the local organization of the Saarlanders, personally accompanied this first group.</p>
   <p>Two hundred passengers from Chicago and the middle west will start their Christmas trip for Germany on the "Bremen". This company of travelers is under the personal leadership of Herr Walter Rankenburg, of the local Hapag-Lloyd Office and, as last year, they go tonight, at 6 P.M., on the Erie railroad to New York.</p>
