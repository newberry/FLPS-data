   <p>At the ripe old age of 87 years and 6 months, one of our best known and generally esteemed German citizens, Mr. Friedrich Wilhelm Schmidt, died yesterday. He lived in the United States since December 1848, and since 1857 in Chicago. He was born in Wolfersschwenda, Schwarzburg, Souderhausen, August 13, 1826. He received a good education, and being gifted with musical talents, he, upon his own request, was thoroughly educated as a musician, so that after finishing his studies, he could always obtain a position in a good orchestra, as a violinist, clarinet or cornet player.</p>
   <p>For a short time he had to fulfill his military duties, but as a musician in the band. After that he came to America, went first to New Orleans, later to St. Louis and Cincinnati, and acquired for himself the name of an excellent clarinet, and cornet player, and also directed bands on several occasions.</p>
