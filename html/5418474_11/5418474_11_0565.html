   <p>The English-American press mentions more often and more definitely the necessity of restricting immigration. Formerly, remarks in regard to this subject, were more carefully guarded; but of late the editorial columns of of our news-papers give this matter more publicity, and the number of those demanding a considerable restriction of immigration is growing daily. We did not suspect eight years ago, at the time when the immigration of Mongolians were restricted, that the same thing would happen so soon to the immigrants from Europe. The attitude toward immigration would not be so infavorable as yet, had not the anarchistic agitators provoked this; but the bitterness against it was increasing rapidly, and it is inconsequential, whether it reached its climax a few. years sooner or not. To erect higher walls in the near future against mass-migration from Europe is inevitable. A "hard working American" made these statements to a New York Newspaper:</p>
   <p>"Encouraged by your brief remarks addressed to the working men of this country I wish to tell you the opinions of tens of thousands of American workers. The unrestricted immigration is eating the heart out of our workers, and destroys their manliness. The political questions of free-trade and protective tariffs does not include the worker. The American worker must be protected against <span class="page-break">2</span>the foreigners who work for low wages. Of what benefit are protective tariffs for us, if cheap labor can be brought here from Europe, and if these foreigners are permitted to work for lower wages in our industries, thereby throwing us out of work? This mass-immigration is more detrimental to the workers than free-trade. When the Slovak miners came into this country, the coal miners in the Lehigh Valley were doomed, because the Slovak can live on two cents per day, he is not human, but lives like an animal, and is not worth the powder it takes to kill him. The republic of the United States has no significance for him. This country is not a place of refuge for the poor and oppresed of all nations, nor is it an asylum or a Poor House for the whole world. The Europeans have no more right to come and settle in this country, than those from the continent have a right to settle in Hyde Park, London. Our laws, indeed permit immigration; but these laws violate our rights, and we American workers will compel the law makers to change the same. "The same law, which excludes the Chinese from this country, include the right to keep all other nationalities from coming here. According to our laws, no chinese can land in this country who is depending upon his own labors for his livelihood. We American workers want to have this law include the Czechs, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, and Russian, German, and Polish Jews. We want to see this law amended, so that no foreigher can land here without paying a tax of $100. It <span class="page-break">3</span>has become imperative to exclude from our country these foreign elements."</p>
   <p>This is only one of the many, who demand the restriction of immigration, and we will not be surprised to see this nation erect barriers which no European country, no matter how vastly overpopulated, dared to do. Everything matures very rapidly in the United States. The New York Sun indorses the idea of their writer to a certain extent, but many of the smaller newspapers are already highly enthusiastic about it.</p>
