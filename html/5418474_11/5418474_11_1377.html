   <p>The singers of Chicago will learn with great regret, that Wm. Arens, first vice-president of the North American Singers Union, and honorary president of the United Men's Choirs, died this morning at his home 567 Ridge Avenue from a heart attack. He deserves great credit for his work in the interest of Germanism. He was born in the year, 1867, in Grevenbruck, Westphalia, as the son of a lawyer, and came to America with his parents and brothers and sisters in 1884, where he shortly afterwards entered the postal service. He served Uncle Sam faith-fully and had the satisfaction of being appointed in recognition of his services, as superintendent of the newly established East Side Station in 1900, and soon afterwards he advanced as superintendent of the much larger Grand Crossing Post office station. He remained there many years. After he resigned he became the manager of the German Theater for a short period and finally was a manager of the Memorial cemetery, which position he held till his untimely death.</p>
