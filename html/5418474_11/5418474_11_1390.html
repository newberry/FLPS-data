   <p>Theodore A. Kochs, who was one of the best known Americans of German descent of our city, died yesterday in his home at the Parkway Hotel.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kochs was born in the Rhineland, Germany, and in 1867 came to Chicago to follow his profession as apothecary. He was manager of an apothecary's shop, and a few years later married the daughter of the proprietor. At the great Chicago fire in 1871 his place of business burned to the ground, but now Mr. Koch could think of the realization of his long cherished plans, namely to manufacture all articles which are used in a barber shop. Therefore he founded the Koch's Barber's Supplies and Equipment Manufacturing Company. The factory buildings were erected at the corner of Erie and Wells Streets.</p>
   <p>Rapidly, under his genial management, the concern grew and today the factory occupies the whole street frontage between Erie and Huron Streets.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kochs was the president of the firm until several years ago, when his son Robert succeeded him. The deceased was one of the organizers of the former Germania <span class="page-break">2</span>which is the present Chicago Lincoln Club. He also is a member of the Union Club. His wife and two children survive him.</p>
