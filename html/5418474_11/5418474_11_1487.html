   <p>From the old choral societies of Chicago a figure has disappeared, who for decades worked with joy for German song and German music, Mr. Emil Zott. For a number of years Mr. Zott has directed German choral societies in different sections of the city. Lately he had devoted himself to the teaching of music. Mr. Zott was 80 years old, but despite his age, he was vigorous and full of youthful energy. He leaves a daughter, the wife of the German high school teacher, Professor Hermann C. Ruff, and the funeral will take place from her home.</p>
