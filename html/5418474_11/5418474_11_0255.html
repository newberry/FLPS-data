   <p>[Half-tone, two column-quarter of a page, view of the house in Germantown in which the first protest against slavery was written by Pastorius in the year 1688]</p>
   <p>Two hundred and fifty years have passed since the day on which Franz Daniel Pastorius ("Schaefer" in German) and his faithful followers set foot upon American soil. On April 2, 1683, the thirty-two-year-old advocate set out from Frankfurt. On June 6, at Gravesend, at the mouth of the Thames, he embarked on the "America," which, after a seventy-five-day voyage, brought him and his company to the shores of their new home. On August 20 they reached the land of their hopes and of their heart's desire.</p>
   <p>William Penn, the son of an English admiral and the founder of Philadelphia, <span class="page-break">\2</span>"The City of Brotherly Love," and after whom the State of Pennsylvania was named, welcomed these German settlers whose beliefs were like his own, and allotted them a piece of virgin forest on the banks of the Schuykill River. Soon the wilderness receded before German toil and the German spirit of self-sacrifice, and, in the midst of the giant trees of the primeval forest German-town sprang up, the "City of the Germans," which is today a part of Philadelphia, five miles north of the center of the city.</p>
   <p>The trail broken by Pastorius was followed by a swarm of immigrants. As early as October 6, a group of Rhenish Germans landed who wished to help in the founding of this German settlement, and at the same time hoped to find success under his leadership.</p>
   <p>This hope of his countrymen Pastorius did not disappoint. Everything in his power he did for the prospering community. Hence it is only natural that, in 1691, his friends, out of gratitude, elected him the first German mayor of the first German city in the New World. His attitude when he entered upon this <span class="page-break">\3</span>office can be seen from the salutation with which he opened the Germantown book of records:</p>
   <p>"Greetings, posterity, posterity in the city of the Germans! Learn that your ancestors, your forefathers, left Germany, that pleasant land in which they were born and raised, in voluntary exile--alas! [they left] their hearths and homes--that, in the wild solitude of wooded Pennsylvania, they might be less troubled, and might live the rest of their lives the German way; that is, like brothers. Learn, also, how difficult it was, after the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, to establish the German race in this part of North America. And do you, beloved descendants, emulate our example where we have been a model of justice; but where we have wandered from the narrow path--a thing we recognize and regret--forgive us. May the dangers which others encountered make you prudent. Hail to thee, posterity! Hail, German kinsfolk! May good fortune ever attend you!"</p>
   <p>From the same feeling, pious and genuinely German, sprang his flaming protest <span class="page-break">\4</span>against slavery, which he first expressed in the Assembly at Burlington, and which led, in 1711, to the Pennsylvanian law forbidding the bringing in of slaves.</p>
   <p>Though many sections of the civilized world came to know of him because of his brave and undaunted championing of humanity, his life remained more or less unknown to his contemporaries. He devoted himself exclusively to the welfare of his community, of which he was father, teacher, and judge. He lived his whole life for the prosperity of his Germantown; the "City of the Germans" in America absorbed all his attention and his effort until the end of his life, until February 27, 1719, when this real pioneer of the German people closed his eyes for the last time.</p>
   <p>Later generations soon forgot this pioneer of German immigration, so that today the resting place for his mortal remains is unknown. Not until the last decade have the German people in America again become aware of the debt they owe the founder of Germantown. And so, on the two hundred-and-fiftieth <span class="page-break">\5</span>anniversary, German-Americans are celebrating the memory of the man who opened the door to America for German immigrants, who founded the first German community in the Western Hemisphere, who smoothed the way to a new home for thousands and thousands of German immigrants. In gratitude they venerate this pioneer of the German people in America and gladly pay him the tribute which he deserves as their leader. For Pastorius' greeting is fitting for the German-Americans of today, also: "Hail to thee, posterity! Hail, German kinsfolk! May good fortune ever attend you!" In reply posterity, in this jubilee year, will dip the standards before his monument in Philadelphia, and with pride and joy will remember this great ancestor as a true, genuine, and pious son of the German land.</p>
   <p>Memorial days are also days for thinking, days of reflection and of reckoning.</p>
   <p>Two hundred and fifty years have passed since the founding of Germantown; two hundred and fifty years of German-American history are drawing to a close. Hence we are justified in asking, "Is the German-American people, posterity, <span class="page-break">\6</span>following in the footsteps of Pastorius? Has it played the role it should have played in building up the new home, the American nation?</p>
   <p>To ask these questions is to answer them in the negative. Probably there have been, in this period, Americans of German stock who have filled important posts and who in critical times have given outstanding service to the American nation. With pride we shall always remember Steuben, Schurz, and others. But they from a very small percentage of the whole German-American people. There is no room here to go into particulars about the reasons for this.</p>
   <p>And how about the most recent period? Perhaps there has been a better showing? Even today the German-American people does not receive the recognition which it should and could attain.</p>
   <p>If one investigates he will find that one of the main reasons for this is lack of unity. That quality which German-Americans lack is the very virtue <span class="page-break">\7</span>which characterized Pastorius' lifework, brotherly love! What divides German-Americans is the political disunion in the old homeland which they have left. The German-American has transferred to his new fatherland the partisan struggles of his homeland.</p>
   <p>So it was in the fifty years in which the recent German immigrants were at swords' points with those who came over in 1848. It was the struggle between the "Grays" and the "Greens". The former called the newcomers prattlers and half crazy, while the latter looked upon the earlier immigrants as betrayers of the German cause. The ideas and events of those times and of the homeland completely occupied their minds, and out of the positions which they took on these particular problems developed their attitude toward America.</p>
   <p>And what is the situation today? Is not a similar drama being played before our eyes? Before, it was the "Grays" and "Greens"; today it is the Monarchists, Republicans, and National Socialists.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The Monarchist cannot [forget the past (Translator's note: A line of type has apparently dropped out)] and would like to sing "Heil Dir im Siegerkranz" (Hail to thee in the Garland of Victory) over and over again, while the Republican treasures the Black-Red-Gold above all else, and the National Socialist would like to pay all honor to the Swastika.</p>
   <p>It is understandable that every emigrant carries in his heart a picture of the homeland as he left it. He does not wish to let this picture fade, and that is his good right, and his own affair.</p>
   <p>However, has mutual strife any meaning in the new homeland? The German-American is first and foremost an American, and for this reason his political orientation must also be American. If the pledge to The Stars and Stripes is anything more than an empty formula, if German faith means anything in a foreign land, the German-American owes his adopted land unconditional loyalty. And only as a loyal and upright American is he in a position to serve his old homeland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Thus, so long as the German-American transfers to his adoptive fatherland the party hatreds that arose within Germany, he shows that politically he still has a German orientation, and that he is only outwardly an American. That is the cancer in the German-American community today. As long as the German immigrant fails to regard himself as an American, and as long as the fails to look upon his fellow countryman as an American, it will also be impossible to bring unity and strength to the German-American community.</p>
   <p>For this reason the watchword of the German-American must be: "Away with all politically partisan associations, which have no meaning for an American, which are of no value to the homeland, and which only weaken the position of the German-American in his adoptive fatherland!"</p>
   <p>If all German-Americans, as citizens of the same new homeland, would extend their hands to one another and co-operate in the service of the new homeland, then a basis might be provided on which the German-American community could engage in significant and influential activities. And so away with everything <span class="page-break">\10</span>that separates us so that we know only German!</p>
   <p>After the obstacle which separates us is brushed aside, however, we should lay special emphasis upon the things that must weld the German-American community together.</p>
   <p>In the first place, there is the love of the German homeland, of the German soil and German sod, on which our forefathers lived. Even though political Germany may have changed in the course of the years, and may change even more in the future, the German homeland will always be the same. The mountains of the Black Forest will not change; the Bavarian Alps will always glow in the sunlight of the afternoon; on the banks of the Rhine the golden vines will bloom, and the roar of the surf on the coast of the Baltic will always be the same.</p>
   <p>Then, too, there is the love of our native tongue, of the language of our fathers, our ancestors, which should always remind us of our origins, and, as <span class="page-break">\11</span>a symbol of unity, should always fill our hearts with pride. Wherever we encounter our mother tongue we will always find a piece of home.</p>
   <p>Finally, there is the love of the heritage of the German spirit, of the world of ideas created by German poets and thinkers. To be able to count heroes of the spirit, like Goethe and Schiller, among one's forebears should serve to create an unbreakable bond with posterity. In the treasuring and guarding of this precious German culture some common ground should be found on which every prejudice of caste and class would be silenced. The whole German-American community should be firmly united in the venerating of the ideals of our greatest Germans. In this treasuring of the German spirit as the standard-bearer of true German culture, the German-American is also taking upon himself the most beautiful and honorable task possible in the interest of the new homeland as well as of the German fatherland.</p>
   <p>In this way the German-American people would also become real descendants of a Pastorius; they would follow in his footsteps and would carry on the work <span class="page-break">\12</span>which their great pioneer began in Germantown. Perhaps then the day will come when a new Pastorius will appear among the German-American people, a real leader, who will give them unity, strength, and prestige. Perhaps he will be able to make Pastorius' greeting a reality: "Hail to thee, posterity! Hail, German kinsfolk! May good fortune ever attend you!"</p>
