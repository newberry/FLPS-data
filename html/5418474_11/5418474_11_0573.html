   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung, a few months ago, published a detailed report by Mr.Reichert regarding the new colony, New Baden in Robertson County, Texas. Herr Reichert claimed to have 40 years experience in real estate all over the United States and to have found the soil in this particular County to be the best. The result was that quite a few wrote to Mr.Reichert, but the inquiries were answered by a Mr.Raup from Baden, Germany, business man and farmer and supposedly a new colonist, explaining about work and wages and including a plan of the city, church and school,he wrote, had been taken care of.</p>
   <p>Attracted by this proposition several families arrived full of hope on February 21st at their destination.</p>
   <p>New Baden did not exist, except for a barn holding three old horses and what was probably Mr.Reichert's cattle. The farmer Mr.Raup, was found to hold the jobs of schoolmaster and preacher. The population through our poor souls was increased to 10.</p>
   <p>Similar proceedings if engaged in by a real estate company might possibly be <span class="page-break">\2</span>excused, but this unscrupulous exaggeration in order to entice people into a non-existing colony is in any case a fraud.</p>
