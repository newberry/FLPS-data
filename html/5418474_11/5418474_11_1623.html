   <p>Ex-Governor Altgeld stated positively, that it will be impossible for him to give a speech at the big campaign meeting, because of other important matters, which have come up in the interim, and that he can hardly at all take an active interest in the campaign in Cook County. However, he submitted to his party the urgent advice to invite Colonel W. J. Bryan, the acknowledged leader of the national Democratic Party. Bryan is capable, more than anyone else, to open a campaign.</p>

   <p>It is obvious that the Central Committee has stepped on his toes too severely.</p>
