   <p>The German Press Club of Chicago gave last night at the Northside Tuenerhall an entertainment for the benefit of Dr. A. Mels, who is known to all of us as a brilliant German author. Unfortunately, Dr. Mels, has been ailing during the last few years and otherwise has been kept down by bad luck. His needy circumstances was called to the attention of his numerous friends, who filled last night the North side Turnerhall to honor and help Dr. Mels.</p>
   <p>The well arranged program was opened by the song "Das Meer hat seine Perlen" (The sea has its pearls), sung by Miss Alice Garthe. Then Mr. Adolph Selz gave a fine recital of "Diebeiden Grenadiere" ( The Two Grenadiers). Mr. A. Balatta gave a piano recital of "Ungarische phantasie"(Hungarian Phantasy), and so followed one brilliant program number after another until late in the evening. A dance kept the younger folks together for a long time.</p>
   <p>The arrangements of the evening were in the hands of:Dr. Max Henius, Emil Hoechster, Theodore Janssen, Dr. F. W. Thue and A. Eckard.</p>
