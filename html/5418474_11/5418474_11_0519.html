   <p>Since there are many Swiss, Austrians, Russians and also Germans among the Canadian immigrants, we may conclude that there are about three million Germans in this country and that their progeny, the second and third generation increased this amount to 10 million. Although the 19th Century showed an exodus trend for Germany, there were many wars which killed millions, the German people increased from 15,500,000 to 55,000, 000 in the course of a century while the population of France only rose from 25,000,000 to 38,000,000 within the same period.</p>
