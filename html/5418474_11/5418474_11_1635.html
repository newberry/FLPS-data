   <p>In honor of Dr. Nicholas Senn a meeting was called at the Newberry Library yesterday under the presidency of Chairman Blatchford. Mr. Blatchford, Dr. Henrotin, Dr. Davids, and others expressed the thanks of the Directors of the Institution and of the representatives of the medical profession, for the magnificent gifts by the celebrated surgeon who enriched the medical Department of the Newberry Library by donating one of the most complete collections of books of the kind, that exist. Dr. Senn in his reply declined any special thanks saying, that in his own home he had no more room for his books, and at the Newberry Library they are always available to him. He feels happy that a chance was offered to him to him to put his books also at the service of his professional colleagues. Dr. Senn proposed that a Committee of three Doctors be nominated to assist the Library in the further development of the medical Department.</p>
   <p>The speaker also proposed that Washington Park should be renamed in honor of Mr. Newberry and that a monument in honor of the Newberry Library should be erected.</p>
