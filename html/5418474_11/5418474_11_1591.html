   <p>Fritz Ebersold, once Chief of Police in Chicago, died yesterday, the victim of a stomach malady. Fritz Ebersold was born May 30th, 1841 in Ixheim, Bavaria. Therefore being a foreigner it was entirely due to his own merit, that he climbed to the high position which he held. When only fifteen years of age, tragedy entered into his life, for on the 6th of February, 1856 he found himself an orphan, death depriving him of both parents on the same day. Left alone, he decided to come to America where an older borther lived, and left Germany in September of the same year. After joining his brother, an architect, both came to Chicago where he received a job with F. J. West, a furniture dealer. Two years later, after the death of West, Ebersold went to Mendota, finding employment with a coal and grain business, remaining there as manager for two years. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted in the 12th Regiment of Volunteers of Illinois receiving the rank of corporal, but became ill in Cairo and had to be returned to Chicago. Upon his recovery, he enlisted as a private in company I of the 55th Regiment of Illinois and was soon promoted to the rank of sergeant, then to second lieutenant, first lieutenant, and finally became captain. As such he served his regiment under the leadership of Sherman throughout the war, and was also present at the capitulation of Lee. He participated in thirty battles, including the bloody battle of Shiloh, at which, with the exception of the 9th Regiment of Illinois, the 55th Regiment registered the heaviest losses. Ebersold was dismissed from the army on August 25, 1865 in a rather poor state of health. He then went into the commission business, but not meeting with success, he enlisted in the police force on July 9, 1867. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant in May, 1872, which was equal to that of a lieutenant of the present day, with a further promotion to the rank of captain on August 1, 1879. He became police inspector in August, 1885 and, upon the resignation of Chief of Police Doyle two months later, he took over the function of that office. However, Mayor Harrison appointed him soon as successor to Chief of Police, which office he held for a considerable time, even after Mayor Roche took over the city's reign. Ebersold was in office during the Anarchistic uproar...</p>
