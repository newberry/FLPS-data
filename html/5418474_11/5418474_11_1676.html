   <p>Governor Altgeld who has been in Chicago since yesterday makes no secret out of it now that he is willing to accept again the candidacy of his party for the governorship. That he is the only man under whose leadership the Democrats of Illinois have any chance for a victory is generally admitted.</p>
   <p>The Governor knows that he has estranged many of his party friends by his position on the silver question, but he believes that these will not withhold their support when he takes care that the standard question is kept out of the state election. The state convention will take place about June 25th.</p>
