   <p>Again the earth covers a genuine German of the old stamp. A large number of relatives and friends assembled yesterday at Muchlhofer's undertaking establishment to take part in the funeral ceremonies of Hermann Hartwig, who is to be buried in the Acacia cemetery.</p>
   <p>Hartwig died Monday, at the age of seventy-four years, in his home, 1520 N. Wells Street. At the chapel, as well as at the grave, Pastor Berghoefer held an impressive funeral sermon in which, as a friend of the deceased for many years, he consoled the family. The Singing Society and the Chicago Singing Club sang some mournful dirges that gave the occasion a solemn character.</p>
   <p>Hermann Hartwig was born in Chemnitz, Saxony and emigrated to America with his family when quite young. He resided in Chicago for thirty years. Always faithful to Germanism, he belonged to a number of societies, among them the<span class="page-break">\2</span>Magdeburg Society, of which he was president for ten years; and the Mutual Aid Society. His passing is mourned by his wife, four sons, and one daughter.</p>
