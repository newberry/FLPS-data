   <p>At a meeting of the Benevolent Society of Jewish Young Men, attended by about 250 members, held at La Salle Hotel, the proposal to tax the Society's two thousand bachelor members five dollars annually, was made by Mr. Samuel Alschuler. He also said it would be well for the Society to take the Christian Youth Society as an example. Another point to be considered is the necessity of various occupations, principally that of agriculture, which is very seldom pursued by the young men of his race. The speaker contended that Jewish immigrants should try to engage in this type of livelihood.</p>
   <p>The president of the Society, Mr. Abel Davis, conducted the meeting. Other speakers of the evening were Hugo Pam, Isaak Rothschild, S. Mayer, Henry Horner, Herbert Friedmann, Abe Stumer, and Secretary Adolf C. Norden.</p>
