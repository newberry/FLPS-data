   <p>Governor Altgeld, who towards the end of the Campaign, exerts every nerve, to either win the once begun fight,or to succumb as a courageous fighter, spoke yesterday before five largely attended meetings. He started at the Turner-Hall in Harlem, and closed, after going from Hall to Hall and covering about 20 miles, - in the Social Turnhalle, corner Paulina and Belmont Streets.</p>
   <p>He emphasized at all these places, that he was more interested in Bryan's victory than in his own, and repeated his assertion, that in the camp of Mark Hanna can be found, the most dangerous enemies, of the American people's liberty,... all these who desire an increase in the standing army, who corrupt the legislation and administration of justice, who want to make the cost of money high and the cost of humanity cheap.</p>
