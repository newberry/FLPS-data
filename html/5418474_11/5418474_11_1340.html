   <p>Shortly after midnight today Mr. Heinrich Hochmeister died at a ripe old age. For the last five months, a bad bronchial ailment was consuming the strength of the old man, but the end was peaceful and without pain. The mourners are his wife, who for 49 years shared joy and sorrow with him; two sons, Heinrich and Georg; two daughters, Mrs. Elizabeth Heimann and Mrs. Toni Hochmeister, and two grandchildren, sons of Mrs. Heimann.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hochmeister was born at Hildesheim, and fought in the war 1870-71, in which he so distinguished himself by bravery that he was given the iron cross by the kaiser. Later, in the struggle for the preservation of German education in the schools, defending it as he did against the onslaught of the nativistic Mr. Cooley, who was superintendent of schools at the time, he was decorated with the Ritterkrenz (cross of Knight) of the Order of the Red Eagle.</p>

   <p>As a young man, Mr. Hochmeister was employed in a large clothing store in his native city. About forty-one years ago he emigrated to the United States with his family and came directly to Chicago where he worked as salesman for large clothing stores. After a few years he became independent and founded, in the then German quarter of the North Side, at the corner of Sedgwick and Sigel Streets, his wine business. He conducted this business until twelve years ago. From then on he occupied various political offices.</p>
   <p>In former years, Mr. Hochmeister always took an outstanding part in all German activities of his new home city, Chicago. He was a member of the Lessing Lodge, No. 557, A. F. &amp; A. M., of the Schlaraffia Chicagoana, and of the Society of German War Veterans. The circle of his acquaintances and friends was large, and the news of his death will bring sincere regret to German circles.</p>
   <p>Following the funeral services in the home of the family, 4512 North Robey Street, at 1:30 P. M. on Saturday, cremation will take place at Graceland Cemetery under the auspices of the Lessing Lodge.</p>
