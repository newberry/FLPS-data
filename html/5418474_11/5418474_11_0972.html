   <p>The German Vice Consul Franz Bopp, who has been in office in Chicago since 1893, will go back to Germany, April 18th and will serve in the army as a reserve officer for six weeks. He probably will be attached to the foreign office in Berlin, though it may be possible, that the German Government will send him back to Chicago. Nothing definite can be obtained yet, about his probable successor.</p>
