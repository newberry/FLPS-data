   <p>George A. Trude, under Altgeld's personal protection,-</p>
   <p>The left wing of the People's Party, not willing to enter into a close alliance with the Silver-Democrats.</p>
   <p>Appointment of the Campaign-Committee of the Sound Money Democrats. Republican Campaign speakers, and the Cock of the Walk.-</p>
   <p>The report which was published yesterday in this column, that the Illinois Silver Democrats, will have to sacrifice the leading candidate for States Attorney, George A. Trude, in order to win the People's Party as an ally, seems to have been only a feeler. It is said, that it would not be proper to hit the great Alfred G. Trude on the head. He would be offended because his friend, Jakey Keon was dropped; it might be going too far to touch his brother now,- Governor Altgeld, who returned yesterday to Springfield, had a conversation before his departure with the younger Trude, whom he promised, that he would not let them do him any harm. The left wing of the People's Party is not satisfied with the arrangement announced of going together with <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the Silver Democrats, but will propose, that the two Party organizations, should each act separately.</p>
   <p>Only to the endorsement of Altgeld, has the "Left" no objections. They are not much in favor of Trude, because it is a well known fact, that he is, at present in the Gas-Trust's pay, and also has connections with other large Corporations, therefore, he is not a fit candidate for the important position of States Attorney.</p>
