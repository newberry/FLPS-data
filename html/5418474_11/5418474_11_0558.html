   <p>Our county agent, A. S. Reynolds, who is in charge of public welfare, has rendered the accounts of his official activity. The author in this statement praises himself profusely. As customary when drawing up such a report the official suggests changes and improvements which he considers necessary. He recommends measures to be taken which are as dumb as they are brutal. Up to now, people who were absolutely penniless or sick and who had relatives or friends in the country, were enabled to rejoin them at the expense of the county. Thus the county got rid of them and in most of the cases the people were helped.</p>
   <p>Reynolds proposes now to discontinue the free transportation allowance - because - those requesting it are mostly foreigners.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>He says that the total sum spent for free transportation during the last year amounted to $1,623.25. He considers this amount as having been taken away from our poor ones. This statesman and stepfather of the poor seems to be a poor arithmetician. Suppose those people, mostly "foreigners" who left Chicago at the expense of the county, had stayed here, how much more it would have cost to take care of their upkeep and burial! But all that this man wanted was to advertise the fact that it was mostly foreigners who took advantage of the free transportation aid.</p>
   <p>The county agent seems to have forgotten that the vast majority of all grown-up people living in Chicago are "foreigners." We will not argue with this stupid politician. Reynolds extols his own administration to the limit. The reason for this self-praise is his care in spending the money allotted for relief.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Even the small amount allotted for relief has not been used up by the county agent. But the money allocated to Reynolds and his political allies has been disposed of with the exception of a few dollars.</p>
   <p>In order to supply the poor of Cook County with coal for $12,966.51 and food and medicine for $7,479.18, $10,334 was paid in wages for officers for this tremendous work. Such results enable the hypocritical Reynolds to praise himself. All in all, $13,578.40 was spent to distribute about 2,000 tons of coal and $7.479.18 worth of food!</p>
   <p>And with such results a man has the audacity to brag! We state and are able to prove that the county agent and his allies unjustifiably squander too much money at the expense of the poor and that the administration is so organized that the poor have to suffer and starve while an unnecessarily large staff of officers and clerks is leading an idle existence wasting public money.</p>
