   <p>After a long and serious illness Prof. George Jenssen, the founder and manager of the Northwest Business College, died at his residence, 1067 Milwaukee Avenue, at the age of 62 years. His death is felt very deeply by numerous pupils, who respected in him a teacher of profound knowledge with rich experience and an amicable, fatherly friend. Prof. Jenssen sacrificed himself to an indefatigable sense of duty and restless activity in the service and management of the institution. He worked for the benefit and success of the college with all his strength until exhausted, he broke down with nervous prostration and was forced to take a rest from which he never recovered.</p>
   <p>Prof. Jenssen descended from an old Hamburg patriotic family and came to the United States about 30 years ago. He worked at his profession in New York, San Francisco, and other cities and founded in 1892 the Northwest Business College in Chicago, which developed to its present prominence through his management. The work of the institution has not suffered any interruption by the illness and death of Prof. Jenssen and has carried on as usual.</p>
