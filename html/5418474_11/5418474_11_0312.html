   <p>Last Sunday, the United Male Choirs of Arlington Heights, Palatine, Jefferson, and Niles Center, celebrated a big choral festival at River Grove in Desplaines.</p>
   <p>At 3 o'clock, Mr. George C. Klahm, President, began his address. The speaker gave an effective description of the beginning of German colonization, in the North of Illinois, and the wearisome fights with Indians. He mentioned the increase of the German element, how it obtained its recognition by perseverance and diligence, and how it fought victoriously the battle with know nothings, until the prominent participation by Germans in the Civil War, on the side of the Union, assured them, for ever, an important place in the nation. The once despised and weakened "Dutchman" whose churches and schools were burned, who was shot down in open streets like games, has now risen to be such an important political factor, that no party can expect success without paying consideration to the German element.</p>
