   <p>The constitution seems to become more or less a foot ball for our legislators, who recently passed a regulation, which allows only 3 assessors or tax collectors for every township of not less than 40,000 and not more than 100,000 inhabitants. Judge Brentano pointed to the fact lately, that the said regulation is against the constitution, which as a fact has no law whatever concerning the administration of revisional regulations of a township.</p>
   <p>In consequence, Judge Brentano threatened to bring the legislature's reform-mad action to the attention of the Superior Judge.</p>
