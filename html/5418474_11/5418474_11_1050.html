   <p>As is well known, German, Austrian, and Dutch capitalists have actively participated in placing American railroad shares in the European money market. The leading bankers of the three countries have named a committee of experts to travel on the roads and to convince themselves of their condition at firsthand. This committee arrived here last night and stays at the Tremont House. It consists of Mr. August Folsch, Vienna; Counselor Hass, Berlin; Mr. N. J. Dentex, Amsterdam; and the special correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung, Otto von Breitschwerdt.</p>
   <p>During their short stay in Chicago - they will return in about two months - the gentlemen could not marvel enough at the colossal commercial life which they found here.</p>
