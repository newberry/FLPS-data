   <p>p. 3 - 3 The "Germania Maennerchor", which is sometimes called the "Germania Club", yesterday sent a cablegram to Baron Nordenflycht, who was formerly German Consul here and is now connected with the Foreign Affairs Office at Berlin, instructing him to place a wreath of flowers on the casket of Gen. Von Moltke. It will be a large wreath of laurel with red, white, and blue ribbons and will be marked, "From Germania Maennerchor, Chicago". The cablegram was signed by Harry Rubens, as President.</p>
