   <p>It might interest our readers to know that recently a Colonization Aid Society has been founded. According to a statement, sent to us from this society, the purpose of the latter is to give any Germans, who become members of the society and are willing to farm, an opportunity to buy a homestead with really good soil, on an instalment plan.</p>
   <p>The members of this Aid Society are paying monthly dues, but otherwise the Society is working out a finance plan in conjunction with a bank, whereby large tracts of land can be bought and the subdivided areas be sold to the interested members of the Society.</p>
   <p>At this very moment, a land commission of this society is travelling now in North Alabama to look over some farmland near Cullinan City, Alabama.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee of the Society consists of the following gentlemen:</p>

   <p>G. M. Lott, 70 North Sangamon Street</p>

   <p>who made the announcement, that meetings of the members are on the first and third Mondays of every month, at 8 P:M, 7 South Clark Street.</p>
