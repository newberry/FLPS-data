   <p>In the evening a celebration was held in his honor, in the new school building; this indoor festivity had been arranged by the Women's Society of the St. Matthew's congregation, and turned in the course of the evening into a regular family celebration.</p>
   <p>In stirring words the school director thanked for all the honors bestowed upon him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nimmer came with his parents to Chicago from Germany at an early age; but soon after their arrival in Chicago the family moved to Watertown, Wisconsin, where the boy attended the school of the Wisconsin Synode. He graduated in 1877, and became a teacher at the school of the congregation of the town of Hermann, Wisc., at which post he remained only for two years. From 1879 to 1884 he taught school at the Trinity congregation of Conklin, Michigan, and from 1884 to 1891 at Half-Way, Mich.</p>

   <p>For one year, from 1891 to 1892, he served in East St. Louis and then accepted a call to the School of Niles Center, Illinois. Since 1898, that is for 29 years, he has been attached to the St. Matthew's School and has been its director since 1910.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nimmer was also active in the literary field; especially numerous Christmas and Reformation, liturgical articles have come from his pen and have found a wide circulation.</p>
