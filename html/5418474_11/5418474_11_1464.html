   <p>Fred A. Busse, former Mayor and Postmaster of Chicago, one of the greatest Republican politicians of the city and of the state, and a very active business man, died yesterday, in his home, 4852 Sheridan Road, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon. Although Mr. Busse has been ailing for some time, his relations and friends did not suspect that his death was so near and would come so suddenly. The original malady of the deceased was a rheumatic fever. This was joined by an inflammation of the stomach. The invalid spent on account of these complications, several months in the Mercy Hospital, which he left, upon his own request, in order to return to his home. His physician, Dr. L. C. Mix, declared at that time that his patient was not in danger of his life, and that his recovery could be expected soon. But the suffering, which lasted so long, sapped his vitality, and he was unable to withstand a relapse. This occurred day before yesterday, and his death followed, yesterday forenoon. The news of Mr. Busse's demise spread like wildfire in the business section of the city, and friends and acquaintances of the former mayor were deeply shocked. Mayor Harrison issued a proclamation to the city council to appear today at a special meeting to make the necessary preparations for the mourning ceremony. In all probability the city council with the mayor at its head, will participate at <span class="page-break">2</span>the funeral. Corporation counsel Brundage who served under Busse, expressed himself about the demise of former Mayor Busse as follows: "I can only utter my deep felt regret, over this sudden death.
