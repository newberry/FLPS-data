   <p>The society for Germans abroad, whose object is to cultivate closer connections between all peoples of German origin, and through the showing of homeland films and other methods intends to erect an American branch and center. The society already has more than three million members wherever the German tongue is spoken. Not only individuals, but also societies can join. Societies out of German territory can exchange with the societies for Germanism abroad, and join it like the German-Chilean Bund, the German-Argentinian Bund, The German-Empire Association of Manchuria and several others.</p>
   <p>The establishment of a special American branch within the United States, will no doubt assist in promoting the German-American connections, because the society for Germans in foreign lands does not pursue any politics, but solely serves the promotion of a cultural unity.</p>
