   <p>A private correspondence of a young German-American, Willy Friedlander from the 12th regular infantry regiment, was turned over to the disposal of the "Abendpost". We gather from this letter the following: When troops were transported from Santiago to Montank Point, the cooks and stewards made exorbitant profits. The rations, which were furnished to the soldiers, were mostly unfit to eat, because of their bodily condition. The men were therefore compelled to buy food from the kitchen of the ship. They were charged for a sandwich .50$ and for pie $1.00. and for other things prices in the same comparative ratio.</p>
   <p>At the end of the voyage the wages of the soldiers were practically all in the pockets of the cooks and stewards.</p>
