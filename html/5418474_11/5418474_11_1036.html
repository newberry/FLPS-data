   <p>The German Army Band gave its first concert last night at the North Side Turn Hall. The band which came to America last October has since toured the Eastern States with great success. The public's unanimous opinion was, that Chicago was never before visited by as excellent a band as this one.</p>
   <p>The concert commenced with the Coronation-march from the Prophet. It continued with the overture to Oberon, Girofle-Girofla and many solo pieces. The "Shepherd's Sunday Song" and "The Chapel" are two compositions of great simplicity depending entirely for its success on the artists rendition of it.</p>
