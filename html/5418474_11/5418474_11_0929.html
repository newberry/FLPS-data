   <p>The reception celebration which was arranged yesterday in honor of the German Professors must have left a never-to-be-forgotten impression on many of the guests who filled the Auditorium to the last seat. This was the fraternization festival which could not have been conceived in a more beautiful fashion, and presumably it will produce good results. The giant hall with the festively dressed people, the spacious stage, on which in the foreground sat the faculty of the University of Chicago, the committees, the speakers and the guests of honor and Professors Joseph Kohler, Paul Ehrlich, Berthold Delbrueck, Eduard Meyer and Wilhelm Herrmann; while in the background were seated the clubs of the United Male Chorus, making an imposing impression. The three center loges at both sides of the main hall were reserved for invited guests and the lady companions of the German guests of honor. They were draped with American and German flags, and decorated with the coat-of-arms of both countries.</p>

   <p>Of the guests of honor Professor Kohler without doubt aroused the greatest interest. The scholar has an appearance whose charm nobody can deny.</p>
   <p>Professor Starr Willard Cutting opened the meeting and described the significance of the festivity, lauding the German Universities, their scholars who are the first line scientists and all the guests of honor for whom the festivity is arranged.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was the festival president, Mr. Harry Rubens, who was followed by Mr. Alexander R. Hohlfeld, Professor of German at the State University of Wisconsin with the real festival speech and this was an oratorical masterpiece.</p>
   <p>Professor Dr. Delbrueck answered with a very favorable address in which he referred to the social institutions and social welfare of Germany.</p>
