   <p>The laws of deportation, at present in force, are in many ways contrary to reason. In some cases they work out in such a way that undesirable elements can escape deportation, whereas morally unobjectionable persons have to be deported. The existing law contains certain limitations with regard to time and duration of imprisonment which often renders a desirable deportation impossible. There are, on the other hand immigrants who for years have given proof that they are persons of ability and usefulness, but will become victims of deportation if they came illegally to this country, or have become a public charge through no fault of their own.</p>
   <p>The worst thing is--one may also justly call it the inhuman thing--that, because of the existing law, families are separated who live here in complete harmony as useful members of the community. In this connection, our laws are an infamous exception to those of other civilized nations.</p>

   <p>From the preceding reasons, we welcome the endeavor to bring the existing laws into harmony with justice and humanity. Congressman Kerr deserves credit for having worked out a bill which has received the approval of the committee on naturalization and immigration, and which has been handed over for debate to the House of Representatives. It is to be hoped that Congress will occupy itself with the bill at this session and pass it. It would surely contribute much to the happiness of many an able man over whom hangs today the fate of deportation; the country is not going to suffer by it!</p>
   <p>In the first place, the bill provides for some aggravations in the definitions concerning deportation in the following cases: Participation in the trade with narcotic poisons; conviction for misdemeanor or crime which involves moral turpitude, even where no prison sentence was pronounced; abetting in the smuggling of persons, and the illegal carrying of weapons. These ordinances are intended to give the government a means for the deportation of undesirable elements, and are obviously so patterned as to more effectively combat the so-called gangster elements.</p>

   <p>The rest of the bill deals with mitigating the hardships pertaining to the existing law. Accordingly, an illegal immigrant who has been in this country for no less than ten years and, during that time, did nothing against society, should have the right to legalize his stay through later registration. Likewise, an illegal immigrant should be given the right of subsequent registration if his father, mother, wife or husband, or a legally acknowledged child of his, live in this country. The sole condition attached to it is that the person in question should, within a year, make use of the opportunity given him to remain in the country and to start the necessary steps toward legalizing his stay, and to acquire American citizenship.</p>
   <p>Persons who are admitted as visitors for a limited period should be permitted to receive the immigration visa without the compulsion of leaving the country first. Since the bill also provides that all subsequent registrations should be booked against the immigration quota of the respective country, injustices toward the various countries will be avoided.</p>
