   <p>With sincere regret will, among the many friends of the deceased, the sad news of the death of Assistant Postmaster Philip Kastler be received. The generally beloved and respected man, was carried away after a short, but malicious sickness. Philip Kastler was born in Chicago, and brought up by his upright father in such a way, that he felt at home only in German circles. For many years a member of the Herder-Lodge of Free Masons, the Turner Society "Vorwarts" (Forward) the Liederkranz Eintracht the Social Workers Club, the Forester Order and Chicago Sharpshooters Club, he very rarely missed the social arrangements of German Nationalities, and everybody who saw him on such occasions, was delighted with his bubbling humor and his laughing love of life, which shone in his friendly eyes. Up till 1890 Philip Kastler was a member of the firm Kastler Bros., which owned prosperous hat stores on Division Street and Blue Island Avenues. Six years ago, he thought that the retail business in Chicago was not remunerative any longer. He quickly changed sides, and took over the former saloon of Walter, on Blue Island Avenue, near Halsted Street. He knew how to make his locality a favorite rallying place of the neighborhood Germans. In the year 1894, Mr. Kastler, <span class="page-break">\2</span>upon recommendation of hundreds of influential citizens, was appointed by Postmaster Hesing to be Superintendent of the Branch Postoffice, at 18th Street and Blue Island Avenue, to which position he devoted his best abilities, circumspection and sense of duty. Philip Kastler only reached the age of 49 years.</p>
