   <p>From many sides it has been strongly recommended that the eight Aldermen, who were elected from as many wards in the last election, should be returned to the City Council in the coming campaign. It is pointed out that those eight belong to the most efficient group in the Council and that right now their services are of special necessity and extra value. This point of view is absolutely justified.</p>
   <p>An overwhelming majority of the Council stands completely under the influence of the present administration, and that it does not possess the confidence of the public in general was strikingly proved at the last election.</p>
   <p>If the aforementioned eight withdraw now, Alderman Arthur F. Albert would be alone in energetically opposing the administration. He has done this for years, and has thereby rendered himself invaluable to the citizens of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Alderman Albert has repeatedly uncovered corruption and extravagance through his attacks, and many times forced his party members to accept his propositions, even to the point of upsetting their plans.</p>
   
   <p>Alderman Albert's strength lies in his immaculate record. He has many opponents in the council, and is often sharply attacked, but never has anyone dared to question his integrity. Alderman Albert is young yet, and by many, that is considered a drawback. On the other hand we feel that it is a great advantage, because Chicago is in great need of young men who are energetic, capable and efficient, and who are thoroughly familiar with local civic problems.</p>
   <p>Albert was one of the candidates for the nomination to the office of trustee of County Commissioners. He was defeated in the primaries by the Bernard Snow machine with a small margin; on the other hand he was nominated as a member of the Commission. He proved his good political judgment by withdrawing his nomination. It is to be hoped that his political career will not end, because he is still young, and men of his caliber have the right and the duty to devote themselves to the services of the public.</p>
   
   <p>The Americans of German extraction in the next few days will celebrate the anniversary of Baron Von Steuben. It is characteristic of the German-Americans to remember in a fitting manner all their great dead. Therefore, it is quite as proper to say a good word occasionally about those still among the living. Arthur F. Albert is proud of his German parentage. All German-Americans have cause to be proud of him.</p>
