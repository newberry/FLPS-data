   <p>The following strange letter was received at our offices: Replying to your article in the Staats Zeitung of today, regarding my reports to the Volkstaat, I should like to ask you next time not to mix in my person, as you will have seen very well that I acted only on the order of the Association. For the rest, the memory of the gentlemen of the Staats Zeitung seem to suffer from extraordinary shortness, for it is hardly five months since it brought daily reports from New York and other big cities that so many had died from hunger. Do the workers contract this fever perhaps from over-eating, or from what? Otherwise, yours truly, H. R. Zimpel.</p>
   <p>So. Mr. H. R. Zimpel is not a myth, but a real person, even though he is angry that we have drawn him out of the shadows, while he would rather have remained hidden behind the chimney screen of the "Social Democratic Association." In any case Mr. Zimpel is unique. Because - revolting as it is - a few persons in the City of New York died of hunger, he warns the workers not to come to America, because in America, every year thousands starve to death! He deserves a medal - and so does the Social Democratic Association, if it read and qpproved this report before hand. If the Association still exists it would oblige us by sending us information regarding its next meeting. "Mochte selbst solcheinen Herren Kennen, Wursde ihn Herrn Mikroksmus nennen." (I would like to press him to my boson, I would call him Mr. Mikrokosm.)</p>
