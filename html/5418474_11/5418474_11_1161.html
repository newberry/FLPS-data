   <p>Dies at the age of seventy-one. Funeral Tuesday. This year death, the reaper, has pitilessly grasped several victims from the ranks of the German Singers. A great loss was caused to them yesterday, when the unselfish promoter of German men's songs in Chicago, Adam Krueter, had to obey the call of death. With him again one of the old popularizers of the German Songs in the United States, a well-known beloved figure in German societies, is gone. Shortly before reaching the age of seventy-one years, Adam Kreuter died after a short illness, after a life, which was devoted to work, but also was crowded with success.</p>
   <p>The deceased came to America as a young man from his home town Treysa near Kassel more than fifty years ago, and settled in Chicago. In later years, <span class="page-break">\2</span>after he had worked himself up, he became vice-president, director and manager of the American Laundry Machinery Co. He soon achieved financial success. But it is a testimonial for the human traits of Kreuter, that he remained true to his democratic habits. He enjoyed most the company of his fellow-singers of Teutonia Men's Chorus, whose president he was for many years. He further belonged to the Germania Club, the Chicago Athletic Club, and the Illinois Athletic Club, also to several golf clubs. In Masonic circles the deceased played a prominent role. His unexpected death caused great sorrow and sympathy among the members of singing societies. Besides a great number of friends, his demise is mourned by his wife, Emily Kreuter, his son, V. C. Kreuter, and his daughter, Mrs. C. H. Romeiser, and also three grand-children.</p>
