   <p>In return for their friendship, which the so-called leaders of the Chicago Sound Money Democrats wanted to offer him, Governor Altgeld did thank them in his own way. He acknowledged the good will of some of the gentlemen, but pointed most of them out as being only clever foxes, who fancy themselves to be able to make an old experienced bird like John P. Altgeld fall into a trap; furthermore the Governor declares that he does not apply for re-election. But if he was looking for the office "no price would he suppress his convictions on such an important question, as the one, which forms the base of our misery."</p>
   <p>This is really well said and confirms the impression that Mr. Altgeld is a gentleman of firm character. But, alas, he spoke yet more, and it can be said: much to much. It certainly does not become the head of a great state very well, to talk of the "Eastern Vampires, who drink the life blood of the country" or call the Federal administration" a gang of stock usurers." This can more fittingly be left to the most ordinary stump-speakers or to the state-men of the Tillman type. If Mr. Altgeld wants to represent "convictions," he should fight with reasons and not with insults.</p>

   <p>He said; " The idea that the prosperity of the world can be replaced with only half of the money that was needed formerly to provide for the business of the world, is too absurd to be discussed in earnest. Especially when one remembers that the taxes, interests, the large debts and other charges did not lessen. Therefore the upkeep of the low prices means the total destruction of the buying power of the entire debtor class.-</p>
   <p>Because the Gold Dollar reduced prices, while permanent debts stay unchanged, it destroyed the buying power of the country and in consequence the market for the only merchandise the laborer can sell-namely his working power."</p>
   <p>Where is the proof that "the world" of to-day has only half as much money as in former years- that is probably before the year 1873? In the U.S. alone the reserves in coined money and fine metals amount to nearly $1,240,000,000 and to this add the greenbacks, treasury notes, Gold and silver certificates, and National Banknotes to the total amount of $1,222,414,206. And altogether odd is the statement that through low prices the labor market becomes destroyed. The cheaper the goods, the larger the market, and the more the laborer can buy for his wages the better it is for him. His buying power would only decrease <span class="page-break">3</span>if his wages were still more lessened than the price of the goods he has to purchase..</p>
