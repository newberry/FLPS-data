   <p>The visitors, among whom are several ladies, went to the Bismarck Hotel, where reservations had been made for them. Immediately after breakfast they began the round trip through the city, in the course of which they got acquainted with the high roads of commerce, the parks and other points of interest. The sightseeing for the morning concluded with a visit to the stockyards.</p>
   <p>For the afternoon, a view of the plant of the Chicago Tribune, and of the city was proposed. Some of the members will attend to their private affairs, visit relations and friends, and in the evening a cheerful meeting will take place.</p>

   <p>To the question as to what has pleased them most so far in America, some of the participants answered that the steamer trip on the Hudson river, from New York to Albany, Niagara Falls, Detroit and its powerful industry, have made the greatest impression upon them. Of course, they added, they do not know much about Chicago so far, and it is possible that after today's inspection, the general opinion will be in favor of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow the inspection of Chicago will be continued by visiting the great warehouses of Sears-Roebuck and Montgomery Ward, and towards midnight the trip to Cleveland will be started.</p>
