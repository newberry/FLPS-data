   <p>The United Men's Chorus under the leadership of Joseph Keller, its president, and Justus Emme, its secretary, arranged a hearty welcome at the Union Station in honor of the celebrated German-American singer, Mrs. Schumann Heink, who, together with "Roxy" (Samuel L. Rothafels), the well-known conductor, has come here to give a concert.</p>
   <p>When Mrs. Schumann appeared before the large crowd that had gathered to meet her at the station, the chorus sang "Harmony Brings us Together." The almost seventy-year old singer was overwhelmed with joy and thanked Mr. Keller for his thoughtfulness. The cheering of the crowd, mostly Germans, showed to the artist how much she is admired in Chicago. In return she declared she was happy to be in old Chicago again.</p>
