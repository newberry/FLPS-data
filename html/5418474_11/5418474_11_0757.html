   <p>Suggestions for the arrangement of a Hindenburg celebration on the occasion of the 80th birthday anniversary of the president of the German Republic, Field Marshall Paul von Hindenburg, has fallen upon fertile soil. A number of representatives of the great German speaking organizations and societies of our city, met at the office of the Abendpost, to undertake preparatory steps for a celebration.</p>
   <p>The conviction prevailed in general that, the entire German-speaking element of Chicago, will participate enthusiastically. It was decided, to call a meeting for the purpose of forming a committee to arrange a great and imposing festival, worthy of this great man and of the German population of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The undersigned therefore, request the representatives of German societies, lodges and church synods, as well as other citizens of German descent, who are interested in this celebration, to come Tuesday, August 2nd, to the Hotel Atlantic.</p>
