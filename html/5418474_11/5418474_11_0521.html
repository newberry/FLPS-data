   <p>One of the most contemptible papers printed in the United States is the "Puck." One issue of this paper contained a picture recently, which is an outrage upon our free country. A ballot-box is pictured and on the right side of it stand a number of naturalized citizens, ready to vote. Everyone of these voters, a German, an Irishman, an Englishman, a Frenchman, etc., were halved, that is, they appeared on one side as German, English, Irish, etc., and on the other side as Americans. On the left side is the well known figure of "Brother Jonathan," and these words come from his lips: " Shall I grant these people the full right to vote, because they are half Americans only?"</p>
   <p>We can not imagine a more shameful attack upon the naturalized citizens. They have done so much for the development of our country, and are still doing it. The constitution guarantees specifically all rights of American citizens, with the exception that no naturalized citizen can become president or vice-president of the United States.</p>

   <p>Did the stupid publisher of "Puck" ever realize that every naturalized citizen has to pay taxes in full like every born American, and not only half of them?</p>
