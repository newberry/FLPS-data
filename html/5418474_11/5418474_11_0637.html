   <p>Immigration from Europe has stopped almost completely. The financial crisis, low salaries, and high taxes are responsible for it.</p>
   <p>But nevertheless there are poor people still coming over, who as soon as they arrive, ask the German Society for support. One Joseph Schmidt from West Prussia father of five children has been here for two months and is without any means. He said his friends had written telling him that Chicago was a bad place for work but a very good one for poor people.</p>
   <p>Many immigrants are also coming to Chicago because they rely on the proceeds from the fair. I wonder if regulations should not be drawn up concerning the people to be helped.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
