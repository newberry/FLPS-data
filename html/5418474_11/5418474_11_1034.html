   <p>Die Volks Zeitung, ( the people's newspaper) of Berlin disapproved of the attacks upon Americans that have been occasioned by the dynamite outrage. "This is regrettable. In everyday contact with other nations we were unpresumptuous and discreet, but since our war victory, other nations are being looked down upon, reserving the nobility of virtue for itself, trying to pin all the outrages on to non-Germans. This is to be considered as youthful pranks of a politically reborn nation and therefore has to be forgiven."</p>
   <p>The article said further:... "We consider it as good fortune that no suspicion fell on the much discussed Thomas as being a Frenchman! Happily, he is a Protestant; were he a Catholic no doubt that there would be plenty of fanatics who would accuse religion for this atrocious act. Our American guests can gather from this circumstance that there is no suspicion cast against American but a parade of a sickly enthusiasm of self virtue harmful to all the world, meaning in this instance to morally disbelieve in the virtue of others."</p>

   <p>We hope that this will be sufficient to calm our American guests if their feelings were hurt adding, that we have cause to regret that the same custom does not prevail in Germany as is the case in England and America, by which a catastrophe like that in Bremen would have been corrected officially...</p>
