   <p>Single members of the German-American Regiment of volunteers arrive gradually here, being sent home on sick furlough. Unexpected obstacles have made the departure of the whole regiment from Montank Point, which was planned for to-day, impossible for the present. The Railroad Companies can not get sufficient sleepers together in such a short time, and it seems certain that it will take several days.</p>
   <p>One of the convalescents of the regiment, Mr. G. Drew, who arrived recently speaks of his experiences with understanding and moderation. He states that the regiment lay in the trenches at Santiago for five days in the burning heat of the sun, and in pouring rain alternately. It was therefore no surprise that many took sick. He considered the food received as good and plentiful, but the meals for the sick had been rather unsuitable, however, with the exception of the meals in the hospital of Montank Point. Similar statements were made by Corporal Blood.</p>
