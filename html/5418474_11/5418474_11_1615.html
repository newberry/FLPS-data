   <p>Ex-Governor Altgeld's speech can indeed not be considered as one of his greatest achievements. A political speech never makes a deep impression, if it is rendered for the sake of keeping the appearance of unity, instead of being the expression of one's innermost conviction.</p>
   <p>Formerly, Mr. Altgeld made no secret of his opinion in regard to the weakness of the Democratic legislature measures and he could not decide in a decisive moment to recommend them publicly. After he had severely critized the "graftbills" accepted by the last legislature, he confined somewhat as follows:- The question is asked if no Democrats had voted for these bills, which can be answered only in the affirmative. But almost all of them have been eliminated by their constituents outside Chicago. The Democratic party as such has taken a decided stand against such legislation, while on the other hand the Republican State Administration indorsed the same.</p>
   <p>Even Mr. Altgeld could not make himself believe that his defense of the Democratic candidates of Chicago was anything else but weak and uneffective, therefore <span class="page-break">2</span>he tried to emphasize the fact, that it would be unusual, if among 40-50 candidates, there would be no black sheep. But even this false conclusion or fallacy obviously failed to satisfy him, and he finally made this confession:</p>
   <p>"If you find a man on the Democratic ticket, whom you consider a grafter vote against him! The Democratic party makes all efforts to free itself from these elements and it will not thank you for supporting a grafter, even if he succeeded in getting his name on the list. But be certain that you are right before you accuse a man of being a grafter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Altgeld should dispel the rumors that he is not satisfied with the Democratic ticket. But instead of it he confirmed the same and attacked the influences back of the Democratic grafters. Therefore it can not be asserted that it was fortunate to have the Ex-Governor hold the opening speech for the campaign against his will.</p>
   <p>His speech contained also dangerous contradictions. It is past comprehension <span class="page-break">3</span>how the visionary Mr. Altgeld, who thinks Socialism is the proper solution for all social problems, can defend so-called inflation politics and it is still more mysterious, how he can still hold on to Mr. W. J. Bryan, who is absolutely against such politics. If the Democratic party is responsible for the war, as Altgeld asserts then it can not be understood, how he can condemn the shortcomings and defects, which were the results of our unpreparedness and of our volunteers being untrained. Whoever makes the Republican party responsible for these bad conditions, must grant her also the credit for the conquest and the easily obtained victory; and whoever stands for the annexation of Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Philippine Islands, must also praise the administration, which is for such policies.</p>
   <p>Mr. Altgeld remains the same in respect to the currency problems, but in view of the colossal gold reserves, which have accumulated in the United States since 1896, his reasons for the silver-standard are rather vague and unconvincing. As soon as facts and realities refute and disprove a theory, words in favor of such theories become useless.</p>
