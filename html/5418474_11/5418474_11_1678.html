   <p>Governor Altgeld, has yesterday nominated Mr. Ed. G. Uihlein for a further term as member of the Westside Park Commission, so that the above named will stay on this Board until 1902. Mr. Uihlein, who always has been personally a great friend of floriculture and horticulture and whose private green houses are considered the most beautiful of Chicago, has during the last years procured of his private means many hundreds of rare plants and bushes for the Parks of the Westside.</p>
   <p>It is chiefly his achievement that these Parks at present, in regard to their flowers exhibit without question occupy the first place among all public parks of the U.S. By the re-nomination of Mr. Uihlein the Governor has done a valuable service to the park system of the Westside.</p>
