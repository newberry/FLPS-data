   <p>With a 300 pound birthday cake and in the presence of a large number of patrons, the Bismarck Hotel today celebrated the fifth anniversary of its existence in the new quarters, and the 39th since the opening of the original Bismarck Hotel. Two capable and far-sighted experts of the German Hotel business, Karl and Emil Eitel, established themselves in business during the World's Fair in 1893, on Cottage Grove Avenue and 63rd Street. Their enterprise has grown with the Metropolis of the West, to such proportions that it is known in all parts of the country as the home of hospitality.</p>
