   <p>Even in the Irish Regiment many Germans are serving the nation. The officers and men of the 7th Regiment swore allegiance to the flag yesterday, in the presence of Captain S. C. Roberts and now Colonel Kavanagh and his soldiers are bona fide National warriors.</p>
   <p>The regiment's list of names shows that it is not entirely composed of representatives of the Celtic race. It is not likely that Mr. Lippert, second lieutenant of company "E" is of Irish descent and such names as Huber, Henze, Kaufman, Schrader, Hasse, Lorenzen, Oppenheimer, Glowitzki, Schaefer, Schneider, Schien, Cawitzka, Echkardt etc. do not show Celtic origin.</p>
   <p>Col. Emil Bloch obtained permission from the Lincoln Park Commissioners to use the ball field for a training ground for the "German Turner Regiment," every Monday and Tuesday from 8:30 to 10:00 P.M.</p>
