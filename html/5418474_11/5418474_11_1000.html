   <p>The Monarchy as a ruling system, with all its stern laws and narrow minded regulations, limiting personal freedom and choking individual free thought, has been the inherited and carefully nourished ideal, by all means of authority of every German. And just for this reason alone, American History should be carefully and more intensively studied, in German Schools. Even if the German nation has at present neither the opportunity nor ability to have a Democratic Government, at least the pupils, the coming generations, should study American History, in order to learn and visualize the blessings enjoyed by a progressive nation, which in the very beginning of its existence, has kept itself free from dogmatic unjust traditions and worn out laws, to become a free people in a free country with a people's Government.</p>
