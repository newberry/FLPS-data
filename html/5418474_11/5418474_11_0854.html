   <p>At present, revolution is in full swing over therein Germany, and nobody can tell with certainty in what form the new German phoenix will rise out of the ashes of its humiliation. That will depend, to a large extent, on the men whom fate has put at the helm of the German ship of state, and their ability to guide her through the rapids and bring her safely into port. The present leaders of the German people are scarcely known outside the boundaries of their homeland. We only know that they are social democrats. Their intentions and plans are known only in general and no details are available. There is no doubt that they will try to establish a people's government, a government by the people and for the people. But the social democrats themselves do not seem to agree on the methods to be employed in <span class="page-break">\2</span>the attainment of this goal.</p>
   <p>According to newspaper reports, it seems to be evident that the so-called Independent Social Democrats [Translators note: The "independent" social democrats were the left wing of the Social-Democratic party. They originally belonged to the latter, but then separated and made themselves "independent" in the parliament.] have the establishment of a pure socialist republic in mind, and would like to exclude all other political parties from participation in the government. The attitude prompting such an intention, if it actually does exist, is foolish to a high degree, but humanly understandable, because, by that action, the "reds" would be paying back the "bourgeois" parties in the same coin that has been handed out to them for decades. Until the war there were, in the German Reich, no high government officials with a red political tint. In the smaller states there may have been exceptions to this rule. Nevertheless, the exclusion of the middle-class parties <span class="page-break">\3</span>from the government would be the most stupid thing the socialists could do. Two wrongs never make a right. If the social democrats should now engage in a policy of revenge against those parties which formerly gagged and maltreated them, they would only prove that they are not a bit better. than their opponents. Under their government the same class rule would prevail in the country that prevailed under the old regime, the only difference being that those who were formerly "underdogs" would become "top dogs". That would of course be a great satisfaction to the former [the social democrats], but it could hardly be called a democracy or a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. It would be the rule of those classes which, in the German Reich have, until now, been called the lower classes. A genuine people's government, on the other hand, would have to include all classes of the people. For this reason it is highly desirable that the German socialists should not establish a one-sided, "red" republic. For such a republic could not endure for any <span class="page-break">\4</span>length of time, since it would deny part of the people their right of self-determination and would thus foment rebellion against those in power, and eventually culminate in a bloody civil war.</p>
   <p>But, as we have already mentioned, the social democrats have not agreed among themselves on any thing yet. We hope that the moderate "comrades", who have for some time co-operated with the government which has just been deposed in order to further the people's interests not only in theory, but in a practical way, and who have shown good judgment and tact, will take matters into their own hands and curb their wild brothers, if they should show any Bolshevik tendencies. Before the war the "moderate comrades", i.e., those that had undergone a political "moulting" and had quit "raving", formed the great majority of the German social democracy. The war could hardly have lessened their patriotic sentiments. It can therefore be expected today that the sense and patriotism of the moderates will finally gain victory over the wild plans and schemes of those who gather around Liebknecht.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Liebknecht has his merits. Perhaps, if he had not carried on his agitation, and if his dire predictions had not come true, and the masses, led astray by the Junkers, had not realized the truth at last, the political upheaval in Germany would not have been carried out so quickly and almost without bloodshed. But if he should now antagonize those Germans who are not socialist in their sympathies, by his narrow-minded and one-sided dogmatism, he could hardly be called a clever and experienced politician, which we would like the leaders of the German people to be. We shall soon see of what calibre he is. Only an extensive reform, without partiality or privileges, can make a genuine people's state out of Germany.</p>
