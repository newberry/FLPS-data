   <p>Governor Altgeld came yesterday to Chicago, to settle his private affairs. He repeated, that after the expiration of his term, he would, in all probability, make a trip to Europe, and has no intention of being a candidate as president of the State Central Committee of his party, in place of his friend Hinrichsen. There can be no talk about his being a mayoralty candidate, because he is not eligible for the office of mayor, at present. He changed his domicile from Chicago to Springfield, four years ago, and therefore, even if he would move to Chicago in January, he would not be eligible, for a year to any city office.</p>
