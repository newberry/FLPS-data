   <p>As we reported yesterday, President McKinley has nominated the editor of the Lutheran weekly "Rundschau", Mr. Louis Lange Jr. as Consul in Bremen, and this is generally called a very good move. Mr. Lange who is 43 years old today, was born in St. Louis and visited, after finishing the schools there, the Concordia College in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He entered then the business of his father and took over, a few years ago, the management of the meanwhile removed to this city, "Rundshau".</p>
   <p>He lives at the present time in Germany, but has participated in the last national campaign in the interest of sound money, for which he now receives well earned recognition, In his behalf Messrs William H. Tatge, William H. Vocke, Judge Brentano and many other influential German Republicans interceded. Mr. Lange enjoys high esteemand great popularity, and without doubt he will be a worthy representative of the German Americans.</p>
