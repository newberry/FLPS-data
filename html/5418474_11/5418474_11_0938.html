   <p>German Consulate at the Schiller Building there reigned yesterday afternoon a special activity and also solemnity. The concern was to deliver in a festive, impressive, and dignified way the awards which Prince Henry ordered for those who made themselves deserving in connection with his stay in Chicago. The acting Consul Dr. Zoepffel had prepared for every one of them a short but hearty address in which he expressed the wish of his majesty, the German Emperor, that the person in question may accept the order or honor-present and at the same time he delivered the thanks of Prince Henry of Prussia.</p>
   <p>Arthur T. Eddy, the lawyer and "the Lion of Chicago Society," received the Red Eagle Order of the 3rd class, but just as pride are the two coachmen John Mooney and Robert Cook who drove the Prince through the streets, they received golden pins that are valuable jewels. More precious and of more artistic value are other pins that were given to the following gentelmen:</p>
