   <p>Governor Altgeld, supplied the "Press" today, with the following declaration, in which he says:</p>
   <p>"To the Democrats of Illinois!"</p>
   <p>"Although, defeated, I wish to thank you for the loyal support you gave me and to congratulate you for your heroic fight. Remember, that only 6 months ago, our party was prostrate on the ground! She was betrayed into the hands of stockbrokers and monopolists by President Cleveland, and robbed of everything, except its honor, political vultures tore its flesh, it teemed with political vermin, and was loaded with political spongers and in spite of that it tore its political fetters, with which those political Liliputians tied her, rose up with new energy, liberated itself of the dominance of "Trusts" and Syndicates and represented vigorously the case of the much troubled humanity."</p>
   <p>Its fight was the most heroic, which was ever fought, under such circumstances.</p>
