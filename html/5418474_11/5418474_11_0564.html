   <p>In connection with the ninth Republican National Convention in Chicago the great Dick Powers arranged a Workers' parade yesterday, ordered by his political bosses in honor of Gresham.</p>
   <p>The workers were Italian street sweepers, who underbid their Irish predecessors with their wage demands and misplaced them and political bums.</p>
   <p>The banners bearing the inscription: "Protect American Labor," were therefore justified.</p>
