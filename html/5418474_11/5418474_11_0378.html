   <p>Congressman John J. Douglas of Massachusetts has introduced a resolution in Congress, which proposes a change in the existing Immigration Law of 1924. This act determined that the yearly total immigration quota to the United States, beginning with July 1st, should be restricted to 150,000 persons, and the distribution of this quota over the various nationalities shall be decided on the basis of the number of individuals of these nationalities living in the United States in 1920. This will include not only those who themselves were born in the homeland, but all those, who are descended from these nationalities, even if their families have been settled in this country for generations.</p>
   <p>It is obvious, that such descent and origins will be enormously difficult to ascertain, especially in a country like the United States, in which registers of persons have never been kept.</p>
   <p>"Enormously difficult" is not the right word; it is simply impossible to collect such statistics without making mistakes. The results of the efforts to secure the statistics are not known yet, but already it can be said that considering the inadequate materials, no claim can be made to the correctness. At the best, it can only be treated as an approximate estimation of the different nationalities from which the present population has sprung.</p>
   <p>The Immigration Law of 1924 was based, for certain reasons, upon the unexpressed intension, of favoring immigration from North, Central and Western Europe, and, on the other hand, of limiting the unwelcome elements of the remaining parts of Europe. After many years of experience it was found, first, that the Slavic and Roman races have outspoken difficulties in adapting themselves to the American standard of living; and second, that they bring an element of unrest to this country, which makes the life of those citizens who are of different origin, difficult.</p>
   <p>It is in the interest of the future development of the United States to give the American nationality a solid structure. Therefore, the wise leaders of the people will use consideration in selecting, among the prospective immigrants those whose similar types offer assurance of quick assimilation.</p>
   <p>Apart from certain narrow strips of the union, which were first settled by Spaniards and Frenchmen, the largest number of the immigrants, since the discovery of America, consist mostly of members of the Germanic races, to which the Irish, on account of their union with Great Britain for many years, can be added. Anglo-Saxons, Scots, Irish, Germans, Scandinavians, and Dutch supply the main contingent of the settlers upon American soil.</p>
   <p>It is their descendants who constitute most of the American population today; and if this type should not change considerably in the future, the majority of prospective immigrants must be largely of the same elements.</p>
   <p>But a sure basis for the calculation of immigration quotas for the different nationalities must be found; but it would not do to prevent the other European races entirely from coming to this country. Dr. Trevor, in his essay, "An Analysis of the American Immigration Act of 1924," published a tabulation of quotas, as they, in all probability will be calculated on the basis of the law attacked by Congressman Douglas. Accordingly, of the 150,000 who will be admitted yearly, 85,135 would be under the quotas of Great Britain and North Ireland. The quota of the Irish Free State would amount to 8,330, and that of Germany to 20,028.</p>
   <p>But every nationality would be granted the right, irrespective of the number settled here already, to contribute at least 100 immigrants. San Marino, Andora, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Liberia, and Abyssinia are all allowed to send 100 immigrants each, yearly, to the United States. But if these little countries were to send their complete quotas over here for several years, they would, in a short time, not have any population left at all.</p>
   <p>It would, in fact, be much better for Congress to undertake once more a thorough consideration in regard to the question of quotas, to find some way of regulating them on a simpler and more suitable basis, according to the indicated directions.</p>
