   <p>Max L. Leich, the well-known proprietor of the Hotel Kaiserhof submitted friendly advice for the education of our American boys.</p>
   <p>In no case, the lack of special knowledge in America, proved so strikingly, as the propaganda, evoked through the World War, to produce an army for an eventual defense of our country. Our part of the population believes, that every nation on earth is prepared to destroy us; the other part believes we never will be entangled in a war; but only those who can judge reasonably, will find the right answer between these two extremes; the biggest error is the belief, that armies can be created over night, this belief is shared next to the government, by the statesmen, publishers, and authors, who are under the impression that it only requires a call, and an army of capable fighting soldiers will be ready for duty. The most conclusive proof is the experience of the last few months, as well, as the situation of our relation with Mexico, and Germany, which brought the possibility of war closer to us. Therefore it is of great importance, to find new ideas of preparedness of defense.</p>
   <p>Max L. Leich, who is well-known in German circles of Chicago, considers it therefore a proper and commendable to express his views in the following statement:</p>
   <p>I am not for a military system that takes a man from 18 to 24 years of age into military training; because of young man at this age shall earn money, and a loss from 1 to 3 years will be financially disadvantageous.</p>
   
   <p>Young men of this age are harder to manage, they look upon military service as too severe and a loss of time. Their conceptions are stranger, exertions of descipline practised upon them, is difficult. Every parent will submit to the difficulty of managing boys of the age from 12 to 16 years. After they complete public schools, few are willing to extend their studies, because they are not forced to do so, and only a small number go to higher schools. In the first place, the boys are in the hands of female teachers, who have no authority to compel obedience, the unmannerly rough fellow leaves school, unruly and insolent, in readiness to participate in crime. At the most dangerous age he is let loose on humanity, in his mature age, a play ball of passion, without experience, judgment or deliberation.</p>
   
   <p>Those are the years, in which a big percentage of boys are left to themselves, and the seed is sown, which will make of them criminals, loafers and vagabonds. At this time in their 13th and 14th year, the government should interfere, and say: "I will take care of your boy during the next four years, will nourish and cloth him in the best way possible, will give him the best physical development. In a manual training school his time shall be divided between recreations, rest, instructions."</p>
   <p>Out of such manly discipline and wholesome education, the 16 year old boy would develop into a strong and morally firm human being, who, in two years, could master 4 years study, or could occupy himself successfully in any trade; such system would not only produce the most able citizens, but would also save the parents much heart suffering, would keep our prisons vacant, would establish happy marriages and families, and would produce in the hour of danger an army, which in ten days of practice could conquer the world. The system would be real preparation, a practical education and the maintenance of our American boys.</p>
