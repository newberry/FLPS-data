   <p>The former president of the Sanitary District and city treasurer died yesterday in his home at 4578 Oakenwald Ave, at the age of 63 years. He was laid up with the flu about one week, but it seemed that he was improving and his physicians permitted him to leave his bed for a short time. All of a sudden a relapse occurred, and not long afterwards he expired. The deceased was born in Muscatine, Iowa, in 1861, worked himself up by his own strength and was everywhere respected as a careful circumspect business man. For a few years he was the representative of the Republic of Peru, in Chicago. During the years of 1910 and 1911, he held the office of president of the Press Club. He was of German descent.</p>
