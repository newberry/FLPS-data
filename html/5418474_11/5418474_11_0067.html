   <p>Haase's Park, which has been an amusement place, is to become a cemetery.</p>
   <p>It is only a few months ago, that the idea was advanced to found a great German cemetery, free from all narrow prescriptions. A few narrow minded clerics helped to promote the idea by making a show of intolerance at the wrong time.</p>
   <p>Many lodges and associations will bury their dead in groups and thus form small cemeteries within a big one. That Waldheim may feel that it belongs to all the Germans, is proven by the gift of twenty-three lots by members of the German Society, for the burial of the poor.</p>
   <p>The new cemetery is located as most of the readers know, ten miles from the courthouse on the Northwestern Railroad, and is crossed by the Desplaines river. The cemetery is covered by a forest of oak and birch trees.</p>
