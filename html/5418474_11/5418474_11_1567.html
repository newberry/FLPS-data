   <p>Through the death of Josef H. Ernst, the Germans of Chicago have lost one of their most capable representatives.</p>
   <p>He was born on February 25, 1838, in Bingen on the Rhine. He emigrated to this country when he was 16 years old. He crossed the Atlantic ocean on the French ship "St. Nicholes."
