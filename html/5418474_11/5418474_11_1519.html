   <p>Sister Mary Julia, the founder and sister superior of the St. Vincent Orphan home at LaSalle and Superior Streets, who was very popular on account of her charity and willingness to help, has died at the age of 48 years, after a short illness. The now deceased, whose former name was Sophie Woelfel, was born in Baden, Germany and came at the age of 6 with her parents to the United States, first to Dayton in the State of Ohio. At the age of 15 years she entered the Convent of the Charitable Sisters of the St. Vincent De Paul Order in Emitsburg, Md. and has since that time devoted her life to the charitable work of this order. She was the founder of the St. Vincent Orphan Home of this city, which under her supervision grew so well, that she was transferred to the St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore where she made a name for herself by the foundation of the Water Cure Sanitarium. When this work was completed, Sister Mary Julia was transferred to the Boys' Orphanage in Syracuse, N. Y., and when the Sister Superior of the St. Vincent Orphanage died, she was called back to Chicago to replace her. Sister Mary Julia accomplished also the erection of a Maternity Hospital in connection with the Orphan Home and built a summer home for Homeless <span class="page-break">\2</span>Infants in Park Ridge, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The obsequies for the deceased will take place tomorrow at the Holy Name Cathedral</p>
