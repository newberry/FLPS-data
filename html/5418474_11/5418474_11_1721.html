   <p>The Germans of Chicago are appreciating more and more the lectures of Dr. Adolph Brodbeck, who according to the opinion of the German scientist, Dr. Rochs has become a noteworthy authority in the realm of philosophy. Dr. Brodbeck spoke last Sunday on "Idealism of Religion" and will give a lecture coming Sunday night on "Mythological Elements of Our Modern Civilization" at Jung's Hall, 106 Randolph Street.</p>
