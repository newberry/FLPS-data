   <p>In Washington, as well as in Chicago, rumors have been current for some time that Theodore Brentano is being seriously considered for a post as ambassador. During the past few days, these rumors have become especially persistent. At present, no definite information is available; nevertheless, according to all indications, Mr. Brentano is prepared again to accept a diplomatic post.</p>
   <p>The memory of his thirty-one years as judge in Chicago is still alive among the Germans of this city, who have always referred to him as Judge Brentano, although he has since been appointed American Ambassador to Hungary, in which capacity he served the country for many years.</p>
   <p>If, in spite of his advanced years, he should accept the appointment to a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>diplomatic post, he would be given universal approval. Having served his country and his people for so many years, he would be justified in now relaxing. But it is obvious that he belongs to that class of persons who cannot dispense with their usual activities. His appointment seems to be definite, although, it is still uncertain whether he will represent this country at Copenhagen or at Vienna. Mr. Brentano is at present the only American diplomat of German ancestry; his re-appointment would therefore be heartily applauded in Chicago.</p>
   <p>If, however, the privilege of deciding between the countries mentioned should fall to Mr. Brentano, there can be no doubt as to his preference for Vienna, the seat of German culture for centuries past. That city is the capital of a Germanic people whose language he speaks and whose customs he appreciates. Since he is of German extraction, no other move could be anticipated.</p>
   <p>President Hoover may be sure that the appointment of Mr. Brentano as American <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>ambassador to Vienna will particularly gladden the hearts of the German population of Chicago and will be pleasant tidings to the German people throughout the nation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brentano demonstrated his ability as a diplomat while representing our government so excellently at the Hungarian capital.</p>
