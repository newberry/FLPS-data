   <p>Without deathstruggle or pain Mr.A.C.Hesing a pioneer of Germania in Chicago and president of the Ill.Staatszeitung Co. died last night. A heart attack, the second one after a light attack in the previous year, ended his life quickly. Notwithstanding his 73 years Mr.Hesing, till the last days of his life, was in good health and in full bodily and mental strength, so that his sudden death was a great surprise to the persons, next to him. After he had dictated last night in his residence 3239 Vernon Avenue an article for the "Staatszeitung", in which he sharply citisized the actions of the boodlers in the city council, he went to bed at about 11 o'clock. A few hours later he complained of not feeling well, and a doctor was sent for, who however declared that there was nothing seriously wrong. At about 7 in the morning his condition became worse, and he died very quickly. When Postmaster Washington Hesing, who had been informed of his condition, arrived at 8 o'clock in the home, he found his father dead.</p>
