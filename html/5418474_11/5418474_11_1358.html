   <p>Carl Pletz who for many years was the correspondent of the Abendpost of Chicago and a local editor of the Cincinnati Free Press died yesterday morning after a long illness. A typical worker, his faithfulness to duty, and a glowing devotion to his profession distinguished this man, kept up his courage to the last. In 1912 Mr. Pletz celebrated his 25th anniversary as a journalist; the most prominent citizens of Chicago honored him and gave proof of the high esteem he stood in among all classes of the German element of Chicago. His efficiency in the employ of the Abendpost was a service to the Germans of Chicago, who will lose in him the best representative of their cause.</p>
   <p>Carl Pletz was born September 28, 1862, in Magdeburg, Germany. He received a very good education in the higher schools of Germany. His excellent knowledge of English secured for him, at the age of 18 years, a position as an English correspondent with a trading firm, which had commercial connections with the United States and Cuba. His activity broadened his horizon and awakened in him the yearning for foreign countries. Assiduously he devoted his time to studies of the Spanish and English languages and history.</p>

   <p>He hesitated for a long time in his decision to emigrate either for Havana or Baltimore, because he had business connections in both cities. The star that finally drew him to America, was a German girl of his home town, whom he had met at a social function, and to whom on the way home from a Lohengrin performance he became secretly engaged. His fiancee was Miss Martha Muller. She came to the United States with her parents and settled in Cincinnati, where her father, H. Muller, an artist and photographer, opened a studio. He lived until the end of last year, when Carl Pletz wrote the obituary of his 91 year old father-in-law in the Free Press.</p>
   <p>In 1881 Carl Pletz came to Baltimore and three weeks after his arrival he secured a position on the editorial staff of the Baltimore German Journal. A year later he was promoted to be the local editor. Then he went to Cincinnati, was married, and brought his wife home to Baltimore. But because of the impression he had gained of this city of Cincinnati, and with consideration to the wishes of his wife's family he decided again to leave. Supplied with the best of recommendations he took his chance with one of the three existing German newspapers of Cincinnati and Chicago.</p>
   <p>A few days after his arrival, Col. Markbreit engaged him to edit the <span class="page-break">3</span>Volksblatt to which he devoted 35 years of his industrious life. He came came in close contact with all the leaders and promoters of German culture, with the singers and turners, the German and English theaters, with music and all useful efforts, and among others with the war veterans but for the politicans he had no use. His thorough study of immigration history, on which he lectured, were always accepted with appreciation. As a historian Mr. Pletz was a well liked and eminent co-worker of the New Yorker, German Sunday paper, as well as a highly esteemed correspondent of the Chicago Abendpost which he served for many years.</p>
   <p>Carl Pletz devoted his life and work to the fulfillment of two duties, namely: to raise and educate his children to be good and useful citizens, and secondly the maintenance of a German newspaper as a mouth-piece of German culture, which was so necessary in an epoch of intellectual deterioration.</p>
   <p>Every striving man comes occasionally in conflict with contrary duties. Carl Pletz always considered himself first and last as a servant for the cause of the German people, therefore rejected many advantageous offers of American newspapers, which would have benefited his family. The public will never know how many personal and material sacrifices he made for the benefit of <span class="page-break">4</span>the up keep of his paper, to which he was devoted with soul and body, like every other true newspaper man.</p>
   <p>He is mourned by his sorrowful widow and his four children. The earthly remains will be buried Monday. Pastor Hans Haupt, a friend for many years, himself a former president of the German Literary Club, whose leader the deceased was, will officiate at the funeral ceremony.</p>
