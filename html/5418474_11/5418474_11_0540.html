   <p>The present poor labor-situation and lack of employment has caused many despairing immigrants, who came from overseas to this country during the last 12 months, to return to their homeland.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the immigration to this country has dropped considerably for the same reason. There is only a total of 70,006 persons, that entered the United States as immigrants during 1893. There were only 3459 Germans in this total.</p>
   <p>Unless our industrial conditions improve considerably, the United States will lose its attraction for immigrants.</p>
