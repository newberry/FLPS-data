   <p>Dr. Wilhelm Cuno, director-general of the Hamburg-American Line, and former chancellor of the German Empire, was welcomed yesterday evening at the Union Station, on his arrival here, en route to Minneapolis where he will attend the International Rotary Convention today. Dr. Cuno is the presidentof the Rotary Club in Hamburg....</p>
   <p>To a representative of the Abendpost, Dr. Cuno spoke only about the Hamburg-American Line, which has lately increased the number of its vessels by taking over different companies, and building new vessels. The latest ship of the line, the St. Louis, will make its first trip to the United States on December 8th. The date for the first trip of the sister ship of the St. Louis, the Milwaukee, is as yet uncertain.</p>
   
   <p>He did not want to express himself about the plans of the big ship owners in regard to aviation. The whole thing has not passed the experimental stage, and therefore it is not opportune to talk about it. Otherwise it can be said of Germany, that conditions are getting better there, although complete recovery is still far off. The German Consul general, Dr. Hugo F. Simon, arranged a short round trip through Chicago, after which Dr. Cuno was a guest at a tea in Dr. Simons home.</p>
