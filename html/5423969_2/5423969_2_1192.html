   <p>p.8..Mr.H. Reindahl, one of the few real violin makers in the United States, is about to leave for Norway on a combined business trip and vacation. During the past two years he has been very busy as the quality of his hand made violins have created such a demand that he has been unable to fill all requests for them. Mr. Reindahl will stop off for a visit with the world renowned violinst Sauret, an old friend, who was also an intimate friend of the composer Edward Grieg.</p>
   <p>In Telemarken, Norway, Mr. Reindahl will purchase age old planks and door posts from which he obtains the perfect wood, perfect in texture, grain and drying, necessary to bring out the wonderful tonal quality his violins are known to possess. Knowing these woods and where to obtain them is a science of which Mr. Reindahl is as real a master as he is in making them into America's finest violins.</p>
