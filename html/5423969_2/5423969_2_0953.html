   <p>The City Council appointed a special committee to inquire into the St. Luke Sanitarium horror. The structure was a condemned hotel building that had been converted into a hospital and partly equipped as a prison, with barred doors and windows, etc. This astounding information and more of a similar character had been brought to light since the horrible calamity in the notorious fire trap, and the Council desired to learn where to place the responsibility for the violation of law that culminated in the loss of so many human lives. The subcommittee summoned Mr. [Peter] Kiolbassa who, at the head of the building inspection department, was supposed to furnish all the information desired. But the building inspector had evidently concluded that his presence was needed elsewhere, for the committee was informed that he had "left the city".</p>

   <p>A great and good building inspector! He knew that the St. Luke Sanitarium was run in gross violation of the laws of the city, or it was his business to know it; he knew that it was one of the worst death traps in Chicago, or it was his business to know it; he, in common with everybody else, had ample reason to fear that some day the unfortunate inmates would be roasted to death in their chains--which actually came to pass; it was his duty to close the establishment and thus prevent a calamity, and he had ample power to do it. But he did not do his duty; he made no use of his power. And when a committee of the City Council calls upon him to learn why the laws are not enforced by his department it is informed that "he has left the city!"</p>
   <p>But we may have the consolation that if this paragon of an officeholder should be elected to another office of trust and responsibility he will certainly return to feed at the new crib.</p>
