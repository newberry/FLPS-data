   <p>Inga Orner, soprano, always a favorite in Chicago and wherever she has appeared, will sing in Chicago in the near future before she starts her western tour. Miss Orner recently appeared in the Pradoy Malecon Roof Garden, in Havana, Cuba, where she was received with the greatest appreciation. We quote from the Havana Daily Post: "Miss Inga Orner's singing was an exceptional musical treat. Her beautiful voice and perfect execution was awarded unstinted praise by Havana's musical critics. In the closing cadenza of the aria from "Lucia," she sang the high F strongly and clearly, a note seldom heard from the human voice. In fact, Inga Orner's high was just one tone higher than could be reached by the great Tettrazini. Her rendition of "My Old Kentucky Home" was the best ever heard in musical and music loving Havana, and though this number was offered as an encore, she was forced to repeat it in its entirety."</p>
   <p>After the concert, Miss Orner was honored at a tea given by Mr. Beaupere, American Minister to Cuba, at his home. Miss Orner is an exception to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>old saying, "a profit is not without honor save in one's own country," as she enjoys the greatest popularity of any of our vocal artists throughout the Chicago colony and Norwegian America in general, and her wonderful personality coupled with her talent will retain for her her well merited popularity.</p>
