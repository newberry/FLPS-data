   <p>The Security Bank of Chicago, rising on the ruins of Milwaukee Avenue State Bank, is one year old today. When the bank was organized there were many who feared for its future, and much criticism was directed against the undertaking. The results of the first year's activity are such, however, as to convince every doubter that the success of the bank is secured, and that so far, things have progressed better than expected.</p>
   <p>The following table gives in figures the story of the bank's progress during the year.</p>

   <p>These figures clearly portray the safe growth of the bank, a steady progress day by day. Mr. J. C. Hansen, the treasurer of the bank, has strong expectations of continued increase in deposits and depositors in the future. The overwhelming majority of depositors are Scandinavians, mostly Norwegians. Also Poles, who most resented the bank's bankruptcy, are beginning to put their money in the bank in spite of the fact that many of their leading men are interested in the management of another bank on Milwaukee Avenue, Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank.</p>
   <p>The vaults of the Security Bank are also widely utilized - to such extent that there is only one bank in Chicago (The First National Bank), exceeding it in this respect.</p>
   <p>The real estate branch is also developing satisfactorily. The officials of the bank are as follows:</p>

   <p>The capital of the bank is $300,000, and the reserve fund is $60,000.</p>
