   <p>These figures clearly portray the safe growth of the bank, a steady progress day by day. Mr. J. C. Hansen, the treasurer of the bank, has strong expectations of continued increase in deposits and depositors in the future. The overwhelming majority of depositors are Scandinavians, mostly Norwegians. Also Poles, who most resented the bank's bankruptcy, are beginning to put their money in the bank in spite of the fact that many of their leading men are interested in the management of another bank on Milwaukee Avenue, Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank.</p>
   <p>The vaults of the Security Bank are also widely utilized - to such extent that there is only one bank in Chicago (The First National Bank), exceeding it in this respect.</p>
   <p>The real estate branch is also developing satisfactorily. The officials of the bank are as follows:</p>
