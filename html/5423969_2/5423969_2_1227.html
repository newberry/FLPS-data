   <p>After Inga Orner's concert in Orchestra Hall some of our "musical" people stated that Miss Orner was a poor singer, etc. She should not pay any attention to these "critics," for notwithstanding [their comments] she will have success--great success.</p>
   <p>She possesses a remarkably clear soprano voice, having perfect control over a full velvety tone which is well suited to such coloratura work as "Ah, Fors E Lui," which she sang. Like Tetrazzini she is utterly lacking in dramatic interpretative power, and songs like Grieg's "Ich Liebe Dich" would fall flat.</p>
