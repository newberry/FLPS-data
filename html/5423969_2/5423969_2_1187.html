   <p>Genius and Solitude, a strange though frequent pair, came to our notice recently. Occasionally one may, in an out-of-the-way corner, accidentally run across an individual who, in everyday life, one catalogues as an ordinary, quiet, unassuming being, performing his daily task with little or no thought of anything but his ordinary needs. Many people of this sort, in the privacy of their own little home or room, think great thoughts, dream great dreams or construct various articles of supreme beauty and worth.</p>
   <p>Such a man it has been our happy lot to visit recently. Away up in an obscure attic room we found one of our countrymen, the young, hard-working, lovable Norseman, Magnus Giovanni Olsen. Mr. Olsen was born in Bergen, Norway, on October 14, 1883. There he first worked as a carpenter's apprentice, then as a journeyman carpenter with the large Abrahamsen Construction Company. Upon his arrival in Chicago he immediately secured work with Lyon and Healy, where <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>he worked nine years. He is now employed by the Regal Instrument Company.</p>
   <p>As one enters his humble room one sees tools, materials, and parts of violins in various stages of completion, stacked on tables, chairs, and boxes, and one wonders how one mind can sort out a complete set of parts for a violin or any other instrument. Mandolins and quitars nearly hide the walls and seem to be crying out for the Salvation Army or some other open-air musicians.</p>
   <p>This workshop, high up among the swallows, is the scene of the transformation of the seemingly insignificant Magnus Giovanni Olsen. Here his shoulders become broader, his back straighter, every movement quick and accurate and his habitual expression, which is almost sad, vanishes behind a beatific smile and a pair of deep expressive eyes that see every detail. Now we have the real Olsen, the genius.</p>
   <p>Very deliberately, as though handling a priceless article of the thinnest glass, he uncovers and hands us a violin that is a symphony of beauty, the most beautifully finished piece of wood we have ever seen. In awe we accept a bow almost <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>fearing to draw it across the strings of this thing of beauty, but at the first note we are entranced with the marvelous perfection of tone, and this from a new violin not yet broken in. Olsen's eyes literally danced as we played on this, his first violin. He calls it his "first born", his child.</p>
   <p>There can be no doubt as to the genius of Mr. Olsen, and we sincerely trust that our observation will awaken the interest of such persons, as may bring this young man and his really wonderful instruments to the attention of artists and the music-loving world.</p>
