   <p>Ole W. Aga, architect, 2501 Kimball Avenue, celebrated his 31st birthday last Saturday, January 6. A host of friends gathered in his home in honor of the occasion, and both Mr. Aga and his good wife were figuratively buried in the avalanche of good wishes of their friends.</p>
   <p>Ole Aga was educated as an engineer in the technical school in Bergen, Norway, and after his graduation took an advanced course at Dresden. After attaining high honors in engineering he took up the study of architecture, a profession which he has followed since his student days.</p>
   <p>Even as a boy he drew attention as a draftsman. Upon his arrival in America he immediately took an examination in architecture, receiving the highest honors. Samples of his work can be seen in Chicago's Kaiserhof. During recent years his work in the Cook County Architectural Department has shown him <span class="page-break">2</span>to be an outstanding man in his line.</p>
   <p>Great responsibilities have been placed upon him at all times (we would especially mention his work on the new County Hospital), and he has carried them through to success in every instance. Mr. Aga is a typical example of Norse energy, idealism, and perseverance, and Scandia wishes him continued success.</p>
