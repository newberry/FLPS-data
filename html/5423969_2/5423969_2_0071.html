   <p>The campaign for the coming primary election is on in full force. Candidates are more than busy (especially those desiring the Mayor's billet) peddling the usual bombastic jargon of their so-called "platforms." On the Democratic side we have Harrison, Dunne and Graham and not one of these has yet made an intelligent statement nor have they advanced a single good reason for their individual nomination. Neither have they advertised their own accomplishments owing to the present mistrust of "big politicians" within the party ranks.</p>
   <p>The only Republican candidate worthy of mention is Charles E. Merriam, alderman of the 7th ward and professor of Social Economics at the University of Chicago. His platform is for "capable administration of the city's affairs in every department"; a laudable aim at any time.</p>
   <p>The Socialist party presents, as a candidate for mayor, a painter named Rodriguez. His platform is that of the Socialist party throughout the world:</p>
   <p>- "The powers of government must be placed in the hands of the worker in order that he may receive the proper benefits resulting from his efforts.".</p>
   
   <p>Certainly no voter who works for a living can find a legitimate objection on the ideals and program of the Workingman's party. Nor can any voter object to the platform of Charles Merriam; as a capable administration of affairs, city, state and national, is the foundation on which government must be built in order that the phrase "government by the people" may again become true and not continue as a synonym for "graft, corruption, and ignorant, inefficient office holders."</p>
