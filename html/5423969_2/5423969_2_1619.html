   <p>Last Monday a young Norwegian-American pianist, James S. Whittaker, made his debut in the Chicago Music Hall. He studied in Berlin and Paris, and has returned to Chicago as a renowned artist.</p>
   <p>His reputation was more than justified by his masterful performance. His playing inspires one involuntarily to think of higher things. We came expecting something out of the ordinary, and out of the ordinary it was in every sense of the word.</p>
   <p>When a mere boy of twenty puts on a concert with Chopin's Sonata in B minor as an opening number and follows this difficult masterpiece with a series of Schumann's compositions, all perfectly played, one realizes that here is an artist with a real musical soul, one who is delving deep into the realms of great music, finding golden nuggets of beauty instead of kicking around in <span class="page-break">2</span>the chaff of today's so-called popular music and finding exactly nothing.</p>
   <p>Chopin, Schumann, Grieg, and Liszt--an array of masters, all interpreted by a young man possessing a rich temperament, deep feeling and an intimate understanding of each individuality. Mr. Whittaker's technique is that of a virtuoso in its power to grasp and hold the heart of a vast audience to such an extent that during a pause in a selection one could have heard the sound of a pin dropping to the floor in the intense silence.</p>
   <p>What a difference when compared to the general run of music, when a pianist must be a magician or a witch in order to satisfy the taste and appetite of a ragtime-maddened twentieth century dance hall and nickel show public. Would that the latter could be eliminated at a stroke and only real music taught those who are musically inclined.</p>
