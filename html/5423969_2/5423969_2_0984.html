   <p>The sewers in Chicago are inadequate; they will not carry the wastes as they should. They should be at least three times the size now being used. They range in size from eight to eighteen inches, but in the case of the thickly populated section on the near North Side and the Northwest Side, the pipes should be at least forty-six inches.</p>
   <p>As usual, our City Fathers forget that Chicago is growing faster than any other city in the world, and that we should plan at least twenty years ahead.</p>
   <p>The sewerage system is also very unsanitary. Most of the epidemics that Chicago has had can be directly blamed on the sewerage system. Our Department of Health should do something besides "play politics." Let them do something constructive, something worth-while. They should wake up.</p>
