He tried his fortune as a sailor and his success as a lake captain was most decided. It did not take him long to sail his own vessel and as time went on he added more vessels to his flotilla. As a commander he was well known among shippers and lake navigators. His vessels generally carried grain from Chicago to Buffalo, or lumber on the upper lakes. His first vessel was "Industry", and he finally owned seven vessels.

He departed this life on April 25, 1891.</p>
