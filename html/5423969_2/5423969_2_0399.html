   <p>Mrs. Julia Walter reports $43,300 subscribed by Norwegian women for the third Liberty Loan. The first meeting to organize Norwegian women for the third Liberty Loan campaign was held at the Chicago Norwegian Club on April 9. About one hundred women were present and subscriptions taken amounted to $10,050. A patriotic Liberty Loan mass meeting was held at the Logan Square Auditorium on April 19 at which $20,250 was subscribed. From April 19 to May 4, subscriptions totaling $12,000 were taken at the homes of the members of the committee.</p>
   <p>My personal appreciation is extended to Mrs. Jacob Bauer for her able assistance, to the young ladies who acted as secretaries, and to the very efficient corps of workers. It was the sincere co-operation of these workers with the Daughters of Norway and the many other patriotic Norwegian women who subscribed through us that made it possible for us to raise $42,300.</p>
