   <p>p.8......The singers' group of the Norwegian Club, at their business meeting on Wednesday elected Mr. Einar Bursum chorus director. Mr. Bursum is, comparatively, a stranger to Chicagoans, but comes well recommended as a musician. He is experienced in both theatricals and opera having studied under Thorwald Lammers for three years before entering upon grand opera; among other roles he was good in "La Tosca." Three years each in Paris and Germany have given him a comprehensive knowledge of vocal music and we predict his success as a chorus conductor. Scandia extends best wishes to conductor and chorus.</p>
