   <p>Rarely, if ever, have Chicagoans heard singing to compare with that of Rolf Hammer, who was heard last night at a concert, given by Mr. Hammer and Odin Renning in Schoenhofen Hall. Many people in the audience may have heard Mr. Hammer as soloist when the students' choirs from Norway were here two years ago, but we know now that those concerts did not do justice at all to his brilliant presentation, and his wonderfully beautiful and well-trained voice. Those who heard him last night will never forget his singing of Sigurd Lies' "Og der var sig en liden gut" (Once Upon a Time There Was a Boy), Grieg's "Den store hvide flok" (The Vast, Bright, Gleaming Throng), and the magnificent "Symra" cycle by Sinding. The compositions of Sinding, Kjerulf, Nordraak, Grieg, and Selmer, and the voice of Rolf Hammer made a brilliantly successful program.</p>
   <p>Many great opera companies have visited Chicago, but not one of them has presented a better male voice than Hammer's. It would not be too much to say that a voice as beautiful and well trained as Hammer's is not to be found in the United States, or least no such voice is widely known.</p>
   <p>Mr. Odin Renning of Milwaukee accompanied Mr. Hammer on the piano; his accompaniments were beautifully played.</p>
