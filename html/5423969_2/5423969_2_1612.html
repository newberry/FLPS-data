   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club, true to tradition, put on its annual concert in April (Wed., Apr. 15th), and true to tradition also, the weatherman furnished the standard brand of Glee Club concert weather; a combination of thunder, lightning, snow, sleet, and rain. Undoubtedly it was the inclement weather that held the attendance down to a mere 600 people, for twice that number was expected.</p>
   <p>Guest artists were Mrs. Aalrud Tillisch, Mrs. Meyer and Mrs. Erhart, vocalists; Mr. Konicny, Bohemian Violin Virtuoso, and Arnt Borsum, pianist. Each of these artists was accorded hearty applause, as their offerings were of the highest class and were well executed.</p>
   <p>The Glee Club, with its forty-seven singers, did not live up to its former excellence many of the members being new and inexperienced. The weather too, may have dampened their spirits, as there was a noticeable lack of spirit and power in both chorus and director.</p>

   <p>Reissiger's "Oday Trygvasson" is an old classic that few choruses can sing properly, and the Glee club was not one of the few on this occasion. Due to the loss of several of the older, more experienced singers, the presentation of this old masterpiece was weak in several passages; but allowing for the absence of the powerful old standbys the presentation was quite creditable. Two Swedish numbers, in a lighter vein were very well sung, and the chorus was forced to re-appear and repent both songs. By the time next years' concert rolls around, the Glee Club will again be one of the foremost male choruses in the country. They have experienced retrogression before, but have eventually won out and reached the top, and they will do it again; it is impossible to keep this chorus down.</p>
