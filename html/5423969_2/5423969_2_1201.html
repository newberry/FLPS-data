   <p>The first all-Nordic symphony concert will be given at Orchestra Hall on November 30, under the direction of Frederik Fredriksen.</p>
   <p>There are several compositions on the program that have never been played in Chicago; for example, the suite "Mester Olof," by for Aulin. Grieg's Pianoforte Concerto in A Minor has probably never been played at a large musical gathering. The well-known pianist Rudolph Reuter will play this exquisite piece. Another composer who is little known here in the West is Ambroise Thomas, who used "Neckans Polka" in his opera "Hamlet".</p>
   <p>The well-selected and well-arranged Nordic program is awaited with interest by Chicago's music-lovers. Have you your ticket? If not, it is just too bad; everything is sold out!</p>
