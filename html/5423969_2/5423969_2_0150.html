   <p>The Honorable Peter Kiolbassa (Pole), building commissioner of the city of Chicago and Democratic candidate for office of treasurer of Cook County, favored the people with a statement explaining his conception of his duties as a public officer.</p>
   <p>"It is none of the public's business how I conduct my office," says Mr. Kiolbassa. "I am responsible to the mayor alone."</p>
   <p>This is laudably brief, pithy, and to the point. The old notion that all public officers are the servants of the people and accountable to them has no place in the political catechism of the commissioner. Should he be elected county treasurer and run his office in defiance of laws and public sentiment his philosophy would <span class="page-break">2</span>furnish a ready-made answer to popular criticism-- "It is none of the public's business how I conduct my office."</p>
