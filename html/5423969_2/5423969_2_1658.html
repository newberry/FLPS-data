   <p>p.7..............Rolf Hammer in "Sangerhilsen" (Greetings to Singers) voices his praise of Chicago's own "Nordmendenes" (Norsemen's Male Chorus) and their proposed visit to Norway to take part in the festivities throughout that country in 1914.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hammer credits this chorus with being this country's outstanding Norwegian male chorus, numerically, musically, traditionally and in point of years of service. He suggested at the National Norwegian Singers League convention at Thief River Fall, Minnesota, during June, that the league, in its entirety, join "Nordmendenes" on their 1914 trip, forming one great massed chorus, with Nordmendenes as the "de luxe" group around which we could demonstrate to all Norway that we Norwegian-Americans know our Norwegian songs and how to sing them. Such a demonstration would be the best evidence that we still love and respect Norway, the land of beauty and tradition.</p>
