   <p>The Skandinaven has received a number of inquiries from voters concerning the relations of Henry C. Payne to the Republican National Committee and the conduct of the present national campaign. One correspondent is under the impression that Mr. Payne was not re-elected to succeed himself on the Committee, while the majority want to know whether he has been placed in charge of the headquarters here in Chicago, the vigorous protest of labor to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
   <p>In reply to the first question it may be stated that Mr. Payne was re-elected to succeed himself as committeeman--in defiance of the clearly and emphatically expressed will of the people. Mr. Payne was one of the four candidates of the Sawyer-Spooner-Payne combine for delegates-at-large, and it was well understood among the Republicans of the State that he is anxious to remain on the Committee.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>But he suffered a crushing defeat in his own home [district], and among all the delegates in the State convention not one could be found who dared to whisper that the repudiated leader be sent as a delegate to St. Louis. John C. Spooner did not lift a finger to save his associate in the receiver business, and--what is still more significant--not even Sawyer, who never was suspected of being fainthearted, had the courage to intervene in the behalf of his faithful lieutenant. The work of the convention was generally approved throughout the State, especially the shelving of Payne.</p>
   <p>But Mr. Payne is a past master at the art of circumventing the will of the people, and snatched at re-election from the delegation in St. Louis. It was pointed out by those members of the delegation who kept faith with the people that his long service as a paid lobbyist for corporations had aroused the wrath of the farmers and workers and that his re-election would be a copious source of weakness to the party. But the thumbscrews were put on by the machine, and Mr. Payne secured another lease to power.</p>
   <p>So much for his continued membership on the Committee.</p>

   <p>The Skandinaven is unable to define the exact nature of Mr. Payne's relations to the national Republican headquarters in Chicago. It is reported at this time that he had been chosen as chairman of the Western headquarters. The labor organizations at once registered protest. Subsequently, rumor had it that his frail health would not permit him to take any active part in the work of the campaign. As regards the charges preferred against him by the workers it is said that he has been exonerated from blame by certain labor leaders in Chicago. But it is asserted by spokesmen of labor that this exoneration was a bare fraud.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hanna and his associates on the National Committee will make a very serious mistake if they disregard the objections to Mr. Payne. There is no reason whatever why his services should be retained at the risk of alienating the farmers and workers. His alleged political generalship is largely a myth, except, perhaps, in his own belief. The battles he has won, a dunce could not have lost, while the reverses the Republicans have suffered in his State are attributable in no small measure to his efforts toward subverting the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>interests of the party to those of the corporations. As a matter of fact, his political spurs have been won mainly on the battlefield of the lobbyist and the buttonholer, in the service of great corporate interests in their efforts to trench upon the rights of the people. As a corporate employer of labor he has incurred the ill will of his employees to an extent that is almost unparalleled. As a lobbyist in the service of Armour he has done his utmost to block legislation designed to protect the farmers against unjust and ruinous competition of bogus butter and cheese. Every dairyman is thoroughly familiar with his record in this respect.</p>
   <p>These are plain facts which cannot be refuted or obscured. It is difficult to conceive why a man so obnoxious to large bodies of voters, should be entrusted with the management of the Republican campaign here in the West. McKinley is popular. Farmers and workers alike admire his sterling qualities, believe in the wisdom of the principles which he represents, and trust his leadership. But Sinbads have broken strong backs before and may do so again. No party can afford to load itself with barnacles, if it desires to retain <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the confidence and love of the people. Mr. Payne may be a gentleman of many qualities; but his character as a private citizen is not in question. What this paper desires to emphasize is that it would be extremely unwise to place Mr. Payne in a conspicuous and responsible position during the present campaign. He would cost the party thousands of votes, where it may need every vote it can possibly get.</p>
   <p>Let your voices be heard; protest, there is still time.</p>
