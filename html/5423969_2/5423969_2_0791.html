   <p>"Republic or Empire" is one of the campaign expressions used most often in the present election struggle. Mr. Bryan uses it frequently, and his adherents still more frequently. People are informed that if Mr. McKinley be re-elected, then the Republic will cease to exist; in its stead we will get the type of government which the Bryanites call "Empire". Mr. McKinley is a dictator now, but if re-elected he will become far more dictatorial. "Imperialism," "militarism," and everything else that is bad will crush the country and the people and there will be no escape. Now all these scarecrow statements do not even have the virtue of being new; they are worn-out things from past generations. Mr. W. J. Bryan frequently refers to sayings by Lincoln, and he employs these sayings in a manner to make the people believe that Mr. Bryan is continuing Lincoln's fight, that he is really Abraham Lincoln the second. But he forgets to inform his listeners that Mr. Bryan's party in attacking Lincoln used the same kind of weapons which Mr. Bryan is</p>

   <p>"We, too, have our emperor, Lincoln, quite capable of telling stale jokes while the country is being drenched with the blood of brothers arrayed against brothers. Were Lincoln to be re-elected, the revolution in America would become complete. Our commonwealth no longer would remain a republic of United States, but a consolidated empire. Every guarantee (for liberty) will disappear sooner or later. The restraint of the executive will no longer be found in the Constitution but only in the will of the President. We plead with patriotic men to stop and consider these matters before casting their votes on the coming Tuesday. Unless our people step forth to save our invaluable Constitution and Union, they are lost forever."</p>
   <p>As we notice, the same rallying cry in 1864 as now. The "anti-imperialists" of those days went somewhat farther in personalities; nobody today will claim that McKinley is an imperialist in order to pay his debt or to fill his coffers. Aside from this, however, the accusations are similar, and even the language is the same. Mr. Bryan and his followers are copying the very worst copperheads from 1864. But the people crushingly defeated this traffic in accusations in 1864, and its sentence this year will be no less decisive.</p>
