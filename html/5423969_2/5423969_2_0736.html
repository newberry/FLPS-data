   <p>A twenty-five year old brakeman, Albert Johnson, was crippled for life because of the "link one pin coupling" in use on all railroad cars. The link and pin coupling should be replaced by the new improved coupling that assures the brakemen of much more safety than the old style.</p>
   <p>The railroads should be forced by law to install all the new equipment possible to promote safety.</p>
   <p>In 1882 hundreds of workers were killed because the railroads believed that human life was cheaper than up-to-date equipment.</p>
   <p>Our State Legislature should pass laws to protect the workers.</p>
