   <p>Conquest and Kultur is the title of a book just published by the government in Washington through the "Committee on Public Information." It contains numerous expressions by Prussia's leading men concerning matters of military, political, and intellectual matters, and from these expressions, a clear understanding may be gained by the spirit, the aspirations, the thoughts which now dominate the Central Powers and make them fit in so excellently with the unspeakable Turk.</p>
   <p>The government of the United States will see to it that this book, collected and edited by professors Notestain and Stoll of the University of Minnesota, will get as wide a circulation as possible in order that no American need remain ignorant of the principles for which or against which our nation is fighting in this war.</p>
   <p>The publishers of the book did not have any lack of material. - - The contents are arranged in seventeen chapters which in the most vulgar way reveal Germany's dream of world conquest, its arrogance, its military dream. The seventeen chapters have headings as follows:</p>
   <p>The Mission of Germany.</p>
   <p>World Power or Downfall.</p>
   <p>The Worship of Power.</p>
   <p>War as a Part of the Divine Order.</p>
   <p>War as the Sole Arbiter.</p>
   <p>Economic Necessity of Expansion.</p>
   <p>Germany, the Ruler of Middle Europe.</p>
   <p>Expansion to the South East.</p>
   <p>Subordination of France.</p>
   <p>Sea Power and Colonial Expansion.</p>
   <p>The Lost Teutonic Tribes.</p>
   <p>Dispossessing the Conquered.</p>
   <p>The Pan-German Party.</p>
   <p>Pan-Germanism and America.</p>
   <p>Pretexts for War.</p>
   <p>The Coming War.</p>
   <p>The Program of Annexations.</p>
   <p>From time to time Skandinaven will present digests of the book's contents, the only way in which we can find space for the material.</p>
