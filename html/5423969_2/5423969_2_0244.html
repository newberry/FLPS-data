   <p>The scandalous passage of the Ogden Gas ordinance during the last days of Mayor Hopkins' incumbency is still remembered by some people in Chicago. The measure was fathered by certain members of the City Council and was railroaded through that body in the most shameless manner. There was no provision whatever for any compensation to the city; it was a boodle measure, pure and simple. But the promoters had a majority in the Council, and Mayor Hopkins interposed no obstacle to the high-handed theft of a valuable franchise.</p>
   <p>The champions of the ordinance promised the people cheap gas, but the company was no sooner fairly established than the pledge was broken. And now they owners have done what they undoubtedly planned to do before they received <span class="page-break">\2</span>the franchise: they have sold out to the People's Gas Company. The purchase price of the property is given as six million dollars. As their cash investment in the plant does not exceed $500,000, it will be seen that the present value of the privilege filched from the city is $5,500,000.</p>
   <p>It appears that the gang of looters consisted of eleven persons, headed by Mayor Hopkins, and including such immaculate citizens as Thomas Gahan, Roger Sullivan, and others of their ilk.</p>
   <p>Are these men being outlawed? Nonsense! They move in the best society, are pillars in their respective churches, are classed as "good citizens", and pose at "reform" meetings as wrathful foemen of boodle, and elequent champions of a purer city government. And the sovereign people applaud them to the echo and are ready to give them fresh opportunities to betray their trust.</p>
