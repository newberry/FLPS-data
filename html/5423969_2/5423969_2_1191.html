   <p>p.4....The public in general,and our Norwegian Colony especially, is invited to inspect the display of Norse art weaving and handiwork. This exhibit will be on display during the next two weeks at Scandia's office. The articles are not on sale, having been made on orders, but are shown as samples,which will be duplicated if desired. The motifs are from paintings by the artist Holmboe, illustrating Norse fairy tales and are worth traveling far to see.</p>
