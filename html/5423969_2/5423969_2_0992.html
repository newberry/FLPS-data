   <p>I have read "Laughing at Veblen" in Scandia's issue of July 9.</p>
   <p>It is not for me to comment on Veblen's science or on his critics. I simply want to ask: What is the use of being the "most learned man in the United States" if fairly well-educated people cannot grasp his range of thought?</p>
   <p>Here is a sample of Thorstein Veblen's style of writing, taken from his book The Place of Science in Modern Civilization:</p>
   <p>"If we are getting restless under taxonomy of a monocotyledonous wage doctrine and a cytogamic theory of interest, with involute, loculicidal, tomentose, and moniliform variants, what is the syptoplasm, centrosome, or karyokinetic process to which we may turn, and in which we may find surcease from the metaphysics of normality and controlling principle?"</p>

   <p>Who can tell simply and clearly what is the meaning of that? We can certainly be proud of having a Norwegian as "the most learned man in the United States"!</p>
