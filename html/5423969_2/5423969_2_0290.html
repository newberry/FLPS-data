   <p>Despite the mouthings and mumblings of certain newspapers and a lot of cheap politicians, the investigations of Kipley's "foinest" by Senator Berry's committee is of great interest to the people of Chicago. The evil effects of the disorganization of the force since Mr. Kipley assumed control of the department have been felt in all parts of the city, but probably nowhere to such an extent as by the 100,000 people residing within the Thirty-second Police Precinct. During the administration of Captain Larsen, of the West Chicago Avenue Station, the police service of the Thirty-second Precinct attained a very high degree of efficiency. He was one of the very best captains of the force; he knew his men and had them well in hand. He also knew the thugs and crooks and had them well under control.</p>

   <p>All this, Mr. Kipley knew as well as anyone else. He knew that the service of the West Chicago Avenue Station could not be improved, and that the best he could do would be to let well enough alone. And yet he proceeded to reduce Captain Larsen to the rank of a lieutenant, and had him transferred to an insignificant post of duty. A large number of efficient and trustworthy patrolmen were likewise removed, and their places were taken by less efficient and more or less untrustworthy men.</p>
   <p>The inevitable results of the Kipley policy were not slow in asserting themselves. The police service in the Thirty-second Precinct was disorganized and at once became all but valueless. Ever since the removal of Captain Larsen, crime has held high carnival in this part of the city. Peaceful citizens are robbed and slugged in front of their very doors by gangs of thugs who are, or at least ought to be, known to the police authorities. After ten o'clock at night partrolmen are conspicuous by their absence on some of the beats where thugs do a particularly flourishing business. But in the corner <span class="page-break">3</span>saloons of this district it is not difficult to discover uniformed guardians of the law, often three or four in one saloon, while the thugs operate in the streets.</p>
   <p>Citizens have complained of this reign of lawlessness and terror, but apparently to no avail. Now that a Senate Committee has turned its flashlight upon the conduct of the police department, the law-abiding people of the Thirty-second Precinct hope that some rays from the light may be cast in their direction. For the present at least, this is their only hope of relief from a scandalous state of affairs due to lack of proper police protection in consequence of the present management, or rather mismanagement, of the police department.</p>
