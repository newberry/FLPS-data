   <p>We learn from Norwegian papers of an unusual honor bestowed upon one of our Chicago Norwegians. Professor Ludvig Hektoen, M. D., has been appointed as foreign and corresponding member of the Christiania Medical Society.</p>
   <p>Such an appointment is rare, indeed, and is one that any man of medicine would be proud to receive. The appointment is evidence of Dr. Hektoen's high standing in medical science and Scandia congratulates him on the honor bestowed.</p>
