   <p>Of the Scandinavian police officers Chief Kipley has fired, about two-thirds are Norwegian, and the rest Danes and Swedes.</p>
   <p>Out of the sixty-one reinstated, only four were Swedes and two Norwegians.</p>
   <p>There are two Norwegian aldermen on the City Council. What have they done, if anything, to reinstate the rest of the suspended Scandinavians? Or, is it true that they cannot or will not do anything?</p>
