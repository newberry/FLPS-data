   <p>There was a capacity crowd and real gala spirit at the concert of the Norwegian Singers League, at Wicker Park Hall, Tuesday evening, Nov. 26. Great preparations had been made, and a great concert was the result. Under the leadership of Emil Bjorn, the five consolidated choruses opened the concert with "Giv Akt." (Be Alert), and we have never heard this number sung in such perfect harmony and volume. Mr. Bjorn, a genius among conductors, seemed to draw the music from his singers with the perfect control and technique of a master organist at a gigantic pipe organ.</p>
   <p>The Glee Club, Professor Alfred Paulsen directing, sang "Solfest," in a manner that was satisfactory to all and proved to the public that the club is progressing. "Nordmendenes" (Northmen), under the leadership of its new director, Nilson Fugle, offered "Serenade ved Strand Bredden" (Serenade at the Sea Shore), but it fell short of expectations.</p>

   <p>The chorus and soloist seemed unable to co-operate fully, and although Henry Anderson has a beautiful, mellow, baritone voice, he failed to put the feeling into his solo that this part calls for. Bjorguin did better with "Vaar" (Spring), by Sigurd Lie, under the able leadership of the veteran director, Professor Joel Mossberg. The chorus of "Den Norske Klub" sang "Nokken" (River Sprite), by Kjerulf, with the director, E. Borsum as soloist. It was very well rendered in spite of the absence of many members.</p>
   <p>As the united choruses again took the stage, an announcement was made that this would be Emil Bjorn's last performance as director of the Singers' League. As Mr. Bjorn who has tendered his resignation, stepped onto the stage, he was showered with flowers from the audience. Mr. Thorstensen spoke of the long and efficient service of Mr. Bjorn, and as a token of gratitude, presented him with an enormous bouquet of American Beauties, tied with long streamers of wide silk, red, white and blue ribbon. Following the presentation, <span class="page-break">3</span>the league sang Professor Paulseu's "Sangen Har Lysning" (Song Has A Radiance). The deep emotion of this magnificient composition was brought out as we have never heard before, due, it is believed, to the felling aroused by the tribute to Mr. Bjorn. Scandia heartily joins the league in saying: "Thank you, Emil Bjorn, and good luck".</p>
