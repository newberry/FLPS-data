   <p>The new National Party, a political organization accepting all the principles advocated by Prohibitionists, Progressives, Social Democrats, and Single Taxers, was organized Thursday evening. The party will be launched formally this coming year at a national convention, probably in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The platform of the party contains the following planks: Government ownership of public utilities and control of natural sources of supply; abolition of land monopolies through a gradual increase in taxes on land values; absolute prohibition of all traffic in intoxicating liquors except for religious or industrial purposes; and adoption of an amendment to the constitution concerning universal suffrage.</p>
   <p>The meeting authorized the national chairman and the conference chairman to name a committee of twenty, - four from each participating group, - to look after the interests of the party until the convention in 1918.</p>

   <p>In addition to the platform, the meeting adopted a "declaration of the principles of the war," held in the most patriotic and loyal terms, at the same time striking a blow for freedom of speech and of the press. Secret diplomacy was frowned upon.</p>
