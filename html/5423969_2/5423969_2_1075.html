   <p>A new Norwegian business enterprise has just been incorporated in Chicago, with a capitalization of $100,000. The firm will deal exclusively in imported Scandinavian products. The president of the firm is Mr. John Ouse, for twelve years authorized agent for the Swedish Produce Co., and the secretary is Oscar Peterson, who for many years was with O. Thorp &amp; Co. This is the concern that, during the world's fair in 1893, brought Norwegian sailing vessels, with cargoes of herring, directly to Chicago for the first time. The new importers will be the only Norwegian firm of its kind in Chicago since the days of Thorp &amp; Co. Mr. Ouse leaves Chicago next week on a purchasing trip to Scandinavian countries. Scandia and the entire Norwegian colony of Chicago join in wishing the Norwegian Importers, Inc. every success.</p>
