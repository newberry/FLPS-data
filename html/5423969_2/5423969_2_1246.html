   <p>Ole Theobaldi, Norwegian violinist, writes that he has survived his Mexican concert tour in spite of Diaz, revolutionists, and fascinating senoritas, and is now touring Texas, where he is proving successful both musically and financially. On Dec. 24 he will pay a flying visit to Chicago to complete arrangements for a concert he has agreed to give on Jan. 15, 1913, for the benefit of the 1914 Norway tour of the Norwegian American Singers.</p>
