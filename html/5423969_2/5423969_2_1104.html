   <p>The firm Mathisen &amp; Christensen, painters of iron structures, is now the largest of its kind in the United States. This company has just reached a new milestone in its road of progress. Because of certain large contracts which it has just entered into, the firm can now claim the distinction of being the largest of its kind in the entire country. And this is due to the ability and energy of two Norwegians who arrived empty-handed in this country only a few years ago.</p>
   <p>Three years ago there was quite a stir when the Mathisen &amp; Christensen Company received the contract to paint the great elevated railroad system of the South Side. How big this contract was may be understood when one learns that the job was just recently finished, although more than fifty men worked at the task steadily.</p>
   <p>The Mathisen &amp; Christensen Company now employs about one hundred painters. The president of the firm is Mr. George Mathisen and its secretary is Mr. A. Christensen.</p>

   <p>The other day Mr. Christensen went to Pierre, South Dakota, where the firm has contracted to paint an immense railroad bridge crossing the Missouri River. The bridge belongs to the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad. The work is to be completed by November 15. The firm also has painting contracts with several other railroads.</p>
