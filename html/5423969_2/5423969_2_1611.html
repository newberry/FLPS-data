   <p>Nordmendenes (Horsemen's Male Chorus), Thursday evening held a special rehearsal of the proposed festival song for the 1914 festivities in Norway. The words are by our own Dr. Anders Doe and the music by Mr. Carlson director of the chorus. The chorus is endeavoring to have this number included in the new song book, and they plan to sing it when they visit Norway during the centennial celebration.</p>
