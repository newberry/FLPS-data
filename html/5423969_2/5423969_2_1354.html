   <p>p.5. Mrs. Marie Lokke-Mathiesen, prominent among Norwegian-American artists, especially in Chicago, has during the past summer spent her time in Massa-chusetts. Mrs. Lokke-Mathiesen has the honor of having no less than seven of her paintings on exhibition at the Chicago Art Institute at present. The paintings are all scenes from the "The Coast of Maine," and are very realistic views of high cliffs, breakers and gigantic waves. So real are the pictures that one can almost hear the roar of the breakers and feel the salty spray as the waves dash against the rock bound coast. This style of painting is to be her specialty, and those of our colony who were born in Norway will enjoy these pictures which remind one so strongly of Norway's rugged coast line. Chicago's Norwegians are especially urged to view these excellent paintings by one of our own artists.</p>
