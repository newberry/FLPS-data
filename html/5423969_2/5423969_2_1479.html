   <p>A pleasant surprise it was to have an opportunity once more to listen to Skald Singing Society.</p>
   <p>Rolf Hammer, the opera soloist, has breathed new life into the club, and it was a singing society very much alive and with an inspiring leader, which last Sunday sang its way straight into the hearts of the audience. Enthusiasm prevailed the whole evening, and the singers were applauded again and again.</p>
   <p>Rolf Hammer's brilliant tenor filled the large hall; Ruth Engedahl gave splendid piano accompanyment; Rogna Colfurr's voice was rich and warm, with a professional touch. The concert suggested harmonious unity which promises well for the future.</p>
