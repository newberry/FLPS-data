   <p>Above everything else, the great City of Chicago needs a real mayor. Whatever our city may do in the next two years by way of preparation for the World's Fair; whatever adornments this "Lady of the Lake" may wish to put on in order to receive and entertain the nations of the world properly, as her guests, Chicago will be molded by the judgment and guided by the hand of its chief magistrate. Some fair officials are to be chosen. There never was a greater opportunity for the city and for the mayor, and there never was a greater peril in a false move. The exigency is with us and must be met.</p>
   <p>But while consideration of this special exigency may be a good leverage for lifting the burden of misgovernment under which we are groaning and which is arousing the citizens to a new sense of responsibility, it is by no means the only or the sole reason for prompt and decisive action. Every consideration of honor and decency, every desire for the moral and physical well-being of the masses of our vast and growing population, as <span class="page-break">\2</span>well as a due appreciation of the influence of this great metropolis upon the life of the whole interior of our country politically, socially and industrially, should prompt all citizens to a united effort in rising to the height of our opportunity and responsibility.</p>
   <p>The whole world knows that misgovernment of our cities is the blight and blemish attached to American institutions. We have finally become conscious of it ourselves, for it is daily confessed by our press and periodicals, by our best informed and most thoughtful men. This is a good omen, presaging eventual action. The serious and sober elements will not tolerate this great peril and shame to be treated as a subject for raillery and jest. A remedy must be found and applied. And why should it not be done now? Why should not Chicago add this also to her glory? In her youth and vigor it should have crushed the hundred-headed Hydra of municipal misgovernment and destroyed it before it had poisoned her vitals. Why should not Chicago, this "Queen of the Lakes," in grateful recognition of the honor that has been conferred upon her, and in receiving the crown which the entire country has placed upon her brow, herself add this central jewel to the crown by <span class="page-break">\3</span>purging herself of her filth and setting a worthy example of municipal reform? Could any aim be loftier? Can any action, any effort be more certain of a reward?</p>
   <p>The task is too great to be achieved at a single stroke, but it can be begun at once. A good beginning is half of the whole undertaking, but a piecemeal, timid beginning is an invitation to failure. This is not the way Chicago is wont to do things in business and industrial undertakings. Why should it not prove itself worthy of its character and reputation in the more essential concern of municipal regeneration as well?</p>
   <p>This is not the field for party politics; Republican, Democratic, Mugwump, Prohibitionist and Socialist--every shade of political faith--is confessedly of one opinion in this most essential matter. They have been so for some time, but when the moment for decisive action arrives, the reformers timidly fold their hands, and the grinding, fatal movements of the political machine are heard in every camp. Shall this be repeated in the year 1891? If not, how must it be avoided?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It should be avoided by the simple process of choosing a [suitable] man for mayor. He should be a man, not simply a cog in the gearing of a political machine. Chicago can furnish a regiment of such men, who are not representative of the worse, but of the better elements. [We need]a man who cannot afford to sell himself for money or notoriety to a combination of men whose character and occupation is a source of filth; a man who has something to lose when he allies himself with immoral elements and becomes the tool of gamblers and brothel owners. A man, whose strength of purpose and decision of character, when tested, will find support in the sympathy and co-operation of high-minded citizens. This is the beginning and the all essential first step in the upgrade movement. It ought not to be very difficult. It is not necessary to search the back alleys with a lantern for such a man. It is not necessary that his fingers should be covered with the dirt of the workshop or that he should wear silk stockings. Outward appearance, which is often thought necessary to win certain classes of voters, may safely be placed in the background. The simple question to be asked is: Is he a man? Is he a man with permanent interests, who is devoted to the city? Is he a man whose <span class="page-break">\5</span>capacity for affairs has been tested? Finally, is he a man who cannot afford to desert the standard of good morals and clean goverment, who will reflect credit upon the best character and intelligence of the community and, who, two years hence, can be re-elected and enter the period of the World's Columbian Exposition with experience and with assurance?</p>
   <p>We think that such a man, no matter what his creed is, politically or religiously, will be supported by the majority of our citizens; a majority, with whose support it is safe for such a man to meet any emergency.</p>
   <p>We will not attempt to name the man, but, for the sake of illustration, we will name some men, whom we think, popular judgment will recognize as answering to our postulates. Would not the best interests of the city be safe while the reins of government are in the hands of such men among the Republicans as: John M. Smyth, T. W. Reck, Victor F. Lawson, a Dane, or S. E. Gross, [(the largest real estate and tax shark in the '80's and '90's) -Translator's note]; and among Democrats: E. M. Phelps, John R. Walsh, William D. Kerfoot, A. H. Revell, E. S. Dreier, Max Henius, the latter two <span class="page-break">\6</span>being of Danish descent.</p>
   <p>The election of aldermen must be placed on the same basis. Reform is as imperative in this field as it is in the executive [branch].</p>
   <p>Let the city take such a step now, with earnestness and unwavering purpose, and it will have fulfilled that condition of success which is necessary in order to pluck the fruit the moment it is ripe. The political bosses might be left at the parting of the ways and the McDonalds and Sullivans, or whatever their names may be, would find themselves out of a job. But the honest citizens would breathe freely again and take heart. Moreover, our streets, which are slippery with mud and reeking with nauseating odors from the business center to every corner would be cleaned. The moral filth, too, would be prevented from flouting itself with brazen effrontery in our thoroughfares. When our million visitors leave us, after the great fair, they will retain pleasant memories instead of disgust and regret. It cannot be repeated too often that correct views on the tariff and silver <span class="page-break">\7</span>legislation will not restrain the saloon, overturn gambling tables, close the brothels, clean our streets or purify our atmosphere. It is also safe to assume that the foreign elements in our population will offer their support in such a movement in a way that will cheer the hearts of all good citizens. But the movement must be led and led by men of courage and with spirit of self-sacrifice and patriotism.</p>
