   <p>Not always do Norwegians in Norway acknowledge the contribution by Norwegian Americans,in art, literature, or culture in general. Of late years a change has taken place in this situation; as an example of this change, may be mentioned the ovation given our Chicago composer, Alfred Paulsen, when in the great music hall of the Exposition in Christiania, Norway, he directed his composition, "When the Fjords light in color." It is probable that never had a Norwegian musician received a similar ovation.</p>
   <p>Professor Paulsen will give a concert in the Bethel Church on Oct. 27. There should not be a vacant seat at that concert. Composer Alfred Paulsen is an honor to the Norwegians. Let us honor him at his concert!</p>
