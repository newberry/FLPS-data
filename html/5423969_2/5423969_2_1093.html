   <p>The Security Bank of Chicago, Milwaukee Avenue and Carpenter Street, is now four years old. In the four years of its existence the Bank has prospered, probably more than any bank on the Northwest Side. Today the deposits total $2,700,000.</p>
   <p>The success of the institution is due to the excellent management of Mr. J. C. Hansen, the cashier, who has been with the Bank since it opened its doors four years ago. Mr. [E. A.] Erickson, the president, has also been with the Bank since its organization. As we know, Mr. Erickson served as cashier at the First National Bank for twelve years where, no doubt, he became the efficient banker that he is today.</p>
   <p>The Bank was organized on October 8. 1906, by Mr. James Forgan, president of the First National Bank. Mr. Thorvald Johnson is on the board of directors.</p>
