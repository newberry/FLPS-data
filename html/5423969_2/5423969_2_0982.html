   <p>The Health Department tells you to boil your drinking water before you use it. The Water Department should use disinfectants in the water, because the people do not want to go to the trouble of boiling the water. This would prevent much of the disease that is spread here in Chicago. Every time we have an epidemic, we can always trace it either to the water or the sewerage system.</p>
   <p>Our aldermen should do something about this. They make so many promises before election without keeping any of them, so let them begin now to do something for the voters.</p>
   <p>Another thing, the water pressure is so low that it seldom reaches the fourth story unless an additional pump is installed in the building. In the summer time, when many faucets are left running, it is nothing unusual not to be able to get water on the second floor.</p>

   <p>The voters should petition the City Council to have the Health Department run the City Water Works, and demand that the city water be disinfected or sterilized so that it will not carry germs of all kinds to the users.</p>
   <p>The voters can and must demand; if they do not, they will never get what they want or what they need.</p>
