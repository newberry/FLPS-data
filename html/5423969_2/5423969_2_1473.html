   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club celebrated its thirtieth anniversary last Sunday.</p>
   <p>On April 30, 1889, eight musical Norwegians met at the home of John P. Dahl, 46 Bismarck Court, to discuss the possibility of organizing a new singing society. Among the eight men were J. P. Dahl, Martin Wold, John Neersard, and Robert Korsan. Robert Korsan became the first director. It was first decided that the society should be a double quartet, but in May, 1889, the singing group was increased to 16 voices.</p>
   <p>In September 1889, the Society was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois. On December 28 of the same year, it gave its first public concert, at Fribergs Opera House, under the auspices of the Swedish society Iduna.</p>
   <p>In 1900 the glee club went on a trip to Norway. In 1903 the club organized <span class="page-break">2</span>The Northwestern Scandinavian Singers' Association, which later became The Northwestern Danish-Norwegian Singers' association.</p>
