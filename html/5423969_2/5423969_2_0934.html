   <p>To have and to hold health is our divine heritage. There is no greater wealth than health. Our efforts should be directed intelligently to obtain the blessed state of health and harmony. All else is secondary to mental alertness and physical perfection. Let us take full advantage of Nature's abundant gifts, thus adding years to life, and life to years.</p>
   <p>Let us be temperate in all things. Keep our thoughts clean, blood red, muscles hard, digestion good, body erect, nerves steady. Work with a will to do; play when the work is through. Build on a foundation of contentment and goodness. Establish a reserve fund of health and happiness, for a health reserve is more important than a wealth reserve.</p>
   <p>All these things are within the reach of everyone, but the knowledge that <span class="page-break">2</span>they exist has been made possible by the use of these columns. We extend to you, our readers, and your dear ones, our very best wishes for healthy bodies and a happy home--the fruitage of right doing and right living.</p>
   <p>May these blessings accompany you during the year 1927.</p>
