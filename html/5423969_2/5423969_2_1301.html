   <p>The Standard American Instructor for the Mandolin was prepared by Christian Nilsson, of Chicago, Illinois, for self-instruction and for use by teachers. The mandolin instructor here offered with all its various drawings and plans of the mandolin, its finger board, etc., is unquestionably the most practical and most easily understood mandolin instructor obtainable. Any person of average ability should be able by means of this instructor to learn the playing of the mandolin in a month's time.</p>
   <p>The mandolin instructor may also be used as a manual for those wishing to play the violin, since the methods of using the fingers are similar for the two instruments in question. Players of the violin and of the mandolin can find no better selection of pieces than that brought together in this book, that is, if popular pieces are wanted.</p>
