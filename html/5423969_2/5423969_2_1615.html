   <p>On Sunday, March 8th, Bjorgvin's hall was filled to capacity for the concert given to raise funds for an electric bread-machine for the Children's Home. It is a source of pride to our colony to note the willingness to help when-ever an appeal is made for funds for our orphan and aged people's homes; our people always make good.</p>
   <p>Vocal and instrumental numbers on the program were exceptionally well-executed and the artists were thoroughly appreciated.</p>
