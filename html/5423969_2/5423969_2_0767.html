   <p>Half a century will soon have elapsed since Abraham Lincoln, the foremost and greatest son of the Republic, was laid in his grave. But when we look into his serious face where sorrows and cares have cut their deep writing, he is close to us once more; his deep eyes are scanning our souls; our hearts are beating full and warm in love and gratitude for what he has accomplished. And not the least so in our days when a man's money is his god; it is a refreshing bath for our minds to bury ourselves in Lincoln's life and activity.</p>
   <p>Straightforward in thought and in action, simple in his habits, plain and on the level in all his behavior--yet his life presents one of the most intense dramas known to history. He stepped forth from the ranks of the people just when our country needed him--him and nobody else--to meet a crisis which had to be solved <span class="page-break">\2</span>for the salvation or the downfall of our country. During the dark years of the Civil War when defeat was followed by defeat, when doubt and fear were clutching the hearts of the people, when difficulties rose up about him, the one greater than the other--in those dark days he stood strong and wise and patient in the midst of the storm, certain of ultimate victory because he was sure of the justice of his cause. And when at last victory was won, when those who had been enchained had been set free and the unity of the Republic secured--"then he fell, the one man."</p>
   <p>History knows of no drama more tense than this. He seemed created for the work he was to do. Even though his contemporaries could not always see this, those of the following age have seen it; they have seen that in clearness of vision and in ability he rose high above his contemporaries. He was a prominent lawyer, and his historic debate with Douglas shows that even at that time he saw what had to come; he was fully aware also of the road to be traveled.</p>

   <p>After he had assumed the presidency it did not take long for men such as Seward and Chase to bow to his clearer vision, his deeper insight in the most difficult questions. Yet, though endowed with the richest of mental gifts and having been educated in the great school of life, he could not have done his great deed except for the fact that his roots were in the broad layer of the people. He came from one of the poorest of pioneer's cabins in the far west of that day, and he led in every way the life of the days of the pioneer families.</p>
   <p>From his own experience he knew what struggles the people had to undergo; what the people were thinking; what the people were wanting. From the very cradle as it were, he received also the deep earnestness, the melancholy, which is the result of strenuous labor where man is alone; and on the other hand, the refreshing, human, frequently rather raw humor which is so characteristic of the people in this country. On account of these facts he was able to speak to the hearts of the people as no one else could do. The awakening conscience of the people <span class="page-break">\4</span>obtained its voice in this man, and when he saw and declared that the "Republic cannot exist half slave and half free" he expressed the common-sense opinion of the plain people--the opinion and conviction which it became his lot to lead to victory and to seal with his own blood.</p>
   <p>Lincoln stands alone in history. The world has seen many great statesmen who have won the admiration of their own times and of subsequent times, but none have won the love of the people in such measure as Lincoln. "The Father of his country" was "the first in peace, the first in war, and the first in the hearts of his countrymen." But there is an exclusiveness in the aristocratic chill of the person of George Washington. Lincoln was as great as he, as a man, as a human being, as a statesman; yet he is very close to us. We can yet feel that his great, warm heart had room for all the woe and sadness in the country; he attracts us; the blood surges through our veins more quickly as we behold his face, and our eyes grow moist as we watch the varied scenes of his life passing by. His power of attraction is something that seems to approach the power of <span class="page-break">\5</span>the religious.</p>
   <p>Let us give to our children our own memory of Lincoln as an inheritance. It has truly been said that as long as Lincoln is living in the hearts of the people, so long is the Republic safe.</p>
