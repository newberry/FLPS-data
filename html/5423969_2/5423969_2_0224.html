   <p>The fire in the Henning and Speed building, 125 Dearborn Street, resulted in the loss of many lives. Had the building been properly equipped with fire escapes these lives would have been saved. The absence of every means for saving life in case of fire was a flagrant violation of existing laws and ordinances: the owners, the lessees, the building inspector, and assistants assigned to this particular district, and the head of the city administration are all guilty of criminal negligence.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harrison and Mr. McAndrews admitted that the law had not been enforced. They even admitted that no serious effort had been made to enforce the law either in this or similar instances. Mr. Harrison pleaded lack of funds, and Mr. McAndrews lack of men and flaws in the law. The building inspector said that he could not enforce the law with his present force, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>Mr. Harrison asserted that the means available for the purpose would not permit any increase in the force. Neither gentleman tried to explain why the two had kept these important facts to themselves or why they had made no efforts to place the building inspection department upon a footing that would enable it to discharge its duties. They had full official knowledge of the fact that nearly every building used for manufacturing purposes was a fire trap; yet they confessed with flippant nonchalance that they had suffered a condition to exist that is a constant menace to the lives of tens of thousands of workers; that for years this condition had existed and that in spite of this they had given no word of warning to the public.</p>
   <p>Citizens who are still hugging the notion that laws are made to be enforced and that a mayor is elected to uphold the laws and not to supervise their violation, were surprised, not to say shocked at the manner and matter of the admissions by Mayor Harrison and his building inspector. But the present achievement of the inspector is, if anything, more surprising. Says one of the pet organs of the Harrison administration:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"Work to compel the owners of downtown buildings to provide safe exits from basements in case of fire or panic is now being conducted by the city department of buildings. The inspectors, securing the names of owners and agents of structures not supplied with fire escapes and shafts. are reporting scores of violators daily, and many new cases have been forwarded to the law department with instructions to prosecute. A number of those already arrested have called at Building Commissioner McAndrews' office and told him that they would comply with the requirements of the law if the cases were dropped. A few have been stopped upon the payment of costs."</p>
   <p>Can such things be possible? What has become of the flaws in the law? Has Mr. McAndrews plugged them up himself, since nobody else has done it?</p>
   <p>How is it that inspectors who, before the fire in the Henning and Speed building, were unable to discover a single breach of the law, now can report "scores of violators daily"? Has the force been increased in the proportion of none to scores a day? And how does the Mayor explain this <span class="page-break">\4</span>sudden activity? Where or how did he secure the necessary means?....</p>
   <p>These questions and many more along the same line are justified by a comparison of the explanations and excuses offered by the Mayor and his building inspector a few weeks ago with the present activities of the building inspector's department. If Mr. Harrison and Mr. McAndrews could not enforce the law before, how is it that they can enforce it now? And, on the other hand, if they can enforce it now, why did they not enforce it until their wilful and criminal neglect had cost a number of lives?</p>
   <p>They stand convicted by their own actions. Meanwhile nothing has been done to mete out justice to those who are guilty of the unnecessary loss of human lives. Is the law to be permitted to sleep in this instance also? Or is murder and manslaughter not a crime if the victims happen to be poor workers, while those who are responsible for their death happen to be important public officials or owners of profitable buildings?</p>
