   <p>The mayor has made his new appointments for the Board of Education. In place of Mr. Helge A. Haugan we find the name of George E. Adams, a very honorable gentleman, no doubt. But by this appointment the present mayor has broken a long-established principle, viz: to have a representative of the Scandinavian nationalities as a member of the board. We confess that we fail to see any good reason for thus deviating from an old tradition, if not a rule.</p>
   <p>A few months ago, when Mr. Haugan was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Mr. Robert Lindblom who had just resigned, Mayor Swift's new choice was greeted with the unanimous applause of the whole Scandinavian press, Swedish papers as well as Norwegian and Danish declaring in no uncertain terms that a better man could not have been selected.</p>
   
   <p>We do not think that any mayor would have asked a gentleman of Mr. Haugan's standing to serve for a few months of an unexpired term, if it had not been well understood that he would be reappointed. Now, therefore, we may well ask: What is up? Has not Mr. Haugan shown himself to be an efficient member of the board? Is there a vote or an action of his open to blame or suspicion? Or, has he shown too much independence of character to suit the mayor?</p>
   <p>Mr. Haugan is not the kind of man to solicit an appointment for himself, and our people did not for a minute entertain any idea that the mayor intended to drop him after a few month's honorable and faithful service and thus violate a long-established rule, one which he has himself lately affirmed in public, in the case of Mr. Strong, viz: that it would be an insult to a gentleman to appoint him for a short term, and then fail to reappoint him. Hence no delegation called on the mayor in the usual way. But we are told that some one, having heard of the mayor's contemplated action, made the suggestion that it might not be the right thing thus to slight both a very prominent member of the community and a great number of the voters, foreign-born, but nevertheless good and true American citizens, whose representative Mr. Haugan was. To this the mayor answered: "Ah, well, these people will vote the Republican ticket anyway."</p>
   <p>By such an answer the mayor gave a full measure of himself as a politician. We have not much more to say but that he undoubtedly was correct in his statement. "These people" will vote the Republican ticket anyway, and in so doing they feel satisfied that they will never again be called upon to vote for the present mayor.</p>
