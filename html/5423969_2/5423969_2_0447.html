   <p>That is a Liberty Bond which it is not only your privilege but your duty to buy. It is a duty which every man should regard as the highest privilege.</p>
   <p>We cannot all serve in the ranks of the army, but every man and woman with a spark of patriotism in his or her soul can serve in this glorious cause, the cause of service represented by the Liberty Loan. Have you considered the value of a Liberty Bond?</p>
   <p>It is better than cash in your pocket; it will do more for you than actual dollars. The bond is worth its face value; it can be borrowed on practically up to its full value; it can be sold above par; and if held by you it will pay you your per cent interest. Money in the bank will not do that.</p>
