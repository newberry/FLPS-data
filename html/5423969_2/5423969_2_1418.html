   <p>"Modest and unassuming," describes Olav Thorshong, who at present is putting on exhibitions of one of the most strenuous and difficult of folk dances; the Norwegian Hallingdans, a dance which originated in the Halling Valley in Norway.</p>
   <p>The crowning movement of this dance is a combination of a high-jump and a high-kick that in suppleness and height would put our vaudeville high-kickers to shame.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thorshong is the national champion of Norway. He bounces into the air like a lively rubber ball, twists and picks a hat from the end of a stick held high by an assistant, and lands squarely on both feet. He never misses his mark.</p>
   <p>He is accompanied by Nels Borge, a young violinist, who is an expert in Norwegian folk-dance music as well as a good performer of Norse descriptive music. Mr. Borge's rendition of "The Girl At The Cradle" and "Dells of St. Thomas," is beautiful.</p>
