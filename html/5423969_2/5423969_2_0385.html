   <p>We feel in regard to the League of Nations that the proposed amendments to the treaty should be voted down since the country is more interested at the present time, we believe, in getting back upon a peace basis than in any other question. This does not mean that the League is in every respect satisfactory; but we cannot get on peace terms with Germany until the treaty of peace is ratified by the Senate. It strikes us that all other considerations should be subordinated to the supreme concern of getting back upon a peace basis. The League itself contains provisions for its amendment and for the withdrawal of any country from it, if it so desires, upon two years notice.</p>
   <p>The fear that England will dominate the League is, to our mind, ridiculous. We do not believe that Canada, South Africa, or Australia would be any more <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>inclined to go with England than with the United States in case of a controversy involving the democratic form of government. We think Senator Nelson takes the right position.</p>
   <p>Another thing that ought to have some bearing on our attitude toward the League is the fact that the Allied Powers are indebted to the United States for money loaned them to the amount of over nine and one-half billions. Of this, Great Britain owes $4,316,000,000; France, nearly $3,048,000,000; Italy, over $1,610,000,000; and Belgium, $343,445,000. The indebtedness of smaller countries brings the total to $9,672,272,568. We have obtained these figures from the Springfield Republican, of Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>
   <p>It strikes us that there is too much of an effort being made to create trouble between England and the United States. If we desire to have a republican repudiation of this indebtedness, we can take no straighter course than to court disagreement with our former allies.</p>

   <p>We can say this without endorsing the President's course. We certainly do not endorse it in regard to domestic affairs.</p>
