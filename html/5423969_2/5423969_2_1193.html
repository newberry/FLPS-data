   <p>P.6... Miss Hildur Alness, of North Sawyer Ave., is a recent arrival from Norway. The young lady is an expert in a handicraft that does not enjoy the deserved popularity here that it does in Norway. Samples of her art in silk and velvet are on display in Scandia's Book and Music department.</p>
   <p>The monotonous sameness of machine made copies of the old art of hand weaving, embroidery, painting, etc. tends to create a renewed interest in and appreciation for the real art of the hand made articles.</p>
   <p>Miss Alness announces her intention of personally making to order such articles of handicraft as may be desired in special costumes, pillow tops, scarfs, etc. We assure our public that each article will be a real work of art executed by a real artist.</p>
   <p>Handicraft, known in Norway as HUS-FLID, " is in the Scandinavian countries a source of pride to individual and community. Several sections of Norway are especially noted for the beauty of a certain product as, for instance <span class="page-break">\2</span>SELBA for its hand knitted mittens of special black and white design, and HARDANGER for its exquisite hand embroidery; neither of these have ever been, even with partial success, duplicated by machinery.</p>
