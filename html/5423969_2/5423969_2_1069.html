   <p>Chicago, a fairy-tale city, where our Norwegian peasant and our youth of the working class have made good! Listen to a few tales, some of them strange, but [all] true.</p>
   <p>In 1858 a youngster, Helge A. Haugan, came to America with his parents, where he almost immediately became an apprentice in the fine art of laying tile. But Helge had other plans; he founded a bank, small, very small to begin with, but today it has assests of more than $30,000,000. After Helge's death his brother, Hauman G. Haugan, took over the bank, and Helge's son, Oscar Haugan, became Norwegian Consul in Chicago. This position is neither a pleasure nor a source of profit, for Oscar has to pay his secretary, his office rent, yes, even the cost of paper and ink out of his own pocket.</p>
   <p>Or let us take Anders P. Johnson, who came to Chicago as a youth, took a job as <span class="page-break">2</span>carpenter's apprentice, and later founded a chair factory that today is the largest in the world of its kind. Or take Christian Jevne, who came to Chicago without a cent in his pocket and started a retail grocery store that today is one of the largest in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Yes, we find Norwegian names in every walk of life. For instance, Jens I. M. Hansen, librarian at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>P. A. Thorp was the first man to charter a steamer, load it with Norwegian goods from Norway, and have this ship unload its freight in the Chicago river.</p>
   <p>Or let us stop in "Scandinavia," on North Avenue between Western and California Avenues. Over the store windows we see such names as Henriksen [Dane], Petersen [Dane], Ulvestad [Norwegian], Fossum [Norwegian], Baker Hansen [Dane], Bookdealer Lund [Norwegian], Revyen (The [Danish] Review), and any number of Scandinavian doctors in their second-floor offices, outstanding among them all--</p>
