   <p>p.7. The home of Dr. Bugge, at 3232 Warren Avenue, was filled with musicians and music lovers last Sunday. The occasion was a musical soiree arranged by the great Norwegian-American pianist Sophie Bull. Miss Bull delivered a short, though intensively educational talk on Chopin and the evening's program was devoted to interpretations of the works of Chopin; it was a Chopin evening.</p>
   <p>Appearing in specials were Anna Fostrud, a former pupil of the famous Erika Nissen; Hugo Tuckelmann, a pupil of Leschetizky, and the composer Segart Hoffland.</p>
   <p>Among the guests were Dr. Henry I. Leviton, the Russian physician; the musical and literary enthusiast Dr. Mrs. Beckstrom; Miss Ray, pianist ( a daughter of Olaf E. Ray), and many others. It was a truly cosmopolitan gathering and should serve as a pattern for many of a like nature.</p>
