   <p>The Central Manufacturing Company is the largest manufacturer of office desks in Chicago and is entirely composed of Scandinavians. The president, Mr. Nils Anderson, has been engaged in the manufacture of furniture for the past forty years; in fact, he is one of the pioneer furniture manufacturers of Chicago. The secretary, Mr. Alf. Norman, has been connected with the Company since 1899.</p>
   <p>At the present time furniture making constitutes so large an item in Chicago industrial output, and Chicago's large enterprises in that trade are so many and so strong, as to bar from special notice any concern not exceptional either in magnitude or character.</p>
   <p>Exclusion on this count however, does not touch the Central Manufacturing Co., whose huge factory at 37-41 Armour Street produces the most complete and salable assortment of roll-top and flat-top office desks and office furniture in the West.</p>
