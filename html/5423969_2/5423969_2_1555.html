   <p>Last night the Bjorgvin Singing Society held its first concert in the newly remodelled Bjorgvin Hall. Ole Bull's relatives had presented the Society with a piano that had once belonged to Ole Bull himself, and at the concert Mr. Chris Olsen, Bjorgvin's president, thanked Mrs. Bull and the rest of Bull's relatives for the gift. Of course, someone spoke for Bergen, and "Ja vi Elsker Pette Landet" was sung by the Chorus. [The majority of the members of Bjorgvin were born in or had lived in Bergen; Ole Bull also came from Bergen. The Bjorvin Singing Society is sometimes called the "Bergenser Club".]</p>
