   <p>The birthday of Ole Bull is February 5. Bull was born in Bergen, Norway, ninety-nine years ago. On both sides of the Atlantic the day was remembered in various ways. Here in Chicago the Bjorgvin Singing Society held a most successful banquet in his honor.</p>

And home again in Norway he did one of the real great things for art in his home city: he created Bergen's National Theater....</p>
