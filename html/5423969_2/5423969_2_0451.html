   <p>The government will request every American to join a national voluntary organization,the purpose of which is to win the war. Food will determine the outcome of the war, says a bulletin from Washington. The side which does not have the necessary supply of food will lose. The members of the entente are dependent upon us for food; if we do not bring them sufficient food supply, they cannot win. We can easily supply them the foodstuffs they need through voluntary concerted action without it being necessary for anybody to make any greater sacrifices than he can stand. During the week Oct. 21, -28, the United States government's food administration will get in touch, through agents, with every man and woman in the country for the purpose of organizing all the loyal citizens into a voluntary army to win the war for democracy.</p>
   <p>Even in times of peace, the entente powers import 750,000,000 bushels of grains.</p>
   
   <p>Now they need import far more because so many of their farmers are in the army. Especially acute,is the need of the entente powers for wheat. The United States can satisfy the need easily as regards the other sorts of grains, but if our country is to send abroad sufficient wheat for the entente powers and at the same time satisfy the requirements of our own army, the American people will need to use less wheat than it has been accustomed to do. Fortunately, we have a large yield of corn this year, and great quantities of many types of vegetables. If every person in the country would use one pound per week of other types of grains than wheat, the United States would be able to meet the requirements in respect to food.</p>
   <p>The food administration, therefore, requests that all patriotic citizens show their loyalty towards the government by signing a pledge to do everything possible to help. The collection of names will take place during the week of October 21-28. During this week, committees will go from house to house in every part of the country. All the 22,000,000 families will be visited by them. Where pledge cards are signed, the committees will leave placards to be placed in the windows.</p>
   
   <p>If through loyal concerted action the people will do what the food administration is requesting, it will be unnecessary in this country to make rules as to the quality of food a person may buy. The food administration explains this as follows:</p>
   <p>Considering the brief time at our disposal we have done everything possible to increase the food production this year; but the pantry of the world is yet too sparingly supplied unless the American people can be persuaded to undertake enormous savings. Our retrenchment does not need at all to be of similar character as that which we see in Europe. Lack of transportation facilities and the necessity of limiting our export of food products to the most concentrated forms reduce the number of kinds of necessities which we desire to send to Europe very greatly The necessities to be exported include wheat and corn, meat and dairy products, and sugar. On the other hand, we have in America supplies of certain necessitites which, so to speak, can be increased at a moment's notice. Thus we can easily substitute for articles which we wish to export, others of which we have ample supply.</p>
   
   <p>It is, therefore,really not necessary for people to sacrifice anything. The committees sent by the national food administration will merely ask that certain slight changes be made in the kinds of foods to be listed on the weekly menus of our people. No decrease in food value, merely a variation in types of foods.</p>
