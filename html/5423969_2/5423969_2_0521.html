   <p>Now that a naval court of inquiry has been appointed to investigate the conduct of Rear Admiral Schley during the campaign resulting in the destruction of the Spanish squadron, the press should abstain from further discussion of the so-called Sampson-Schley controversy. There is absolutely nothing to be gained by keeping up the partisan warfare. The court, headed by Admiral Dewey, has the implicit confidence of the country, and whatever conclusions it may reach will be accepted as fair and final.</p>
   <p>The unceasing activity of the Schley organs at the present time cannot otherwise than be embarrassing to the rear admiral. It betrays a lack of confidence in the strength of his case and may be construed as an attempt to break the force of an adverse verdict. Rear Admiral Schley has demanded an investigation <span class="page-break">2</span>at the hands of his brothers in arms. Eulogies by "land crabs" who know nothing at all about the matter can be of no possible benefit to him, nor will the effusive compliments of Spanish officers alter the facts which will determine the decision of the court.</p>
   <p>The whole trouble is in the first place due to the mistaken zeal of Rear Admiral Schley's friends, and if the findings of the court should prove damaging to his reputation as an officer, upon them will rest the responsibility.</p>
   <p>Rear Admiral Schley will not suffer alone; if his conduct shall be condemned his humiliation will be a blot upon the honor of the navy. While the victory afforded "glory enough for all," the investigation may dim the glory of all. But the court represents the highest ability and the best traditions of the navy, and its verdict should be, as it will be, accepted as the last and decisive word in this unseemly controversy.</p>
