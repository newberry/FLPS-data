   <p>The Bjorgvin Singing Society celebrated a memorial for Ole Bull, the great Norwegian composer. The program was held in Bjorgvin Hall. On the program we find such prominent and outstanding individuals as Mrs. Ola Mossberg and Mrs. Gertrude Larsen, vocalists; Johan Dybdahl, violinist; and Tom Boe, tenor.</p>
   <p>The Society has forty-five active members who meet regularly once a week to rehearse the beautiful songs of the homeland. Mr. Joel Mossberg, the director, has, because of his knowledge of music, made this group of singers the outstanding chorus that it is.</p>
