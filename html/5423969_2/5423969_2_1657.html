   <p>p.3..............The "Bjorgvin" Male Chorus and Chicago's Norwegian colony, as a whole, mourn the loss of one of Bjorgvin's oldest and most faithful members, Mr. Max Engels, who passed away last Sunday. An octette of Bjorgvin singers paid the final tribute to the much loved brother singer and the rehearsal on Wednesday evening, the day of the funeral was so overshadowed by the loss of Mr. Engels that the evening became a purely memorial service instead of a rehearsal.</p>
