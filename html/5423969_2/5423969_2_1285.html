   <p>Tomorrow Rolf is giving a concert, which will be of more than ordinary interest. People will get a chance to hear a new phase of his art since Mr. Hammer will sing arias from "Pajazzo," "Martha," and "Traviata."</p>
   <p>Some people may not know yet that Mr. Hammer for years was the only tenor opera singer in Norway, and a strong favorite with the public in Christiana. He has sung in more operas than any other Norwegian. He will accede to requests here in Skandinaven and sing, in addition to the announced numbers also a selection from Grieg's most characteristic romances and songs, and also Agathe Backer-Grondahl's magnificent composition, "Endnu et Streif Kun" ("But One More Gleam"), a composition of which already the second edition has been sold in Norway. Whoever wants to hear genuine art in music and singing, let him not miss the concert at Bjorgvin Hall tomorrow evening.</p>
