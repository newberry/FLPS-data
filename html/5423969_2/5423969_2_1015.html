   <p>p.8....................The Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company has honored a member of our Norwegian colony, who, though he has been in the employ of the company for a number of years, was "discovered" only recently. Mr. Charles Olsen, quiet and unassuming, was found to be quite a linguist. He speaks seven languages fluently (Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, German, French, Spanish and English) and he is now the Northwestern Railroad Company's Supervisor of Immigration.</p>
