   <p>After being inactive for a long time Chicago Norwegian Singers League came together for a lively meeting last Sunday in Bjorgvin's Hall. Representatives from the different singing societies of Chicago were present and the atmosphere was full of mirth. The singers are now preparing for the singing festival in Grand Forks, N.D. next July. The occasion for tonight's gathering, was largely to seat the new officers, and to speed up the preliminary work. Songs and speeches and the presence of both Mr. Emil Bjorn and Mr. Alfred Paulsen made for an excellent program.</p>
