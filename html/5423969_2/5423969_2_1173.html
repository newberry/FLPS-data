   <p>The Chicago Anderson Pressed Brick Co., was entered into the County Courts as insolvent. Albert C. Barnes was appointed receiver. The assets total $500,000, and the liabilities total $350,000. The company was organized in 1881 with a capital of $500,000. The yearly business totalled over one million dollars. It was the largest company in this line of business. The factory is located on Elston Avenue near Clybourne Place. It cost one-half million dollars to erect; it is the only asset left. The debts are a mortgage of $200,000 and $150,000 cash loan. The directors have obligated themselves for $150,000. People, who have inside information, state that the factory even today is worth $350,000. It appears as though the firm will re-open with the directors buying out the factory. The reason for the sudden cash shortage is that a workman, who had an accident, his hand was smashed and it was amputated, sued the company for $20,000 and was awarded $12,500 by a jury.</p>
