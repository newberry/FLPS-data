   <p>Following the body of "Big Jim" Colosimo to the grave today will move a cortege which should interrupt the complacent thoughts of Chicago. Three judges, eight aldermen, an assistant state's attorney, a congressman, a state representative, and leading artists of the Chicago Opera Company are listed as honorary pallbearers along with gamblers, ex-gamblers, dive-keepers, and ex-divekeepers. A calvacade such as moved behind the funeral car of Caesar is to pay homage to the memory of the man who for more than a decade has been recognized as the overlord of Chicago's underworld. Such tribute from men set up to make and enforce our laws, to a man who in much of his life was a law unto himself, is more than the tribute of friendship. It is a tribute to power, regardless of the source or justice of that power.</p>

   <p>Jim Colosimo ruled in his world. Out of his rule came sudden death. Raised to the throne of the half world, he was a maker and breaker of political aspirations. His methods were ruthless, considering the law only in so far as to avoid its penalties. The penalty which came to him was not of the law, but of the kingdom which he had built up. Yet it brings to his grave a concourse notable for its lights and shadows.</p>
   <p>It is a strange commentary upon our system of law and justice. How much can power derived from the life of the underworld influence institutions of law and order? It is a question worthy of the thoughtful consideration of those entrusted with the establishment of law and order, and of those dependent upon and responsible for such trust.</p>
