   <p>About a week ago Mr. Swan Nelson presented the Chicago Historical Society with his original plan of Lincoln Park. The old landscape architect, who also drew the plans for Union Park, recognized the fact that this original drawing had great historical value to the Historical Society, so that people in the future could follow the growth of Lincoln Park since its birth in 1865. The drawing shows the first sixty acres that were donated by the city for the project. Now, the park contains 309 acres, not including the boulevards.</p>
   <p>Lawrence Proudfoot and Ivar Lawson[Translator's note: Ivar Lawson is the father of Victor F. Lawson, who was the first publisher and owner of the Daily News], who were members of the City Council at the time the project was decided upon, deserved the credit for the building of the park.</p>
   <p>We can best understand the troubles of the first Park Board when we listen <span class="page-break">2</span>to Mr. Nelson's own words:</p>
   <p>"My contribution to the building of Lincoln Park is part of my dearest memories," says Mr. Nelson. "We had great opposition from people who did not understand the value of a park system, and curiously enough, because of this opposition only ten thousand dollars was appropriated for the building of the park.</p>
   <p>"An example of the opposition is found in the case of John Wentworth. Before the Lincoln Park project was started, John Wentworth offered to sell to the city a parcel of land near 23rd Street, containing about eighty acres, for half its value providing the city would use it for a park, but when it was taken to a vote the project was killed by a large majority.</p>
   <p>"As far as I remember, the original sixty acres were donated in 1864. It is probably not generally known that this original 'sixty' was an old cemetery that bordered on Menomonee Street, north of Webster Avenue, with Clark <span class="page-break">3</span>Street the western boundary. The streetcars on Clark Street ran as far north as Division Street, and from there on, a plank road snaked through the sand and bog toward the north. So, at that time, the park was quite a distance from town.</p>
   <p>"When the lagoon was built, much criticism began, the papers stating that the water from the lagoon would drain into the lake and nothing would be left but a dry hole, and especially so if the lagoon was higher than the lake. Today the park stands as a monument to Lawrence Proudfoot and Ivar Lawson.</p>
   <p>"How the park got its name is also very interesting. When the ordinance was passed to build the park, in 1864, it was first proposed to call it Lake Park, even though a park by that name had been built on the South Side. But shortly after Lincoln was assassinated, and someone proposed the name Lincoln Park, people objected to naming the desert of sand and <span class="page-break">4</span>bog after the martyred President. It was later decided to use the name Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>"Ivar Lawson is dead; but Lawrence Proudfoot still lives. It is his greatest pleasure to visit the scene of so much struggle, in which he was a central figure. We see him quite often sitting on a bench, somewhere in Lincoln Park, dreaming of the past."</p>
