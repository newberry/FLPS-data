   <p>The brief, breezy debate between ex-Governor J. P. Altgeld and Roy O. West of the Board of Review will serve a good purpose. Though Mr. Altgeld's contention that the Board sit as a court cannot be complied with for reasons explained by Mr. West, the discussion was both interesting and suggestive. Speaking of behalf of the taxpayers, Mr. Altgeld said, among other things:</p>
   <p>"It seems that in the pressure of business and for the purpose of facilitating things, the Board has given individual private hearings, but it looks to the public as if these hearings were granted for another purpose and in the form of confidential conferences. Now this Board is a court, and in some respects the most important court in the state today. There is no appeal from its decisions except in cases where fraud is concerned. Our whole system of government depends on the action of this body, and it is of the greatest importance that the public should have absolute confidence in the work of the Board. Not that the Board can escape criticism and <span class="page-break">2</span>satisfy everybody, but it should make the effort. It is of the utmost importance, in my judgment, that the proceedings should be conducted like the proceedings in a court of record, open and above board, so that every reason given should be presented to all interested and so that everybody can hear and the suspicion of influence and all that it implies will not settle down in the minds of the people. We ask that the Board insist on a public hearing in every case, treating rich and poor alike, so that it may be known and felt that there is no private influence being used to defeat the law."</p>
   <p>This is sound in principle. But Mr. West's reply was conclusive: It would be a physical impossibility for the Board to do its work if it should sit as a court. In addition Mr. West emphasized another vital point of the question in a manner that ought to appeal to every taxpayer.</p>
   <p>"The trouble," he said, "is not in the way our proceedings are conducted, but in the difficulty of getting evidence. Give us the names of the people in Chicago who have secreted property not open to public inspection, and <span class="page-break">3</span>we will do our best to discover their holdings and tax them. We, as well as everyone else, know that stocks are purchased in foreign corporations and never listed for taxation. The hotels and clubs of Chicago are full of rich men who deliberately attempt to defeat the work of the assessors and will not make honest returns."</p>
   <p>Here is the difficulty. The Board knows that immense amounts of property are secreted and that our hotels and clubs, not to mention our churches, are full of rich men who deliberately attempt to defraud the public and their fellow citizens, and frequently succeed. But the explicit evidence that is required to smoke the culprits out of their holes is generally lacking. It is the duty of every taxpayer, as it is to his interest, to aid the assessing authorities in their efforts to obtain full information about assessable property. The public appeal of the Board of Review for the co-operation of the general public should meet with a generous response among the taxpayers.</p>
