   <p>The Norwegian Theater has just produced Ibsen's "A Doll House," with Rolf Hammer and Mrs. Borgny Hammer in the title roles.</p>
   <p>As usual, the theater was filled to capacity; all available standing room was occupied. Mrs. Hammer played the part of "Nora" true to character. "Attorney Helmer," played by Rolf Hammer, was superb. "Doctor Bank" was portrayed by Mr. Bernts, and "Attorney Krogstad" by Mr. Hjalmar Clausen.</p>
