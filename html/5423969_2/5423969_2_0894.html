   <p>Dear Sir: I think the columns for the young people are very interesting and I would like to say a few words in behalf of the ladies on wheels.</p>
   <p>In the first place, there is no exercise that sets the blood tingling through a person's veins quicker than a short trip on a bicycle. I could advise nothing better for a lady that has to stand behind the counter of some dry goods store or tailor shop, than to own a bicycle and take a spin in the fresh air on her way home for her meals. And if she has any spare moments she may take a trip out into the open country, as fresh air cannot always be had in large cities. On the other hand, if she were to follow the advice of a previous writer, she would have to trudge home afoot with her body already overtired.</p>
   <p>As to bicycle riders being deformed, I think they were that way long before <span class="page-break">\2</span>they got their wheels. One thing I know is that it has not deformed me, and I rode over five hundred miles last fall, and the only time I could ride was Sundays because I had work to do during the week. I used to take my wheel on Sunday morning and visit distant churches, which I could not have done if I had not had a wheel. And I cannot see why a lady should not go to church on a bicycle, instead of going on foot in the company of some one who may be of no interest to her.</p>
