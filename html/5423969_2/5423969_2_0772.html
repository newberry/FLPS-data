   <p>The following are the main happenings in outline of the history of streetcar development in our city:</p>
   <p>1859. The City passed an ordinance giving Frank Parmelee and Company, permission to run horse-drawn cars for 25 years on State and Madison Streets and on Cottage Grove Avenue to 31st Street, the then city limits. The laying of tracks was prevented, however, by a court injunction on the basis that the right to give the type of concessions here concerned was not vested in the City government. Parmelee and Company then applied to the State legislature for a charter.</p>
   <p>1859. The Chicago City Railway and the North Chicago City Railway Companies were incorporated by law passed by the legislature.</p>

   <p>1861. Chicago West Division Railway incorporated.</p>
   <p>1859-1865. Chicago City Council adopts various ordinances giving the companies rights in the busiest streets in the city. Chicago at the time had for its limits, Fullerton Avenue, Western Avenue, and 39th Street.</p>
   <p>1865. On application from the three companies, the legislature adopted a law altering the charters of the companies and extended them to 99 years. This was the notorious 99 year law.</p>
   <p>1883. The City Council adopted an ordinance extending the companies' franchises 20 years.</p>

   <p>1903. The receiver for the Union Traction Company instituted suit against the City to show that the claim of the City that the franchise of the Company had expired was not well founded. The franchises granted in 1883 had expired in July.</p>
   <p>1905. The application of the 99 year law to all franchises in city or town, granted before the 99 year law was enacted, was sustained by Judge Peter S. Grosscup, April 15.</p>
   <p>1906. Judge Grosscup's decision voided by U. S. Supreme Court, March 12.
