   <p>And now comes John D. Long, the honorable Secretary of the Navy, and says that he is the man who made Dewey. Unfortunately for John D. Long, the admiral takes the view that, in so far as his making depended upon the opportunity to do business, his thanks are due to John D. Long's first Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, and next to President McKinley.</p>
   <p>Commodore Dewey may or may not have been Long's choice for commander of the Asiatic squadron. In any event it is probable that the Secretary was influenced by Roosevelt's energetic support of Dewey, and the President's endorsement of the Assistant Secretary's suggestion. But even if Dewey <span class="page-break">\2</span>were indebted exclusively to Long for his command, it was Roosevelt who gave him the opportunity to strike. The greatest thing Long has done as Secretary of the Navy was his departure from Washington for some seashore resort at the most critical juncture before the outbreak of the war with Spain. He left Roosevelt in charge of the department, and while Long was talking peace to a select circle of Boston "aunties," Roosevelt prepared for business and instructed Dewey to proceed to Manila. Long returned to rein up his vigorous assistant; but it was too late. The instructions had gone forth, and Dewey did not propose to lose precious time. Before Long had fairly caught his breath, the country was thrilled by the victory of Manila Bay. Obeying the instructions received from Roosevelt, Commodore Dewey had opened a new era in the history of his country and written his name in the book of undying fame.</p>
   <p>John D. Long would better keep silent as to his relations with Dewey as long as the American people are charitable enough to forget and forgive the Secretary's humiliating part in the great patriotic drama of 1898.</p>
