   <p>Much has been said and written about the County Hospital, but nothing is being done. We feel that a real clean-up should take place, not only in the personnel, but on the staff and the Hospital Board. Many of our readers believe that the Hospital "persecutes" foreigners only, but that is not the case. There have been complaints from Americans who have been treated equally as bad, if not worse.</p>
   <p>The warden of the County Hospital is a smooth talker, and can talk himself out of anything. The two cases discussed in this paper are already forgotten, and so it goes with every complaint brought to the public eye.</p>
   <p>Let us all get together and force a real investigation, one that will really clear up things.</p>
