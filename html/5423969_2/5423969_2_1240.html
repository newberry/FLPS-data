   <p>A benefit concert for the Bethesda Old People's Home, 2244 Haddon Avenue, was held on Friday, March 7th, at Wicker Park Hall. The hall was filled to capacity, and the program was both long and good.</p>
   <p>The Bjorgvin male chorus, directed by Joel Mossberg, contributed a number of songs that were greatly enjoyed and drew prolonged applause. Solos by Mr. Mossberg were, as always, well-received. Miss Ragna Linne, soprano, and Miss Anna Fosterud, pianist, both pleased the audience, as did the ever-faithful John Dybdahl, violinist and Miss Lilly Meyer, who accompanied him.</p>
   <p>Rev. Mr. Tiller spoke for Judge Torrison, who could not come. He expressed the gratitude of the Home management to those who had made the concert a success, artists and committees both. The proceeds of the concert were badly needed and are heartily appreciated.</p>
