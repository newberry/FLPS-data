   <p>Theodore H. Lunde, a Norwegian manufacturer of piano metal parts in Chicago, was arrested last Monday for breach of the spy regulations. He was released Wednesday on a bail of $25,000. The secret agents of the department of justice visited during the day, both Lunde's home in Edison Park and his office at 811 Rees St., also, an office at 1541 Unity Building, the headquarters of Chicago pacifists. All of Lunde's letters, checks, and documents of various kinds were taken by the agents, a whole truckload, to be gone over by the Federal authorities.</p>
   <p>The following, from one of Lunde's letters, is illustrative of his way of thinking: "Neither do I believe that the Kaiser started this war; the others would hever have dared start the war, except for the encouragement given them by England. You consider yourselves a democratic nation, and yet ten or twelve lords own all the land in England; I consider the Kaiser to be the greatest social politician of our day. He is a Socialist on a large scale."</p>
   <p>Lunde has denied that he is connected with the German spy propaganda, or that <span class="page-break">\2</span>he has exported copper and other goods to Germany. The bail was furnished by Dr. Karl F. M. Sandberg and a businessman.</p>
