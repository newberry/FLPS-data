   <p>The Norwegian Theatre opened its season last Sunday with the presentation of Amalie Skram's drama "Agnete," in Bjorgvin's Hall.</p>
   <p>In spite of the warm weather the house was filled to capacity, and the very competent actors were generously applauded.</p>
   <p>We think that the excellent actress, Mrs. Hammer, played "Agnete" exactly as the author wanted the heroine to be; the young divorcee who ruthlessly disregards conventions in order to live in luxury and comfort, and her consequent disappointments and remorse, were beautifully portrayed by Mrs. Hammer, who actually lived the role, and never lost her hold on the audience.</p>
   
   <p>The supporting roles were also in very good hands; we particularly want to mention the company's latest aquisition Mr. Frithjof Werenskjold who showed outstanding ability in his characterization of the sculptor Ulfsen, the disillusioned, disappointed, and thoroughly disgusted husband.</p>
   <p>In spite of certain shortcomings, the minor roles were well taken care of. A new and commendable innovation was the music between acts, furnished by the pianist Agnes Werenskjold and the violinist Fausta Marillac.</p>
