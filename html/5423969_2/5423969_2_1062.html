   <p>A meeting was held at the Odin Club for the purpose of forming a Norwegian Chamber of Commerce. This Chamber should create a closer industrial relationship between Norway and the United States. Norway has little knowledge of the American market, and American business knows little or nothing about the industrial needs of Norway. This dual Chamber should be able to discover what goods are most needed in both countries, and how these goods can be most cheaply marketed.</p>
   <p>Committees have been formed in America and Norway. Chicago, New York, Seattle, and Minneapolis have already laid the foundation for this move. The following resolution was adopted at all committee meetings:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The possibility of extended trade relations between the United States and Norway has been presented to us, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, We consider that such extension will be of benefit to both countries, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, We consider that the opportunities for such an extension at the present time, when world trade necessarily is seeking new channels, should be made use of, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We consider that such an extension will be greatly facilitated by the establishment of a Norwegian Chamber of Commerce in the United States to act as a bureau of information, to assist in the settling of disputes between exporters and importers, to assist in establishing credits and in general to assist in bringing about a better acquaintance between the businessmen of both countries; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we favor the organization of a Norwegian Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the chairman of this meeting be authorized to appoint a committee of twelve, the Norwegian Consul at St. Paul to be a member ex officio, to devise a plan for such organization, and after submitting the plan to similar committees in other cities at the earliest opportune time, call a meeting of parties interested at such a place as shall be found convenient for the organization of the Norwegian Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America."</p>
