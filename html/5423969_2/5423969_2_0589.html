   <p>The flag must not be lowered in the Philippine Islands. That is the verdict of the American people as shown by the popular reception of the published forecast of the terms of peace to be submitted to Spain by our government. President McKinley keeps his finger upon the public pulse. If his purpose was to ascertain public sentiment in regard to the disposition to be made of the Philippines, the answer was prompt and emphatic: The flag must remain. Whether the islands are to be annexed, or are to be placed under the protection of the United States with some system of native government, are questions of detail which American statesmanship will deal with and solve in due course of time. The main question, which must be met and decided now, is whether we shall retain them. Upon this point the <span class="page-break">\2</span>sentiment of the people is unmistakable; we must hold what we have won in fair warfare. The natives are unfit for independence and self-government. We cannot give the Islands back to barbaric Spain, nor would Spain be able to re-establish her sovereignty and establish a system of just and stable government, if we were to haul down the banner that Dewey raised. We cannot turn them over to one or more European powers. We must keep them whether we desire to or not, because any other course is neither practical, safe, nor statesmanlike.</p>
   <p>Dewey's famous May Day victory opened a new chapter in American history,and this chapter begins with the Philippine question. The first sensation after the glorious tidings were known and understood was one of bewilderment. Should the nation depart from the path of the fathers, or should the most brilliant naval victory of the century be thrown upon the scrap pile of history as a worthless useless thing? For a moment the national sentiment <span class="page-break">\3</span>hesitated, but only for a moment. The American people were face to face with new problems of their destiny and they were ready to grapple with them. In the brief space of three months, the sentiment of the nation has crystallized into a definite policy. Notwithstanding the difficulties attending the establishment of undisputed American control in the Philippines, doubts and uncertainties have vanished; the people demand their retention as a stronghold of American sea power in the Pacific, as a field of prospective American civilization, and a mart for American enterprise and trade.</p>
