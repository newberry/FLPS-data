   <p>Martin Luther, the great religious reformer, was keenly interested in matters of import for the everyday life of the people. So the question of monopolies, etc., attracted his attention, and he speaks of it as if he were living in our own day.</p>
   <p>"When someone who is unable to monopolize a certain product on account of competition, starts selling the product at such a low price as to force others out of the field, compelling them to quit after selling at a loss, one cannot help but thinking that such person is not worthy of being considered a human being or of being permitted to live among human beings, because in him envy and greed are so base and arrogant as to render him willing to lose heavily for a while in order to be finally able to dictate the price. It would be but <span class="page-break">2</span>the right thing if the government were to take away from such people all they have, and then drive them out of the country.</p>
   <p>"Similarly, it is a trick of selfishness when three or four dealers who control certain products get together to raise their price and pretend that the rise is due to increased demand."</p>
