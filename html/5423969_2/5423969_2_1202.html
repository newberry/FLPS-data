   <p>The following interesting resolution has been passed by practically every Scandinavian singing society and endorsed by every outstanding Scandinavian musician or singer in the Scandinavian colony:</p>
   <p>Whereas, It is a matter of common knowledge that for years one of the most insistent forms of German propaganda in this country has been the establishment of German societies primarily intended to develop a love for German music as the only music worth studying; and Whereas, In the present condition of world thought it is impossible to regard German music as an abstract expression of the beautiful because of the persistent and insistent propaganda still carried on by ill-advised persons in the interest of German music for the purpose of unduly exalting all German music and restoring as fully as possible the pre-war condition of German <span class="page-break">2</span>domination in musical matters; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Our acceptance of these conditions or aquiescence in them has led to a misapprehension of artistic values and has been and now is a detriment to our best development and limits our knowledge of the extent, the value, and the practical use of the music of American composers and of composers of the nations leagued with us in the Great War; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, While we recognize America's obligations to the efforts especially of the earlier German musicans in this country in cultivating an appreciation for good music and for better educational methods, yet we insist that it is imperative to overthrow alien domination in matters of art as it is in matters of politics and economics in order that our national art may be free to develop along its own individual path; therefore be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the members of the......Society, as loyal Americans, and as <span class="page-break">3</span>active workers in the musical profession, pledge themselves to a much wider study and greater personal use of American music and music other than German, zealously furthering, by all legitimate means, the recognition, advancement, and use of such music in the studio, in the home, and upon the concert platform.</p>
   <p>Whatever is great in German music will survive, yet we feel that until the partisans of German music permit us to listen to it without injecting German propaganda into the question of its enjoyment, patriotic Americans will hear it under protest.</p>
   <p>(Scandia endorses the above resolution.)</p>
