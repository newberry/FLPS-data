   <p>It is reported that Marshal Blanco has resigned and that Weyler is to succeed him.</p>
   <p>The butcher must not be permitted to land. Much as our tars and boys in blue would like to get a chance at the monster, they must forego this pleasure. If Weyler is allowed to land in Cuba, he will quickly complete his work of destroying the whole population of the island by starvation and wholesale slaughter of the "reconcentrados" who are penned up in walled towns and camps. This would be done so throughly that Cuban liberty--if it shall dawn at last-- would look upon a land of complete desolation and death, relieved only by the mocking laughter of the Spanish murderers, and with none left to enjoy the blessings of freedom.</p>
   <p>Our government will not stoop to protest against Weyler's return. But it <span class="page-break">\2</span>will see to it that he does not get an opportunity to tread Cuban soil again. It will dispatch some swift vessels to look out for him and pick him up or send him and his gang of murderers to the bottom of the sea. Let the government take notice.</p>
