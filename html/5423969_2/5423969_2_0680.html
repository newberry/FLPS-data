   <p>State Senator O. F. Berry argues that the voters of Chicago by all means ought to approve the new charter. If it is rejected, he believes it will take 25 years before the legislature again will offer a charter to the city. That, of course, would be a long time to wait. We expect that the senator assumed too much when thus declaring the attitude of the legislature.</p>
   <p>But even if he be correct it does not follow that the charter ought to be approved. There are many good points to the charters, signifying advancement in the arrangement of our city government. But there are also many weak points. The most important of these have been summed up briefly and clearly as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The new charter will not give real home rule to Chicago.</p>
   <p>2. Taxes will be increased, and so will the debt.</p>
   <p>3. A combination of the various park committees is dangerous.</p>
   <p>4. Concessions will be granted without the owners of property having a voice <span class="page-break">2</span>in the matter. Referendum is abolished.</p>
   <p>5. Civil Service law becomes a complete farce.</p>
   <p>6. The decrease in the number of representatives in the city council, as well as the re-districting of the wards is not to be recommended.</p>
   <p>7. The public schools will suffer.</p>
   <p>The opponents to the charter have in certain respects shown a one-sided attitude, but their criticism ought to be studied, especially as it deals with taxation. The voters ought to study the matter from the various points of view before making a final decision.</p>
