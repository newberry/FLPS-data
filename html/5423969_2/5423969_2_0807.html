   <p>Some time ago Ignatius Donnelly's paper, The Representative, published an editorial saying in part:</p>
   <p>"One of the last public statements of Abraham Lincoln--one which the orators of that commercial agency called the Republican party are careful always to suppress--is well worth the careful thought of all patriotic citizens. It is a prophecy whose prophetic truth is now our sorrow. It is worthy of a place beside the prophetic warnings of George Washington against the dangers of partisan blindness and foreign influences. Lincoln's words, in brief, are as follows:</p>
   <p>"'It has been indeed a trying hour for the republic; but I see in the future a crisis that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of <span class="page-break">\2</span>my country.</p>
   <p>"'As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will attempt to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudice of the people until all wealth is aggregated into a few hands, and the republic destroyed.</p>
   <p>"'I feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before, even in the midst of war. God grant that my suspicions be groundless.'</p>
   <p>"Were Abraham Lincoln alive...., he would feel that his suspicions were well founded."</p>
   <p>In its issue of April 15, Skandinaven requested The Representative to state when and where Abraham Lincoln made the alleged statement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But no answer came. The Representative has maintained a stubborn, yet eloquent, silence.</p>
   <p>No well-managed newspaper in the United States is ignorant of the fact that the alleged "prophecy" is a barefaced forgery, perpetrated by some knave who did not even know that Lincoln's assassination occurred before peace had been restored. Its fraudulent character had been exposed at least a dozen times when it was republished by Donnelly's paper as an accepted historical fact.</p>
   <p>But instead of correcting the error and squaring itself with truth, The Representative attempts to cover up one forgery with another. The latter attempt at historical garbling appears under the caption of "Lincoln as a Populist," over the same signature which was attached to "Lincoln as a Prophet," and reads in part as follows:</p>
   <p>"Lincoln the Populist</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"'Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people. In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism. It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its connections not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask brief attention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if not above labor, in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital, that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor. Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much higher consideration. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty; none less inclined to take or touch ought which they have not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement <span class="page-break">\5</span>against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them till all liberty shall be lost.'</p>
   <p>"The above sentiment was voiced in one of Lincoln's first messages to Congress, and was again expressed by him in an address delivered to the workers during the fourth year of his administration. Were the above sentiment to be uttered today it would be promptly pronounced by the old party press and corporation organs, 'Populist'.</p>
   <p>"This plainly shows how the Republican party has drifted from its early moorings.</p>
   <p>"The Lincoln Republican, therefore, violates no principle when he bolts the Republican party and allies himself with the People's party. Indeed, he must do so in order to be true to his principles. The same sentiments as those which Lincoln expressed thirty years ago are today voiced only by People's party papers and orators. No Republican orator, or organ, <span class="page-break">\6</span>or platform, will have anything to do with such a platform as that which Abraham Lincoln laid down as above, in his official message as the first President of the Republican party. Lincolnism is now represented in Populism."</p>
   <p>As will be seen, the great President is here presented in the garb of a latter-day Populist. Not that his plea for labor is particularly Populistic; the labor doctrine laid down in the above paragraph is today accepted by all parties as a fixed maxim of economics and politics.</p>
   <p>But the quotation is intended to convey, and does convey, the impression that Abraham Lincoln, in one of his first messages to Congress, said that the capital of the country (the loyal states) was conspiring to curtail the rights of labor and the power of the people--that despotism was returning, and that "monarchy itself was sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people".</p>
   <p>Can this be true, the thoughtful reader will inquire. Can it be, that <span class="page-break">\7</span>Abraham Lincoln in a message to Congress delivered during the dark days of the rebellion, would go out of his way to strenghten the Copperhead sentiment of the North by needlessly emphasizing class distinctions among the people?</p>
   <p>Let history answer. The quotation given by The Representative is taken from a message dated December 3, 1861, and delivered to the Senate "in the peculiar exigencies of the time". The last part of this famous state paper is devoted to a discussion of the economics and political doctrines and aims of the rebellion, and reads as follows:</p>
   <p>Skandinaven (Daily Edition), May 21, 1896.</p>
   <p>"It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not exclusively a war upon the first principles of popular government--the rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents. In those documents. In those documents we find the <span class="page-break">\8</span>abridgement of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers, except the legislative, boldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that a large control of the people in government is the source of all political evil. MONARCHY ITSELF IS SOMETIMES HINTED AS A POSSIBLE REFUGE FROM THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE.</p>
   <p>"IN MY RECENT POSITION, I COULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED WERE I TO OMIT RAISING A WARNING VOICE AGAINST THIS APPROACH OF RETURNING DESPOTISM.</p>
   <p>"IT IS NOT NEEDED NOR FITTING HERE, THAT A GENERAL ARGUMENT SHOULD BE MADE IN FAVOR OF POPULAR INSTITUTIONS; BUT THERE IS ONE POINT, WITH ITS CONNECTIONS, NOT SO HACKNEYED AS MOST OTHERS, TO WHICH I ASK A BRIEF ATTENTION. IT IS THE EFFORT TO PLACE CAPITAL ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH, IF NOT ABOVE LABOR IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE GOVERNMENT. IT IS ASSUMED THAT LABOR IS AVAILABLE ONLY IN CONNECTION WITH CAPITAL, THAT NOBODY LABORS UNLESS SOMEBODY ELSE, OWNING CAPITAL, SOMENOW BY THE USE OF IT INDUCES HIM TO LABOR.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or buy them, and thus drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired, or what we call slaves. And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life.</p>
   <p>"Now, there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed; nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless.</p>
   <p>"LABOR IS PRIOR TO, AND INDEPENDENT OF CAPITAL. CAPITAL IS ONLY THE FRUIT OF LABOR, AND COULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED IF LABOR HAD NOT FIRST EXISTED. LABOR IS THE SUPERIOR OF CAPITAL AND DESERVES MUCH HIGHER CONSIDERATION. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a <span class="page-break">\10</span>relation between capital and labor producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of the community exists within this relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class--neither work for others nor have others working for them. In most of the southern states a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters; while, in the northern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with their families--wives, sons and daughters--work for themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favor of capital on the one hand, nor hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital--that is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them: but this is only a mixed, and not distinct, class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.</p>
   <p>"Again: as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such <span class="page-break">\11</span>thing as the free hired laborer being fixed to that condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in these states, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of the condition of all. NO MEN LIVING ARE MORE WORTHY TO BE TRUSTED THAN THOSE WHO TOIL UP FROM POVERTY, NONE LESS INCLINED TO TAKE OR TOUCH OUGHT WHICH THEY HAVE NOT HONESTLY EARNED. LET THEM BEWARE OF SURRENDERING A POLITICAL POWER WHICH THEY ALREADY POSSESS, AND WHICH, IF SURRENDERED, WILL SURELY BE USED TO CLOSE THE DOOR OF ADVANCEMENT AGAINST SUCH AS THEY, AND TO FIX NEW DISABILITIES AND BURDENS UPON THEM TILL ALL LIBERTY SHALL BE LOST.</p>
   <p>"From the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy years, and we find our population at the end of the period eight times as great <span class="page-break">\12</span>as it was in the beginning. The increase of those other things which men deem desirable has been even greater. We thus have at one view, what the machinery of the states and the Union has produced in a given time; and also what, if firmly maintained, it promises for the future. There are already among us those who, if the Union be preserved, will live to see it contain two hundred and fifty million people. The struggle of today is not altogether for today--it is for a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence, all the more firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon us."</p>
   <p>The sentences printed in capitals are those used by The Representative in the construction of its quotation from Lincoln's message. By comparing Lincoln's argument as presented in his own exact words, with the meaning of the quotation in The Representative, the reader will detect at a glance the shameless dishonesty and astonishing audacity of the Populistic organ. Lincoln spoke about rebellion and disclosed the secret plans and purposes of the slave power: Donnelly's paper represents him as warning the people <span class="page-break">\13</span>and labor of the North against attacks planned by the rich men of the North. As it appears in The Representative, Lincoln's plea for labor partakes of the nature of a truism: In all the land not a man can be found who dissents from it in a single particular. Read as it was written, it reveals its far-reaching purpose--to prepare the public mind for the freeing of the slaves. The closing paragraphs of the message of December 3, 1861, were intended as an appeal to the loyal people in the loyal states--calling upon them to grasp and hold fast the first principle of liberty. Abraham Lincoln was constructing the foundation of the glorious act of emancipation when he penned those immortal lines; to serve as such was their grand purpose and historic mission.</p>
   <p>People will know what to think about a newspaper that can stoop to such tactics as have been employed by The Representative in this instance. A paper which does not hesitate at defiling the grand features of the great martyr-President for the purpose of furthering demagogical designs is <span class="page-break">\14</span>unfit to be admitted to the hearths of honest men and women. If, as is believed, the majority of the population are honest men, they will compel Mr. Donnelly to confess in black and white in his own paper:</p>
   <p>1. that the so-called "Lincoln's prophecy" is a forgery and a lie;</p>
   <p>2. that the quotation from Lincoln's message of Dec. 3, 1861, published in The Representative of May 6th, is an unscrupulous and utterly contemptible falsification intended to mislead and confuse.</p>
   <p>And if the "sage" is an honest man, he will confess promptly and cheerfully and apologize to his readers for the sins of fraud, forgery, and deception of which his paper stands convicted.</p>
