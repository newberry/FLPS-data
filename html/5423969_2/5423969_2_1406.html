   <p>The Norwegian Theater Company has just presented several comedies, everyone of them outstanding both in production and in the perfect artistry of the entire cast.</p>
   <p>Rolf Hammer, as "Bellringer Link" in the comedy "Ja," could not be improved on; he sang the humorous songs true to character, with the utmost control and tone.</p>
   <p>"The Baby Present", with eleven children in the cast, caused so much applause and laughter that it was decided to present this humorous comedy again next Sunday.</p>
