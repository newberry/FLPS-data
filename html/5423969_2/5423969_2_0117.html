   <p>The hearings of the [Ballinger] Committee, after proceeding for months, were ended in the closing days of the last session of Congress. There was no opportunity and no attempt upon the part of anybody to have the Committee meet for purposes of consultation upon the evidence to report its findings to Congress prior to the adjournment of the session. Under the circumstances, that course was manifestly impossible. The Committee is the creature of a special act of Congress, which fixed the number of its members at twelve, six Senators appointed by the Vice-President and six Representatives elected by the House. The act carefully defined the powers and jurisdiction of the Committee and contained the mandate that it should report its findings and conclusions to this Congress. A great mass of testimony had been taken, making a direct and collateral record of about seven thousand closely printed pages. The issues involved were full of moment to the cause of pure administration, to the conservation of our natural resources, and to the interests of the government <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>generally and to the reputation of some of its present and former officers. The work, therefore, of deliberation and decision, was of great importance as well as of great difficulty. The Committee determined to devote some of the time during the recess of Congress to this work and decided to meet on September 5.</p>
   <p>The day of the meeting found the membership widely scattered and only seven of the twelve members present. Three other members were detained by brief but peremptory engagements; Senator Flint was in Europe and Senator Root on the sea returning from arguing a case for the government before The Hague tribunal. Upon reassembling two days later, eight gentlemen were present and two more were reported on the way. The eighth member to appear happened to be a Democrat, and the members of that party found themselves in temporary control and promptly proceeded to turn the circumstance to what seemed to them a party advantage. In advance of any consultation whatever upon the evidence which had never been weighed and discussed in the Committee, they demanded the passage of resolutions of the most sweeping character, formally finding Secretary Ballinger quilty not merely of charges which had been made, but of charges <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>which had been only implied and of things which had never been charged but which persons appearing at the hearing had alleged against him.</p>
   <p>Other members of the Committee present protested against such a proceeding, which would dispose of the case in the absence of four of the twelve members, making it possible for a minority of the Committee to find the Committee's verdict and this, too, without any consultation or discussion. But the partisan political end to be gained by the Democratic minority became all the more urgent in proportion as the railway trains bearing other members of the Committee were approaching the meeting. the minority refused even to take a recess, and the other members, protesting against the evident determination to take a snap judgment by a minority in the absence of a third of the whole tribunal, and declining to bear any responsibility for thus converting the investigation into a travesty and for a violation of the fundamental principle which should govern the whole proceeding, withdrew from the meeting and thus deprived the Democrats of their temporary control of the Committee.</p>
   <p>The meeting being left without a quorum, any attempted decision of the case <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>would have no more validity than would like action of any similar number of men collected at random in the streets. But the spectacle was presented of five gentlemen out of a tribunal of twelve, created by the Congress of the United States, assuming to act as the tribunal itself. These five gentlemen continued their proceedings to the end, according to the worst methods of ward politics, and after pretending to adopt a report of eighty-nine pages, which they brought to the meeting already prepared, and which was never the subject of even consideration or discussion or even read in committee, they gave it to the newspapers, although the law requires it to be rendered to Congress; and they completed their perversion of the purpose of the meeting by adjourning to December 3, so as to foreclose, if possible, any action by the Committee in the meantime; and by solemn vote they graciously extended the majority the leave to file a minority report. It does not need to be said that such action in both form and substance is wholly lawless, and it leaves it entirely unnecessary to ask what sort of justice any public servant could look for whose character was on trial in such a proceeding in the excitement of a political campaign. If there is any relation between lawless methods and the character of the results which they accomplish, this so-called <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>verdict condemns its authors rather than the officials under investigation.</p>
   <p>This action of the minority in no way relieves us from our responsibility under the law. The duties which have devolved upon us by the law were not at all of our own seeking, and they have proved laborious and sometimes disagreeable duties. But we conceive that we are still bound to follow an orderly procedure and, indeed, the only procedure that is open under the law. It is incumbent upon us to sift the great mass of evidence and to attempt to reach and render a just verdict.</p>
   <p>Every effort was made to induce the minority members to agree to a meeting on some early day at Minneapolis or Chicago, as might suit their convenience, but without avail. The chairman thereupon called the present meeting. The members, whose names are hereto attached, have spent the day reviewing the case, but, being without a quorum, are powerless to act, and have adjourned subject to the call of the chairman. The report of the Committee cannot be made until December 5, when Congress meets, and the meeting called for September 5 was for the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>purpose of considering and discussing what the report to be made three months thereafter should be. There was therefore no haste or pressure for time. The action of the Democratic minority in taking temporary advantage of the delay of some members in reaching the meeting was an effort to substitute a prearranged scheme for the orderly deliberation and discussion which the duty of the Committee requires. The pretended adoption of a report by a political minority, and its publication as if it was a report of the Committee, exhibited a willingness to sacrifice the rights and injure the reputation of the officers investigated in order to obtain a supposed partisan advantage in the pending political campaign. We cannot reconcile such a course with our sense of justice and our duty.</p>
