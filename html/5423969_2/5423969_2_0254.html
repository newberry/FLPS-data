   <p>The plain, everyday citizen may be unable to grasp the complex machinery for assessing property in Chicago, but even the most indifferent understand that the palpable dishonesty of large property owners is the chief difficulty confronting the assessors and the board of review. If the honesty of our "leading" citizens is to be gaged by their sworn property schedules, the percentage of righteous men must be considerably smaller in Chicago than it was in Sodom and Gomorrah when Lot turned his back upon those places.</p>
   <p>We have no dearth of reformers in our city; in fact, we have regiments of good people who preach for us in season and out of season and tell us what we should do in order to make the city a model of physical and moral health. And their sermons are repeated and rehearsed by newspapers <span class="page-break">\2</span>that ever pose as champions of purity and reform.</p>
   <p>How these lights practice what they preach we all know. Their virtue cannot stand the sight of an assessor; his knock at the front door is sufficient to put it to flight. Whereupon our leading citizen, parading as a paragon of civic virtue, will set him down, prepare a schedule permeated with fraud, seal it with the name of God, then rub his hands in glee and congratulate himself upon his success in cheating the community and his fellow citizens of nine-tenths of the taxes he by right ought to pay. When Sunday comes around he will go to his church, drop a coin in the contribution box, and feel that he has discharged his duties to God and man.</p>
   <p>If a poor man should attempt a similar fraud he would be quickly caught and brought to justice. But the rich tax-dodger evidently enjoys the immunity of rich criminals in general. A woman who snatches a loaf of bread to still the hunger of her children is punished as a thief; but <span class="page-break">\3</span>if a public servant robs the school fund, or a rich tough corrupts a jury, he is permitted to depart and no one seems to be anxious to interfere with him. If a poor man should happen to trespass upon forbidden property, public or private, he will be hustled off to the lock-up and promptly fined. But if a leading reform light converts three hundred thousand dollars of public money to his own use--or steals it, as plain people would express it--he can stave off prosecution for years and then get a jury that will not convict him. And yet there are people who wonder at the discontent of "the masses"!</p>
   <p>Our children are taught that "honesty is the best policy". But the doctrine generally practiced by those who should set them good examples is that dishonesty is the best policy. Our youths are apt pupils. If they go astray in growing numbers--if our jails are crowded with young criminals, let it be understood that their blood rests upon our "leading" citizens, church deacons, and reformers, including pharisaical newspapers, that perjure themselves in order to escape just public dues, <span class="page-break">\4</span>who corrupt the courts of justice when their interests require it, who preach reform and practice iniquity, who are whited sepulchres filled with corruption and uncleanliness.</p>
