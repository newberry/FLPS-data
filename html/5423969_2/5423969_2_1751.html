   <p>Bjorgvin Singing Society will celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary with a great concert in the Garrick Theatre on Sunday April 14, which will mark a new milestone in the Norwegian community in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It also has a children's choir and a ladies' choir both of which will sing tonight at the concert. The "Bjorgvin" we must tell you is the owner of its own hall.</p>
