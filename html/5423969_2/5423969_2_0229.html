   <p>Alderman Frank T. Fowler of Ward 13 should receive the support of all good citizens in his war on dishonest or incompetent city officials who have permitted, and are still permitting street-paving contractors to put down paving that is not up to specifications. Mr. Fowler is not confining his efforts to his own ward. He is willing to consider written complaints from any part of Chicago and assist in discovering or checking paving frauds in any ward in the city. He also offers the services and advice of street-paving experts in his employ, free of charge, to any citizen who desires their assistance.</p>
   <p>This is business. If all members of the City Council were to go about their duties in a similar manner, there would soon be an end to all forms of public stealing. If the people and taxpayers are honest in their demand for an honest administration of the affairs of the city, they will enlist for Alderman Fowler's war upon public thieves and not lay down their arms until they have routed the rascals and captured their last stronghold.</p>
