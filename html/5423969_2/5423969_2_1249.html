   <p>p.3.......One of our Norwegian American Chicagoans, Mr. Tom Boe (born in Bergen, Norway) has been signally honored. Mr. Ziegfield, president of Chicago Musical College, has offered Mr. Boe a year of free instruction at the college. Mr. Boe already is noted for his exceptional tenor voice and with such an opportunity as he is now offered he should soon rank among the country's elite tenors. To be so honored is an inspiration to unlimited achievement. The school is the largest of its kind in Chicago.</p>
