   <p>Is there still danger of Indians attacking our Illinois suburbs? A meeting was recently held, sponsored by several leading Scandinavians. The discussion was concerned with ways and means of protecting the outlying sections of the city from attack. The recent massacres in Iowa and Wisconsin caused some excitement.</p>
   <p>The following proposals were accepted:</p>
   <p>1. That the Indians must turn in all firearms.</p>
   <p>2. That Indians in groups of five hundred should be given land and implements; and that an agent be appointed to teach them farming.</p>
   <p>These are good decisions, but try to find the Winchesters. The Indians have, no doubt, hidden. Also, try to teach these roving people farming. We think that a certain territory should be reserved, where whole tribes may be sent. Then, let them hunt and farm as they please.</p>
