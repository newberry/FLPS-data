   <p>While the world war is yet thundering, while yet no man can have the slightest idea as to the time when the great peace conference may convene, an enormous literature has grown in the various countries concerning the question, and the theme everywhere is: "What will the world and life in the world be like when the terrible world fire is extinguished?"</p>
   <p>As everyone knows, another and still more fearful war is predicted to follow after the present one. The conference by the entente powers at Paris in August 1916, gave warning of economic boycott and commercial war against the central powers.</p>
   <p>About this matter several large volumes has been written.</p>
   <p>Those who are aware that before the war, a great deal more than half of the export of Russia went to the central powers will understand why the question of economic <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>boycott has raised voices of warning and apprehension also in the countries of the entente. Where, it is being asked, are to be found markets after the war to compensate for the old? Will not this enormous volume of goods serve to destroy rather than benefit the countries where it will go? And where is France going to get the goods which during the past decades have come to her from Germany? Has not nature destined France and Italy to be competitors in their exports rather than each other's costumers? Besides, will not the greatest danger for "old Europe, " after the war hail from America and Japan? These countries are likely to press forward with their goods where the Europeans have closed the doors upon their own abilities..........</p>
   <p>This much is certain that "the war following the war" will be fought under conditions differing greatly from those of the day when the gun barked in Sarajevo in 1914. What has occurred during the two and three fourth years since then, has already transformed the world in many ways. Fear of extinction has driven man to develop an excellency of technique in all lines of mechanical engineering; this will persist after the war is over, and the advance brought about during the war will be utilized in the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>following peace time competition. In this competition yet to come, victory more than ever will depend upon the ability of the competing nations to take advantage of the conquests of the human mind.</p>
   <p>And there are other factors too, which will alter the conditions under which the coming competition will be conducted. Social conditions, especially in the countries at war, will have undergone great changes. The long years passed in the trenches by millions have caused a mixing of the various social classes which will make a return difficult to the pre-war social attitudes. And what the trenches did not accomplish, the concentration camps for captives undoubtedly have done. These factors will be felt both in national and international life. Prejudice and ignorance will yield to sympathy and knowledge. Knowledge and insight have been acquired. This fact will and must influence also the daily toil.</p>
   <p>The nations, too, will need to seek new forms for their work. Other countries besides Russia will find it necessary to shake off the old coat and put on a new. The form <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of constitutional government which so far has held sway in a number of European states will hardly survive long after the present day. At the same time there is no blinding oneself to the fact that democracies, too, have been unable to keep out of the witches' dance.</p>
   <p>Where, then, is the salvation of the Future? Socialism? - Hardly!</p>
   <p>It is true, of course, that extreme necessity has driven nations at war as well as nations at peace into experiments at State Socialism to a large measure. But we are hardly mistaken in believing that these experiments have hardly created a taste for more, outside of the circle of those who have already joined the cause. We do not believe that private initiative has received its death knell through the experiments. Rather do we believe, that even the nations will take advantage of this same private initiative to a far greater extent than before, when the day comes to raise again the world from the morass of blood and misery into which it remains sunken at present.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>In any event, the tasks to be undertaken and the problems to be solved after the conclusion of the war are enormous. The important task now is to prepare while the opportunity is ours.</p>
