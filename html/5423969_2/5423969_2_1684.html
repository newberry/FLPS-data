   <p>p.5. The Bjorgvin Male Chorus gave a concert last Sunday (February 5) in memory of n grand old man and world famous violinist, Ole Bull. The concert was followed by a sumptuous banquet for members, their families and specially invited friends, including representatives of Chicago's Norwegian press. Many were unable to attend on account of a raging snow storm, but the concert went over perfectly and all talent was of the "home" variety.</p>
   <p>Bjorgvin made a very good impression and is to be heartily complimented on the wonderful progress it has made during the short time it has worked under the directorship of Mr. Joel Mossberg (a veteran director of renown). Up to the present time Bjorgvin has been handicapped by several changes in directorship, which is always a disturbing and disintegrating factor in such an organization, but the chorus is now assured of the continued leadership of Mr. Mossberg, and we look for a "Bjorgvin par excellence" in the near future. The faithfulness of these men deserve the greatest success.</p>

   <p>Guest artists were Mr. Dybdahl, violinist, who played Ole Bulle's "Soetegentens Sondag" (The chalet girls Sunday) and Grieg's "Sonata in F" in his usual masterful way, and Mr. Tom Bo, a student at the Chicago Musical College who sang Alfred Paulsen's "Norge, mit Norge" (Norway, my Norway), artistically and with feeling.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers during the banquet were Mr. J. Jaeger, Sigurd Dahl and Finn Simonsen all of whom had known Ole Bull personally, and who held him in high esteem as a musician and friend.</p>
   <p>Toasts were also proposed by Messrs. Ericksen, Kramer, Remertsen and the Norwegian American artist Ben Bleusem. Music during the banquet was furnished by the "Norda" ladies quartet and an orchestra. The entire evening was one of real enjoyment and good will; petty jealousies and disagreements as are usualy found in such a gathering were pleasingly, conspicuously absent. The spirit of utmost friendliness ruled in regal state indeed.</p>
