   <p>The Norwegian Colony of Chicago has a new musical organization from which we expect some good entertainment. The Liberty and the Northern Light Bands have been losing members through moving, sickness, age and other reasons, so they have combined forces and taken the name of "Northwest Band."</p>
   <p>The Liberty band was not a very old organization, as it was organized from remants of the old Normania Band, the first Norwegian band in Chicago and the second in the United States. Only one of the original members of this band is still active, Mr. Chas. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. N. Pedersen was the first conductor.</p>
   <p>The Northern Light band was organized twenty years ago, and for a number of years was one of Chicago's favorite bands, especially among the Norwegians and Danes.</p>
   <p>The merged band will have about twenty-five members and intends to give a number of concerts for the benefit of their treasury. Math Pedersen, the veteran band-master, will conduct the band, which will hold its rehearsals every Tuesday evening at Gieses Hall, Division Street and California Avenue. Oscar Gray is the president of the new band and Chas. Nergaard is the secretary.</p>
