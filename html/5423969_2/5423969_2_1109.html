   <p>On Wednesday, October 24, the depositors of the bankrupt Milwaukee Avenue State Bank (Stensland's Bank) were fortunate enough to receive a twenty per cent payment on their savings, the second twenty per cent payment since John C. Fetzer became the receiver.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fetzer's opinion is that he will be able to make another payment in November that will bring the payment up to sixty-five cents on the dollar.</p>
