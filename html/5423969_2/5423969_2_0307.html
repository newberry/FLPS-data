   <p>Boodlers in high and low places and their rascally tools are getting somewhat uneasy. The dragnet of the grand jury has brought up from the murky pools of corruption some hideous creatures whose convulsive wrigglings are hurtful to their eyes.</p>
   <p>The audacity of the corruptionists is truly astounding. It would appear that they even are ready to railroad innocent people to the penitentiary in order to cover up their tracks. The blackness of night becomes a radiant light in comparison with such hellish designs.</p>
   <p>It may be that they have overreached themselves. Justice is often thwarted and always delayed. But some day even the cunningest scoundrels are caught in the meshes of the law.</p>

   <p>This paper has always fought the boodlers and always will. The penitentiary is the place for them, and that is where they will go, if we have our say-so.</p>
