   <p>For the last fifty years Norwegians have ranked among the best immigrants that have come to this country.</p>
   <p>These former immigrants and their descendants have now become a strong national factor, for they have by hard labor, honesty, and love of independence developed a part of this large country to such an extent that we who are of this race can point with pride to great and everlasting results. In fact, the work of the Norwegian male is so well known that the previous statement may bore you, and I make this slight reference to the standing of the Norwegian citizen just as an introduction.</p>
   <p>But what of the Norwegian woman as a factor in this great undertaking? We know that as a pioneer she stands unrivalled, as a mother she is matchless, and as to her ambitions, we know that if she has been denied great benefits, her children must and shall have them if it is in her power! For she knows that knowledge is <span class="page-break">\2</span>power. She is of sturdy stock and whether educated or not has within her elements of strength, of beauty, and of imagination that are unsurpassed.</p>
   <p>What a splendid heritage, and how pregnant in possibilities!</p>
   <p>Now after a period of fifty years in her adopted country and with these splendid qualities, how does she rank? Among the very highest, you will say. She is known in music, in art, in song, and in story; but how? And here truth compels us to say: only as an individual.</p>
   <p>As a Norwegian-American citizen of Chicago it has been a mystery to me for years why there was not a strong united movement of some kind among so many finely educated and earnest women. Those of us who have felt the need not only of human fellowship but also of larger intellectual and civic growth have been compelled to [leave such needs unsatisfied] or to find (?) ourselves in some American club.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>I admit, of course (and now I am restricting myself to conditions in Chicago), that we have a great number of "reading clubs" and "social cliques," but I have never heard of them as being part of any great movement.</p>
   <p>When I speak of a movement, I mean a union of all women standing for something, as certain woman's clubs do. Those of us who are club members know that the smaller clubs have the privilege of joining the larger federation of clubs, and there we enter an arena where women stand side by side irrespective of nationality.</p>
   <p>In what way do we Norwegian women show our position and our rank in our city?</p>
   <p>As a member of the American-Scandinavian Society I should have deemed it a privilege for a "Norwegian-American Woman's Club" to have received the secretary of the Society at the Art Institute. But no. We seem to be obliged to leave all such functions to the men; and why?</p>
   <p>I doubt whether there are any women born that have a greater heritage or more to <span class="page-break">\4</span>be proud of than we of Viking birth, with our folklore, our music, our legends, our history, and a mother country unsurpassed in natural beauty! Is it not because we are intolerant and afraid that some one may come into our charmed circle who is not of our set? Is it not a feeling of class, a spirit of "I am better than thou"? We boast of our republican sentiments, but are we Norwegian women really broad and tolerant?</p>
   <p>To me there is no factor so great in broadening a woman as club life. Here poor and rich are equal--if not intellectually, in other things that are vital to women; and here they meet on neutral ground. This ground should be so elastic that we could take into our midst women who need us, and women who would help us.</p>
   <p>It is not what clubs do for us that is so valuable, but what we give to our clubs, what of tolerance, of charity, and of sympathy. Is there not a great need in Chicago for a "Norwegian Woman's Club"? Wherever you travel, you hear of the advanced position of our women in Norway. We are proud of their position, but how shall we justify ours?</p>
