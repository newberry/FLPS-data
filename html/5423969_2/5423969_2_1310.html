   <p>Mr. Emil Bjorn's latest composition, "Ye Artists' March", published by the S. Brainard Sons' Company, has just appeared. The march was first played by Mr. Bjorn's orchestra at the Auditorium on the occasion of the Seventeenth of May festival, and all the musicians present spoke in high praise of the composition. Several of them made arrangements to secure the use of the piece for various "Summer Gardens". At present the new composition is being played at Bismark Garden, Germania, Kinsley's, the Great Northern Theater, Humboldt Park House, and at other places.</p>
   <p>Now the composition has been published for piano. Mr. Bjorn himself has drawn the title page, a "funny poster" in many colors, showing "Ye Artists" marching off with full pack for a tour of sketching.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bjorn is very popular both among his American colleagues and among his countrymen, and as a consequence his piece has had a large sale. The march is light, merry, and appealing.....</p>
