   <p>The society has many guests and is a good host. A wreath is received from Ole Bull's widow. A pleasant evening, a success from beginning to end, such was the unanimous appraisal of the twenty-five years jubilee festival by Bjorgvin.</p>
   <p>The hall was beautifully decorated, and four large tables were carrying the liquid and solid refreshments. There were several excellent speeches relative to the significance of the Bjorgvin in the life of the Norwegians in Chicago, as well as the significance of the Norwegians in the life of the nation. Mrs. Ole Bull had sent a beautiful laurel wreath which was given a place of honor beside the picture of Ole Bull. A number of other greetings and congratulations, by telegrams, letters, and deputations gave evidence of the high regard Bjorgvin has won among the Norwegians.</p>
