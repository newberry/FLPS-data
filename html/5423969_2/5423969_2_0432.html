   <p>What is the basic objective of the war? The war is an attempt by the human society, to put things in order, to place its possessions of the earth on a secure basis. Nobody joins the war's carnival of butchery because he enjoys it. All the people, friends or foes, white or black, desire the right to their lives fully and freely, to get as much enjoyment out of life as possible, to have as much liberty as is consistent with the liberty of the neighbors; and, possibly to leave the world a little better than they found it. There are exceptions, people who think that war is really the main objective of life, but people of grown-up minds do not think that way. The world has sunk, at present, into barbary, not because people love barbary, but because the foundation of society is rotten. It failed, and broke, and we all are fighting <span class="page-break">2</span>among the pieces of wreckage, searching for materials for a new foundation.</p>
   <p>But our struggles will be in vain if we do not realize that the material in the old building was not at fault, but the architecture. Humanity,itself,was not wrong but the system within which humanity had become imprisoned. This is the ray of hope in the tragic affair; for we are able to change a system; we cannot change humanity. If the old system be maintained then it does not matter much which group wins the war. Humanity as a whole will have lost. Humanity will become entwined in the old net of enmities and will be drifting toward a new Niagara as inevitably and as helpless as was the one in 1914.</p>
   <p>The whole idea of society must be changed if we are to escape such a tragedy. We must learn to hang together in order to escape being hung one by one. When Ruskin said that cooperation in all things is the law of life, and that competition is the law of death, he was derided as an idealist. His <span class="page-break">3</span>statement, however, was one of practical wisdom, and if there is any hope for man at present, it grows from the fact that there are indications that this wisdoem is being understood in many places.</p>
   <p>Let us see how this ideal has advanced along big lines. If we consider the world situation one year back, there is in one sense not much reason for rejoicing. But if we consider the ideas which were predominant then, we will realize that in the meanwhile an enormous change has taken place, a change for worse if the desire is for a world of war, a change for better if the desire is for a world of peace.</p>
   <p>What idea was under discussion one year ago? It was the idea of an economic war to follow the war of arms. The peace to come was, not to end war, but rather to facilitate a new phase of the war. Europe was about to organize into two camps for the purpose of starting commercial warfare as soon as the soldiers had left the battlefield. In Germany <span class="page-break">4</span>Dr. Naumann was working on his Middle Europe theme, which implied the economic fencing off of Central Europe from the Baltic to the Black Sea. And at Paris, the entente was discussing means of shutting off Germany. We have before us an unending vista of war. We could not expect a new world as the fruit of the blood that had been sacrificed; we were to have a return of the old world in a vastly more wicked form.</p>
   <p>This vista has disappeared, however, both in Germany and here. In Austria there was no enthusiasm for the Naumann plans, and the Paris proposals were still-born. Now no one seems to have the courage to remind us of them. Not only were they impractical basically, but they were also dangerous as regards our relation to the neutral world and, more particularly, to the United States. And upon the entrance of the latter into the war, the ideas expressed in the proposals have evaporated altogether.</p>
   <p>The idea which is dominant at present is entirely different. It is the product of two events - the fall of the Russian autocracy, and the entrance of the <span class="page-break">5</span>United States into the war. The new idea is, in the words of President Wilson, to make the world safe for democracy. The thought underlying the plans of Naumann and of the Paris conference was to have the world continue on the same basis as before the war. The aristocratic rulers were to continue in power; the enmity between nations was to continue; the armament race was to continue on a scale greater than before; commerce was to be guided by the sword; diplomacy was to start again its secret plots, and the common people as of old, were to be used for cannon fodder.</p>
   <p>The events of this spring has done away with these propositions.</p>
   <p>America has entered the war,not to just win the war for the entente powers but to win it for humanity. The objective in beating Germany is not to keep the world going in the same direction but to create new roads and new vistas. Obstacles for common security are to be done away with in order to make possible a world ruled by reason, where we may buy and sell, work and play, live and die <span class="page-break">6</span>without being exposed to periodic explosions of a subterranean volcano . No longer is forced to throw its terrifying shadow over the lives of men; it is reduced to its true function as the guardian of universal peace.</p>
