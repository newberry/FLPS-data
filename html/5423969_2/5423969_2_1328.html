   <p>The Chicago Norwegian Club's art exhibit was one of the outstanding events of the year. Every Norwegian-American artist of note was exhibited.</p>
   <p>Let us begin with what we may call the professional artists. Jonas Lie leads as the best; his picture, "Mackerel Fishing," was sold for $3,000. Professor Olaf Branner was second with his picture, "North Cape". Now comes our own Emil Bjorn. His "The Discovery of America" is considered an outstanding piece of art. Christian Bagge, with his "Skyscrapers," has caused a lot of comments. John Larsen's "Leif Lands in America" is outstanding. Others represented at the exhibit were: Oscar Lumby, Claire Opstad, Oscar Olsen, C. Sannem, Helga Hong, and Dorothy Visju Anderson.</p>
