   <p>The Entertainment offered by Fridthjof Werenskjold at the Humboldt Park Parish House on Saturday attracted an over-crowded house and enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Magda Aas presented some beautiful classical dances; Otto Clausen and Johan Dybdahl, the violinist, both were reaping well deserved applause, and finally Werenskjold came with his stories and declamations, and needless to say, he produced many hearty laughs.</p>
   <p>The performance was given for the benefit of a Norwegian artist in Chicago.</p>
