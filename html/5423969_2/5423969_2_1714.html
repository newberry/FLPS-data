   <p>Scandinavians in Chicago are widely distributed throughout the area of this large city; they have but scant opportunity for meeting their countrymen and enjoying one another's company; for this reason they will surely greet with pleasure and joy the plan announced by Consul John R. Lindgren (Dane) and endorsed by the two other Scandinavian consuls, as well as by other leaders among Scandinavians in Chicago. Because of the fact that the new organization, which was originally planned as a committee on arrangements to provide musical entertainment, has so far presented merely a temporary plan for its work--a plan to be studied in detail later--I shall take the liberty of presenting a few preliminary remarks which might serve to clarify the situation and therefore be of use when more detailed plans for the new organization are to be formed. I take this liberty as one who is already connected with musical organizations in Chicago....My remarks will be based on the knowledge I have of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Norwegian societies, musical and otherwise. To a considerable extent the conditions prevailing in the Norwegian societies will probably find parallels in the Swedish and Danish societies as well.</p>
   <p>The main idea to bring together the three Scandinavian groups here in Chicago into cordial association as neighboring people, and to lend further impetus to the musical development among us--is so attractive....that it is important to establish this idea upon a firm foundation, in order that every one of our compatriots may be enabled to participate in the common aim and to support the work implied in the plan.</p>
   <p>Permit me to quote here a paragraph from the annual report of the Danish-American Association: "This association is not meant to supplant or make superfluous any other existing Danish-American organization. Its policy is one of co-operation; its objective is the furtherance of Danish-American community interests; its goal is unity..." This part of the annual report of the Danish-American Association should fit in with the program of the new organization.</p>

   <p>When,as at present, we are planning for one or more concerts, the first question that forces itself upon us is: In what manner can we do our work without competing with or opposing those societies whose purpose for years has been the furtherance of musical development and appreciation among our countrymen? Among us Scandinavians we find a large number of singing societies, and in addition a number of mixed choruses and church choirs, all of which give concerts featuring the work of Scandinavian composers. The competition is all the greater because societies that are not primarily musical likewise arrange entertainments and "concerts".</p>
   <p>Our singing societies that have been striving to further musical culture within our groups have kept up their courage even while working under steady financial pressure. Sometimes individually, sometimes in groups, these singing societies have given concerts of musical value; occasionally, united choruses have also given song festivals in other parts of the country. At these festivals the public has been given an opportunity to listen to singers of note, frequently engaged from Europe.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Instructions in choral singing are given from week to week. The co-operation of our singing societies is solicited with considerable regularity by our benevolent societies, and the singers have shown their willingness to help on a large number of occasions. Now that this new organization is being formed, it is important to arrange its activities in such a way that it does not make any present organization superfluous; the idea of co-operation must be established on a basis that can be justified with reference to existing societies.</p>
   <p>For the purpose of aiding in the solution of the difficulties which may arise in this connection, I beg to suggest the following:</p>
   <p>1. Our brilliant Thomas Orchestra from time to time includes in its program the more important of our Nordic musical compositions. Ordinarily, however, the majority of our countrymen are not informed of this until after the compositions have been performed. At the same time it must be admitted that the efforts of this orchestra are probably not sufficiently appreciated by the Scandinavian public. Applause must be tendered the work of the composer, but the compatriots of the composer who did not attend must be considered uncultured and indifferent. These are matters which should be taken into account.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>2. In the various summer gardens Scandinavian music is occasionally heard. I suppose there are but few Scandinavians who knew that the solo cellist with the Damrosch Orchestra last summer was the famous Danish cellist Henry Bramsen.</p>
   <p>3. Shortly after the death of Edvard Grieg, Mr. Emil Liebling gave a most interesting and instructive lecture on the music created by Grieg. The lecture was given at Kimball Hall which was filled to capacity. I believe that I was the only Norwegian present; I stayed near the entrance, watching for people of my circle of acquaintances.</p>
   <p>4. Famous singers and instrumentalists give recitals with Scandinavian compositions on their programs quite regularly.</p>
   <p>5. St. Olaf's Band gave a concert at Orchestra Hall to a half-filled house. It was a pity that there were not enough Norwegians to fill the Hall to hear how well this band played. It was a pity that these students from St. Olaf's College did not receive reasonable encouragement on this occasion from the compatriots of their fathers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>6. A young Norwegian woman violinist, without money or friends, was aided by some people interested in music in getting a concert arranged. She did make a little money from the concert, but she could get no more openings. Now she is a housemaid.</p>
   <p>7. A Norwegian woman pianist gave a recital downtown about a year ago. A snowstorm set in during the evening, and the present writer was the only "audience" in the hall.</p>
   <p>Will this new organization, considered as a musical institution, be able to fill a need long felt among us--the need of educating our public so as to make the people realize that we Scandinavians have come from environments where music forms the very strongest impulse in our culture; that our music has its roots in the life of the Scandinavian people; and that our great musicians are the products of the spirit and culture of our countries?</p>
   <p>It seems to me that it ought to be possible, through our press or through special publications, to spread information about Scandinavian music of value <span class="page-break">\7</span>produced on various occasions by "responsible people" here in Chicago, so that the organization might step in and lend support in cases where it was found that a musical group was working toward presenting something of value, or where such a group was experiencing financial or other difficulties in the execution of its tasks as a musical organization. Such publicity would enable our benevolent societies to benefit from the activity of the new organization in its capacity as a sort of musical central committee or clearing house. As such, the organization might arrange for musical entertainment in these benevolent societies, and provide music and even musical instruments where needed for those people, young or old, who are confined in institutions and do not have the opportunities for hearing Nordic music that are available to people on the outside.</p>
   <p>I believe that, if conducted on some such basis as here indicated, the new organization is justified among our countrymen, and that its objective is laudable. The organization will then furnish a much needed support at concerts to be given by our musical societies;....it will aid the benevolent institutions in a manner which would not be discriminatory and along lines which have <span class="page-break">\8</span>thus far been too much neglected.</p>
   <p>With such a program the objective of the new organization would seem fully justified--an organization working for co-operation in attaining the goal of unification of interests and activities.</p>
