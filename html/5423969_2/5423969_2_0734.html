   <p>In 1837 there were about one thousand houses in Chicago,[of which approximately twenty were brick and the remainder were wooden shacks].</p>
   <p>In the great fire of 1871, most of the houses built before 1838 were destroyed.</p>
   <p>But today we find a row of old buildings on the west side of State Street, between 9th and 12th streets. This row of buildings bears the name, "Rotten Row." It is a menace to the town; a fire starting there would spread and might cause a conflagration as bad as the one in 1871.</p>
   <p>It is high time that our city wrecked these houses; they are nearly all houses of prostitution, where unsuspecting men are robbed and murdered.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mayor, get rid of this "eyesore."</p>
