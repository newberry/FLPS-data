   <p>p.8....................A well-known member of our Norwegian colony has invented an appliance that is unusual to say the least. For some unaccountable reason we are forbidden to disclose the name of the inventor at this time but if his appliances will do what is claimed for it his identity cannot be hidden.</p>
   <p>Mr. Blank has made an electrical shaving machine that gives a closer shave than the old style razor and courtplaster, styptic pencils and other accessories, usually kept handy in case of cuts and nicks customary while using the old blade, may be thrown away as cutting ones face is impossible. Shaving soap and brush, hone and strop are all to be relegated to the scrap heap except the few that will be preserved in various museums. We wonder, however, whether the thrill of any young man's first shave will be the same.</p>
