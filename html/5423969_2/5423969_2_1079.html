   <p>p.6...Norwegian thrift, energy and ambition have again combined to make possible the opening of one of Chicago's largest and finest stores dealing in men's and boys' clothing. John M. Erickson &amp; Sons are today throwing open their doors to the new place on Milwaukee and Armitage, the Northwestern flat iron building, where they are offering a gigantic stock of high grade clothing at remarkably low prices, ranging from $10 to $30. Customers attending the opening will be entertained throughout the day and evening by an excellent orchestra; souvenirs and flowers will be given every visitor. A feeling of homey friendliness encompasses one during a visit to the new mart and our colony will always be warmly welcomed by the genial personnel of the establishment. This store bears the distinction of being the only place on Milwaukee Ave. where every garment is absolutely fresh and new.</p>
   <p>Besides John M. Erickson and his sons we find the ever smiling countenances, and rotund figures of our old friends, long and well-known <span class="page-break">2</span>throughout the Norwegian colony, Jorgen Olsen and Johnann Ecker, who literally swelled with pride while showing the public around this model store.</p>
