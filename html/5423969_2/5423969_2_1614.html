   <p>The concert given by the [Danish] Harmonien (Harmony) Singing Society and the [Norwegian] Bjorgvin Singing Society was so well attended that every inch of standing room was occupied.</p>
   <p>The program opened with a selection by the well-known pianist, Mrs. Agnes Mathiesen, after which the Harmonien Society sang the national anthem. The Bjorgvin Society then offered several numbers.....The two choruses closed the program with the singing of "Olaf Trygvason" and "The Star-Spangled Banner". The combined chorus was under the direction of Joel Mossberg [Swede].</p>
