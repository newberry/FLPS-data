   <p>In his message to Congress, President Wilson once more calls attention to the objective of the war so far as the United States is concerned, an objective which our chief allies in the war will undoubtedly acknowledge as theirs also.</p>
   <p>Our objective, present and future, says the president, is to win this war; and nothing can make us deviate from our course until the objective is gained.</p>
   <p>"Those who desire to bring about peace before this goal is attained, should employ their services and advice elsewhere; we do not want them."</p>
   <p>German domination "consisting of intrigue combined with assault" must be crushed, and if not completely crushed, it must, at least, be excluded from <span class="page-break">2</span>the cordial intercourse between nations.</p>
   <p>When the present rules of Germany have been replaced by reliable spokesman for the German people, ready to join in arrangements intended to protect the world against future wars, "we are willing to pay the full price of peace" and this peace is to be "justice at every point and for every nation. The final arrangement must touch our enemies as well as our friends." "Only then will we consider the war won," the president says, "when the German nation, through suitably authorized representatives informs us that it is ready to join in an agreement based upon justice, and restitution for the injustice and the destructive acts committed by its rulers. They have assaulted Belgium, which, therefore, must be given restitution."</p>
   <p>The president states that Germany must give up, not merely Belgium and Northern France, but must also relinquish its domination over Austria-Hungary,over its other allies in Europe and Asia. There is no intention of weakening or rearranging Austria-Hungary, but this country must be given control of its own affairs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The acts of deep injustice committed during the present war call for restitution, and restitution must be rendered, but not by "similar injustice, against Germany and its allies." Humane considerations excludes "revenge of any kindâ€œ when peace is concluded. The central powers must not "be robbed or punished because the irresponsible ruler of our country has committed serious and odious injustice.</p>
   <p>The nations have a right, "not merely to open lanes on the sea, but also to open and secure access to these lanes." This is true not only of the weaker nations, but also of the stronger ones, friends as well as foes, Austria as well as Serbia and Poland.</p>
   <p>Such is, briefly, the president's presentation of the principles for which our nation is carrying on war. His message is not needed so far as the American people is concerned, our nation is standing united and determined by the president. For this reason, the message is addressed to the American Congress, primarily as a matter of form. It is really, a message to the world, a vigorous and eloquent <span class="page-break">4</span>re-iteration of the paths we are to follow, motives for our action and goals we have decided to attain in this war.</p>
   <p>The president recommends that war be declared against Austria-Hungary. This is logical and will serve to make it evident to the Italian people that its participation in this war is not being ignored by America. As long as Austria is fighting under German control and supported by German armies, it is making of itself an enemy of the United States.</p>
