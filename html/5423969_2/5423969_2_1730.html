   <p>The resolution of the Norwegian Singing Society to go to Norway in 1914 has caused considerable discussion among our singers. Since I am the one who first suggested the excursion, I shall beg permission through the Skandinaven to present certain phases of the undertaking which may not be clear to some of the singers.</p>
   <p>Many seem to be of the opinion that it is the intention to exclude from participation in the excursion singers who do not belong to the Norwegian Singing Society. This is not the intention at all. We wish that as many of the members of other singing societies as possible may take part so that we may form a very large chorus.</p>
   <p>One of our well-known musicians expressed the desire that singers should be <span class="page-break">2</span>mobilized from various parts of the country in order that the chorus might be as large and as representative as possible. How he intended to manage the task of having these singers practice together for harmonious blending of the voices, I do not know. I believe that one or two years of practice would be required. We must not offer the Norwegian public the type of chorus singing that is rendered here at our song festivals, and it seems likely that the idea of a chorus with members from all over America will be abandoned. For this reason, I did not present the matter to the Northwestern Singing Association.</p>
   <p>But what about the Norwegian Singing Association in Chicago? people will ask. The trouble here is that under its statutes the Association has no obligations towards the individual singing societies belonging under it, or vice versa, and since new delegations are elected from the singing societies to the conventions of the Association from year to year, an undertaking necessitating expenses into thousands of dollars would not have sufficiently substantial backing in the Norwegian Singing Association of Chicago.</p>

   <p>Since the Norwegian Singing Society has taken the initiative in organizing such a chorus, giving all singers who are willing and able a chance to participate, the undertaking ought to be supported by all sincere singers. Everybody knows, in addition, that many singers, and among them several whom we cannot afford to leave out, are not in a position financially to meet the large expenses incidental to a tour to Norway. It is therefore the intention of the Norwegian Singing Society to give financial aid to as many of these as possible, and for this reason we are hoping for support not only from the Norwegian Singing Association in Chicago and from the Norwegian National Association, but from every Norwegian man and woman in Chicago, and, for that matter, everywhere in the country. Thus it will be the Norwegian people in America who will be sending a chorus home to Norway, and we wish to send the best representation possible.</p>
   <p>And now a word to those who are thinking in terms of the honor involved. The committee selected will elect a temporary president. Two years before the departure an instructor will be elected and he will then start the work <span class="page-break">4</span>of practicing the choral singing. Later, when the chorus has been completed, a president and other officials will be elected. On the other hand, instruction will be started soon in the songs that have been selected. Those who do not belong to any singing society, but are in possession of good voices, need to join the group as early as possible if they wish to be included.</p>
   <p>Do not expect to be admitted at the last moment; the chorus which is to represent the Norwegians in America at the centennial celebration in Norway in 1914, must be so well practiced that it will do honor to the Norwegian singers in America.</p>
   <p>Admission to the chorus may be arranged through communication with the present writer. Information may be had by addressing me at 1355 North Kimball Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
