   <p>The Chicago Tribune has published a list containing the names of some 1,300 soldiers who have died from disease in the various camps in Cuba, Porto Rico, Manila, and this country, since the Army was placed upon a war footing. In presenting these lists, we quote the Tribune in English:</p>
   <p>"While 350 officers and men have been killed in battle or died of wounds received, there have died of disease in camps somewhere between 1,300 and 2,000 volunteers and regulars. The Tribune, after over a week of incessant effort, has secured the names of 1,299 who answered their country's call for men to fight, only to die in fever-stricken camps, on transports, or, perhaps at home, after contracting the dread malady at one of the camps. There is no doubt about the 1,299 whose names have been secured. Neither is there much doubt that there are hundreds dead whose names could not be secured on account of lack of records and inability or unwillingness of Army officers to furnish lists of the dead."</p>

   <p>Assuming that the number of victims will reach 2,000, our losses from fevers and kindred causes certainly appear large at first sight, yet they are much smaller than was anticipated by all well-informed people, the Tribune not excepted. Military camps invariably breed more or less disease. Everybody knew that the war would have to be conducted in a deadly climate, in localities reeking with miasma of every description. Those who were most clamorous for war and who were most lavish with abuse of the government because it did not rush into war fast enough to suit them, knew, as did everybody else, that sickness would prove a more dangerous foe than Spanish bullets. The expected has happened. What was anticipated has come to pass; the hospitals count more victims than do the battlefields.</p>
   <p>Our casualities in battle were so exceptionally small that any considerable loss from other causes would seem large in comparison. But as a matter of fact, the death rate in the Army, excepting those who died in battle or as a result of wounds, does not exceed the normal death ratio prevailing in most of our cities. According to Adjutant General Corbin, the total number of deaths from disease will <span class="page-break">3</span>reach 1,500 in an army of 275,000 men during four months of service in camps and in the field. In other words, the loss from this cause is about one-half of one per cent in four months, or at the rate of twenty-six per thousand per annum, which is below the normal death rate in a majority of the large cities in the world.</p>
   <p>Considering the unhealthy climatic conditions to which our unseasoned forces have been exposed, this is a remarkably good showing, except in the eyes of those newspapers that speak as if men who make war ought to be exempt from the very dangers they boldly face--disease and death.</p>
   <p>If we compare the Cuban War with other wars that have been fought during the last fifty years our losses will appear still more insignificant. Of the English Army of 97,000 men in Crimea, 2,755 were killed in battle and 17,000 died from disease. The French Army numbered 309,000 men, 8,490 of whom were killed in battle, while 11,750 died from wounds, and 75,000 from disease. Of the Russian Army of 888,000 men, 30,000 were killed, 42,000 died from wounds, and 374,000 died of disease. Seventy-one per cent of the French <span class="page-break">4</span>Army and 147 per cent of the English Army were patients in hospitals during the War; in other words, nearly three out of four French soldiers were on the sick list, while every English soldier was in a hospital once, and every other English soldier twice.</p>
   <p>The French-Italian War against Austria in 1859 was fought under favorable sanitary conditions, yet the French lost 2,040 men from disease compared to 2,536 killed in battle. In the Mexican War, France lost 1,180 men in battle, and 4,925 men from disease out of an army of 35,000 men. The Franco-Prussian War is noted for its bloody and fierce battles; the Germans left 19,782 dead on the field, while 14,259 died in hospitals from diseases not caused by wounds. Though the French fought in their own country, they lost 45,000 men from sickness and 41,000 were killed in battle. The loss of the Union Army in the Civil War was approximately 1.9 per cent killed in battle and 6.4 per cent from deaths caused by fevers and other forms of disease.</p>
   <p>Contrast with these appalling figures our losses in the Cuban War! The percentage of those killed does not exceed one-ninth of one per cent <span class="page-break">5</span>and our losses from disease are only about one-half of one per cent of all forces under arms! It is a miraculous record.</p>
   <p>The whole history of human wars may be searched in vain for anything approaching it in the providential smallness of sacrifice of human life compared with the results obtained. Nobody knows the true character and extent of our losses better than the Tribune. It has been classed with the most vicious among our yellow journals in its treatment of the alleged neglect and abuse of our soldiers, and its accounts may have lent color to the charge. But by publishing its roster of death our contemporary has relieved the public mind of needless apprehensions; and has relieved itself of the odium of serving unpatriotic purposes. In so doing the Tribune has performed a great service to the public, which will be duly appreciated by all fair-minded thinking men and women.</p>
