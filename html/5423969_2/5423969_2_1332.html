   <p>The Norwegian sculptor Sigvald Asbjornsen, completed the tablet for the statue of "The Gold Star Mother." Mr. Asbjornsen's temporary studio is located at the Chicago Historical Society. The statue portrays a woman in life size standing on top of a rock. The figure holds a sword suspended over its head, and grasps the hilt of the sword with both hands. The expression of the face is heroic in its sorrow. A poem was written by Mr. Fred Bentlie, "Dedicated to Mr. Asbjornsen's Gold Star Statue". [The text of the poem is omitted in translation.]</p>
