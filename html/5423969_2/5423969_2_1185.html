   <p>Mrs. Josephine Mansen, well-known and able artist of the Chicago Norwegian Colony, has now returned from a tour through European countries where she studied the latest developements in her special line, painting on porcelain. During her tour she visited France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.</p>
   <p>The art of porcelain painting at its best she found in France. Mrs. Mansen secured a great many of the latest and most beautiful patterns in Europe. A visit to her studio to view her beautiful art will be a time well spent and, having already visited the place, we are not hesitant in predicting that porcelain decorated by Mrs. Mansen will be ordered faster than the lady can possibly do the work.</p>
