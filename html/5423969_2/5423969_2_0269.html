   <p>Justice Olaf Seversen of the West Chicago Avenue police court has for some ten years "kept a clean court," as the saying goes, and should be re-appointed. Too many of our justice courts are "justice shops" for bargains of iniquity, and too many of our justices of the peace are utterly destitute of every attribute of a just and upright judge.</p>
   <p>Justice Seversen and his court are not in this class. His office has been administered to the entire satisfaction of the better class of people of the district, regardless of their politics. The only complaints against his administration have come from the vicious elements who have received just punishment in his court, even though they happened to have a "pull," and from a certain group of low grade politicians who have discovered that he is not a man to be intimidated by threats or swayed by any sort of improper "influence." The West Chicago Avenue district is the most peaceable, law-abiding, and orderly <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the city, and this desirable condition of affairs is largely due to Mr. Seversen's honest and vigorous administration of justice in the West Chicago Avenue police court.</p>
   <p>The people of Chicago are thoroughly aroused to the necessity of "justice shop reform". Legislation may be necessary, but unless we secure good men for justices no legislation will avail to right existing wrongs. In order to cleanse and elevate the bench of popular justice we should endeavor to keep the good men we have and replace corrupt and incompetent incumbents with the best men we can secure. Justice Olaf Seversen has been a good and faithful servant of the people. The sentiment among the people of his district is overwhelming in favor of his re-appointment. They have entire confidence in his integrity, fairness, and ability, and expect his re-appointment in compliance with their wishes and as a reward for his good work as a people's judge.</p>
