   <p>The Non-English press in this country has started a movement, through the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers, for the gathering of a fund to be used toward purchase of Christmas gifts for the American soldiers at the various fronts. Mr. Louis Hammerling, the president of the association has personally contributed $500.00 to the fund. It is the intention that soldiers using tobacco are to be supplied with some of this ware.</p>
   <p>Collection of funds take place under the supervision of the American Red Cross, this fact forming a guarantee that the money will be applied in the right way. When collections have been completed, the purchases will be made in one deal, making it possible to acquire the goods for gifts at about one half of their regular price.</p>

   <p>Contributions should be sent as early as possible since no contributions can be accepted after November 15. He who can spare but very little should not feel bashful about sending a small amount. He who has plenty should send plenty. Use postal money orders in sending the contributions. Skandinaven will receipt, in the paper, for all the contributions it is receiving, and the money will be forwarded to the treasurer of the fund.</p>
