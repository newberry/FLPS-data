   <p>Colonel August Jacobsen, former superior court clerk, well known among Scandinavians as the owner of the Wenslow subdivision, has been appointed administrator of the estate of the Bank of Chicago, by Judge Moore, after the previous administrator resigned from his post a few days ago.</p>
   <p>It is reported that Mr. Jacobsen did not apply for the job, and it is uncertain that he will accept it, particularly since a $50,000 bond is required.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jacobsen has lately been much in the public eye as a lecturer on financial matters, and as such has been acclaimed by the American press.</p>
