   <p>The Eureka-Wyoming Petroleum Company has just been organized by a group of Chicagoans, all Norwegians.</p>
   <p>The advisory board has been set up and consists of the following substantial business men: P. W. Stuhr, importer, J. Clementsen, president of the Clementsen Club, P. A. Pettersen, merchant, Thomas G. Pihlfeldt, engineer of bridges, Carl B. Moe, civil engineer, Paul J. Loberg, and Henry H. Stokes, manufacturer.</p>
   <p>The board of directors is as follows: C. F. Arnet, president, Dr. J. W. Hanshus, vice-president, C. T. Andrews, secretary-treasurer, H. Torgersen, counsel, and Dr. S. H. Hannestad.</p>
   <p>It seems that the people on the boards are sufficient guarantee that the new enterprise is safe. None of the above gentlemen have ever failed in anything that they have been connected with.</p>
