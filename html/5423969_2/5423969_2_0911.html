   <p>"A new law has recently been passed by Congress allowing certain persons to file second homestead entries. The bill was introduced by Senator Hansbrough, and it will be the means of helping a good many people to secure free homes now who have heretofore been denied the right under the old law."</p>
   <p>Many articles have appeared in the press to make the people believe that Senator Hansbrough is the father and real maker of the law concerning second homestead entries. Now, what are the facts? The facts, briefly stated, are as follows:</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the session of Congress several bills providing for second homestead entries were introduced. Two were taken up for consideration by the Public Lands Committee of the House; one of them had been presented <span class="page-break">\2</span>by Mr. A. J. Gronna, and the other by Mr. Mondell. The matter was referred to the Commissioner of the General Land Office and, as is usual in such cases, the bill reported out of the Committee was worded in accordance with the suggestions of the Commissioner. Mr. Gronna was selected by the Committee to make the report on the bill to the House. In his report he stated:</p>
   <p>"The necessity for the advisability of legislation from time to time providing for second homestead entries in cases where the entryman has been unable to perfect title to the land covered by his first entry, has long been recognized by Congress. In 1889, and again in 1900, legislation of this character was had; as time passes, and since the public lands subject to homestead entry are largely in regions where the perfecting of homestead entries is surrounded by many difficulties, the necessity for the legislation increases.</p>
   <p>"The American homesteader is constantly pushing forward from the confines of settlement on to new lands; and passing beyond the region of assured and plentiful rainfall he has, from time to time, invaded territory where conditions were such as to render it impossible for him in many cases to retain <span class="page-break">\3</span>his land and obtain title to it. Years of extreme drought and other conditions--sometimes permanent in character, sometimes temporary--have often compelled him to give up the struggle, and yet the spirit of the pioneer is so strong in the breasts of many of these men that after a lapse of a few years, during which time they have been able to somewhat recoup their fortunes, they desire to again make an effort to secure homes on the public lands.</p>
   <p>"These men make the best and most successful homesteaders in the regions where conditions are trying for the pioneer. They have had experience which qualifies them to cope with the conditions more successfully than the man who has never made the attempt and is unfamiliar with conditions in the region in which he desires to settle.</p>
   <p>"In the past few years the adoption of improved methods of cultivation and the introduction of crops suitable to semi-arid regions have encouraged the settlement of lands which a few years ago were considered valueless except <span class="page-break">\4</span>for grazing purposes. To cope with the situation in such regions no man is so well qualified as he who has had experience under somewhat similar circumstances."</p>
   <p>The bill passed the House as reported by Mr. Gronna, and was sent to the Senate and referred to the Senate Committee on Public Lands. This Committee recommended that Senate Bill No. 1387 be substituted for the Gronna bill and passed. The Gamble bill was passed by the Senate after adding to it an amendment offered by Mr. Clapp, which provided that "this act shall not apply to any land included under pending homestead entries".</p>
   <p>It is, of course, plain to everybody that this amendment cut the heart out of the bill and would have made the law absolutely worthless. Senator Hansbrough, a member of the Public Lands Committee of the Senate, understood that as well as anyone else.</p>
   <p>The House promptly disagreed with the Senate bill; but the Senate insisted, <span class="page-break">\5</span>and conferees were appointed. Among the conferees were Mr. Gronna from the House and Mr. Hansbrough from the Senate. After a hot battle in the conference committee, the House members won the day, and the bill as finally reported by the conference committee was the bill that had been originally reported by Mr. Gronna and had passed the House, with an unimportant addition. The bill was accepted in this form by both houses and became law on February 8, of this year.</p>
   <p>The new law, which, word for word is identical with the bill as reported by Mr. Gronna, with the exception of the two words, "or abandoned", reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"That any person who, prior to the passage of this act, has made entry under the homestead laws, but from any cause has lost, forfeited, or a bandoned the same, shall be entitled to the benefits of the homestead law as though such former entry had not been made, and any person applying for a second homestead under this act shall furnish the description and date of his former <span class="page-break">\6</span>entry: Provided, that the provisions of this act shall not apply to any person whose former entry was canceled for fraud, or who relinquished the former entry for a valuable consideration."</p>
   <p>As will be seen, Mr. Hansbrough had very little to do with the law. The bill was reported out of the Senate Committee by Senator Gamble and was in his charge during its consideration in the Senate. Mr. Hansbrough's name does not appear in connection with the measure at all until he was made one of the Senate conferees by virtue of his position as chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Lands. It is true he had introduced a bill for second homesteads (Senate Bill No. 1174), but his bill was never reported out of his own committee.</p>
   <p>The new law is a great boon to many poor and worthy people who, without any fault of their own, had lost their right to take a quarter-section of Uncle Sam's land. The right is now restored to them. The history of the fight for the passage of this measure is very interesting and may be read in full <span class="page-break">\7</span>in the Congressional Record, pages 574, 609, 610, 688, 725, 759, 769, 910, 952, 1210, 1295, 1353, 1453.</p>
   <p>The fact that Mr. Hansbrough's bill was not reported out of his own committee shows how much he was interested in a measure of this character. But now, that a law for second homestead entries has been placed on the statue books largely as a result of Mr. Gronna's able, vigorous, and persistent efforts--now the press comes sneaking around claiming all the credit and glory for Mr. Hansbrough! Some of his henchmen may not know any better. But Mr. Hansbrough himself knows that he did as much as the man in the moon to secure this law, and no more. That a Senator of the United States will stoop to such cheap tricks and despicable tactics for the purpose of misleading the people is a disgrace to the state he misrepresents and cannot but arouse contempt among manly and honest men.</p>
