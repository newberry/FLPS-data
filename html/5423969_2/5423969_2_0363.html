   <p>Several complaints have been lodged against Scandinavians connected with the Poor House. Here are a few of them: Supervisor Lagergren (Swedish), had been reported drunk several times, and was unfit for duty at the time he was drunk. Mr. Christianson (Norwegian) was drunk for three months, and Mr. Berglund (Norwegian), on several occasions had been reported too drunk to perform his duties.</p>
   <p>This investigation is in charge of Mr. Nelson (Dane) who, we hope will soon clean up this deplorable condition.</p>
