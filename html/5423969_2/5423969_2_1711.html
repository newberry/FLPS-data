   <p>The Scandinavian Workers' Singing Society held a very successful reunion and social in Jacobsen's Hall last Thursday. The Society likewise took the occasion to honor Mr. J. P. Balle on his seventy-eighth birthday. Thus the event was a triple festival, and a large number of old and new members and their friends were present. The ladies, all dressed in white, were well represented.</p>
   <p>The evening opened with a program of dancing. Then there was singing by the Scandinavian Workers' Singing Society and the Scandinavian Socialist Ladies' Singing Society, both of which were rewarded with well-deserved applause. The chief interest, however, centered about....the honoring of the seventy-eight-year-old, but ever youthful Peter Balle, who is an honorary member of the Society. Christian Nielsen, a blacksmith, presented Mr. Balle with a bouquet containing seventy-eight American Beauties. His <span class="page-break">\2</span>speech on the occasion was very good, and he was followed by a number of other speakers eulogizing Mr. Balle. Mr. Balle expressed his appreciation for the kindness and honor shown him, and voiced the wish that all his friends in the Society might live to see as many years as he had, and that they might be of as good health and spirit as were his. Then there was dancing once more, and Mr. Balle proved to be one of the liveliest of the dancers.</p>
