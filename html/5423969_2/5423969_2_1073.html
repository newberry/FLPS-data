   <p>Commerce between the U. S. A. and Norway is steadily increasing. Imports to the U. S. A. have increased from $6,551,985 in the fiscal year 1909-10 to $8,009,490 for the year July 1, 1910 to June 30, 1911. Exports to Norway have increased during the same periods from $5,940,785 to $7,350,372. Should the increase continue in this proportion the new Norwegian-American line will not be in need of freight on its trips either way, when it places its two new boats into transatlantic service early in 1913. The new line will have a strong patriotic appeal, for both freight and passenger traffic, due to the fact that all shares in the concern are owned by Norwegians in Norway and the U. S. A., and Norwegian ships and sailors have always stood highest in the estimation of the entire maritime world. Scandia predicts a grand and prosperous future for this, our own, N. A. line.</p>
