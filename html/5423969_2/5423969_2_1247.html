   <p>A novelty in musical treats will be offered to members of our Norwegian colony during the next few days, and a pre-hearing justifies our urging all our countrymen - as well as Swedish and Danish friends - to attend the forthcoming concerts.</p>
   <p>This group of musicians comes from Kongsvinger, Norway, and consists of Mr. W. O. Christiansen and his four boys, each of whom has studied with Mr. Christiansen from infancy on. They have now developed into a five-piece string ensemble that is a real pleasure to hear. The ensemble consists of two violins, viola, cello and bass viol. Their repertoire consists of Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish folk melodies and classical numbers.</p>
   <p>The constant association of the boys with their father has welded the group into a pleasingly harmonious whole, as will be demonstrated on Tuesday evening, Oct. 28, at the Norske Klub.</p>
   <p>A second concert will be held in Bjorguin's Hall, on Thursday, Oct. 31. The third will be held at the Humboldt Park Parish House on Sunday, Nov. 3.</p>

   <p>Among the numerous numbers on the programs are the "Norwegian Cavalry Battalin March," a medley of Norse folk-songs, a medley of American melodies, a Swedish medley and Alfred Paulsen's "Naarfjordene Bleaner," arranged for strings.</p>
