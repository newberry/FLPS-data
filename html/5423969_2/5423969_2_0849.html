   <p>P. 4. - A world war is in the offing! Plans are afoot to utterly crush an age old world power. The weapons are Parisian styles (trousers for women) on one side with the age old skirt in opposition. Will woman surrender and accept the new edict making "skirted regiments" a matter of history? Will they don the pants and give up the ancient emblem of the power of femininity, the skirt? This is now the burning question throughout the world.</p>
   <p>The skirt is to woman what the unshorn locks were to Samson; deprivation of either means loss of power. The women are well aware of the power of the skirt, still, indications are that the pants stand a good show to win.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the men are putting up a fight against the idea of women in trousers, prefering the rule of the skirt to equality in pants. Unrest, respect and awe inspired by the rustle of a woman's skirts has long been man's second nature and wherever the trousered woman has had the temerity to appear, she has been met with jeers from men of sense. In adopting the masculine manner of dress, woman will be deliberately stepping down from the pedestal she has always occupied in the esteem of men.</p>
