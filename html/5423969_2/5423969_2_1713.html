   <p>The excursion of the Norwegian Glee Club to Mayfair Park was well attended. The whole afternoon the weather was excellent for foot races, music, and dancing. The Club delighted the excursionists with many musical numbers. Although the park was small and situated within the city limits, the participants passed a delightful afternoon.</p>
