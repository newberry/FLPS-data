   <p>As president of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, I urge the congregations belonging to our Church to hold services next Sunday thanking God for peace. Let us especially thank God because our beloved country did not take up arms for conquest, but for high and noble ideals in the interest of justice and liberty to so many people who needed help. At the same time let us bring our President and Government before the throne of grace, asking wisdom to fulfill the difficult task of establishing order and peace among the nations.</p>
