   <p>It was a great disappointment to us when we learned that Mrs. Borgny Hammer was retiring from the local Norwegian stage after a futile attempt to interest the public in her plays.</p>
   <p>After many years of constant observation of the best on the American stage and a thorough study of the methods of such fine actresses as Mrs. Fiske, Ether Barrymore, Kalich, and Bernhardt, we find that Mrs. Hammer lacks nothing in technique, emotion, and character delineation. Her forte is tragedy, so well demonstrated in "Agnete".</p>
   <p>We wish to express our hope for her great success in her forthcoming appearance in "Hedda Gabler" at Maurice Broune's Little Theater, where they know good art when they see it.</p>
