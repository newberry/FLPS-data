   <p>Two weeks ago one Theodor Hansen, a carrier for the Daily Skandinaven, was accidentally drowned; the house at North Western Avenue and Powell Park was his wife's, and his whole estate was some $125, deposited in his safe-deposit box in the Reliance Safety Vault, 859 West North Avenue.</p>
   <p>When his widow, Mrs. Anna Hansen, called at the vaults, the manager, Mr. Charles S. Edwards [Norwegian], refused her admittance until she had been appointed administratrix of the estate. So far Mr. Edwards was perhaps right, though it seems rather ridiculous that such proceedings should be necessary when the whole estate is barely enough to defray the funeral expenses.</p>
   <p>But Mr. Edwards was not man enough to act honorably toward the poor ignorant widow, and when she suggested that she see a lawyer whom she knew, he said that <span class="page-break">2</span>it was not necessary, and that he would arrange it for her; and he sent for a man who seems to be one of his pals, one P. J. Fitzpatrick, ex-plumber and ward politician, and at present one of the trusted employees of the Clerk of the Probate Court, James Reddick, general manager of the Republican forces in the Twenty-eighth Ward. Mr. Fitzpatrick assured the woman that she need not go to a lawyer "who might charge her $10 for the job," saying that "he represented the Court," and that he would fix the matter for her. With the aid of the law firm of Deming and Murphy the necessary papers were made out; Fitzpatrick and a brother of James Reddick signed her bond, and she was made administratrix of her late husband's estate of $125.</p>
   <p>Then Mrs. Hansen was coolly informed by Mr. Fitzpatrick, representative of the Clerk of the Probate Court, and Attorney Deming that their services were worth forty-one dollars, and not one cent less.</p>
   <p>The poor widow was dumbfounded; she did not understand a bit of it; the kind-hearted Mr. Fitzpatrick had volunteered his services to save her a possible <span class="page-break">3</span>attorney's fee of $10; and now they demanded $41 for having made out her papers as administratrix of an estate of $125! She cried and said that she could not spare so much because she needed it to pay the funeral expenses; and the sharks graciously agreed to take $30 on condition that she should pay the balance of $11 inside three months. The money was paid on the spot and receipted for; the receipts are written on the stationery of the Reliance Safe Deposit Company; Mr. Fitzpatrick receipted for $5 for "services" in connection with the estate of Theodor Hansen; and Deming and Murphy receipted for $25 attorneys' fees.</p>
   <p>Now the poor woman tells us that a few days ago, disconsolate, she told the story of this skin game to another lawyer who evidently has "seen" some of these persons; on the day before yesterday a representative of the law firm of Deming and Murphy called upon her and promised to disgorge if she would only keep quiet.</p>
   <p>These are the facts, and we have little to add. Probate Court charges are usually not made when an estate is under $2000, but this poor widow whose husband left only $125 must pay $5--perhaps for the extra services of being steered into <span class="page-break">4</span>a robbers' roost by "a representative of the Court".</p>
   <p>Mr. James Reddick, Clerk of the Probate Court, may not be personally interested; but as long as he surrounds himself with employees whose reputation is notoriously bad, he is morally responsible for their conduct, and as boss of the Twenty-eighth Ward he should see that poor women in his Ward are not swindled by his trusted men and in his name.</p>
   <p>Lest he forget: even a poor Norwegian widow may have a few friends.</p>
