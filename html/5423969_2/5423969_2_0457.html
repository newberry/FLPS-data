   <p>The garden social given by the Norwegian Women's Federation last Friday evening proved a success.</p>
   <p>It has to be admitted that Mrs. Sundby-Hansen, from whom came the initiative for the social, must be in cahoots with all the good powers, and that the Red Cross work of the Norwegian Women's Federation must be highly pleasing to these powers, for they lent great help.</p>
   <p>All of September this year having been cold and stormy, the more skeptical predicted that the fairies would have to appear in fur coats and high boots if any social was contemplated. Contrary to this prediction, the most <span class="page-break">\2</span>favorable weather prevailed during the evening of the social, and the fairies danced in their filmy garments as if everything had been made to order. Those who were present at the social will not forget Dickinson Park very soon. People coming to the social by autos and street cars did not need to ask their way to the fete. Even from afar the multi-colored lanterns in the garden sent their gay invitation to the enchanted garden into the midst of the gloom of the night.</p>
   <p>The people came by the hundreds and thousands, expecting much and finding more. A little while for orientation, after which they would meet old acquaintances and friends among the multitude. Many went about carrying lanterns, and it seemed as if the garden were peopled with lights dancing about. Then came the music and the dances of the fairies, dances transplanted <span class="page-break">\3</span>from the woods of Norway to the parks of America. There were various Norwegian national dances, all to the great delight of the guests. The program ended with several speeches in connection with the Red Cross work of the Norwegian Women's Federation.</p>
