   <p>As a composer of popular songs and piano music, few musicians have won greater acclaim than Hans Christian Verner, a Chicago Norwegian.</p>
   <p>Mr. Verner came with his parents to Chicago from Skien, Norway, when he was a little boy. His father, Mr. Verner, Sr., who was engaged in the jewelry business on Milwaukee Avenue about twenty-five years ago, can still be remembered by many of the oldsters among the readers of the Skandinaven.</p>
   <p>The older Mr. Verner died when the future composer was only three year old. Mrs. Verner had died some time previously, and the boy was brought up by one of his aunts.</p>
   <p>At a very early age Hans Christian Verner began to show great aptitude both as musician and composer, but he did not win renown till lately. His first great success was the song "Won't you be my Sweetheart," which appeared in 1894 and at once won the approval of the public and to such an extent that 150,000 copies of the song were sold. Next came "Pride of the Ball," of which 175,000 copies were sold. Both of these songs.....belong to the type of compositions which not merely are of interest at the moment but also retain their popularity among the people.</p>
   <p>To list even a small number of Mr. Verner's compositions would take more space than we can spare. Several of his songs are known also in Germany and in Norway. A part of his music has been published by Sheard &amp; Company, London. The noted music critic Amy Leslie, in one of her reviews, says: "Mr. H. C. Verner has recently composed two brilliant pieces for the piano, 'The Jolly Bachelors' and 'Butterfly Wooing'. He is one of Chicago's most promising composers and at present is working on an opera, several songs of which give evidence of talent of first rank."</p>
   <p>Also in the field of church music, Mr. Verner has won considerable renown. His "Beautiful Visions" has won the hearts of all from Maine to California, according to the Musical Courier of New York.</p>
   <p>Although Mr. Verner has lived practically all his life in the United States, he considers himself a Norwegian and is interested in everything pertaining to the land of his birth. In his home there is to be found a collection of paintings from Norway, wood carvings from Norway, etc., all of which he proudly shows to his American friends.</p>
   <p>Mr. Verner also has composed "Viking March" and the song "Little Inga Olson," which has won strong acclaim. In addition, Mr. Verner has set to music the poems (by Eugene Field) "The Night Wind" and "Wynken, Blynken, and Nod". Both of these compositions had a very large sale, and one half of the royalties went to the family of the late poet.</p>
   <p>A large number of Mr. Verner's compositions have been published under the pseudonyms of Carl Henschel and H. V. Monroe.....</p>
   
   <p>Most of the compositions by Mr. Verner have been published by S. Brainard's Sons Publishing Company, Chicago and New York.</p>
   <p>In addition to being a composer, Mr. Verner is an artist of no mean ability......His income from royalties is very large.</p>
