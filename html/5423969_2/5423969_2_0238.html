   <p>The reign of violence must come to an end in Chicago. If the city administration is unable or unwilling to preserve peace, other agencies of the law should be invoked. The existing condition of affairs is bordering upon anarchy. Law-abiding and peace-loving workmen are terrorized, beaten, maimed, and even killed, simply because they attempt to exercise their right to work. For weeks and weeks, every day has witnessed fresh instances of brutal assaults. Victim after victim has been sent to the hospitals or to the graveyards, yet nothing has been done by the city authorities to check the rising tide of crime. On the contrary, Chicago has been completely surrendered to lawlessness by the very official who is in supreme command of the city's army of 3,000 peace officers and who is solemnly sworn to uphold law and order.</p>

   <p>Let Carter H. Harrison [Jr.] look upon his hands.</p>
   <p>There is blood upon them. If that is not sufficient to rouse him to a sense of his duty, let him turn his eyes upon the past and read the warning of its ominous tale-:</p>
   <p>Not many years ago Carter H. Harrison [Sr.] was Mayor of Chicago. Anarchy raised its head and began to marshal its forces for a determined attack upon society. Thousands flocked to its red banner; in public meetings revolution was openly preached; the torch flaunted, and arson and murder taught as a right and a duty. But the complacent Mayor was not disturbed, nor did he disturb the conspirators against the public peace. He beheld the law trampled under foot, but he did nothing to vindicate its authority. Encouraged and emboldened by his "hands-off" policy, the anarchist conspirators went from threats to action, and the Haymarket slaughter followed. Under the protection of the city government the dragon teeth of lawlessness and crime had struck root, and in due season the city reaped a harvest of <span class="page-break">\3</span>assassination and carnage. Carter H. Harrison, the present Mayor of Chicago, cannot have forgotten those dark and bloody days. Yet he has been following the very path that led to the Haymarket tragedy. The only difference between conditions now and then is that the law is more flagrantly violated now than it was during the period preceding the assassination of the seven police officers. Those who at present set the law at naught do not waste much time on inflammatory speeches; they let their brass knuckles, their slingshots, and their revolvers speak for them. The anarchists conceded a man's right to work and respected those who wanted to support their families by the sweat of their brows. Our present-day lawbreakers deny a man's right to work and proceed to beat him or kill him unless he be willing to loaf and let his wife and children starve. The anarchist agitation was a mere breeze compared with the present raging hurricane of lawlessness. And yet the little fellow in the big chair in the City Hall is doing nothing. He has practically abdicated, and mob law rules the city.</p>

   <p>Contrast with the demagogic course of Mayor Harrison the policy of Governor Roosevelt, a man who is in the habit of squaring his performances with his professions. Said he in a recent interview with a Chicago paper:</p>
   <p>"They have found out in New York, that when I declare for a thing, I am in the fight to stay. I am friendly to every right of labor and to its advancement. I am for law and order also. The law must be obeyed in letter and in spirit. If I send the state militia out to guard property, it must be guarded. If a strike is on and rioting liable, the mob must not rule. The men may strike all they wish to but not riot. I think I have made plain where I stand as the Governor of New York, and while I have not, and cannot have, the vote of the plug-ugly or the hoodlum, I have the vote of the solid, law-abiding, right thinking citizen."</p>
   <p>This is the manly policy of an executive who knows his own mind, has the courage of his convictions, holds his oath of office sacred, and who dares <span class="page-break">\5</span>to do his duty.</p>
   <p>An executive who is a demagogue is neither a man of convictions, nor a courageous man. His winking at vice, his covenant with the criminal element have dulled his sense of duty and made him their tool. He is unable to protect his own honor, much less the public peace. At the first sign of trouble the Mayor and the rest of the "rat-hole politicians" of the City Hall were scared out of their wits and sought a quick and safe retreat in their holes. Whereupon this magnificent maneuver was proclaimed the policy of the administration!</p>
   <p>The pusillanimous and contemptible attitude of the administration must not, however, be permitted to blind the people to its dangers. The future of organized labor is imperilled. The rights and dignity of labor in general are at stake. The honor of Chicago and the prosperity of our people are in jeopardy. And above all, the arm of the law is paralyzed. Since the <span class="page-break">\6</span>administration has surrendered to lawlessness, the people must rise to guard the welfare of the city, protect labor, vindicate the law, and enforce public peace.</p>
