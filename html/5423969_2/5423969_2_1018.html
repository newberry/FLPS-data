   <p>Among the sixty-two graduates at Rush Medical College on Wednesday were the following five Norsemen, Christian A. Fjeldstad, Sverre Oftedohl, Daniel Glomseth, T. A. Johnson, and Iver Stoland. Dr. Fjeldstad also was awarded the De Laskie prize. The Chicago Norwegian Colony can well be proud of having a representation of eight per cent among the graduates from such a prominent school of medicine, and the entire colony wishes our young men every success.</p>
