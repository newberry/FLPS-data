   <p>The Norwegian Singing Society recently produced Bjornson's five-act folk drama, "Sigurd Jorsalfar," at Wicker Park Hall. The Society's sixty active singers had rehearsed under the direction of Thorwald Koht for the past two months. The historically accurate costumes and scenery were designed by Mr. Koht. This drama is considered one of the most difficult to produce, but the singers gave one of the best performances that Chicago has ever seen.</p>
