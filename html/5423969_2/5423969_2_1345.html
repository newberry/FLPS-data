   <p>Much interest is being shown in the Norwegian Art exhibit, and there is much discussion regarding the merits and demerits of the various paintings. On Sunday afternoon, the Chicago Norske Klub (Chicago Norwegian Club) opened their doors to the colony for a lecture on the exhibit by Dr. Henry Leach. The lecture, supplemented by stereopticon slides was instructive and well received. The absence of commercialized art at the exhibit was heartily commended.</p>
