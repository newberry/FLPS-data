   <p>An ancient law ordains that officers and sailors on American ships of war are to be paid prize money for enemy ships taken in wartime. In addition they get "bounty" for the conquered enemies, $100 for every captured enemy ship if the enemy force was equal or less in strength, and $200 if the enemy force was of superior strength.</p>
   <p>The total amount of "bounties" under the Spanish-American War amounts to $436,000....The total amount of prize money under the same War reaches $290,082.41.</p>
   <p>The "bounties" are distributed to all the men of the victorious navy...without it being considered whether one ship took greater part in the battle than others....Prize money is considered by ships, that is, a conquered ship falls to the ship <span class="page-break">\2</span>which took it, not to the whole navy....</p>
   <p>The law about bounties and prizes is a residue from the period when our country was feeble, when it was struggling for existence. Now the law should be abolished without delay. Our sailors will do their duty without being urged on by special prizes. The ancient custom does not aid discipline and comradeship in the navy, but rather soils the honor of the battle won. In addition, the moral sense of our time condemns the old custom. Let it be abolished!</p>
