   <p>The persistent efforts of the postmaster general to establish a parcel post service in one form or another speak well for his enterprise and zeal, but are ill-advised under present conditions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Meyer points to the success of the parcel post in many of the most advanced countries in Europe; but it does not follow that what has been a success in Europe would work well with us, or be a boon at all to the people of this country. In the first place, the distances with us are so great and the population in many parts of the country so scarce and scattered that the cost of a fairly satisfactory parcel post service would be altogether out of proportion to its benefits to the people. The figures presented by Congressman G.N. Haugen, in a notable speech delivered in the House of Representatives, are conclusive on this point. Moreover, as things are in this country at present, a general parcel post service would enable a few millionaires to form a trust for the control of the retail business of the country. The country merchants would disappear and the small towns would be crippled or decay.</p>
   <p>This in itself would be a calamity that would far outweigh any advantages the people might derive from the parcel post. The country town is a boon and a necessity in any rural community. It affords a handy local market for the surplus products of the district, and as an intellectual, political, and social center it is of great importance to the people of its neighborhood. In many ways it is the eye through which a farming community looks out upon the great world from the monotonous routine of rural life. Our large cities are growing fast enough. It is unnecessary for the postal department to do anything to stimulate their growth. Least of all should they be favored at the expense of the smaller cities and country towns. Rather may we wish the small cities to grow larger and the very large cities grow smaller. That would make for a healthier political and economic development and be better for the people.</p>
   <p>Realizing the force of these objections, or baffled by the strong opposition to a general parcel post service, the postmaster general is trying to secure the passage of a law for a similar service between the small towns and their respective neighborhoods, or an exclusively rural parcel post service. Such a service would not be all the mail order houses want; but they would quickly discover ways and means to make extensive use of it, and no law could stop them.</p>
   <p>Another objection to a rural parcel post is that it would interfere seriously with the delivery of the regular mail, especially the daily newspapers. The rural mail service is poor enough as it is. The delivery of the daily papers in this part of the country is notoriously irregular and unreliable. To illustrate, the Skandinaven office receives from half a dozen to a dozen complaints a day from subscribers who do not receive their papers regularly.</p>
   
   <p>Some days they get no paper, and in many instances they have to wait two or even three days for them, and then they get several issues in a bunch. Such conditions are intolerable to newspaper readers and publishers alike. If the aim is to make the rural mail service absolutely intolerable, the pending pet measure of the postmaster general is sure to accomplish the purpose. Let the rural mail carrier be loaded down with all sorts of packages and local errands, and the newspaper mail will be even more neglected than at present.</p>
   <p>The people have not clamored for parcel post service. They can see that, under present conditions, it would utterly demoralize the rural districts, and hence they do not want it. Some theorists may think it a fine thing to have, and they may be right; but the hard-headed farmer, who knows how the present rural service works, would regard it as sheer folly to load fresh burdens upon its weak shoulders.</p>
   
   <p>Let the postmaster general do all he can to better the mail service, by cutting out red tape and introducing business methods in the department at Washington and the post offices throughout the country, by replacing incompetent with competent men, and by doing a thousand and one other things that will make the service stronger and better. That is a task that is big enough for any man, and it is something the people would be thankful for. But he should not try to choke the parcel post down the throats of people. The time is not yet ripe for this "reform in this country".</p>
