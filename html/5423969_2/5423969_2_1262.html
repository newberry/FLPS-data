   <p>The benefit concert, given for Mrs. Azora Koch recently was one of the most successful events our colony has ventured to put on. The opening number "Saeterjentens Sondag" (The Dairymaid's Sunday), by Ole Bull, played by the master violinist Morse Rummel, was in itself worth many times the price of admission. His tone and technique held one breathless throughout a selection. Mrs. Rummel, who accompanied, is a pianist whose art is of the highest order, and these two make a truly wonderful combination.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Tillisch sang two very beautiful numbers that were enthusiastically received, and Miss Melda Zarbell played a group of compositions by our own Signe Lund. In this group were "Legende," "Preludim," and "Etude". She also played Sinding's "March Grotesque," Mendelssohns "Spinning Song," and MacDowell's "Shadow Dance," with Arensky's "Etude" as an encore number. Miss Zarbell plays with a sureness and feeling that wins admirers at her every appearance; her technique is marvelous.</p>

   <p>Mrs. Gudrum Thorne Thompson pleased the audience with a number of very good readings. Osten For Sol Og Vesten For Maane" (East of the Sun and West of the Moon) was exceptionally well done and her listeners awarded her with the evening's most hearty applause. Mrs. Ragna Linne won her listeners completely as usual. Her rendition of Signe Lund's "Vandreren" (The Wanderer) and Chanson de Fortunio was marvelous in both voice and execution; "The Spring" and "An Open Secret" were also very good.</p>
