   <p>Rolf Hammer and Borgny Hammer played the title roles in Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "The Master Builder" last week at the University of Chicago. Our American institutions seem to have become Ibsen conscious. Many of Ibsen's best plays have been produced at the universities and colleges. Here in Chicago we often have the honor of seeing "the two Hammer" in the title roles.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the popularity of Ibsen has been increased because of the Norwegian Theater in Chicago, especially when the Theater decided to produce Ibsen in English. Borgny Hammer's success at the Chicago Little Theater has also been a factor in Ibsen's increasing popularity. It has been conceded that the Hammer's portrayal of Ibsen's plays is outstanding. The American press has always given these two excellent artists wide publicity.</p>
   <p>Madame Hammer has always been spoken of as the Norwegian Sarah Bernhardt. Yes, Madame Hammer's dramatic art can certainly be considered on par with that of Madame Bernhardt.</p>
