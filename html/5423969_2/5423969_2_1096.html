   <p>Severt Tobias Gunderson was born in Norway in 1839, and came to Chicago with his parents in 1848. In order to reach Chicago, they traveled up the Hudson, through the Erie Canal, across Lake Erie to Michigan, across Michigan to Lake Michigan, and finally across Lake Michigan to Chicago.</p>
   <p>At that time, Chicago had a population of 20,000. In such a small town, it was often hard for immigrants to find work, and for the first few years young Severt's parents had a tough time of it. Severt became an apprentice in a carpenter shop. In 1857 he traveled around the country trying to find work, but soon tiring of this, he returned to Chicago.</p>
   <p>In 1862 he purchased a sailing ship, the "Hercules", and in less than a year he owned six fairly large ships that carried produce from town to town on Lake Michigan. In 1871 he expanded his business enterprise by buying several sawmills. This branch of his business proved very profitable, but all his holdings were wiped out by fire in 1875.</p>

   <p>In 1874 he was elected alderman, and in 1891 Mayor Washburn appointed him to the school board. Later he was reappointed by Mayor Busse.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gunderson has traveled extensively. He has visited Greece, Egypt, the Holy Land, Turkey, France, England, and most of the other European countries.</p>
