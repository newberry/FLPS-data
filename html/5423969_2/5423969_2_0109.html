   <p>Olaf E. Ray, prominent Norwegian-American attorney, who is a candidate for county commissioner on the progressive ticket, writes us regarding the attempted extortion by a fake group of grafters he has helped expose.</p>
   <p>The gang is known as the American Federation of Labor Political Program League, and on March 26, when Mr. Ray solicited their support, he was asked to donate $100 to the campaign fund. The secretary of the gang stated that many candidates had "kicked in" with various generous sums to secure the labor vote, among them a prominent Deneen-Lorimer candidate who had donated $2000. Mr. Ray was informed that $100 was cheap for a county commissioner's job. Mr. Ray informed the outfit that he was not buying votes, and that he did not want or need the backing of a gang of grafters and racketeers. It developed later that this "league" was in no way connected with the A.F.L.</p>
