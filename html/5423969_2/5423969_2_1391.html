   <p>The popular Norwegian actress, Mrs. Borgny Hammer, will make her debut on the American stage next Tuesday in the title role of Ibsen's drama "Hedda Gabler," at the Little Theatre.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hammer made her stage debut at the age of 17 at the Norwegian National Theatre in Christiania, Norway and was later associated with the Central Theatre of that city.</p>
   <p>During her five years in Chicago, she has been the leader of the Norwegian Theatre here, which has presented a large number of modern plays, and rendered many performances of outstanding artistic merit, thanks to Mrs. Hammer's talents both as actress and instructor.</p>
   <p>She is at her best in heavy characters and tragedy roles, and it has been <span class="page-break">\2</span>her ambition to practice her art in Ibsen dramas on the English-speaking stage, and due to her talent, energy, and fighting spirit, she has now reached this goal in a shorter time than it takes most people to even partially master the English language.</p>
   <p>Revyen wishes Mrs. Hammer success in her new and larger sphere of activity, and in her presentation of one of the most remarkable woman characters that Ibsen has created.</p>
