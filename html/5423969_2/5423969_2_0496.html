   <p>Apropos of peace, our daily press throughout the world is printing articles on peace while the nations are spending enormous sums for armaments and crying for more funds to make more instruments of destruction. Can there be the least shadow of a doubt as to what the result would be if all nations were to gather in a peace conference in which peace and disarmament were to be promoted? Is it difficult to foretell the reaction on the part of the manufacturers of cannon and rifle, of powder and other explosives, on the part of monarchs whose thrones rest on a brutal base of bayonets, or on the part of the financial giants whose coffers are filled to overflowing with the blood-money of wars?
