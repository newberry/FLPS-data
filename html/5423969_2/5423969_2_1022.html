   <p>p. 8 - Sigvard Sorensen, librarian at the Newberry Library, Chicago, is becoming famous for his lectures on subjects pertaining to the literary arts and science. On December 8, 1910, he delivered a lecture on "Reference Work in Political Science," that so impressed his listeners that he has been requested to lecture on February 8, on "How to Set the Limit (if any) of Research Work for Readers." Mr. Sorensen's lectures stamp him as a deep thinker, a man of understanding and an eloquent delivery.</p>
