   <p>The mayor's suggestion that the jurisdiction of the civil service commission be extended so as to include all employees of the school board, other than teachers, met with general public approval, as it should. The people have come to demand that merit, and merit only, shall be the test of appointment and promotion in all branches of the public service.</p>
   <p>But why did the mayor, in the same breath, violate the very principle which he advocated? If clerks, janitors, floor sweepers, etc., are to be put under civil service regulations, the membership of the board ought to be made up with an eye to the good of the service. Good men ought to be reappointed as long as they are willing to serve, whether they happen to be personae gratae or not, and personal whims or dislikes ought not to <span class="page-break">\2</span>influence these very important appointments in the least.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to reconcile the mayor's civil service professions with the failure to reappoint Mr. H. A. Haugan to succeed himself as a member of the school board. When he was named to fill a vacancy without soliciting the honor, his appointment was generally commended as the best that could have been made. His work on the board has been of a very high order and has been performed at very large personal sacrifice, which he has cheerfully given. He probably does not regret that he has been relieved of duties which are onerous to any man who, like Mr. Haugan, throws himself heart and soul into the work. But the people and their children and the schools can ill afford to lose the services of such a man.</p>
   <p>The school board should not serve as a stepping stone for personal ambition. Selfish politicians should be excluded from this board. What the people <span class="page-break">\3</span>want is men and women who are willing and able to devote a liberal share of their time and energies to our schools and their work. Mr. Haugan is such a man to a great degree. He was one of the strongest members of the board, and his absence from the board will be felt as a distinct loss to our public schools.</p>
   <p>In order to put our schools in the closest possible touch with their many-tongued constituents it has been thought best to have the leading elements of the population of the city represented on the school board--the Germans, Irish, Scandinavians, Poles, etc. The results obtained are the best justification of the wisdom of this policy. The representative character of the board has brought the schools nearer to the people and has drawn the people nearer to the schools. But the mayor has seen fit to disregard this well-established practice, in so far as Scandinavians are concerned, and thus for the first time in a quarter of a century the large Scandinavian <span class="page-break">\4</span>element of the population of Chicago is without representation on the school board and without any direct voice in the management of the schools.</p>
   <p>It is not known how the mayor will justify the blunder he has made. He has deprived the school board of an exceptionally capable and able man, and he has weakened his party by administering a wanton insult to an element which in the past has been steadfast in its support of Republican principles and always may be relied upon to uphold the cause of good government.</p>
