   <p>Harald Heide, the greatest violinist of Christiana, came to Chicago and visited the Norwegian Singing Society for whom he had promised to play at their next concert. He came to their anniversary program in Wicker Park Hall. Every seat was taken and people stood along the walls. Harald Heide from the Christiana National Theater would play for them, hence the mob of people. Everyone wanted to hear if he was what he was "cracked up to be." After the first number the applause broke loose and would not stop. He was called the second "Ole Bull."</p>
