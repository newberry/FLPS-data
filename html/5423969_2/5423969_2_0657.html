   <p>The inauguration speech by President Taft shows us the man--what he is, and what he wants. He speaks calmly, plainly, and straightforwardly, and one feels instinctively that he says exactly what he means. His voice is mild, but his words are weighty and forceful.</p>
   <p>The President begins his speech by emphasizing that he is in full harmony with [former] President Roosevelt's policies, and that his task will be to strengthen these policies and extend them. He points out that as a member of Roosevelt's cabinet he had assisted in shaping these policies, and thus, in a way, he will be continuing his own work.</p>
   <p>This statement by Taft proves that Mr. Roosevelt did not make a mistake when he worked hard to get Mr. Taft nominated as the presidential candidate of the Republican party. He wished a successor who would continue the work that had <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>been started, and it is now apparent that this carrying on of Roosevelt's work is President Taft's program.</p>
   <p>Thus, Mr. Taft states that the laws concerning railroad companies and industrial corporations need further changes and additions; that a graded income tax is a just tax and the first new tax to be sought to balance the budget; that the defenses of the country--the army, the navy, and the various forts--must be brought to a strength sufficient to protect the country against attack, and to enable it to maintain its rank undisputed in the councils of the nations. To weaken the defenses of this country at a time when all other powers are armed to the teeth is, according to Taft, an unwise and dangerous policy.</p>
   <p>His discussion of the Negro problem is likely to create a stir. He points the way to a complete understanding between the South and the other parts of the country. He insists that the Fifteenth Amendment must be retained and that it must be obeyed, but he intimates that the Southern States are within their <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>rights when they restrict the voting privilege for blacks as well as for whites in such a manner as to make it impossible for the most ignorant to take the helm and control the States. He also intimates that he considers it unwise and opposed to the best interests of the Negroes themselves to appoint Negroes to federal offices in districts where such appointments would meet general disapproval.</p>
   <p>Another noteworthy part of the speech is the section on immigration from Asia. Mr. Taft emphasizes the necessity for giving the government the power to see to it that treaty obligations are adhered to by the States. Under the present law, a State or even a city would be able to push the nation into war against some foreign power. This possibility has been made evident by the latest occurrences on the West Coast. Of course, this state of affairs is intolerable. President Taft will do all in his power to remove this dangerous remnant of the old doctrine of the sovereignty of the States.</p>
   <p>For the rest, President Taft stands squarely on the Republican platform, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>which he wants to have completely carried out. Thus, Congress will convene on March 15 in extra session for the purpose of revising the customs laws. Mr. Taft's statements on this issue show that he stands for as low tariff rates as are compatible with the best interests of the workers and of the country at large. He will keep the promise to establish postal savings banks, and to limit by law the granting of injunctions in disputes between employers and employees.</p>
   <p>The message is thoroughly clear and well knit. It does not contain any striking turns or specially inspiring thoughts. It is plain, sober, and solid, like the man himself. But the attentive reader will observe that President Taft has a different conception of the objectives of government than that which has been current in the past. Evidently, his philosophy is that the government can and must play a larger role in the various activities of society than it has hitherto done. One notices that he is a man who is abreast of his time.</p>

   <p>Shortly before his inauguration, President Taft stated that his highest wish was to "make good". He concludes his message with an appeal for the sympathy and co-operation of his fellow citizens, and a prayer to the Almighty God for his aid in the execution of the President's difficult tasks. President Taft enjoys the good will of the whole nation, and the people will unite with him in the sincere wish that his government may be of benefit and honor to the people and to the country.</p>
