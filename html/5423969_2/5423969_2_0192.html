   <p>The Republican city convention built a strong platform, one that will appeal to all voters who have the best interests of Chicago at heart. The strength of the ticket remains to be demonstrated. It might have been a great deal worse, and it might probably have been better--at least from a vote-getting point of view. All sections of the city are represented, though the North Side has received the lion's share. Two candidates are German by birth or blood.</p>
   <p>Judge Hanecy is a man of strong personality, ability, firmness, and force in action and speech. Mr. Gartz is a representative businessman and is considered a strong candidate. The other nominees are said to be men of good ability, though they might have been better known. On the whole, the ticket is likely to grow upon the people.</p>
   
   <p>The platform is frank and clear-cut and covers the issues of the impending contest in a most satisfactory manner. All good citizens will say with the convention:</p>
   <p>"We denounce the administration of Mayor Harrison for its inefficiency, its open and notorious violation of city ordinances; its repudiated pledges to the people; its scandalous and corrupt manipulations of the special-assessment fund; its unclean streets and rotten pavements; its dishonest administration of the civil service law; its criminally negligent manner of defending corrupt and dishonest damage suits against the city; its prostitution of our public schools to political purposes; its depressing effect upon the realty and industrial values, whereby the property of the individual has been depreciated in value while manufacturing and other industrial interests have been driven from the city."</p>
   <p>Terrible as is the arraignment, it is, unfortunately, only too true in every particular, and it might have been made even stronger without exaggerating the actual condition of the city. The aim, then, broadly speaking, must be to secure "an administration that will elevate and purify the moral life of the city, increase its financial worth and raise its standard of citizenship".</p>
   <p>The most pressing needs of the city, and the policy of the Republican party on great questions that must be settled in the near future, are set forth as follows:</p>
   <p>"The present civil service law must be honestly, fairly, and vigorously enforced.</p>
   <p>"The public schools must be taken out and kept out of politics, and men and women of special fitness placed upon the Board of Education and in the management of the schools and school property.</p>
   <p>"The police force has within its ranks as brave and good officers as any in the world. It is capable of the best service if properly organized and managed. Its present inefficient and corrupt administration under Mayor Harrison invites the condemnation of all good citizens irrespective of party.</p>
   <p>"The streets, alleys, and public grounds of the city must be preserved not only from franchise grabbers, but from the thieves and despoilers of public and private virtue and morality, and made safe for the people at all hours.</p>
   <p>"The Chicago River--the greatest highway of commerce in this or any other city--must be made and kept adequate to the demands of the present and the future.</p>
   <p>"The franchise question must be settled fairly, honestly, and promptly between parties. Long franchises will not be granted. Full and fair compensation must be paid for special privileges in all streets, alleys, and public grounds. The extension of street railway franchises and the lowering of the tunnels are questions which demand the immediate attention of the executive of the city, and must be promptly and fearlessly met. These questions should be settled and adjusted simultaneously with each other, and all interests should receive fair and honest treatment."</p>
   <p>This clear and emphatic statement has the right ring. There is no equivocation or dodging on any point. Some of these issues are more important than others, but all are pressing and of vital interest to Chicago. The Republicans present a comprehensive policy, the sole aim of which is the moral and material welfare of the whole city, all the people, and all legitimate interests. What they will do is what the people want and must have done. With a Republican of recognized ability and force in the mayor's chair, supported by a Republican Council, there can be no doubt the pledges will be carried out to the letter. And then Chicago, the Chicago represented by the people who work, who build factories, who do business and pay taxes, will gradually emerge from the slough of filth, degradation, and despondency where she has been struggling against hope and gasping for breath for four long years.</p>
