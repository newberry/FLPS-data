   <p>p.4......................On Tuesday, August 1, Chicago was given its first Postal Savings Bank. The legislation establishing Postal Savings Banks was brought about after years of campaigning by presidents, parties, lodges and individuals. In spite of the fact that all our citizens have, for years, favored such legislation it is perfectly in order to give Victor F. Lawson, publisher of the Daily News, a great deal of credit for bringing about the enactment of the law required for the establishment of these institutions.</p>
   <p>Lawson, (originally Larson) is a son of the late Iver Larson, at one time associated with the late John Anderson in publishing Skandinaven and the inherited tenacity with which he carried on the agitation for the Savings Bank legislation is a source of pride to the Chicago Norwegian colony.</p>
   <p>We urge Mr. Lawson to again put his shoulder to the wheel, this time in the interest of Parcel Post legislation, that would give us needed relief from excessive express rates.</p>
