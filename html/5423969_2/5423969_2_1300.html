   <p>In our report of the concert given in Our Savior's Church, in last Sunday's issue of Skandinaven, the name of the composer of "Sangen" (The Song) was accidentally left out. The composer of the piece which received such enthusiastic applause is Mr. Alfred Paulsen, well known to most of our readers.</p>
