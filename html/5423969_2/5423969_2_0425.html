   <p>One of Germany's chief intrigues since the World War started has had for its objective the creation of disagreement between the United States and Japan in order that our country, for fear of a possible attack from Japan might stand any arrogance on the part of Germany without going to war against the latter country. Since we entered the war, the plan has been to make us keep our troops and our navy on this side of the ocean, also from fear of Japan. These plans, however, have now been frustrated through the exchange of notes between our secretary of state, Lansing, and the Japanese government. The understanding reached should remove every disagreement and suspicion. The territorial sovereignty of China is to remain as before. The open door in China will be maintained. The independence of China will not be threatened. These are the chief principles of the American-Chinese policy, and these have not been authoritatively confirmed.</p>

   <p>The understanding thus arrived at between the United States and Japan is, therefore, a new step toward the complete cooperation between all the members of the entente, and that means greater activity at sea and on land in connection with the war.</p>
