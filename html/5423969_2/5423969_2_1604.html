   <p>Mr. H. G. Haugan, Chicago banker, was roundly cheered at the last meeting of the Norwegian Singers' League. The reason? Dr. Anders Doe, on behalf of Mr. Haugan,donated $100 to the league as a contribution toward financing the 1914 trip to Norway by the selected league chorus. Mr. Haugan is a veteran singer and has never lost interest in the art; to the best of our knowledge, he is the first president of the first Norwegian male chorus in America.</p>
