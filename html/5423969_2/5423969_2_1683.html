   <p>p.8.................The Norwegian Singers League held a social session, yesterday evening, that was a very pleasant affair, though not as well attended as it should have been. Carl Gulbransen presided at the supper and the presidents of the four member choruses spoke for their respective groups. The new male chorus "Laerken" (The Lark) was welcomed as a member of the league. Other speakers of the evening were Messrs Warloe (who presented the league with an excellent portrait of Mr. Koren, president of the league), Emil Bjorn, Losby, Haglund, Nielsen and Sorteberg. A duet by Mossberg and Gulbransen was very pleasingly rendered as were all songs by individual choruses and the entire ensemble.</p>
   <p>These social evenings ("Sexas") have accomplished their purpose, that of creating and preserving a real spirit of friendship and co-operation in the league.</p>
