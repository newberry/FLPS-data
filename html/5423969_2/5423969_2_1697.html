   <p>p.4.col.3... NORDMENDENES Male Chorus served a banquet for active and passive members on Wednesday evening. A good program of chorus and solo numbers kept the assembly in the best of humor and Finn Simonsen pleased with the recitation of his Bjornson Epilog. The returned delegates from the Sioux Falls convention were given a real ovation for their efforts while there.</p>
   <p>Henry Anderson, the soloist of the big convention concert, was called on again and again and the chorus expressed a deep appreciation for the publicity and honor he had brought NORDMENDENES on so many occasions.</p>
