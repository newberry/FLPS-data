   <p>A chorus of two thousand voices, consisting of foreign-language singing societies, participated in the foreign-language parade yesterday.</p>
   <p>There were no pedestrians in the parade; everybody rode on floats.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian float was one of the most beautiful in the entire parade. It represented a Viking Ship with Leif Ericson at the helm, and with twenty-four oarsmen. The float was sixty feet long.</p>
