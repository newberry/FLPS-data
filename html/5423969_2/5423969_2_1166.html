   <p>Last Saturday Mr. Hans Nordahl and his wife celebrated their twentieth wedding anniversary at their elegant residence, 518 North Robey Street. Their intention had been to let the day pass quietly, but their friends planned otherwise..... Shortly after eight o'clock in the evening the first congratulators appeared, and before long the house was crowded with well wishers.</p>
   <p>At the sumptuous repast Dr. A. Daae was the first speaker.... He was followed by Dr. B. Meyer who spoke in honor of Mrs. Nordahl and presented the couple, on behalf of the visitors, with a beautiful breakfast service of porcelain....and concluded with a "Long live!" for the couple. Mr. Nordahl thanked the guests for the honor shown and for the gift and flowers presented.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hans Nordahl was born in Odalen, Norway in 1843; he passed his apprenticeship <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>years as jeweler and watchmaker with Mr. John Smith, Christiania, Norway. In 1866 he came to Chicago and after three years opened his own jewelry business at 213 Milwaukee Avenue. The business developed rapidly; he later joined company with Mr. Ole Olsen, and the well-known watchmaker and jeweler's firm, Nordahl &amp; Olsen, has long been one of the leading firms in its line in Chicago. Three years ago the firm moved to 449 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>On March 31, 1880 Mr. Nordahl married Miss Petra Stuberg. The couple has one son and four daughters.</p>
