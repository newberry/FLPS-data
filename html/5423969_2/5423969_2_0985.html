   <p>Mooreland, a surburb of Chicago, was completely destroyed by fire, last night. The fire started in a church at about 3:30 P. M.; it soon spread to adjoining buildings; by 5:00 P. M., the entire town was in flames. Every available fire apparatus in Chicago was sent to Mooreland, but the fire had gained much ground.</p>
   <p>Several well-known Scandinavian businessmen lost their homes. Among them were: J. R. Olinger, on 48th Street; Ed. Anderson, Fulton Street; Chris Sorensen, Lake Street; August Anderson, Indiana (Grand) Street; Charles Nelson, Hubbard Street; C. Johnson, Harry Nelson, Sam Anderson, Martin Hansen, Conrad Jensen, all [lived on] Hubbard Street. Christ Sorensen and Lars Breum lived near the outskirts of the town.</p>
   <p>About a month ago, Mooreland, was annexed by the city. Skandinaven asks its readers to help in offering assistance to the victims of the fire, if possible</p>
   <p>Later news reports several more names of Scandinavians who lost all their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>possessions.</p>
   <p>This should be a warning to Chicago [to eliminate] fire hazards and make more fire equipment available.</p>
