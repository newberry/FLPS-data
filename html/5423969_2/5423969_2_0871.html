   <p>The Norwegian"Storthing"(parliament) has adopted an amendment to the Norwegian constitution, giving to the women of that country the right to vote at the national elections, provided the voter or her husband has an annual income of five-hundred crowns ($133. or more). While this does not mean absolute universal suffrage, it is very nearly $80. Women already have suffrage in municipal affairs in Norway, and thus the Kingdom of Norway has stepped out far in advance of the Republic of the United States. In fact, the Kingdom of Norway offers a condition of liberty for the people, broader than that of any republic in the world with the exception of one or two. As to the United States, the outlook now is that women here may have to wait for another generation before attaining equality with the men as far as suffrage is concerned.</p>
