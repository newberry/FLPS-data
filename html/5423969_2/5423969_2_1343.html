   <p>P. 1- Kim all Hall, 304 S. Wabash Avenue is the location of a display of art by Lars Hankinses, Norwegain American artist well known throughout Chicago's Norse colony.</p>
   <p>The exhibit is comprised of about fifty paintings, the result of a two year stay for study in Norway, and has already been well spoken of in out Chicago dailies.</p>
   <p>On Thursday, May 11th, a reception has been arranged in honor of the artist, to be held in the hall that houses Mr. Hankinses' exhibit.</p>
   <p>Whether one has or has not seen Norway this group depicting the beauties of the country in both summer and winter garb cannot but impress and please the observer;there is something so fresh and natural about the scenes that one is involuntarily drawn to them. We have already seen them and intend to visit them again.</p>
