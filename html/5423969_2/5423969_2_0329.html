   <p>Gambling is rampant on the West Side, and particularly so in the Scandinavian district. Whether Chief Badenock's wrath has compelled the poor gamblers to seek havens of refuge on this side of the river, or whether the South Side has monopolized every Argus-eyed detective at the disposal of the chief, is not known. The fact remains that policy-shop agencies galore are found on Milwaukee Avenue and other streets. In the 17th Ward alone, dozens of such agencies are operating, principally among the Italians and the Scandinavians. They gather in the nickels of the poor by the bushel, and accommodate their customers with two drawings every day.</p>
   <p>Whether or not this deplorable condition of affairs is known to Mr. Badenock, the Skandinaven cannot say. But it is undoubtedly familiar <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to many of the officers on duty in these parts. If the chief will call at this office in person, or send a representative who wants to see what he can see, the Skandinaven will put him in possession of a large batch of interesting information.</p>
   <p>We object to having our district made a center of gambling.</p>
