   <p>The Norwegian Singers' League has been inactive for quite a long time. The members of the League discussed the possibility of reactivating the organization. The old board of directors was replaced by a new board. Hans Oftedahl presided at the combination banquet and business meeting held at Harmony Hall.</p>
   <p>The installation of the new board was accomplished with some speed, in order to get down to business as soon as possible. Julius Jaeger proposed that a Singers' League concert be held in Chicago. This proposal was unanimously accepted. Darrel from the Bjorgoin Singing Society, Forthun from the Norsemens' Singing Society, and Zimmerman from the Norwegian Glee Club wanted the entire concert to be in Norwegian. Otto Clausen, Gus Carlson, and Emil Bjorn are to direct the League.</p>
