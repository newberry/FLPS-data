   <p>A more senseless waste of energy and good intentions than we behold in the present mayoralty campaign in Chicago is almost impossible to imagine. It is undeniable that the maintenance and strengthening of the merit system is a necessary condition of a thorough and lasting improvement of our city government, as it is the only effective cure for boss and machine rule. Everybody admits that the very existence of the merit system is at stake and that this issue has dwarfed all others in the pending contest. And yet the friends of civil service reform are still cutting one another's throats in the presence of the common enemy, who is already reaching out for the spoils. A more absurd or pitiable condition of affairs was probably never witnessed by an intelligent community.</p>
   <p>Of the three candidates pledged to civil service reform, Mr. Harlan occupies <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the most indefensible position. His sincerity and honesty of purpose are not doubted; he is an able and strong man, who probably would make a good mayor, though that remains to be seen; he has made an aggressive and brilliant campaign and has impressed himself upon the community as a man of force and character. But he knows, and all his friends know, that his election is highly improbable. His campaign is a useless waste of powder, except in so far as it may bring victory to the very forces Mr. Harlan is endeavoring to break up and rout.</p>
   <p>But even if his election were probable, it does not follow that he ought to be elected this time in preference to Sears or Hesing. There is nothing in his record or campaign speeches to show that he would make a better mayor than either of the other two candidates. If the Scandinavians were free to decide, which they are not, they would undoubtedly say: "We want for mayor some good honest conservative citizen who will uphold the civil service law and protect the rights of the city and the people; but by all means, let <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mr. Harlan remain in the Council, where he has done magnificent work and where he is needed."</p>
   <p>This is the situation in a nutshell, as it presents itself to a plain everyday citizen. As the leader of the honest minority of the City Council, Mr. Harlan has performed a great work, while it is doubtful whether he would have done better than Mr. Swift, or as well, had he been occupying the mayor's chair. By virtue of his forensic abilities and other qualities of mind and character, he is exceptionally well-qualified for a position of leadership in a lawmaking assembly, and particularly in the City Council of Chicago under the present conditions. The "gang" will be with us for some time yet, and we have at the present time no better man than Harlan to pit against it. He has shown that he will fight it "con amore" and with utter fearlessness. The City Council is the headquarters of the "gang". In the Council if it is to be met and vanquished, it must be fought aggressively. Any honest man who combines common sense and strength of character with a true regard for the welfare of the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>city can write a veto message to the Council. But the Scandinavian voters of Chicago know of no man who could fill Harlan's place and do Harlan's work in the City Council at the present time. For this reason he should stay where he is. If the "gang" should retain a majority in the new council, he will be badly needed there. If the honest element should secure a majority, he will be in a position to exercise a decisive influence of a positive character in shaping local legislation. As a leader of the honest majority of the Council, Mr. Harlan would do a great deal more to cleanse and reform our municipal government than he could ever do as mayor. In matters of legislation, the mayor is largely a negative force at best; the leader of the right kind of a council is the positive, aggressive, reformatory force of the city government.</p>
   <p>It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Harlan should so signally mistake his mission among the reform forces of this city. His brilliant campaign for the mayoralty is an utter waste of splendid energy. Let him withdraw and continue his work in the Council, and when the "gang" shall have been routed and the bulk of the work of cleaning the Augean stables of the city government <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>shall have been performed, the people will show their appreciation of his services by placing him in the mayor's chair.</p>
