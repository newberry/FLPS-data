   <p>The old political sayings seem to hold true. "To the victor belongs the spoils", and "A new broom sweeps clean" are being convincingly demonstrated in Chicago's change of administration.</p>
   <p>Captain John Olsen has been a bailiff for twenty-five years, long enough to be reckoned as one of "the old guard" at the Cook County Building. Moritz Salomonsen, a Dane, has served as marriage license clerk for nearly thirty years. Both these "old faithfuls" are now out, replaced by Democrats. A checkup now shows that not one Norseman is an employee of Chicago, in the County Building. Even the janitresses and scrub women must now be Democrats. We are at a loss to know whether to laugh or weep when we hear that the Twenty-seventh Ward Republican Club, at a meeting recently called, requested the appointment to the School Board of a Democrat. What a beautiful picture to admire.</p>
