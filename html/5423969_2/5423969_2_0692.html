   <p>The election in 1896 was of unusual significance for our country and its people; but the election this year is of greater significance still. In 1896 the question was whether our people were to return to a policy which had invariably brought good fortune to our country, or whether they were to choose a way which would catapult them deeper into misery. The people gave an answer not to be misunderstood.</p>
   <p>The questions which dominated in 1896 are with us this year also, but in addition there have arisen new problems relating to the honor of our nation among the other countries, and its mission among the people of the earth. The decision made by the voters this year will be of far greater significance and more fateful than was the public decision in 1896; yet, in the opinion of Skandinaven, the road to follow is clearly outlined before the voters.</p>

   <p>The first of the great issues to be considered this year is that of the tariff. This issue has been but slightly discussed because the proofs of the desirability of the policy followed by the Republican party are so clear and overwhelming that the Democrats have done their best to evade the issue. Free trade, however, is one of the planks in the platform of the party, and if the Democrats get into power they will re-cast the tariff law. The great crisis taught our people the result of Democratic tariff reform.</p>
   <p>The second great issue before the voters at this year's election is that of sound money. Also in regard to this question, it is true that the Democrats would prefer to leave alone the discussion of the problem on account of which they were moving heaven and earth four years ago. Experience has taught our people that the legalization of the gold basis has brought about the exact opposite of what the Democrats predicted: The volume of money in our country has increased; the rate of interest has been lowered. Our country is full of money and loans may be had easily and on reasonable conditions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>A Democratic victory would place our country on a silver basis and lead to money shortage, high rate of interest, endless disturbance in all situations related to money and money values.</p>
   <p>The trust issue cannot be solved by political cries; to what extent it may be solved by way of law, only the future can tell. What the voters have by way of guide posts in this matter may be stated as follows:</p>
   <p>Whatever has been done to solve the question through legislation has been done by the Republicans. The Republicans have also shown that they are prepared to use the last, the most inclusive means of correction, a change in our country's Constitution. In regard to this matter as in regard to other questions where the Republicans have acted or tried to act, the Democrats have done nothing but oppose.</p>
   <p>To these old questions come the new, raised by the war against Spain. In regard <span class="page-break">4</span>to these questions the voters will decide only after careful consideration; but impartial investigation of the matter can lead to but one result. Everybody knows that no man in our country had intended a war of conquest; the transfer of the Philippines from Spain to the United States was an inescapable consequence of the war, and after the Islands, on the ratification of the peace treaty, had been added to our country, it was the clear duty of the President to maintain law and order in the Islands. Had he neglected this, he would already have been placed before the impeachment tribunal and sentenced--and deservedly so. The cries of "Imperialism" and "Militarism" are only designed to mislead the voters. The Filipinos already have a greater degree of home rule than they had dreamed of at any time before, and they gain a still greater degree of home rule according as they become more mature and capable of the task. It is true that our army comprises 100,000 soldiers at present. This, however, is a temporary arrangement; in about a year our army will hold only 30,000 men.</p>
   <p>Our country has followed the road of duty and honor; the Democrats want to throw <span class="page-break">5</span>overboard duty and honor; they want to sacrifice what has been won for ourselves and for others; they intend to lower our flag as an indication of shameless surrender.</p>
   <p>The improved standing of our country in the councils of the peoples has been of great and beneficent consequences for all of humanity. This is clearly shown through the development of the Chinese drama. All intelligent and impartial men know that the policy of our government not only has saved China from partition, but in all probability has saved the world from the terrors of a general war. The policy of the Democrats as regards our foreign affairs is a queer, narrow-gauge, shortsighted affair. Our great country needs the markets of the world as do other great nations; under the guidance of Republican government a number of brilliant conquests have been made in the peaceful war of commercial competition. Now the Democrats demand that our country keep clear of the councils of the nations; that it, in all humility, try to become as insignificant as possible; that our United States leave the leadership to others even where we have great and vital interests to take care of.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>It is hardly probable that our people will adopt such a miserable, cowardly policy. The voters will say that it were better that the Star-Spangled Banner light the way for humanity to liberty and happiness.</p>
   <p>The Republican party has fulfilled every campaign promise with a faithfulness unique in the history of parties. Its policy has been so favorable to the country's interests that it has produced a period of general welfare unexampled in the history of the country. The Republican party has met and solved new and difficult problems in a manner to awaken the admiration of the world, and such as to weave new glory about the proud name of our country.</p>
   <p>The Democratic party stands denuded, covered only with the shame of its false prophecies. Every prediction made by the Democratic party has been made into naught by the developments subsequent to the predictions. Not a trifle even, remains of the Democratic predictions of four years ago. Yet the party continues to threaten the welfare of our people, and now it also attempts to sully the honor of our country. And on the strength of such a program it makes its appeal for the confidence of our people!</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Between the two parties mentioned, and between their platforms, the choice will not be difficult for the great majority of the enlightened and patriotic citizens.</p>
