   <p>The annihilation of the Spanish fleet at Manila was followed by another piteous appeal to Europe from the distracted Spanish Queen. In order to reach not only the governments but also the peoples of Europe, Her Majesty this time chose to avail herself of the convenient form of an interview with a representative of the press.</p>
   <p>About this appeal, M. Blowitz, the Paris representative of the London Times says in part:</p>
   <p>"The interview with the Queen Regent is of great importance, because of the far-reaching suggestion she makes regarding European intervention. The powers will not intervene in an imperious way but in a friendly manner, after <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the next battle. I believe the United States was actuated by humane motives in Cuban affairs, but I cannot approve of the method by which the war was brought about. It will be the duty of Europe to intervene in the name of civilization as soon as a decisive battle is fought.</p>
   <p>"I don't think there is a single disinterested man in Europe who believes that the United States has any right to a war indemnity if Spain should get out of Cuba. To ask for a war indemnity from Spain would be odious. The conscience of the civilized world would revolt against such a demand. Germany asked an indemnity from France because the latter pushed her war, yet Germany is reproached for having accepted an indemnity. The Queen could not say otherwise than that the onus of having made war rests on the United States. The hope she expresses is an important diplomatic revelation."</p>
   <p>Mr. Blowitz, the famous German Jew who occupies what many regard as the fore most position in the press of the United Kingdom, is a very important <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>factor in the game of European diplomacy. When he speaks, statesmen, publicists, editors, and politicians listen. Since the beginning of the early seventies he has been in the confidence of every French Cabinet, a confidant of nearly every leading statesmen in France, and an ever ready messenger of the French Foreign Office whenever it desired to influence public opinion in Europe. M. Blowitz' position is well understood in Europe, hence his letters to the Times are accorded the weight of semiofficial utterances of the French government and, in some instances, also of other governments working in harmony with France.</p>
   <p>Bearing this in mind, the importance of M. Blowitz' comments upon the Queen's appeal at once becomes apparent. M. Blowitz may, or may not, mean what he says, but there can be no mistake that he says what H. Hanotaux means, and that his utterances faithfully represent the views of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. It would be ridiculous in Mr. Blowitz to say <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>in a statement to the nations of Europe and America, "The powers will intervene after the next battle," "I cannot approve of the method by which war was brought about," etc. But when it is remembered that it is not Mr. Blowitz but M. Hanotaux, the French Foreign Minister, who speaks, we discover in M. Blowitz' statement an outline of the position and policy of France.</p>
   <p>Briefly speaking, the position of France then is: Europe should intervene, gently but firmly, to save Spain; the United States is waging an unrighteous war, and hence has no right to demand an indemnity; in other words, Spain will have to resign herself to the loss of Cuba, but she is to retain Porto Rico and the Philippine Islands and not be compelled to pay the cost of the war.</p>
   <p>There can be very little doubt that M. Hanotaux is now endeavoring to secure support among the powers of Europe for concerted action along these lines.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>To what extent he will succeed remains to be seen.</p>
   <p>This country is ready to do more business if there shall be any more business to transact. No European intervention will be permitted, and if France shall make any attempt at impertinent meddling she will do so at her own risk. Her West Indian possessions are not very valuable, but they are worth having. France had better keep her disposition to be officious in check, and reserve her powder for some other occasion; she may soon find use for all she has and all she can get.</p>
