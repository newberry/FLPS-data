   <p>On Thursday Patrick H. O'Donnell was requested by Governor Yates to forward immediately his resignation of the office of public administrator of Cook County.</p>
   <p>Some politicians profess to be astonished at what they term the "hasty action" of the Governor. They would have Mr. O'Donnell remain in office while he drags his case the weary length through the courts, and they seem actually to think that the Governor has done the ex-administrator an injustice.</p>
   <p>Other people are surprised at the unseemly delay of the Governor in the premises. The office of public administrator is one of exceptional responsibility and trust; it should be filled only by men of unimpeachable integrity.</p>

   <p>An indictment for conspiracy to bribe juries and corrupt the fountainhead of justice is in itself sufficient to shatter public confidence in a public administrator. Mr. O'Donnell should have been removed immediately upon his indictment. Why his conviction was not followed by an instant request for his resignation is a puzzle that only Governor Yates can solve. That the Governor remained inactive until some of the judges of Cook County spurred him to action savors of a public scandal.</p>
   <p>"Hasty Action." Guess not.</p>
