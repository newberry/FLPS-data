   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary at Bjorgvin Hall yesterday evening. The celebration proved to be a festival in honor of the director, Alfred Paulsen [Dane].</p>
   <p>Judge [Oscar] Torrison was the main speaker. He spoke in Norwegian, and congratulated the singers for the splendid work in keeping alive Scandinavian song and poetry. He pointed out that the factor that had held the Club together during the hard, early years was not entirely love for the homeland, but love for music and song as well....He said that the Club could be thankful for having such an accomplished director as Mr. Paulsen, whose love for music was above his love of country.</p>
   <p>In the songs and music of the homeland, one relives the saga of Norway; one relives the past in Grieg's "Olav Trygvason," in "Finlandia," in "Hr Peder," and in hundreds of other melodies and songs.</p>
   <p>Later, Judge Torrison presented the Club with a rare photograph of its first eight members, including the first director, John Dahle, who was active in building this singing group.</p>
   <p>The Judge again spoke at length about Professor Alfred Paulsen, telling the audience about his activities when the Norwegian Singers' League made their European tour. He mentioned Professor Paulsen's unique composition, "Naar Fjordene Blaaner" [When the Fjords Are Bathed in Blue].</p>
   <p>In closing, the Judge said: "You are in the spring of your life or in the light of your summer; therefore, I say to all of you:</p>
   
   <p>"Sing in the springtime of thy youth;</p>
   <p>In the gleaming summer</p>
   <p>The stream of songs comes from the heart,</p>
   <p>And comes back to the heart again.</p>
   <p>Sometimes the melodies of thy youth</p>
   <p>Shall, when autumn comes with joy,</p>
   <p>Resound again, Resound again."</p>
