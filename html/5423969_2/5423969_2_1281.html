   <p>The famous Chicago resident, Anton Sanness, has returned to his old home town to stay.</p>
   <p>We all remember Sanness as an outstanding actor and singer. On Wednesday evening, he will sing many of the old songs which we remember from childhood. As for his recitations, who could forget them?</p>
   <p>Let us recall a few: "Herremands Bruden", by Asbjornson; "Tredie Bryllup", by Madame Anderson (Madame Anderson's Third Wedding); "O Mor" (Oh, Mother); "Stile paa Apotheket" (The Fisherman at the Pharmacy); "Anders Oglisa" (Anders and Lisa); "I Min Ungdom" (In My Youth); and "En Skamfuld Tjeneste Pige" (The Shamed Maid). He will also recite the "Death Scene" from Peer Gynt.</p>
