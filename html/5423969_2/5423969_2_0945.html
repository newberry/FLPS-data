   <p>The state's attorney and the police in Chicago are co-operating to gather information concerning the cause of the terrible crib disaster which cost so many lives. So far all that has been brought to light seems to indicate that the responsibility rests with one, two, or three workers, all of them Negroes, who were exploding mines deep below the bottom of the lake. Of course it will also be attempted to determine whether the company which held contract on the mining job had acted in a responsible manner, and whether the inspectors of the city had performed their duty.</p>
   <p>If the guilty are discovered, however, and if they be punished--which will not be done until after long delay if the guilty ones be people of influence--those who died are dead, and their widows and children are left with their sorrow and their needs. The terrible catastrophe reminds us that the life of a worker, and for that matter, human life in general, is the cheapest of all merchandise here in America.</p>
   <p>More than 30,000 workers are killed, and about two million people are injured every year in the United States as a result of accidents. No other country shows a similar record of slaughter. It is generally admitted that about one half of these accidents could have been avoided if only the most elementary rules of caution had been followed.</p>
   <p>But why bother about such things? Most of those who are thus sacrificed are merely "foreigners". If a few hundred or a few thousand of these are killed, why worry? Ships carrying immigrants are regularly bringing new crowds of people who are willing to take the jobs offered even though the jobs mean traps of death. Of course, an accident is an unpleasant affair; machines, tools, and other property may be destroyed, and that is bad, especially if the properties were not insured. Accidents also stop or delay production, thus cutting down profits. But the workers? Well, what about them? who knew them? They were "foreigners" or other "nobodies", and there are plenty of other people who are willing and glad to get the place left vacant. A pick or a shovel costs money; the life of a worker is of no value.</p>
   <p>Who will deny that the general attitude of the larger employers is expressed in the statements made above? Of course there are exceptions, but contempt for the life and welfare of the workers is characteristic of the industrial life of our nation. Only on the day of election is the worker really considered in his character as a human being; at that time he is told in many sweet words that he is the real "big shot" in this country. But the people he elects are doing little if anything to protect his life and health.</p>
   <p>In several of his messages to Congress, President Roosevelt has directed attention to this matter. He has emphasized that the industrial legislation of our country does not consider sufficiently the life and health of the workers, and he has strongly stressed the fact that the United States is the only civilized country in the world where the question of accident insurance for the workers has not been seriously considered. His messages, however, have been cries in the wilderness as far as this matter is concerned. Some of the members of Congress have of late even amused themselves by laughing at his messages when the latter have touched upon the defects in laws concerning industrial activities. Our factory laws are inferior by far to the laws of European nations in this respect, and to this may be added that in America the laws are not obeyed unless it is found convenient to do so. Those whose task it is to enforce the laws, close their eyes and let the laws sleep. The terrific loss of life in mines, on railroads, in factories, and at various large undertakings, is the natural result of bad legislation and the still worse enforcement of the laws.</p>
   <p>When an accident has occurred and a worker has lost his life or his health, the family as a rule is left to starve unless the worker had some property. To be sure, he who is responsible for the accident can be made to pay. In many cases, however, it is difficult to fix the responsibility; furthermore, the responsibility is frequently fixed on people who have no means of paying for the damage done. In the comparatively rare instances where a rich company is made liable, the worker or his dependents are hardly any better off. If those suffering as a result of the accident are unwilling to accept the mite offered by the company, the latter refuses to pay, and the case is taken to court where it may be continued for years. And if the worker finally wins the judgment, the greater part of the amount will usually go to the lawyers.</p>
   <p>This is not justice. What the worker and his family need in such cases is immediate payment of damage without the need of awaiting the outcome of the slow court process.</p>
   <p>In Norway the worker gets this sort of compensation. Of late many writers to our paper have spoken of aid to the workers in Norway. These latter, however, are better off in regard to accident compensation than the workers in America. The Rigsforsikringen (government insurance) pays compensation amounts in case of loss of life or limb or other damage as a result of accident, and the money is paid at once according to rules determined by law.</p>
   <p>In the news columns of Skandinaven there are frequently found items from Norway telling of families of workers who have been compensated by the government insurance for loss of life or earning capacity by the provider. This insurance so far covers only industrial workers, but the intention is to extend the insurance to include the whole nation. A special insurance arrangement for fishermen was, as recorded in this paper, enacted in Norway to take effect on January 1, of the present year.</p>
   <p>What little Norway has been able to do for its workers, large, wealthy America can certainly do. But here nobody cares. The most prominent man who has raised his voice in this matter has spoken to deaf ears. America continues carelessly to murder its workers by the thousands, and the survivors, the widows and the children, have only the sorrowful memory left them.</p>
   <p>The life of a worker is the cheapest merchandise in America.</p>
