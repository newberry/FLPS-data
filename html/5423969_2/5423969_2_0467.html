   <p>The Red Cross Division of the Norwegian Women's Federation (at the time the most active division under the Federation) is starting its work off with a "bang." It is giving a grand garden social at La Vergne and Belle Plaine Avenues, West Irving Park, Thursday, September 14. The social gives promise of becoming unique. And this much may be said that excellent talent have been acquired for the social.</p>
   <p>The amount gained from ticket sale will be used for purchase of goods needed by the Red Cross in its work of mercy.</p>
   <p>It should be stressed however, that the Federation as a whole is now in full activity. Their paper, "The Bulletin" will appear on September 1, and will be sent without cost to all the members of the Federation.</p>
