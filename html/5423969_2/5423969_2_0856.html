   <p>There was a full house last evening at Bjorgvin Hall when Miss Gina Krog lectured on "The Onward March of Women in Norway". The majority of those present were, of course, women; it was their evening; a prominent Norwegian woman was to represent their cause, and the conduct of the meeting was in their hands. People started coming long before the appointed hour....</p>
   <p>Consul Gade was to have introduced Miss Krog to the audience, but he was unable to be present, and, in true Norwegian style, Miss Krog presented herself to her listeners. It was a festive moment when Miss Krog, making her debut before a Norwegian audience in Chicago, appeared on the platform. The applause was thunderous, and persisted long after four young ladies presented Miss Krog with two large bouquets of American Beauties.</p>

   <p>The speaker appealed to her countrymen in America to set their stamp upon legislation in their new homeland by supporting the great reform, suffrage for women. In this manner, she said, the Norwegians in America could repay what the leaders of the fight in Norway owed Susan B. Anthony and others among the older leaders of the women's movement in America.</p>
   <p>She concluded her interesting lecture with a greeting to the Norwegians in America from the Norwegian National Association in Norway, from the Norwegian Storting, from the Norwegian Cabinet, and from the Norwegian King and Queen. These greetings were presented with great warmth and found an echo in the hearts of the people. The audience rose to its feet and expressed its sentiments by thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>After the lecture, the guests invited by the literary clubs Aurora Borealis, Glimt (Light), and the Norwegian Reading Club proceeded to the Humboldt Park Refectory where everything bore the stamp of a festival spirit.</p>

   <p>Mrs. Gerner, chairman of the committee on arrangements, stated that the purpose of the social following the lecture was to give people a chance to meet Miss Krog. So the members of the committee and Miss Krog took their places at one end of the hall, and everybody was given a chance to shake hands with the guest of honor.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Maja Gjorsen-Huitfeldt, of Christiania, Norway, then sang several songs; she was accompanied by Mrs. Signe Skabo Lund Robarth. Enthusiasm increased with every song....</p>
   <p>After the singing, lunch was served, and Mrs. Gerner announced that Dr. Ingeborg Rasmussen would speak in honor of the guest from Norway.</p>
   <p>The women's movement, she said, is a worthy movement, especially for women....At first, ideas concerning the movement were confused....It was thought that its objective was the destruction of femininity, family life, and family peace....Silly imitators of the leaders did much to make the movement seem ridiculous. "Emancipated" became a term of reproach; <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>those suspected of being emancipated....were ridiculed and shunned; they were pointed out as examples of what a woman ought not to be. Many who were in sympathy with the cause became frightened and dared not join the ranks.</p>
   <p>The first society in behalf of the women's cause in America was organized in 1848. The American women have been working persistently for sixty years; yet they have not attained their goal. Norway is the first sovereign nation which has extended suffrage to women....</p>
   <p>It is doubtful if there ever was a more delightful festival among the Norwegians of Chicago than the one given in honor of Miss Krog.</p>
