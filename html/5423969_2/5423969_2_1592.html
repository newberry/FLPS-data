   <p>Last night Bjorsvin Hall was filled with a great mass of happy people. This was a gala night; the Scandinavian Socialist Singing Society presented its annual concert. As we entered the Hall we heard the strains of a stirring workers' march, played by Ratzer's orchestra.</p>
   <p>The active group of singers, under the direction of Rolf Hammer, gave us one "musical surprise" after another. This group sang the songs of freedom for the workers, seemingly, with a hope that some day the workers would obtain economic freedom.</p>
