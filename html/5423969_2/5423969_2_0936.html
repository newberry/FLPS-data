Certain valuable food elements, called Vitamins,which are found, e.g. in the outer layers of grains and rice, in the yolks of eggs, in fresh fruit and in raw vegetables, are lost in cooking. The vitamins are life giving elements of the greatest importance for our well being; if they are lacking certain diseases will take hold such as Beri-Beri, and the body also suffers in more general ways, though the full extent of the weaknesses caused by the lack of vitamins in the system, is not yet known.
