   <p>The Union Bank of Chicago, as we all know, was founded by a number of Scandinavians in 1905. The Bank has grown rapidly under the excellent management of these capable men.</p>
   <p>The Bank has just leased the premises at 25 North Dearborn Street for a period of 183 years, at an average annual rental of $35,000. This address will be the permanent home of the Bank.</p>
   <p>The following Scandinavians were the incorporators of the Bank: Nils Arnesen, cashier; G. Hallbom, assistant cashier; John M. Ericksen, Charles L. Johnson, C. W. Johnson, C. A. Johnson, H. P. Johnson, Thomas Olesen, and John S. Rydell. Charles E. Schytern was elected president in 1905, and Chilton C. Collins was assistant cashier.</p>
