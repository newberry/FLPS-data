   <p>The question of woman suffrage is rapidly pushing itself to the front and will not be settled before woman has equal rights and suffrage with man.</p>
   <p>This great social movement is meeting with violent opposition based on some unfounded fears, and the knowing ones predict terrible consequences, and are quite certain that the home sanctities will be irremediably outraged now that women are getting their political eyes opened.</p>
   <p>Women in India and other countries of the East have no rights that men need respect. But as the benign influences of civilization and Christianity reach these darkened corners of the earth, woman is being elevated and made equal with man. In bringing about this desirable movement, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union has been and still is a mighty factor. The latent power of thousands has been revealed, new avenues have been opened, until today woman is ready to compete with man in almost any calling. It is as absurd to deny all women their civil <span class="page-break">2</span>rights because the cares of the household and family take up all the time of some, as it would be to exclude the whole male sex from Congress because some men are sailors or soldiers in active service, or merchants whose business requires all their attention and energies.</p>
   <p>Does our sense of natural justice dictate that the being who is to suffer under laws shall first personally assent to them? That the being whose industry government is to burden should have a voice in fixing the character and amount of that burden? While woman is admitted to the gallows, the jail, and the tax list, we have no right to debar her from the ballot box.</p>
   <p>It is advocated by some that woman, intellectually, is not equal to man; but is that any reason for disfranchising her? Shall the Fultons say to the Raphaels: "Because you cannot make steam engines, therefore you shall not vote"? Shall the Napoleons or the Washingtons say to the Wadsworths or the Herschels: "Because you cannot lead armies and govern states, therefore you shall have no civil rights"?</p>

   <p>The ballot is an educator, and its benefits can be seen by contrasting the descendants of Jamestown or Plymouth, educated by the ballot, and the descendants of the same European ancestors who have never been allowed to vote.</p>
   <p>There have always been men glad to share with women every advantage. Hence American women are as well informed as men, have as much patriotism, and are just as capable of choice.</p>
   <p>Some say: "It will be a great injury to feminine delicacy and refinement for woman to mingle in business and politics." But to such I say that the broadest and most far-sighted intellect is utterly unable to foresee the ultimate consequences of any great social change. Lastly, has not God made woman capable--morally, intellectually, and physically--of taking this part in human affairs?</p>
