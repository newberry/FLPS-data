   <p>Miss Gina Krog, Norway's Susan B. Anthony, will visit Chicago this week. This outstanding representative of the women's cause in Norway will be received with suitable courtesy by the Norwegian women of this city, and, in fact, by the Norwegians in general. It is an honor for a small nation such as Norway that the women of the country have attained to a status of equality with the men to a greater extent than in any other country, whether in Europe or in America. In this field, Norway is really a pioneering country.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Camilla Collett, the highly gifted sister of Henrik Wergeland, was the real pioneer in the work for the liberation of women in Norway. Her book, Amtmanden's Dotre, voiced the demand for the natural rights of women with a <span class="page-break">\2</span>fiery vehemence sufficient to awaken even the dullest minds from their slumber. Most of the noted authors of the day concurred with her; in fact, the position of woman in society and in law forms the central problem in the dramatic poetry of Norway from the seventies up to the present day.</p>
   <p>Practical, systematic efforts in behalf of the rights of women did not begin, however, until the eighties. The leader in this work at that time was Mr. H. C. Berner. Like other leading men of liberal tendencies, notably the followers of Mr. Johan Sverdrup, he derived his stimulus for social and political activity mainly from England, and, in so far as the women's cause was concerned, especially from John Stuart Mill, whose books on this question were translated by a well-known Danish author. Mr. Berner provided the impetus for the organization, in 1884, of the Norwegian Society for the Furtherance of the Women's Cause.</p>
   <p>A small body of young, able, and energetic women now stood ready to push the work forward. First among them was Gina Krog. Many other gifted women, young <span class="page-break">\3</span>and old, joined the ranks; but all of them willingly admit that Gina Krog has been the leading force in the work. Miss Krog is a clear thinker, a good speaker, and a natural leader. And the result of the fight of the Norwegian women during the past twenty-five years demonstrates that she has been a leader leading on to victory.</p>
   <p>The demand for woman suffrage was for a number of years the burning issue; now it has practically ceased to be important. The final step to be taken in order that women may have equality with men in this respect will naturally come soon, without any special exertion and with little or no opposition. In addition to the fight for universal suffrage, women have accomplished great work for the improvement of the position of their sex in law and in business....</p>
   <p>A comparison between the woman's suffrage movement in Norway and that in America does not redound to our credit. A number of years ago, Susan B. Anthony and <span class="page-break">\4</span>her circle of co-workers were animated with an idealism similar to that which characterized Gina Krog and her disciples. Of late, however, the work in behalf of women's rights has retrogressed. The fight of the women for their cause has become mere shadow boxing. Most women will admit that the cause is theoretically just and good, but if the matter came to a secret vote, they would vote against it.</p>
   <p>The fact is that neither men nor women wish to see suffrage extended to the hordes of ignorant women arriving from Europe every year. If women were to obtain universal suffrage in America and become eligible for Congress, Emma Goldman would probably become the first Congresswoman in the United States. The women of America know that under present circumstances there can be but scant hope for real progress in the work for their cause. They know that as a practical political question their cause is hopeless; on the other hand, they do not feel like dropping the matter. So they float aloft the banner of the great idea for appearances' sake, and nothing more.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Nor have the American women done as well as the Norwegian women where more practical matters are concerned. The reason for this is probably that there is less interest and serious effort among women of the so-called upper classes in this country, and that any issue is easily apt to become merely a fad of the moment... But the Norwegian women have been co-operating; they have made strenuous efforts for themselves and for their country--and they have won.</p>
