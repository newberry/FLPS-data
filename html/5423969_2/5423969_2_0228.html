   <p>The Republican county ticket was dictated by the machine, or to be more explicit, by two of its members. All the convention had to do was to ratify the slate as presented for adoption.</p>
   <p>Yesterday another boss-made county ticket was put in the field. The convention was waiting patiently for hours in the North Side Turner Hall while the leaders fixed up the ticket at Democratic headquarters where "Bobby" Burke cracked the whip as the all-powerful ringmaster. When the slate was completed it was presented to the convention and ratified with a whoop.</p>
   <p>Thus has the will of the people of the respective parties been faithfully expressed by their respective bosses, and in November the sovereign voter will exercise his glorious privilege of choosing between the boss-made tickets.</p>
