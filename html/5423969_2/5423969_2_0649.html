   <p>The price of ice in the cities of this country is unreasonably high, and there are signs that there may be further increases. Last year the price was $6.50 per ton of ice; this year people have to pay nearly a dollar more. The ice companies claim that they do not raise the price more than is necessary to give them a reasonable return on their money. Uncle Sam, however, has shown that this assertion is not in agreement with the facts. The Post Office Department in Washington, D. C. has a plant which manufactures artificial ice, and produces more ice than the Department needs. The cost of production at this plant is sixty-five cents per ton.</p>
   <p>The question now under consideration is whether the government should or should not produce the ice needed in the various government departments in the capital. It is evident that the government could save a great deal of money by so doing, and it is <span class="page-break">\2</span>also clear that a private company could manufacture ice as cheaply as the government. In Jacksonville, Florida, there is an ice company which is not afraid of admitting this. It supplies the city with ice at a price of fifteen cents per hundred pounds--less than one half the price the people of Chicago and most other cities have to pay. Yet, this company confesses that its business pays well even at this price.</p>
   <p>However, so long as there is an ice trust in every city, there is no reduction to be expected in the price of ice; on the other hand, one may expect increases. People should not stand for this heartless plunder!</p>
   <p>The children of poor people are suffering most because of this robber-traffic. Many infant lives are crushed out during the summer heat, because their parents cannot afford to buy expensive ice. If there is no other way out, the cities will have to build their own ice plants. They have their own water works; they can just as easily build ice plants. So, unless the ice companies cease robbing the people, it will probably not be long before the cities have their own ice plants.</p>
