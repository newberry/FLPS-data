   <p>Farmers in the northern part of Illinois and in Wisconsin have difficulties in obtaining the necessary help for their farms. All the time since the snow began to melt in the districts mentioned, the free employment offices in Chicago....have been practically swamped with requests for farm help. Men who are not married are preferred; men with wives but not too large a family are also desired.</p>
   <p>One of the difficulties connected with the situation is the fact that many men who are quite capable of doing work in the fields are unable to do milking.</p>
   <p>The farmers are offering better wages at present than they did earlier in the year. At the start wages were offered from ten to twenty dollars per month, but there were only a few workers interested under the circumstances. Now the bids have risen to eighteen to twenty-four follars per month in addition to board and lodging.</p>
   <p>A farmer from Booneville came to the employment office the other day stating that he wished to hire a German housekeeper. He explained that the housekeeper must be prepared to help with the haying and other kinds of work in the fields; in addition she must help with the milking and, or course, do the cooking and take care of the house. In spite of his demands, he got his housekeeper, although ordinary positions as housemaids and cooks are scorned by many even though the wages be as high as eight dollars per week. More than one hundred requests for kitchen maids have been received at the employment office, but only few girls want the positions; they prefer factory employment, work in an office or in a store.</p>
   <p>There are yet many chances for our Norwegian people on the farms.</p>
