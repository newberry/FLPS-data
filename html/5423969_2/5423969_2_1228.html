   <p>The tenor, Christian Mathisen, with the assistance of the International Opera Company, gave a concert last Sunday in Bjorgvin Hall. This concert was a triumph for the little group on the program. The audience was enraptured by the presentation, which consisted entirely of selections from operas. Mr. Mathisen has control, volume, clarity, depth, and an exceptionally high, pure tenor voice.</p>
   <p>The John W. Colberg memorial concert in Wicker Park Hall drew every music lover to the hall; hundreds of people were turned away.</p>
   <p>A large portrait of Colberg was placed at the rear or the stage, draped with the American and the Norwegian flags.</p>
   <p>The soloists of the evening were madame Ragna Linne, Miss Adelheid Wolterding, Mr. Gustav Holmquist, and Mr. Johan Colberg.</p>
