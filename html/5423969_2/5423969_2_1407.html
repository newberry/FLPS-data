   <p>The Norwegian Theater has been well patronized for several months. As you know, this stock company was organized several months ago, and it has found supporters among the Scandinavians as well as among many other language groups.</p>
   <p>The next play to be produced will be Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler". The cast has several well-known artists in the leading roles: Mrs. Borgny Hammer as "Hedda Gabler," Mrs. Jebe as "Mrs. Elvestad," and Miss Ingeborg Rasmessen as "Aunt Julle". Among the male parts we should mention Rolf Hammar as the leading man.</p>
   <p>This Theater should be enlarged and extended, because the people of Chicago, judging by their patronage, seem to want it. The plays are produced in both English and Norwegian.</p>
