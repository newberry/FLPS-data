   <p>With an overwhelming majority both houses of Congress have adopted a proposal to amend the Constitution so as to give Congress the unquestionable right to levy taxes on incomes. On previous occasions, Congress has levied income taxes, but its right to do so has been questioned: it is doubtful whether the Constitution in its present form grants this right. The attitude of the Supreme Court in the matter is not clear; contrary opinions have been rendered by the Court in the matter.</p>
   <p>President Taft gave the impulse to the step which has now been taken. In the message in which he suggests that Congress pass the needed amendment, he says, among other things, that even though one might be reluctant to turn to this source of revenue, yet Congress ought to have undoubted authority to utilize <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>it, since conditions might arise under which it would be very dangerous for the government not to have a free hand in providing the necessary revenue.</p>
   <p>This, of course, is true. But the income tax should henceforth be one of the regular sources of income for our government. The income tax is a just tax, since it places the burden according to the taxpayers' ability to pay, and his relative advantages in society. This kind of tax has long been used in other countries, and has also found local application in this country. The only objection was voiced by one of the speakers in Congress: he said that the tax would create a nation of liars. This argument might have considerable weight if we had been a truthful people where existing taxes are concerned. But everybody who has paid any attention to the local tax assessments knows that the tax statements do not at all mirror the real conditions as to property and income. If we get a federal income tax, it is doubtful whether we shall have more incorrect information on property and income than before. It is common experience that it is difficult to find all the property and all the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>income which ought to be taxed, and this fact would of course interfere with the equitable placing of the tax burden. Yet there is greater probability that the truth will come to light when the Federal Government has its hand in the matter. Uncle Sam is not quite as easygoing as local assessors and boards of review. Therefore, one may turn the argument about and say that if we do not want to remain a nation of liars in regard to matters of taxation, let Uncle Sam get a chance to levy income taxes and keep track of the statements concerning incomes.</p>
   <p>In order that the amendment shall become part of our Constitution it must be ratified by the legislatures of thirty-eight [sic] states.</p>
   <p>It is a matter of course that the opponents of the tax will do their utmost to prevent ratification. It is quite probable that the New England States, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, will vote no. If, however, the rest of the states ratify the amendment, the recommendations of Congress will <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>be sustained and the great reform will win. Should this be the case, it would be the only important change in the Constitution of the country adopted since the Union was established, aside from the changes written by the sword during and following the Civil War.</p>
