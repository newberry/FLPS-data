   <p>The number of Scandinavian travelers passing through Chicago from the cities and country districts of the Northwest as well as from the East and from Europe, is steadily increasing, and the majority of them stop at the Scandinavian hotel, Dannevirke, which, under the management of its able proprietor, Mr. C. Hansen, compares favorably with most of Chicago's great hostelries. For about one third of the ordinary price, one may enjoy in it as good accommodations as are offered at the most expensive establishments, and as to the food, most Scandinavians will undoubtedly prefer it to that served at any other restaurant in Chicago. Cleanliness, comfortable rooms, wholesome, appetizing food, including Scandinavian dishes, courteous attendants and moderate prices, are attractions highly valued by travelers, and Scandinavians particularly will enjoy stopping at the Dannevirke during their stay in Chicago.</p>
