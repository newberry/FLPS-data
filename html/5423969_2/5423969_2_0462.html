   <p>On invitation from the Liberty Loan Executive Committee, the foreign language publishers of the press, in Chicago, met last Tuesday in the auditorium of the Directors of the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank. The publishers considered what position the "Foreign Language" press would take relative to the Second Liberty Loan, to be opened for subscription soon.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. A. Heath, the chairman of the Executive committee in the Federal Reserve district including Chicago, explained the purpose of the meeting and asked the newspapermen present to express their views. The Director of Publicity for the Committee, Mr. Charles H. Schweppe, had charge of the discussion. It is hardly necessary to mention that the publishers of the German papers were absent.</p>

   <p>The publishers present promised to do everything possible to make the Second Liberty Loan known as widely as possible and to assist in persuading the foreign speaking population to subscribe to the loan as far as their economic ability would permit. The various speeches were marked by patriotic enthusiasm for our country and for the cause of the warring countries of the Entente.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven was represented at the meeting by Mr. H. Sundby-Hansen.</p>
