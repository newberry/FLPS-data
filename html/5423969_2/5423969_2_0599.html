   <p>European correspondents tell us that "the sentiment of Europe toward the United States has undergone a remarkable change of late: expressions of ill will or hostility have given place to avowals of friendship".</p>
   <p>This is true. Dewey's performance in Manila Bay was an eye opener to the Old World, as it marks the beginning of a new era in the history of America.</p>
   <p>The sudden leap of the United States from its position of continental isolation into the arena of world politics has amazed and disturbed statesman of the Old World. Before the present war began, the great Western Republic did not figure in their calculations; to them it was merely a great producer of grain and pork, a land of audacious speculators, skillful inventors, vulgar millionaires, and corrupt politics; it had no army and no foreign policy, and so it counted for naught. Poor, miserable Spain was a much more important factor in their eyes; <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>she belonged to the family; she held valuable strategic positions, and she had an army.</p>
   <p>The battle of Manila Bay changed all this. It was a thunderclap bursting without warning upon the councils of the map makers of the great powers. It secured for the United States a magnificent position of vantage in the very quarter of the globe where they all were endeavoring to gain new territory or greater privileges. It threatened to upset their unstable balances, to thwart their clever schemes for reconciling their clashing ambitions. No wonder they were amazed. But they are well-bred and well-mannered; and they recognized in the intruder a pretty big fellow whom they were not anxious to tackle. Even if he was somewhat unconventional he must be tolerated; for it was very evident that he had come to take his seat among them and that he was determined to keep it.</p>
   <p>This accounts for the change of "sentiment" to which the correspondents allude. The new "friendship" does not spring from a new love; it is inspired by fear and selfishness--fear of American destiny and battleships. It is realized that the Western Republic has come into its own as one of the ruling powers of the world <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and that it will be strong enough to enforce its will in peace or war.</p>
   <p>But the war has also wrought another change in European sentiment, which, if not so generally observed, is less selfish and more pleasing to us. It has rehabilitated our good name with our friends in Europe and compelled our enemies to moderate their abuse of our country and our people.</p>
   <p>When the relations between the United States and Spain became seriously strained and war loomed on the horizon as a possible or probable outcome, the idea that this country would declare war to free Cuba was ridiculed as an absurdity in the European press. The newspaper-reading public of Europe was informed that Wall Street and the financial interests of America did not want war; that the statesmen and politicians of the Republic, from the President down to the local wirepuller, were owned and controlled by the money power, and that the "voice of the people" was nothing but a hollow clamor without real force or effect. Nor were the people in earnest, for American society was corrupt to the core, said all these wise-crackers; the people were a mercenary lot, entirely devoid of idealism, while American liberty was a mockery and a sham.</p>

   <p>Such was the tenor of the comments of the European press before the war was declared, as habitual readers of European newspapers well know. But its [the European press'] tone has changed from one of contempt to one of respect, though this is not always cordially expressed. Our calumniators have been compelled to eat their own words more or less gracefully, and our friends can once more point to our flag as the greatest emblem of human liberty in the world. All progressive elements in Europe contrast our attitude on the Cuban question with the contemptible weakness and infamous policy of the powers in Armenia and Crete, and hail our entrance into the arena of the powers as an omen and the beginning of a new and better era in international politics, an era of larger justice, broader humanity, and higher aims. This is worth something to us--perhaps as much as the war will cost.</p>
