   <p>Mr. Emil Bjorn, singer, artist, director, and writer, has just finished another picture. This one measures 6 by 8 feet. The picture portrays Odin at the moment when the goddess of poetry, Odrerir, gives him a horn of the "Mead" that has been brewed for the Gods. Dr. Max Henius [Dane] ordered this picture some time ago. It will hang at the entrance of the Wahl-Henius Institute on Fullerton Avenue.</p>
