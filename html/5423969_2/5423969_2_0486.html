   <p>[Skandinaven donated a full page for the following appeal which was signed by 373 foreign-language editors.]</p>
   <p>"Let us stop human suffering and defend life--not help to exterminate it.</p>
   <p>"Because of hundreds of thousands of telegrams received, demanding, pleading that war cease, we, the undersigned foreign-language editors, feel that this war is of no consequence, and should be stopped. We appeal to the American nation and its people, to the noble and fearless American press, and to the manufacturers of powder, shrapnel, and bullets; we appeal to the workers of ammunition plants to immediately stop work, to resolve not to help manufacture gun powder, shrapnel, and bullets to murder our brothers, to make our mothers and sisters widows and their children fatherless.</p>
   <p>"We demand that the manufacture of war munitions be stopped at once. We demand that the murder and slaughter of human beings stop at once. We demand that the United States stop sending munitions to the warring nations of Europe.</p>
   <p>"Take up this issue in your churches, in your fraternal organizations, in your local press, and demand of the legislature laws to outlaw the manufacture of munitions."</p>
   <p>[The resolution reads as follows:]</p>
   <p>"We, the editors of the following newspapers, resolve to print in our columns the above appeal to the industrialists and to labor." [Names of newspapers and the signatures of their respective editors are omitted in translation.]</p>
