   <p>The Chorus from St. Olaf's College performed at Orchestra Hall last evening. The choir sang with a beauty that was astonishing to those of us who know little of what goes on outside the circle of our own immediate interests. St. Olaf's College is a Lutheran institution, and is, I judge, attended principally by young men and women of Norwegian descent. This Chorus is the regular College choir, subject to the constant change of personnel inevitable in such organizations, and practically all the singers are evidently students. There were about fifty of them, thirty young women and twenty men. But they were all animated by a purpose, and Conductor F. Melius Christiansen is a master of choral training.</p>
   <p>The authorities of the Norwegian Lutheran Church felt that it would be desirable for the St. Olaf Chorus to sing in different Lutheran communities as an exemplar of the spirit and practice of singing in the Lutheran Church. It could <span class="page-break">2</span>be a stimulus to singing in other religious communities for them to hear what this Chorus does, and it is to be hoped that as many of them as possible will avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by this tour. The Chorus did not exactly give a concert, at least not in the usual meaning of the word; they sang religious music exclusively, not for the purpose of displaying their technical skill, but to lift their voices in praise. The whole atmosphere of the evening was one of religious fervor.</p>
   <p>They do believe, however, that to sing the praises of the Most High calls forth the utmost skill of those chosen because of their special gifts. In their singing nothing was left to chance; everything bespoke the results of the most rigorous routine under the direction of a man who knew how the thing ought to be done. They sang the most difficult music. Bach anthems for double chorus, a Gretchaninov anthem for eight voices, and other numbers of an almost equally taxing character, and all with a precision that was remarkable. In all of these numbers I noticed but one occasion when any of the singers used music. One <span class="page-break">3</span>consulted the printed page during one number, otherwise they all sang without a note of music before them. To memorize such music and sing with the certainty they displayed all the evening, tells its own story to those who know anything of music.</p>
   <p>Everything was sung without accompaniment, in fact, there was no instrument on the stage and no audible sounding of the pitch. When the time came, Mr. Christiansen gave the sign and the choir began with a solidity of tone most gratifying to the ear. The spirit with which they sang was impressive. The words were vital expressions of their deepest belief. There was no vainglorious display of technical proficiency, but the entire program was an utterance of faith with all the earnestness of youth. It was beautiful.</p>
   <p>The training of these singers has given them a technical skill that is extraordinary. In attack, in variation of tone quality and dynamics, and in the finish of the phrases they were equally admirable. It did not seem to me, <span class="page-break">4</span>however, that they had paid quite as much attention to the beauty of resonance as they had to accuracy and balance. The tone was excellent and in many places of great beauty, but there were other places where it seemed as though Mr. Christiansen did not bring from his singers all the tonal beauty of which they were capable. He has them so absolutely under his control that he can do anything with them he chooses, and if he should pay greater attention just to the beauty of the tone he could make this choir unique.</p>
   <p>The audience applauded the singing with great warmth, and the singers deserved the highest praise. The Chorus is a remarkable body of singers, and the most practical sort of demonstration of what can be done by a man of genuine power who is given a free hand. There is always the material if the man can be found. Mr. Christiansen is the man. This choir will be a stimulus to singing in the churches wherever it is heard, and it should cause the choral societies to do some hard thinking. It is to be hoped that they will sing here again, for everybody interested in choral singing should have the opportunity of hearing them.</p>
