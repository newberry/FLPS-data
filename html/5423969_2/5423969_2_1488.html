   <p>The ladies of the Norwegian Club opened the new season with a very successful concert on Saturday evening, September 8. Income from the concert is to go to the ladies' club inventory fund. An unusually versatile musical program of excellent quality was given by Maud Wilson, soprano; Arthur F. Plate, tenor; assisted by Lilly Wejer-Johnson, pianist; and Hjalmar Rabe, violinist. The selections were received with much applause.</p>
   <p>The concert was attended by about 150 club members with their ladies and acquaintance after the concert they all went to the club rooms where refreshments were served and the flaming fire in the Peis (fire place) greeted as from home.</p>
   <p>Both from the point of view of art and finance the evening was an unqualified success</p>
