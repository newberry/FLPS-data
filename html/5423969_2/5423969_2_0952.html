   <p>The fire at the Iroquois Theater caused a great deal of sorrow; more than six hundred people, among them a great many outstanding Norwegians, perished in the conflagration.</p>
   <p>The majority of the deaths were caused by suffocation in the fumes and smoke. As usual the main cause of the great loss of life in the fire can be traced to the laxness of the city officials. Our lawyers are demanding ten thousand dollars for every Norwegian that perished.</p>
   <p>Of the many Norwegians who lost their lives, we can mention only a few at this time: Albert Alfson, Mrs. Carl Schoubesk, and her two daughters, were the first bodies to be carried out. About twenty Swedish men and women died in the fire.</p>
