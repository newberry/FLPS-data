   <p>"The influence of the Pope is being exerted in both the United States and Spain to avert hostilities. Two great motives are said to sway the conduct of Leo (XIII). He would avoid the dangers that would threaten the throne of Spain should a war occur. A great European power would be pleased if he could dispel the war cloud.' It is the Austrian Emperor, who would also spare his kinswoman, the Spanish Queen Regent, the threatened dangers.</p>
   <p>"The Roman Church holds authority in Cuba through a concordat. It was executed by the Vatican and the Spanish Government. Certain powers are hereby given the Church. She holds a position in Cuba established by law. The independence of the island would necessarily shatter this work of Papal diplomacy.</p>
   <p>"It is said the Queen Regent has personally appealed to Leo XIII. That he has responded favorably there is no doubt."</p>

   <p>If the Pope is anxious to avert war, let him tell the Spaniards to get out of Cuba as fast as ships will take them. Nothing short of unconditional surrender and evacuation of the island can now stay the hand of the United States. If they get out quickly enough, the contempt of the American people for the nation of cruelty, torture, and assassination may save it from deserved punishment for the crime of blowing up the "Maine".</p>
   <p>Pope Leo XIII ranks high as a statesman and diplomat, and his representatives in this country are men of eminent ability. He ought to know that any effort on his part to exert influence in Washington in behalf of Spain is, at this stage, a profitless waste of time. The Pope, as well as the Emperor of Austria, has had ample time to intercede with Spain in behalf of the Cubans. They have not done it. For three long years, the Catholics of Cuba have been butchered and starved and tortured to death by the minions of "His Holy Catholic Majesty". But the pitiful appeals of the Cubans found no response either in the Vatican or in Vienna.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Now that the United States is determined to stop this unspeakable crime against humanity and civilization, we are informed that the Pope is very much concerned about the fate of the Spanish dynasty, and the privileges of the Catholic Church in Cuba, while the Emperor of Austria would protect his kinswoman from danger. Why did they not listen to the agonizing cries of hundred of thousands of Christian women in Cuba, praying not for privileges but for protection against their Christian torturers and assassins?</p>
   <p>By their silence, by their tacit approval of the Spanish barbarities in Cuba, they have forfeited whatever rights they may have had to speak upon the Cuban question. The American people are now going to settle this business. They need no advice from Emperor or Pope; they have asked for none and want none. They will liberate Cuba, let the Spanish dynasty and concordat stand or fall! They will set the oppressed and suffering people free--free to rule themselves under self-made laws and free to worship according to their light.</p>
