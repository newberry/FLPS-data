   <p>It is admitted at the county treasurer's office that tax-fixing operations may have been carried on for a long time and that the total loss to the county as a result of these frauds may be very large. The office does not know anything definite as yet, but will be able to tell all about it later on.</p>
   <p>The treasurer of Cook County has a princely income from the office, and employs as many assistants as he needs, if not more. Yet he cannot tell whether or not his books have been tampered with on an extensive scale for years, nor does he know whether the county has lost a dollar or thousands of dollars.</p>
   <p>This looks rather puzzling to the average taxpayer. It suggests a pressing necessity for a reform of the business methods in the office of the county treasurer.</p>
   
   <p>Another puzzle is the apparent indifference of prominent businessmen and firms to the criminal operations of Luke Wheeler. According to their own statements, they have known for some time that promissory notes purporting to emanate from their offices have been hawked about in the city; but they have paid no attention to the matter. They have done nothing to put a stop to this dangerous business or to bring the forger to justice. These men appear, on frequent occasions, in gatherings of our "best citizens." They lecture the common herd on the duties of good citizenship, and they are severe in their condemnation of the shortcomings of officials whose business it is to catch and punish criminals. On special occasions they will preach ponderous sermons on various evils of the present system of taxation. How strange, that they should fail so signally to practice what they preach! Why did they not report the forgeries to the state's attorney or the police department?</p>
   <p>Once upon a time it was said of a class of distinquished people that their teachings were sound, but their practices bad. Our prominent businessmen who have shown such exceptional leniency to forgers of their firm signatures--are they to be judged by the same standard? The answer would better be left to themselves. In any event, there are many funny things in this tax-fraud business.</p>
