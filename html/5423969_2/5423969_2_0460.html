   <p>The Norwegian, Theodore H. Lunde, Edison Park, who for a considerable period has carried on pro-German propaganda, last Thursday was called,before District Attorney Clyne,and warned not to go too far in his disloyal activity.</p>
   <p>Lunde,who is the chief of the American Industrial Co., 811 Reese St., is strongly pro-German in his attitude, and strongly opposed to the government at Washington,D.C.</p>
   <p>He is the treasurer of the socalled "Peoples Council of America for Democracy and Terms of Peace." The direct cause for which he was called before the District Attorney was the recent publication of a magazine "The People's Counsellor" apparently published in Washington.</p>
   <p>Of the magazine only the first number has appeared, and this number contains <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but one article, a very long open letter to Mr. Lunde. The letter is signed Junius Americans. The author speaks depreciatingly of America, of England and the Entente powers and insists that Germany must not be deprived of the fruits of its "victory". Further the author demands that a compromise peace be concluded at once in such manner that the German "Central Europe" politics be not destroyed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lunde is well-known in the Norwegian colony here in the city, as a radical idealist and as a man who is very indiscreet in his speech. His residence is at 6825 Olympia Ave., Edison Park, and he is a manufacturer of certain metal parts used in piano manufacture.</p>
