   <p>Henrik Isben's play the Wild Duck was produced for the first time in Chicago at McVickers Theatre Tuesday afternoon Jan. 12, 1907, by Wright Lorimer and his company. The first impression one had was, that even if there were many unoccupied seats left, the audience represented people who appreciated high class drams and took an interest in the efforts made by the actors to produce a good play.</p>
   <p>Particularily was one's attention called to the typical reproduction of the Norwegian scenery that was almost a copy of the original used at Olso, Norway.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lorimer before he first produced the play at Boston, had visited Norway and made a study of the sceneries and costumes and therefore gave the production a Norwegian background and atmosphere which it otherwise would not have had.</p>
   <p>It was a good impression at the opening of the first act, when the orchestra played "Ja vi elsker dette landet", and the national anthem as well as the play itself was met with unlimited applause.</p>
   <p>The interest in the play was noticeable from the beginning, and its realism was appreciated. There were several curtain calls for different actors to appear between the acts and the play was strongly applauded.</p>
