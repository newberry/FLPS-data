   <p>The Norrona Student Chorus of the Norwegian-Danish Theological Seminary gave a very successful concert last Thursday evening at the Immanuel Church. The director, T. J. Smith, and the seventeen young students in the chorus, proved themselves to be singers of high standing. The program was unusual; it could almost be called an international program. The last two numbers on the program were "Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet" (Yes, We Love the Land that Towers), the Norwegian national athem, and "America".</p>
