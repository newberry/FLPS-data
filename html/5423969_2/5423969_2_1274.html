   <p>The Auditorium Theater was filled to capacity at last nights' concert sponsored by the American Conservatory of Music. An excellent program was presented; the seventy-five piece orchestra was under the direction of Adolph Weidig. The main attraction of the evening was Miss Marie Bergersen, the Norwegian pianist, who received the greatest ovation accorded any of the artists on the program.</p>
   <p>Three pianists, two violinists, and two singers participated in the concert. Of the pianists, Miss Bergersen was unmistakably the most talented. She chose to play the opening movement of Tschaikowsky's first piano concerto. This young performer revealed an interpretive ability--an ability that more famous pianists do not always possess--which is the essential requisite of a convincing performance. Her interpretation indicated a certain imaginative-ness of style. Miss Bergersen was successful in producing large and sonorous <span class="page-break">\2</span>tones without the arduous hitting [of keys] which is the last and desperate resort of many of her colleagues. Moreover, she played the Tschaikowsky movement with much brilliance and elan. Hers is an admirable gift.</p>
   <p>The president of the Conservatory, Mr. Hattstaedt, and the faculty are to be congratulated upon the proficiency exhibited by the several pupils on the program. Particular emphasis must be placed upon the talent displayed by Marie Bergersen, a young pianist, who gave a very intelligent performance of the first movement of Tschaikowsky's Concerto in B Flat Minor for piano and orchestra. This selection is a task even for virtuosos, and the elan and spirit, aside from the technique which Miss Bergersen brought to the performance of the work, called forth a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>It is not often that great excitement, particularly at the end of a season, can be aroused over a performance by a music student. The usual formula for <span class="page-break">\3</span>such appearances is that the performer plays correctly, with taste and intelligence, and reflects faithfully the ideas of his or her instructors. Anything like marked individuality is generally taken for granted, the evidence of a thing not seen but subsequently hoped for.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the rule is not without exception, and the performance by Marie Bergersen in the commencement concert of the American Conservatory of Music was a striking exception. The young lady played the first movement of the Tschaikowsky Concerto in B Flat Minor for piano in such a way as to make even the hardened music critic sit up and pay close attention.</p>
   <p>She is really a remarkable pianist. The breadth, the sweep, the insight into the composition which she exhibited would have been a credit to any concert. She has the power of a grown man, and the artistic intelligence of a mature artist. Handicapped as she was by an orchestral accompaniment singularly inelastic and, to put it as mildly as possible, never in any danger of exceeding the speed limit, she finally succeeded in infusing the orchestra with her <span class="page-break">\4</span>own enthusiasm, and the composition was brought to a brilliant and triumphant close.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Miss Bergersen became one of Chicago's most outstanding pianists.]</p>
