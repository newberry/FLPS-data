   <p>p.4.col.1....The BJORGVIN Singing Society arranged a real social session last Sunday at their hall when members and friends partook of a very good supper, played cards and otherwise enjoyed themselves. It is their intention to hold these social sessions regularly thruout the winter, an arrangement in which Scandia is in full accord. The crowning pleasure of the evening was the opportunity to officially greet the new director of BJORGVIN, Mr. Joel Mossberg, a veteran in musical activities and a director "par excellence." We predict a wonderful future for BJORGVIN under this leadership.</p>
   <p>The social session was a real ray of sunshine cutting thru the drab of this workaday world, so we emphasize - keep them coming. Music for the evening's dancing was furnished by an amateur orchestra, whose members are to be highly complimented for their skill.</p>
