   <p>The Chorus of some fifty voices from St. Olaf's College has finally become known to the public. This choral group has started on an extended concert tour which began in Orchestra Hall last evening. Such exquisite choral singing as that which this highly trained body presented on this occasion stands alone among the many musical achievements heard here over a period of years, and credit must be given to F. Melius Christiansen, the conductor, for the remarkable work he has accomplished with his material.</p>
   <p>From occasional solo passages, which stood forth through the evening, it is evident that the voices of the Chorus are all of unusual beauty and perfectly drilled. A tenor, whose vocal quality is not only clear, but of peculiar suavity and beauty; a basso, whose voice is low and ringing; a soprano of crystal brilliance and fineness of tone--these were some of the individual characteristics noticed; but perfect blending, the accuracy of the leading part, and the precision and tone shading of the entire Chorus, make this organization unique for musical perfection and rythmic precision.</p>
   <p>The St. Olaf singers are all of Norwegian Lutheran parentage though most of them are young Americans, and neither difficulties of counterpoint nor height nor depth of range, hold any terrors for these intrepid vocalists. They attacked the sacred songs, the fugues, and the part songs with fine, clean-cut accent and with pure intonation.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of works by Bach, Lindeman, Martin Luther's "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," Grieg, Kroeger, Christiansen, Gretchaninov, and Nicolay. All these selections were sung a capella. It was indeed astonishing to notice the ease and surety with which the choir negotiated the most intricate and difficult compositions.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the St. Olaf Chorus under their leader, Mr. Christiansen, will meet with enormous success on their coming concert tour.</p>
