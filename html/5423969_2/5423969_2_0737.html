   <p>We have mentioned time and time again the danger of elevators or hoisting apparatus used in our hotels and downtown buildings. These contraptions are for lazy people who do not want to walk up a couple of flights of stairs.</p>
   <p>Every so often we hear of an elevator falling three or four stories to the basement of a building, usually resulting in death and destruction.</p>
   <p>Recently there have been many accidents, some of them fatal to a number of people, and many of our countrymen have [been crippled or lost their lives]. What can be done about this situation. Rigid inspection, fines for owners of buildings where such accidents occur because of negligence or the removal of these death boxes.</p>
