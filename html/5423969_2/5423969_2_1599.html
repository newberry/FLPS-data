   <p>The 1914 tour of Norway by the Norwegian singers is the most interesting subject of conversation in the colony, and the interest is growing daily. They are all dreaming of the delightful trip across, the shorter trips to all parts of Norway, the laurels they expect to win, and the numerous experiences and loving memories that will never be forgotten whether the traveler ever again sees Norway or not.</p>
   <p>Extensive plans are made for financing the trip, and even as early as November 26 of this year a concert is to be held in Wicker Park Hall. Aside from the massed chorus and solo numbers by the individual groups arrangements have been nearly completed to have an outstanding vocal soloist, but as this has not been definitely settled we are not at liberty, at present, to divulge the name of this famous lady. Lovers of good singing will be offered one of the finest concerts ever heard in Chicago.</p>
