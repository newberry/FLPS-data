   <p>A concert was held at Wicker Park Hall last Saturday; the proceeds are to go to the Home for the Aged in Norwood Park. All nations were represented in the audience, but the Americans had the largest representation. Mr. Ingram, an elderly well-known gentleman of the Wicker Park district, and owner of the Wicker Park Hall, said to the chairman of the affairs committee: "Step into my office and I will write you out a check to help organize more concerts like this one."</p>
   <p>Inga Orner was, as usual, the idol of the evening, and Marie C. Bergersen received unusual applause. Regarding Mr. Gustaf Holmquist [Swede], it is unnecessary to say much about him for everybody knows that he is one of Chicago's best. The concert was well attended, so the Society for the Home for the Aged will be happy when they receive the check tomorrow.</p>
