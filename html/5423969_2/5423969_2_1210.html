   <p>The Norwegian Singer's Association holds and enthusiastic meeting.</p>
   <p>Life and enthusiasm characterized the meeting of the Norwegian singers yesterday. At the installation meeting in Bjorgvin Hall there were at least 150 singers, men who have carried the heavy burden of promoting singing activities here in the city, men whose names are symbolic of the male singers movement in America.</p>
   <p>The veteran Julius Jaeger, the inspiring toastmaster of the evening; Alfred Paulsen, the composer, placing the seal of music upon the resurrected organization; Emil Bjorn, the beloved music director, (there is probably nobody in America so unanimously regarded as he is.); Rolf Hammer, the opera singer, whose name is synonymous with beating the drum for singing, were present. Dr. Thomas Warloe was also at the meeting. Dr. Warloe has a perfect command of English; he is an enthusiast for singing and a force for progress. Many others who have done valuable work in the realm of singing and other music attended. There is good reason to believe that during the new season there will be no <span class="page-break">\2</span>shortage of singers. Plans are being worked out for one great concert in which all good singers in the Association will have a chance to be heard. The new officers which were installed are eager to have the performance of the Singer's Association raised to the highest level.</p>
