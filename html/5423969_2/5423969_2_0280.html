   <p>Those contemporaries who greeted the Berry Committee with a chorus of angry snarls and who have done their utmost to hamper the committee and to belittle its work, now demand the head of Joseph Kipley. This demand is in line with their former attitude of shielding the administration. Mr. Kipley is to be made the scapegoat of the powers in the City Hall, and after he has been sent into the desert all is to be well again and the traffic of covering up the corruption and rottenness in the City Hall is to go on as before. The scheme is undoubtedly well intentioned, but it won't work. Joseph Kipley cannot be used as a scapegoat for the simple reason, that if he is able to carry his own load of sins into the dreary desert that is all the poor man can possibly do.</p>
   <p>Moreover, Mr. Harrison has no sympathy with the proposition.</p>
   
   <p>"I will keep Kipley in his place in spite of all the newspapers in town,"the mayor is reported to have said. "I appointed Chief Kipley to his present position because I believed him to be well-fitted for that place. His management of the police department has given satisfaction, and you can say that he will stay as long as I am the head of the city's affairs. I have not the faintest intention of ordering his removal."</p>
   <p>This is clear and explicit. It is, furthermore, a timely hint to those papers that have been trying to mislead the public as to where the responsibility for the rottenness disclosed in the police department should rest. The head of the administration must assume the responsibility, and Mr. Harrison has no desire to shirk it. To this extent, his decision to keep Kipley is good logic, although it will be regretted by all law-abiding people. Joseph Kipley should go, as should also Thornton, Kraus and his colleagues, and the rest of the present administration.</p>
   
   <p>It has been demonstrated beyond any possibility of doubt that lawbreaking is an integral part of the policy of the powers that are in the City Hall. It is time for the grand jury to take action on the matter.</p>
