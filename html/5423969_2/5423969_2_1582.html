   <p>Nordmendenes' (The Norwegian Male chorus) minstrel show on Saturday evening, was a decided success. Negroes, blacker or better dressed, we have never seen; and their interpretation of the old southern melodies and negro spirituals was very good. The Negro atmosphere was not what it should have been, and this was due to the rather poor offerings of two guest comedians (not in a colored sketch), who though highly-touted as entertainers, were decided failures. The boys from the chorus could easily have put on the same, or another sketch and mad it really funny. This group has so much talent that importations of Saturday's sort are not necessary.</p>
   <p>A new member, Trygue Holst, recently from Trondhjem sang several solos. He displayed great talent and was awarded hearty applause. The evening was a typical Nordmendenes affair; good music, good singing, plenty of excellent food, and dancing to music by a good orchestra. What more could one ask?</p>
