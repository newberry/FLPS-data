   <p>Nordmandenes (Norsemen's) Male Chorus celebrated its forty-second anniversary at its club rooms on Thursday evening, October 31, with a banquet, a musical program, and dancing. The banquet was given for both active and inactive members with their ladies and a number of special guests. Among the special guests were Consul and Mrs. Haugan and Dr. and Mrs. Quales.</p>
   <p>The high point of the evening came when Dr. A. Doe, on behalf of the ladies auxiliary, presented the chorus with a large Norwegian flag of silk, to match the American flag they had given the chorus on their thirty-eighth anniversary, in 1908. Dr. Doe's remarks were very appropriate and his quotation from Ibsen very apt. He unhesitatingly asserted that the forty-two years of success enjoyed by the Nordmandenes Chorus was due, in large measure, to the faithful support of the wives, mothers, sisters, and sweethearts of the members; Ibsen says of one of his characters, "He was strong, borne onward by the influence of good women".</p>

   <p>As the two flags were placed side by side one could not get away from the conviction that the two were related. The red field with its white and blue cross, and our own Star-Spangled Banner made a harmonious whole that touched hearts so deeply that the singing of "America" and "Ja Vi Elsker" (Yes, We Love) gave one a thrill and a choked feeling which can only come to the true lover of his country.</p>
   <p>"A word as to the design and significance of the Norwegian flag," said Dr. Doe, "will not be out of place. As we all know, the Danish flag 'Danebrog' (the red field signifies courage, the white cross purity and justice) is the oldest existing national flag. During the union with Denmark, Norway flew the Danish flag, but following the congress at Eidsvold, in 1814, a blue cross, signifying freedom, was superimposed on the cross of white, giving us Norway's beloved red, white, and blue. In the ancient saga the cross was the hammer of the god Thor, while now it is the symbol of Christianity, the cross of Christ. May these two flags, the most beautiful on earth, wave to the end of time, their colors ever binding in tighter bonds the people of the nations which are the world's greatest lovers of liberty."</p>

   <p>Rev. J. H. Meyer, pastor of the Christ Church in Logan Square, spoke enthusiastically for male choruses in general and Nordmandenes in particular, and voiced his sincere regret at the attitude of condemnation assumed by the leaders of our Norwegian churches toward these organizations. We honor Reverend Meyer, the only Norwegian Lutheran pastor who dares face his narrow-minded leaders and become a member of a group characterized in the Lutheran Almanac for 1912 as one of the fruits of the "Devil's tree of evil". May more of our pastors follow the example of Reverend Meyer and show themselves more human than they have hitherto dared to.</p>
   <p>The musical entertainment of the evening was furnished by the chorus, Miss Bella Mickelsen, Mrs. Dina Conradi, Albert Olteson, and Henry Anderson. Scandia says Happy Birthday.</p>
