   <p>"German domination, fraught with intrigue and combined with violence, must be crushed, if not completely at least to the extent of preventing it from obstructing the friendly intercourse between nations. "If the present rulers of Germany were replaced with men of responsibility duly elected as spokesmen for the German people, men who are ready to join in efforts to safeguard the world against future wars, then we would be willing to pay the full price for peace and justice on every point and for every nation. The final social order must include our enemies as well as our friends.</p>
   <p>"Only then will we consider the war as won," says the President. "When the German nation, through properly authorized representatives, says to us that she is ready to join in a world order based upon justice and compensation for the damage and wrong doings committed by her rulers, we are ready to negotiate. They have wronged Belgium and northern France, which therefore must have restorations made."</p>
   <p>The President says that not only must Germany relinquish Belgium and northern France, but she must also give up its power over Austria, Hungary, the Balkan States, Turkey, and Asia Minor. There is no intention to rearrange the empire of Austria-Hungary, but these countries must be given full control of their own affairs.</p>
   <p>The deep wrongs which have been committed in this war require that restoration be made, but not through wrongs of like nature against Germany and its allies. Humane considerations prohibit actions of vengeance when the accounts of the war are to be squared. The Central Powers are not to be given up to plunder and punishment because the irresponsible ruler of one country perpetrated deep and outrageous injustice.</p>
   
   <p>The nations have a right not merely to free traffic routes on the ocean but, besides, to safe and unobstructed access to these traffic routes. This holds true not only of the weak but also of the strong nations, enemies as well as friends, Austria as well as Serbia and Poland.</p>
   <p>Such in brief, is the President's statement of the principles for which our nation is fighting. It is directed to the American people only as a matter of form. It is, in fact, a message to the world, a vigorous and eloquent repetition of the motives and aims for which our nation is carrying on the war.</p>
