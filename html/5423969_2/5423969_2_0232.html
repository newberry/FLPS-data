   <p>The teachers' pension fund is bankrupt. Our firemen and our gallant guardians of the peace have already had ample time to mourn the disappearance of their respective pension funds, and now our teachers have discovered that their fund is a rather illusory treasure.</p>
   <p>The firemen, the police force, and the teachers include the three most important branches of public servants in the city. In the police and fire departments, efficiency, courage, and integrity are essential to the proper performance of the duties of the service, while professional skill, devotion, and zeal are necessary attributes of a successful teacher. For service in these branches we select the best from among the applicants in their respective classes; and in order that the very best service may be obtained and the accumulated experience <span class="page-break">\2</span>and increasing efficiency of these functionaries may accrue to the benefit of the city, they are assured of promotion according to merit and of a pension when their public workday is at an end.</p>
   <p>Now it appears that these assurances were nothing but false pretences. The pension funds are gone. Money that has been contributed by the prospective beneficiaries themselves, out of their earnings or by dint of hard work, is squandered or stolen, while the prospects of restitution are vague and uncertain. It is not gangs of professional robbers who have made away with these funds; they have been looted by the very men to whom the people have intrusted the management of the financial and other public affairs of the city. The money laid up for the rainy day of old age of our firemen and police officers has disappeared in the bottomless maw of the city administration and its horde of retainers and public robbers.</p>
   <p>This is bad enough, God knows; and yet, bad as it is, the worst feature of the deplorable business is the public apathy towards this wholesale looting of <span class="page-break">\3</span>public funds that should have been guarded as a sacred treasure. Apparently the people do not care one whit about the management of their affairs. The present administration has squandered every penny left in the treasury by the preceding administration and, in addition, piled up huge indebtedness; the facts are as plain as an open book; but the people are indifferent. The administration has robbed every fund within its reach; but there is no public outcry. The administration invites the people to saddle themselves with a big loan of millions of dollars for the administration to squander, but they seem to regard the proposition as a rather enjoyable joke.</p>
   <p>Pessimists and a few others regret this sluggishness of public sentiment, which by no means augurs for better government. But they reap naught but disappointment for their pains. The sovereign people have a constitutional right to govern themselves as badly as they please, and the people of Chicago evidently propose to enjoy the costly privilege to the very limit of their endurance.</p>
