   <p>The main issue of the war between Russia and Japan was Korea. Each of the two powers was trying to gain influence over that country, and it appeared that Russia had the upper hand in the competition.</p>
   <p>Then Japan started the war, claiming, as its reason, that Korea's independence must be maintained. In the peace treaty there were also high-sounding words about safeguarding Korea's independence.</p>
   <p>No sooner was the war ended than Japan started "reforming" the country, and from the very start it acted on the principle of being "master in the house." The Japanese have acted most ruthlessly in Korea. They even stole the holiest temple in the country, carrying it off to Japan. This puts into the shade all earlier known accounts of plundering defenseless people.</p>

   <p>Korea's emperor decided to protest against the acts of the Japanese before the Peace Congress at the Hague, and sent delegates for the purpose. Japan replied by dethroning the emperor. His successor will be a man obedient to Japan.</p>
   <p>The Japanese are people without regard for good faith or the rules of the game. In addition, they are holding on to the illusion that the task of ruling the world has been given to them.</p>
