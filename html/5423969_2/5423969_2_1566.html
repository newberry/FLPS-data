   <p>The Liberty Band and the Northern Light Band have amalgamated and will be known as the Northwest Band.</p>
   <p>The reason is that the number of instruments will thus be increased to twenty-five, and the majority of the musicians will be Norwegian. Math Pedersen will be the instructor.</p>
   <p>The Liberty Band was the remnant of the old and well-known Normannia Band. The only charter member who is in the Band today is Charles Nergard. The Normannia Band, the first Norwegian band, was organized in 1884.</p>
   <p>The Northern Light Band is not quite twenty years old. Math Pedersen has been its leader from the beginning.</p>
   <p>The newly elected officers of the Northwest Band are Oskar Gray, president, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Charles Nergard, secretary, and John Winnberg, treasurer.</p>
