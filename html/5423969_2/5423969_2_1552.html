   <p>A concert was given last night at the Wicker Park Hall, the proceeds of which will be used to erect a monument over the grave of Professor John W. Colberg, the well-known Norwegian musician and director. When the committee asked the agent at Wicker Park Hall what the rental of the Hall would be, the answer was, "Not a cent!" All the printing and advertising were donated, and all the artists offered their services without charge.</p>
   <p>Madame Ragna Linne is so well-known that she need not be discussed; Miss Adelheid Welterding, mezzo-soprano, is also very well known. The Swede, Gustav Holmquist, also offered his assistance. The Norwegian Singers' League and several individual choruses contributed their services.</p>
