   <p>If Mr. Bryan should be elected president, what would he do with the Philippines? He has discussed the status of those Islands on many occasions, and we know that the impressionable Filipino people look upon him as a champion of immediate independence for the Philippines. Among the first things they would expect after his inauguration would be a proclamation cutting the bonds between the Islands and the United States. And if it should not be forthcoming they would soon grow restless and perhaps begin to take matters into their own hands, feeling that they would have the sympathies, if not the open support of the American president.</p>
   <p>The very silence of the radical Filipino press during the present campaign is significant. The nationalist leaders know that their support would weaken Bryan's chances of election because they expect him to make concessions that <span class="page-break">2</span>the great majority of the American people are not ready to grant. Hence their silence. It is not at all unlikely that a Bryan victory would be followed by a native uprising in the Philippines. We know now that but for encouragement received from unpatriotic American theorizers, the Aguinaldo rebellion would probably have remained an unwritten chapter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bryan's "scuttle ship" policy in the Philippines was emphatically condemned by the American people by the re-election of William McKinley in 1900. That verdict was meant to be final, and should be accepted as such by our public men. Nor has the nation had any cause to regret the stand thus taken. What this country has done in the Philippines to fit the people for their rich land and the land for the people, is one of the proudest and most cheering chapters of American history, and has met with the approval of the educated and thinking Orientals as shown in an interesting article in the Modern Calcutta Review. Contrasting Japanese and American methods in dealing with dependencies, the author, Satis Chandra Bassu, a leader of the Indian national movement, says in part:</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"The history of Japanese activity in the Far East since the Russian war does not present an honorable record. She has deprived of her ancient liberties an Asiatic state (Korea) to which the Japanese directly owe their civilization. The barbarous conduct of the Japanese is unworthy of a civilized Asiatic nation. Before the Russian war, Japan snatched away the fair island of Formosa from the country which is the cradle and mother of her civilization. And at the present moment her greedy eyes have been placed over the fertile fields of Manchuria.</p>
   <p>"Contrast the Japanese policy in Korea and Formosa with the American policy in the Philippines, where the government is trying to revive the native languages which had been almost lost during the Spanish regime, though English has been adopted as the common language of the archipelago."</p>
   <p>This from an educated Oriental who certainly is as well qualified to speak for the Asiatic races as are the "anti-imperialists" of the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The inevitable outcome of Mr. Bryan's Philippine policy would be the absorption of the Islands by Japan. There would be a scramble among the great powers for these rich possessions, but Japan would beat them in the game of grab. Her flag would go up the very moment the Stars and Stripes came down, and she would have an army in the Islands ready to hold them.</p>
   <p>Is that what we propose to do or permit? The apt millions of those Islands were freed from oppression and savagery by American blood and treasure, and have been schooled by American skill in all the arts of civilization. Are we to rob these wards of the blessings of American protection and guidance, to become the prey of the harsh, cruel despotism of Japan? Is that to be the end of our God-given mission in the Far East? Our commanding position in that part of the Pacific Ocean, so needful for the protection and development of our Asiatic trade and commerce--is that to be surrendered in cowardly weakness?</p>
   <p>If we are ready to prove false to our great national trust, to lower the flag in disgrace and so make the Pacific Ocean a Japanese sea, then we should vote <span class="page-break">5</span>for the "scuttle ship" policy represented by Mr. Bryan and his "anti-imperialistic" following. But if we are true Americans we will vote for the flag to remain where it was planted by Dewey.</p>
