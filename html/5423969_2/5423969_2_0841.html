   <p>The Norwegian-American Woman's Club met yesterday with an attendance of 250 members.</p>
   <p>This organization is doing a splendid work and is an inspiration to the Norwegian women of our city.</p>
   <p>The membership consists of two classes, active members, whose dues are five dollars a year, and associate members, who pay three dollars.</p>
   <p>There are three departments or divisions: the literary department, which has one class in Norwegian and one in English, the music department, consisting of a chorus and a study class, and the philanthropic department, which helps the Norwegian charities.</p>
   <p>So many physicians are members that a small office has been set aside where each <span class="page-break">\2</span>one gives one hour of her time every day to charity patients.</p>
   <p>The president and the board of directors are elected for one year.</p>
   <p>The reception yesterday was given in honor of a young Norwegian girl who is studying at Yale University after being with Madame Curie of Paris for five years. Her paper on "Radium" was a revelation, and we noticed a great many men in the audience. Our dues enabled us to pay this young lady well.</p>
   <p>We have two club meetings every month, alternating with the literary department's meetings.</p>
   <p>At the next regular meeting of our Club Professor Smithson will speak on "The Position of the Norwegian Woman in America".</p>
   <p>Our president is a woman of rare tact who treats each one in a kind and gracious manner. Character and honesty are our credentials, and our clothes, as <span class="page-break">\3</span>Shakespeare says, are "as good as thy purse allows".</p>
   <p>The woman who works and the woman of leisure have found that after all they are very much alike, each one trying to do some good in the world by remembering the biblical injunction:</p>
   <p>"And the greatest of these is charity."</p>
   <p>We should have many organizations like this one.</p>
