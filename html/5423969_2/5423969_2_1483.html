   <p>At the latest meeting of the Norwegian Singing Society, it was resolved unanimously,and with great enthusiasm, to authorize the committee on building to buy land for a building plat, at Fullerton and Fairfield Avenues. A considerable part of the cost of the land has been secured already, and the singers expect to have the remainder ready at an early date.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Singing Society is the oldest and strongest of our singing societies. For a long time it has felt the lack of an owned home. Now since building lots have been secured, the members feel optimistic as to the realization of the greater dream, a home and singing hall of their own.</p>
