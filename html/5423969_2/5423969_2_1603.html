   <p>p.6. On Thursday evening the "Nordmaendenes Sangforening" (Norwegian Male Chorus) held its first rehearsal under the instruction of its new director Mr. Christian Nilssen. The chorus had arranged a "sexa" (6:00 o'clock supper) for the occasion at which Mr. Nilssen was formaly presented by Mr. Bentzen, president of the organization. Mr. Nilssen was deeply moved by the hearty welcome and found it somewhat difficult to control his emotions when he responded to Mr. Bentzen's toast.</p>
