   <p>The new Scandia Hall on Ohio Street, between Peoria Street and Milwaukee Avenue, will be one of the finest buildings on the Northwest side.</p>
   <p>The ground was bought from Mr. John Anderson, the publisher of Skandinaven.</p>
   <p>The new building will cover the entire space on Ohio Street from Milwaukee Avenue to Peoria Street, and all the way back to the alley, near Skandinaven's shop.</p>
   <p>A box has been cemented into the cornerstone, holding several documents, and a copy of the August 4 issue of Skandinaven.</p>
