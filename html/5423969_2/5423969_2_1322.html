   <p>The gilded walls of the promenade corridor in the Grand Pacific Hotel, echoed, yesterday evening, with simple Norwegian songs. As was previously announced, a serenade was given to the famous master of the violin, Ole Bull, by a number of his admiring countrymen in this city. At about 9:30 o'clock, the "Norwegian Singing Society" grouped outside of the hotel at the Clark Street corner, and without delay struck up the familiar air "Hoja Noer". They followed this with "Wir Har Bort Lenkens Wingar". At its conclusion the vocalists were summoned into the hotel, and on arriving in the corridor they were met by Ole Bull and G. B. Carpenter, who introduced all parties. Mr. Bull shook hands with each member of the society, and after completing the rounds acknowledged the compliment shown him in a brief speech.</p>
   
   <p>He said he was heartily glad to see so many friends, old and new, and wanted to tell them how thankful he was for their encouraging aid and friendship. Speaking in a low voice, yet one full of meanings, Mr. Bull referred to the history of the Norwegian race in America, which race had always been foremost in the cause of liberty. He hoped they would keep on the same honorable road and keep the flag hoisted. They were a truly united people having fewer prejudices of caste than any other nationality, and it was good for the country that it had such a people. After toiling many years against obstacles of poverty and sickness, they had at length risen to a nation so important, that no American of intelligence could overlook them.</p>
   <p>The Society then sang "Ossian", and soon afterward dispersed. The whole affair was informal and exceedingly pleasant.</p>
