   <p>Samuel Arentz passed away the other day at the age of eighty-three years. He died in his home at 155 Green Street where he had lived during the past forty-four years. In him the little circle of pioneers of the Norwegian nation in Chicago has lost one of its few early members, for Mr. Arentz belonged to the very oldest group of settlers; his remembrances extended back to the time when Chicago was more of a village than a city.</p>
   <p>The real cause of Mr. Arentz' death was heart failure; since the death of his wife about eighteen months ago the old man's health began to fail, and his heart grew ever weaker. Before the death of his wife Mr. Arentz had never spent a day in bed because of illness. A short time ago he caught a cold which speedily developed into pneumonia, and this illness, together with the weakness of his heart, brought down the old giant.</p>

   <p>Samuel Arentz was born near Bergen, Norway, on January 3, 1818. At the age of ten he went to Stavanger, Norway where he was later employed by a sheet metal firm. He left Stavanger in 1843 and emigrated to America, settling in Chicago. This city remained his home during the rest of his long and active life.</p>
   <p>Three years after his arrival he met the woman who was to become his wife. They were married in 1847, one of the first if not the very first Norwegian couple to be married in Chicago. Three years ago the couple celebrated their golden wedding anniversary, the first golden wedding to be celebrated among Norwegians in the city.</p>
   <p>Almost immediately upon his arrival in Chicago Mr. Arentz obtained employment in his trade with Charles Van der Cook and Company, and with this firm he remained until he started his own business at Kinzie Street, the name of his firm being Arentz and Paulson. In this business, which comprised iron goods and related articles, he continued until he retired from active business a <span class="page-break">\3</span>few years ago.</p>
   <p>A conversation with Arentz about "old days" was something highly prized by anyone at all interested in the past; for not only had Mr. Arentz resided in Chicago before any considerable number of Norwegians had settled in the city, but his capacity for observation was keen, and his memory unusually good. His tales of Chicago in the days when he came here two generations ago were, therefore, of unusual interest. Yet he was not, as is the case with many old people, so enamored with the past that he could not see anything good in the present. On the contrary, he had his eyes open for progress, and his descriptions of life in the Chicago of old were ever spiced with comparisons with conditions as they are now.</p>
   <p>Arentz and his wife had eight children, five of whom survive them. The oldest, Mr. A. C. Arentz, is employed at the Recorder's office where he has charge of the index books; a second son is an insurance agent, and the third is book-keeper for a firm on Michigan Avenue and Water Street. Two daughters, Mary and Amy, assumed the household duties after the death of Mrs. Arentz.</p>
