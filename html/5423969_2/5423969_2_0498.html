   <p>Whether the English-American Arbitration Treaty be ratified or not, it is safe to assume that the peace prize will be awarded to President Taft in 1912 by the congress (Storthing) of Norway; if his name was presented in time--which may or may not have been done--the honor will come in December this year. No other man in the world today looms so large as he to the teeming millions who grope their way, bent under crushing burdens of past and prospective wars.</p>
   <p>The first award of the peace prize was made in 1901. In all, twelve men and one woman have received the honor. This peace roster contains the names of three Swiss, three Frenchmen, an Englishman, an Austrian (Baroness Bertha von Suttner), a Hollander, a Swede, a Dane, and an American. The group contains the foremost champions of the peace and arbitration movement in Europe in recent years, all being distinguished as publishers or statesmen. The only chief <span class="page-break">\2</span>executive in this galaxy is Theodore Roosevelt, who received the prize in 1906.</p>
   <p>The rapid growth of the peace sentiment in all lands during the last decade is due largely to the faith, enthusiasm, and zeal of these and other "idealistic dreamers". A series of arbitration treaties of limited scope, the peace conferences at The Hague, and the International Arbitration Tribunal are a fruit-age of their efforts, and mark the successive steps in their peaceful war upon war.</p>
   <p>Yet the burdens of war have been growing heavier from year to year. Even pronounced peace advocates have, although reluctantly, supported increased appropriations for military purposes to meet similar increases in some other country. This apparent inconsistency is easily explained. Existing arbitration treaties provide for a peaceful adjustment of minor differences that rarely lead to a clash of arms, but exclude those where dishonor or war appear to be the only alternative. Any attempt to get beyond this point seemed hopeless. The accepted principle that no questions involving the honor or vital interests of a nation could be submitted to arbitration barred further progress.</p>

   <p>At this juncture President Taft cut the Gordian knot by his famous speech suggesting a broader scope of arbitration so as to include even questions of vital interest. He spoke at the psychological moment and all the world listened. His speech re-echoed throughout the world and was in all lands accepted as a harbinger of a coming halt in the mad race of armaments. The treaty with England framed along the new lines has demonstrated to the world that the President spoke not as a mere theorist, but as a practical statesman who knew that he had the support of his country, the strongest in the world. The remarkable enthusiasm with which the English people have hailed the pact shows that the English-speaking world was ready for the new message. Other nations will follow sooner or later.</p>
   <p>President Taft stands today the most conspicuous spokesman and champion of the world's peace. America was the only country whence such a broad arbitration proposal could come; but it took a strong, far-seeing, and courageous man to speak the word.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The Storthing of Norway was the first parliament to voice a demand for arbitration treaties. In no parliament was President Taft's great initiative hailed with more sincere enthusiasm; and it will be with a keen sense of satisfaction that the Storthing [awards] the peace prize to the great American President, the first ruler to give arbitration a breadth and scope that promises to relieve mankind of the dread and crushing weight of war and secure to it the blessings of honorable peace.</p>
