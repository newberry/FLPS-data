   <p>According to a press report, Reverend F. Weber, who preached the now notorious "Catholic sermon to Catholics", has been requested to leave the diocese. It is said that this priest hails from somewhere in the West; his particular place of residence is not given. Nothing has been heard from or about him since he sounded his note of open treason. He may have concluded that Spain has a more agreeable climate than the West.</p>
   <p>While no direct disavowal of the traitorous sermon has been made public, such men as Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland have expressed their views upon the impending conflict and the attitude of the Catholic Church in the present crisis. Archbishop Ireland, who is generally regarded as the most <span class="page-break">\2</span>gifted and aggressive spokesman of the more progressive wing of the Church in this country, says in an interview:</p>
   <p>"The Catholic Church assumes no attitude of any kind. It has not been called upon the scene. The fact that Spain is a Catholic nation matters nothing. The question is not one of religion. If there is a question at all, it is one of national and international right and nothing else."</p>
   <p>This is conservative and correct: "the question is not one of religion." Yet Ireland's utterances will be a disappointment to a large number of people who have read with admiration his many aggressively American speeches at patriotic gatherings. He says that in his opinion, "nothing has yet come to light that would call for a rupture between the United States and Spain." The larger question between the two countries is not the "Maine" disaster; the question that imperatively calls for a rupture of some kind is Cuba. But Archbishop Ireland does not even allude to this question, and hence it may be inferred that he is not in favor of American intervention in Cuba.</p>

   <p>At a requiem Mass celebrated at the cathedral in Baltimore a few days ago, Cardinal Gibbons made an address and read the services of the dead. The Cardinal said in part:</p>
   <p>"I hope and believe, for the honor of humanity, that the destruction of the "Maine" was caused by an accident, and in that case Spain cannot be responsible. But suppose some fiendish Cuban had occasioned this fearful loss of life in order to embroil our nation in a war with his mother country? In that case Spain should not be held responsible. And even had some fanatical Spaniard perpetrated this atrocious crime, there would be no necessity for a recourse to arbitrament of the sword. The only circumstance that should warrant active hostilities would be the evidence that the Spanish government connived at the placing of torpedoes or explosives in the harbor of Havana to destroy our vessel. But I do not believe, and no sane man can believe, that a chivalric <span class="page-break">\4</span>nation would be guilty of such inhumanity.</p>
   <p>"An able commission has been appointed by the government to investigate the cause of the disaster. Let us calmly and dispassionately await the result of their verdict and not anticipate their judgment. One thing is certain: this country knows how, in any emergency, to defend her honor and protect her interests."</p>
   <p>It will occur to some of our readers that His Eminence does not observe his own injunction to suspend judgment until the commission's verdict shall have been made known. He tries and decides the case in advance, both as to fact and law. He advances a theory that is absolutely unsupported by any scintilla of evidence thus far made public, namely, that the destruction was caused by some "fiendish Cuban." And he adds that "active hostilities are not warranted," unless it can be proven that"the Spanish government connived at the placing of torpedoes or explosives in the harbor of Havanna to destroy our vessel."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Everybody knows that such proof can never be furnished except by a direct confession of guilt by the Spanish government, and "no sane man can believe" that such a confession will ever be made by the government of His Catholic Majesty. In other words: While exhorting others to "await the result of the verdict and not anticipate the judgment of the commission," Cardinal Gibbons has argued Spain into a position where she is safe from "active hostilities" unless we should decide to wage an "unrighteous war" against her.</p>
   <p>It may be that His Eminence did not intend to take such an extreme position, but it is fair to assume that the bearing and force of every word uttered on this solemn occasion were weighed and well considered. Neither can it be denied that the conclusion reached is based upon the logic of his own words. Cardinal Gibbons is the honored head of the Catholic Church in the United States. His address was pre-eminently "a Catholic sermon to Catholics." Hence it will be regretted that he should have seen fit to render an advance decision in the "Maine" case which may put our country in the light of waging an "unrighteous war" in the eyes of those who look to the Cardinal for guidance; <span class="page-break">\6</span>for nothing is more certain than that Cardinal Gibbons' doctrine of Spanish responsibility never will be accepted at Washington, except by a handful of Spanish "cuckoos" in the capital.</p>
   <p>If citizens may raise the question of the"unrighteousness" of a war waged by the government of the nation, they may also consider it a duty to follow the advice of Reverend F. Weber and take up arms against the United States. The loyalty and patriotism of Cardinal Gibbons himself are not doubted by any fair-minded citizen. But we have some ignorant people in this country who are as yet untouched by the spirit of American patriotism, and for the benefit of such people, every citizen whose words are a law unto many men should speak so clearly and definitely that not even the dullest can mistake his meaning.</p>
   <p>The majority of the American people do not share the views of His Eminence on "Spanish Chivalry". Spanish history reveals nothing chivalric to them. Spain, the motherland of the Inquisition, has always been an implacable enemy to <span class="page-break">\7</span>liberty. Her history is a forbidding drama of oppression, cruelty, and treachery, continued from one century to another. In the western world, the most inhuman, wholesale shedding of innocent blood has marked the trail of Spanish rule from the days of Columbus up to the present time. Even such an atrocious crime as blowing up the "Maine" pales before the fiendish inhumanity practiced by Weyler in Cuba with the sanction of the Spanish government. Not even Turkish history presents anything so utterly abhorrent and forbidding. The Turks have slaughtered their enemies by putting them to the sword. But the policy of exterminating a people of 1,500,000 souls by starvation and thus end a war that Spain has shown herself unable to win in honorable warfare --such a hellish policy is their conception of "chivalric Spain", and of no other nation upon the face of the earth.</p>
   <p>A nation that can adopt and execute such an unspeakable crime against humanity is in the opinion of the majority of the American people, capable of any act of inhumanity.</p>
