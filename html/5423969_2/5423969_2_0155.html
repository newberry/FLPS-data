   <p>Peter Kiolbassa has issued another proclamation to the people of Cook County, setting forth all the nice things he is going to do if they will be good enough to elect him county treasurer.</p>
   <p>It is all very pretty, but the practical effects are likely to disappoint Mr. Kiolbassa. The voters will regard his promises in the light of his performances as building inspector, just as they will be guided in their opinion about Mr. Handberg by his performance as president of the county board. And their conclusions will be that a man who, like Mr. Kiolbassa, has so signally failed to fulfill his duties as a public officer is not to be trusted in a position of greater responsibility; and that a man who, like Handberg, has been tried in one position and not found wanting, is likely to give satisfaction if he should be intrusted with another.</p>

   <p>Mr. Barrett has also gone into the proclamation business. It will do him no good. Dan Healey's record is well established and well known to the people of Cook County. The voters are firmly convinced that, if elected, Healey is going to make a model sheriff, and they will attend to his election.</p>
   <p>The leading Democratic candidates on the county ticket are long on promises but short on records; and it is records of the right kind that tell.</p>
