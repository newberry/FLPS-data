   <p>p.8.col.3.... Revenue collector Henry L.H.Penman resigned last week, by request. That he has held this position under two Presidents is largely due to his connections with the worst political elements in the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Senator Lorimer made some effort to have Penman retained but the Senator's gesture was in vain,as he has all he can do to keep himself and those near him on the free side of prison bars. During his tenure of office Penman has accumulated a generous share of this world's goods. It will be recalled that at the time several Illinois State Treasurers were tried and sentenced to refund, to the State, certain misappropriated funds, Penman refused to do so. He had previously transferred all his property and money to his wife.</p>
   <p>Penman's methods and their results are a shining example of the sickening conditions in the State of Illinois, when a man who has been forced to skip from his own country and, though a fugitive from justice in that land, can <span class="page-break">2</span>with cunning scheming attain one of the highest positions of trust in the State.</p>
