   <p>Mr. Nicolay Grevstad. Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Having just read your [article] "A Sad Tariff Lesson" in the last Skandinaven, a question occurs to me that I should like you to answer.</p>
   <p>The protectionists of this country claim that it is necessary to have an import duty sufficient to raise the prices on foreign products to the amount that would be required to manufacture the same kind of goods and put them on the market in this country. The barrier of a protective tariff is needed, then, because labor costs more in this country than in foreign countries. In your article concerning Norway you do not touch [upon] this side of the question at all.</p>
   <p>Hardly any country in Europe can manufacture goods cheaper than can Norway. Wages are low, and her many great advantages of utilizing water power saves her to a great extent the expense of steam.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Now then, are the conditions in Norway such as can apply to this country--the United States--and vice versa?</p>
   <p>Yet, in Norway I thought a protective or high tariff was a good thing; here, with the magnificent resources of a new and vast country, it seemed to me that the ideal condition of free trade might well be applied. The United States seemed to me to be in a position to take the lead in the world's progress.</p>
   <p>As to the question of taxation, I cannot see but that a direct tax on property and incomes is right and just, far more than the indirect taxation by which a man does not know exactly when he is paying taxes or how much he is paying.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, I am not going to discuss these questions with you or anybody else.</p>
   <p>I am simply</p>
   <p>A Student.</p>
   <p>[Reply of Nicolay Crevstad]</p>
   <p>"A Student" wants to know whether "the conditions in Norway are such that they <span class="page-break">\3</span>may apply to this country or vice versa".</p>
   <p>Certainly not, and "A Sad Tariff Lesson" will show him why not. The United States may adopt a protective tariff or a revenue tariff, because either will produce a sufficient revenue. Norway cannot at this time adjust her import duties exclusively with a view to protect home industries, because such a tariff would not produce sufficient revenue.</p>
   <p>The United States is a country with vast and varied resources. Nearly everything that enters into the consumption of man is produced here. It is a country sufficient unto itself in a higher degree than any other country in the world. Such a country is in a position to adopt protection or free trade, as may be deemed best.</p>
   <p>Not so with Norway. She is very far from being sufficient unto herself. In the present condition of her industrial fabric she cannot do without a pretty liberal dose of free trade. She must find employment for her ships and markets for her fish and lumber.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It is true that labor and power is cheaper in Norway. Why? Because labor is not in demand. Free trade has taken the work out of the hands of the Norwegian workers. Capitalists are afraid of investing in new industrial enterprises, because they know that in spite of an ample supply of cheap labor, they cannot face unrestricted foreign competition. It is easy for German or English manufacturers to flood Norway with a certain article, and sell it cheap, or even below cost, in order to crush any new enterprise that might be attempted in the same line in Norway. As "a student" knows, this is precisely what the manufacturers of all large industrial countries are in the habit of doing. Canada was the favorite dumping ground of the manufacturers of this country until she put a stop to this practice by adopting a protective tariff in 1878. Norway is not a country noteworthily adapted for protection. But she needs a certain measure of protection, and this is now understood by her people. The recent growth of the protection sentiment in Norway is all the more remarkable because her limited resources do not permit her to enter upon a policy of protection generally applied.</p>
   <p>Which country has been, and is, leading in the world's progress, if not the United <span class="page-break">\5</span>State?</p>
   <p>As to direct taxation, it is sufficient to say that everybody concedes that direct taxation is just in principle while no one has been able to prove that it operates justly in practice.</p>
