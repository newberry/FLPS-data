   <p>All thoughtful and patriotic citizens realize by this time that city government by political parties is a dismal failure, and that if they really desire better government the people must take matters into their own hands and place in office fearless and honest men who do not owe allegiance to any boss, or ring of bosses, or any political machine.</p>
   <p>There can be no improvement under the present system. As long as municipal politics is controlled by party organizations, the question of "what there is in it " will constitute the dominant issue at caucuses, in conventions, and at the polls. It makes very little difference which party is "in" and which is "out". The two machines work hand in hand for the mutual benefit of those who control them and their retainers. The Democratic machine is always sure of getting a slice of the Republican pie and a "lift" from the Republican machine whenever needed; and vice versa, when the Democrats are in and the Republicans <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>out. The most essential difference between administrations elected by the machine is that those officials from whom the people expect some improvement disappoint every hope pinned to their promises, while those to whom we look for nothing but bad, inefficient, and corrupt government give us the full measure of our expectations.</p>
   <p>The people must act, and the time is ripe for action. There is nothing to be gained by further delay. The hopelessness of obtaining needed reforms at the hands of the professional politicians has been most thoroughly demonstrated. To rescue the city from the clutches of the political machines is a difficult task, but the issue is not doubtful if the honest people in all parties will join hands and go to work in thorough earnest. The result of the spring election shows what can be accomplished when the people are aroused and united for the cause of better government. The same forces which were strong enough to rout the gang at the aldermanic elections can give the city a nonpartisan Mayor if no time be lost in going to work. The taxpayers are weary of dishonesty <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and inefficiency and ready to support a well-directed movement in this direction.</p>
   <p>Speed the movement!</p>
