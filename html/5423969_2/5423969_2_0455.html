   <p>Once again Skandinaven calls attention to the request for contributions to Christmas gifts for the soldiers, published in another column in today's paper. There are numerous Norwegians in Chicago and elsewhere who could contribute considerable amounts to the fund which is to bring a little joy and happiness to our brave boys at the front, and their purses would not become much smaller on account of it.</p>
   <p>Birger Osland is the first to send $10 to Skandinaven. There are many Norwegians who can afford similar amounts; smaller sums, too, are gratefully accepted. Many little brooks from the big river. Also, let us have, without delay, a large number of small contributions. If the gifts are to arrive at the front before Christmas, it will be necessary to have them bought and shipped very early.</p>
   
   <p>November 15 is the deadline for gifts.</p>
