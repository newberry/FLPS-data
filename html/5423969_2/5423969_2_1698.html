   <p>p.4.col.3.... The Chicago delegation to the convention of the United Scandinavian Singers League, left for Sioux Falls, S.D. on Thursday via the Illinois Central Railroad.</p>
   <p>Enthusiasm for the trip was far below that of two years ago when the singers met at Minneapolis, Minn. for one of the most enjoyable conventions in the history of the League. The lack of enthusiasm is largely due to the ruling by the Sious Falls committee prohibiting the appearance of individual Chicago choirs in solo numbers for they must sing as a joint chorus. For this reason many of those who never miss a convention decided not to take the trip.</p>
   <p>Nordmandenes, Bjorgvin, Glee Klubben and Kvartet Klubben each sent two or more representatives including Emil Bjorn, director, and Hanry Anderson, soloist.</p>
   <p>A motion to hold conventions every fourth year instead of every two years will <span class="page-break">2</span>be offered by Nordmandenes delegation at the business session of the League. The Glee Club will also make a motion to change the name of the League to the "Norwegian Singers League" instead of the"Danish-Norwegian" as the League consists of thirty-three Norwegian choruses and one Danish group.</p>
