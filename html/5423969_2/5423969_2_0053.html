   <p>To the Editor of the Tribune: Chicago, Oct. 31. Sir: I do not think that it can be true that the Democratic Committee has taken our countryman, Mr. Riechel, off of the Democratic ticket and put on a person by the name of Kavanaugh, to satisfy a lot of working men who have no votes. Mr. Riechel is the only representative of the great Scandinavian element who has been put upon any ticket. We think that, after he was fairly nominated, he should remain where he was, and not be interfered with.</p>
