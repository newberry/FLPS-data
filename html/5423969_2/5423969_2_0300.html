   <p>And now comes the defendant, the Honorable Joseph Kipley, and says:</p>
   <p>"I know no man on the force by his nationality. We were compelled to make some changes in the personnel of the department, but to say that this was done with any reference to particular nationalities is not only unjust but untrue. The police department is made up of all nationalities and in a general order, members of some of these are bound to suffer. The Irish are proverbially good politicians, they press their claims very hard and are bound to come to the front. But as I am a German and as my mother had Scandinavian blood in her veins, it is not likely that I would discriminate against my own people."</p>
   <p>It will be admitted that the Honorable Joseph Kipley is more interesting than persuasive when he appears as a witness in his own behalf.</p>

   <p>"I know no man on the force by his nationality," says Kipley. Of course not. Who ever suspected him of knowing that Schaack is a German, O'Connor an Irishman, Kolstad a Scandinavian, etc? Perish the thought!</p>
   <p>"We were compelled to make some changes in the personnel of the department," the chief proceeds. He does not explain by whom "we were compelled," but permits it to be inferred that it was not by any regard for the good of the service.</p>
   <p>"The police department is made up of all nationalities, and in a general order members of some of these are bound to suffer." No discrimination here! The department is made up of all nationalities, and hence in a general order all-- no, only "some of these are bound to suffer." Among these there are no Irish. On the contrary, they "press their claims very hard and are bound to come to the front." Are we to understand that this "hard press" is identical with the "compulsion"to which the chief alludes?</p>

   <p>Be this as it may, he is entitled to credit for his frankness in explaining the principles that govern his appointments. The people now understand why good men were summarily discharged in order to provide places for men many of whom have shown themselves to be utterly unfit and unworthy of any public "job" outside of the penitentiary. The "press" [i. e. pressure by the Irish] explains it all. The "press" is not particularly concerned about the good of the service, but when "the press" presses "we" are compelled to make changes.</p>
   <p>That is all there is to it, and that is the long and the short of police department management, according to the Honorable Joseph Kipley.</p>
   <p>Nearly all of those men whose heads were dropped in the basket by the notorious general order thirty-two bore German, Scandinavian, or American names. But that was no evidence of ill will on the part of the chief toward those nationalities! "As I am a German and as my mother had Scandinavian blood in her veins, it is not likely that I would discriminate against my own people," says the redoubtable chief. That is as plain as daylight. He just chopped off their <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>heads for pure love--because he considered them to be altogether too good men to do a police officer's work.</p>
   <p>It is true, in the light of his own statement as to his pedigree that his order of wholesale decapitation may remind some people of those birds that befoul their own nests. But it is self-evident that the Honorable Joseph is not open to any such charge; for he knows "no man on the force by his nationality," while, on the other hand, he does know that "the Irish press their claims very hard and are bound to come to the front," even if it be necessary to discharge efficient American, German, and Scandinavian officers by the hundreds, in order to make room for the Irish claim-pressers or pants-pressers.</p>
