   <p>A song, with words and music by M. Frederic Berat of France, "My Normandie" has now been translated into Norwegian and has also been arranged as a solo number. "My Normandie" was received with great enthusiasm at the 1000 year celebration at Rouen, France, a year ago and is of special interest to Norwegians throughout the world as this celebration was centered around the name of "Ganger Rolf" (Wild Rollo) the Norseman who conquered France and is the progenitor of no less than seventeen ruling European monarchs of today.</p>
   <p>Chicago's own Prof. Alfred Paulsen, some time ago, arranged "Mit Normandie" (My Normandie) for four voices. That the arrangement is by Paulsen, is in itself a guarantee of wonderful harmony. For beauty of words and harmony we know of few equals to "My Normandie" and feel that this piece should have its place in the home of every music-loving Norseman.</p>
