   <p>There is a fearful amount of bad legislation in this country, and the chief source of this evil is to be found in the application of the principle of rotation in the legislative positions. Lawmaking is a subtle science and a fine art, the most difficult task of all in the complex and complicated process of government. The most finished product of modern civilization is a wise and successful lawmaker. He is, or ought to be, the skilled workman of politics "par excellence".</p>
   <p>This delicate function we entrust--to our wisest and best men? Far from it! The majority of the men who make our laws are petty, local politicians whose ambitions must be satisfied in some way, but who do not possess influence enough to obtain any of the offices that "pay". This ignorant crowd is then <span class="page-break">2</span>let loose upon society and invested with power to tinker with institutions and principles, and to embody their whims and vagaries in statutes which the people are compelled to obey, if such mongrel laws are not so completely meaningless that their enforcement cannot be attempted seriously. Bad legislation is the main curse of all modern democracies, as it must be as long as the power of lawmaking is exercised by the political roustabouts of society, by a set of men whose ignorance is only matched by their monumental lack of experience. This applies with especial force to our state legislation; but as everybody knows, the lower house of Congress also contains a large percentage of men who are entirely unfit for their duties, and who serve their constituents and their country best by doing nothing at all except to draw their salaries.</p>
   <p>Instead of letting legislative offices go 'round, and thus placing the power of legislation in the hands of inexperienced and incompetent men, good men should be returned as long as they are willing to serve, or at least so long <span class="page-break">3</span>as the other party is willing to let them serve. It is old heads and experienced hands rather than new blood which are needed more than anything else in our legislative halls. The shifting fortunes of parties result in a more than sufficient supply of the new blood that is needed. But when a man has reached the point where he can become really useful as legislator, by reason of acquired experience and familiarity with the work, he is put under the thumbscrews of the principle of rotation in office, and told to give way to a new and untried man.</p>
   <p>N. P. Haugen is a case in point. He has served the same district for three consecutive terms in Congress, and is understood to be willing to accept the Congressional nomination this fall in his new district which is made up largely of counties forming the old eighth district. Technically considered, his nomination would not be a renomination; but the people are requested to look at the substance of the thing, and to send some other man, for the <span class="page-break">4</span>very reason that Haugen has served long enough to acquire thorough familiarity with Congressional routine and the work of national lawmaking. It is possible, at least it is to be hoped, that the good sense of the people will assert itself in this instance. Haugen's record as a member of the lower house is one of brilliant, and solid ability. In the great battle with the southern brigadiers, he has stood firm as a rock against which the waves of fury dash in vain. His contributions to the great tariff discussions in the House rank with the best efforts of the ablest members of the House. He possesses what may be termed a "legislative temper" in an eminent degree, and is endowed with all the essential qualities of a useful and wise lawmaker--wide information, a studious mind, native conservatism, well-grounded convictions upon public questions, and a liberal supply of practical common sense.</p>
