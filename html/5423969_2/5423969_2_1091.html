   <p>Otto Christian Ericson was born in Guldbrandsdalen, Norway, in 1852. He arrived in Chicago with his father in 1868. He worked as carpenter's apprentice for a year. In 1869 he went to work for Christian Jevne on Kinzie Street.</p>
   <p>Ericson was, as far as, is known, the first businessman in Chicago to publish a "house organ"; he called the weekly paper Bon Vivant. Bon Vivant is considered the best house organ in America today.</p>
   <p>In 1887 H.H. Kohlsaat, then owner of the Chicago Inter-Ocean offered to Ericson a half interest in a western chain of restaurants. Jevne then, because of Kohlsaat's offer, gave to Ericson a quarter interest in Jevne and Company.</p>
   <p>After Jevne's death Ericson purchased the remaining interest in Jevne and Company. He employs today 125 people in his [grocery] business. He has a branch store on the South Side.</p>
