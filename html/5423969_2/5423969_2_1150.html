   <p>Karl Michelsen, 804 Grand Avenue has made a model of a flying gas baloon which is far superior to anything on the market. His faith in flying is great; he states that in the near future he will fly to the north pole. He is offering his baloon to Fridtjof Nansen.</p>
   <p>The model is three meters in length and has three propellers and a rudder. The three propellers can be used for driving power and for steering purposes. It can turn left and right, up and down.</p>
   <p>Karl Michelsen was born in Norway; he is twenty-seven years old and has been in America only three or four years.</p>
