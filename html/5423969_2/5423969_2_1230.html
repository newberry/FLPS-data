   <p>The Norwegian opera singer Otto Clausen did not disappoint the large and expectant audience that attended his Chicago debut in St. Timotheus Church last Saturday.</p>
   <p>He possesses a powerful, rich and well-trained baritone, which masters the operatic classics as well as the small songs of Grieg and Sinding, and the audience was so thrilled that it forgot its church etiquette and applauded loudly.</p>
   <p>The performance of the pianist Miss Irma Brynildsen was of the same high quality and the concert was a real triumph for the artistic couple.</p>
