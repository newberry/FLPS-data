   <p>Upon disembarking from the S. S. "President Roosevelt," one of my old American friends greeted me and whispered in my ear, "My dear friend, please do not say that you are a socialist, because they do not like socialists here." He was right, since, for not following his advice, I was excluded from the land of liberty for five years. Since that time, MacDonald toured America, where he was warmly received, and, thanks to his influence, the order for my exclusion--in spite of my being a "dangerous revolutionist"--was suspended.</p>
   <p>It would be exaggeration to say that there is socialism in America today, yet the truth is that the masses are beginning to realize that their case <span class="page-break">\2</span>is not hopeless. The first thunderbolt that struck Wall Street stirred the people, who thought at the time that unlimited speculation was the chief cause of the crash. However, when the stock market tumbled again, it had to be admitted that everything was not in order in the world's richest country.....</p>
   <p>American overproduction, the perfection of machinery, and the rationalization of production all tend to aggravate the world crisis of capitalism. American capitalism advanced faster, more brutally--it was not retarded by the difficulties that beset Europe. With the exception of the Southern states, there was, strictly speaking, no feudalism in the United States. There were no economic limits or traditions to hinder capitalism, which forged ahead by leaps and bounds, a fact of which the workers were unaware until now.</p>
   <p>Let us not forget that in America, during the capitalistic era, everyone was concerned with his own well-being only, no one worrying about the <span class="page-break">\3</span>situation as a whole. Up to the present time, no one has had any anxiety. If it was hard to make a living in one field, there were other fields to try. No one noticed that in the meantime capitalism was being concentrated. Today the people understand that the same capitalism--God forgive it--which meant prosperity, is preparing to undermine the right of individual ownership. A number of the bourgeois are horrified to note that they are becoming impoverished and proletarian.....</p>
   <p>Since the end of the World War, America, taking advantage of the poverty of Europe, has conquered the markets of the Old World. Production in America was based on this new situation. However, America did not stop to think that Europe would gradually recover economically, a recovery that already has come about. Be it through socialism or "Fordism", the fact is that an organized drive, in the form of a United States of Europe, is on its way against the Americans' monopoly of foreign markets. It makes no difference to the New World whether the change in the European situation takes the form of socialism or capitalism, the fact remains that America <span class="page-break">\4</span>will lose a valuable market for its goods.</p>
   <p>The crisis is increased by the fact that industry is not the only one to suffer from overproduction; agriculture, too, suffers a great deal. For instance, the Ford factories had to reduce their production from ten thousand to three thousand cars per month. The 1928 surplus is still in their warehouses.</p>
   <p>Before the World War, fifty per cent of the population of the United States was made up of farmers. This ratio has dropped to thirty per cent, which means that industrialization has increased.</p>
   <p>In view of this situation, the number of the unemployed is inevitably becoming larger and larger every day. As no official statistics on the number of the unemployed have been made, it is difficult to give an exact <span class="page-break">\5</span>figure, but it is thought that there are from four to eight million people without work in this country.</p>
   <p>I saw machines that can do the work of two, three, and four hundred people. The fate of the unemployed is made worse because the government does not give any kind of relief to them. This brutality is a newer proof of the unscrupulous methods used by American capitalists, who do not see the necessity of compensating the unemployed. The proletariat is not sufficiently organized. There are not more than two million organized workers in the United States, as the task of organizing the workers who flocked here from all parts of the world has been difficult. Immigration kept the workers on the move continually from East to West, and the different nationalities, as in the tower of Babel, were unable to understand each other. With the closing of the doors of the United States to immigration, it is anticipated that the socialist and trade-union movements will gain ground.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The repetition of the crash of the stock market not only ruined the economic foundation of the United States, but also disillusioned the optimistic conceptions of Americans.</p>
   <p>The American citizen believed with peculiar naivete that he had to thank his racial superiority for prosperity. Some went so far as to say that Almighty God rewarded Americans because their moral conception and energy were superior to those of other people. There was an element of mysticism, a heaven-sent gift, in this unbelievable conception of prosperity.</p>
   <p>Another circumstance aggravates the American economic crisis. Instead of practicing economy, as in the Old World, the capitalistic system in the New World advocated squandering. Buying senselessly was instigated by unbelievably shrewd advertising. The crisis is the more unbearable because the public has become accustomed to a higher standard of living, a standard <span class="page-break">\7</span>which is only possible when the worker receives his wages regularly. Today, the worker, besides being unable to indulge in luxury, finds himself deep in debt for things he bought on the various installment plans.</p>
   <p>The installment system is an American invention that exhausts the consumer leaving him like a squeezed lemon. Houses, automobiles, typewriters, clothes, tools can be paid for on a monthly payment system. It can safely be said that ninety per cent of the salaries are mortgaged in advance.</p>
   <p>The foregoing is the situation in a nutshell, and still one can't express his doubts about prosperity. The newspapers never publish anything that would contradict this stubborn optimism.....The press is not supported by the readers but by the advertisers. We have the Saturday Evening Post as an example--it costs but five cents a copy, but an advertisement in it costs one or even two thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Although I could not state my opinion of the economic crisis in the American <span class="page-break">\8</span>newspapers, still the audiences at my lectures were interested in this topic most.</p>
   <p>The lecturer is assailed by questions so childish that they sound foolish. I was asked whether I could define the difference between socialism and anarchism. Furthermore, I was asked what is the difference between French, English, German and Russian socialism.....The answer to these questions was made difficult by the total absence of elementary theoretical knowledge on the part of the American audiences. An American attends a lecture with the intention of finding a radical cure for his ills. He feels that his country is not on the right road, that its economic theory is all wrong, and he expects the lecturer to prescribe a remedy. Nothing is more disappointing to an audience than the lecturer's obscure answer.....</p>
   <p>American ideology is traveling in the direction of collectivism, and standardized life will make the transition to socialism easier, but it is <span class="page-break">\9</span>doubtful whether the change will take place smoothly. That unspeakable brutality with which the Americans treat not only the Negroes but the "inferior" immigrants, proves that their morals have not improved and that there will be a bitter struggle. I am positive that the unfortunate Sacco and Vanzetti would have escaped the electric chair had their eyes been blue instead of black.</p>
   <p>If a European country commits a crime, it tries to justify it by moral and legal reasons. In America this is done more simply. They cynically assert, "We know that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent of the crime for which they were electrocuted, and that Tom Mooney has been suffering in a prison for nearly fourteen years, but they were all dangerous revolutionists, so we were justified in committing a theoretical crime against them."</p>
   <p>I am positive that nowhere in the world will the war between capitalism and proletarianism be bloodier than in America.</p>
