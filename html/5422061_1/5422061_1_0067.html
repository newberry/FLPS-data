   <p>The committee organized for the purpose of freeing Lidikiewicz, a foreigner, who is being held in prison on charge of having in his possession several bottles of home-brew, has petitioned President Hoover for a pardon.</p>
   <p>The committee has sent notices to the American foreign newspapers, whose number is over one thousand in order that they join in the movement to free Lidikiewicz. They also wish to point out that <span class="page-break">2</span>often foreigners are victims of unauthorized enforcement of prohibition.</p>
   <p>The text of the notice reads:"Unfamiliar with the English language, ignorant of American customs and laws, the foreigners are the easiest victims of over-zealous prohibition agents. The situation is growing more serious day after day, so much so that the Foreign Language press has seen fit to interfere.</p>
   <p>We all know that the Volstead act cannot be inforced because it interferes with one's personal liberty. This law is just as invalid as one enacted to curb one's religious beliefs.</p>

   <p>Lidikiewicz cannot be charged with violating the law. Judges have ruled time and again that one may have alcoholic beverages in one's home for personal use. Dry agents, who enter a home without a search warrant, are violating the Constitution of the United States."</p>
