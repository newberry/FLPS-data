   <p>The change in economic conditions in the United States has naturally brought about some very difficult situations. These conditions have affected the Hungarian working people just as they have affected the rest of the nation. The present unemployment situation has harmed thousands of Hungarians.</p>
   <p>In the first place, there are those who have not been in this country very long and, therefore, they have not established themselves in industry, due to their lack of sufficient service; there are those who belong in the common laboring class, those who do not have a trade of any kind; then there are those who have little or no ambition and naturally are not wanted by industry.</p>
   <p>It is an absolute fact that there are thousands of Hungarians in Chicago who are unemployed and who are going hungry.</p>
   <p>After these unfortunate, breadless Hungarians have gone to the limit of their credit, which does not take long, they then are left destitute, common beggars.</p>
   <p>Can you visualize what a terrible situation it is, when an absolutely normal person must resort to begging in a foreign country? This fact is not imaginary because the Hungarian beggar has already made his appearance in the United States.</p>
   <p>Those who came here to the land of wealth have been cheated, and now, with bowed heads they visit Hungarian homes and beg. This is a very bitter situation, but it is not new.</p>
   <p>We older Americans know that before the war the Hungarian beggar visited Hungarian families and Hungarian organizations. Who can tell us how many letters asking for aid were received by Hungarian organizations and Hungarian businessmen of this city?</p>
   <p>Years ago, when economic conditions became bad and unemployment resulted, the Hungarian beggar appeared. In the past this movement was so great that some of the common beggars became regular professional beggars. There were those who regarded begging as a regular business: they worked the Hungarian districts of the cities from New York to San Francisco, with letters of recommendation, many of these letlers written under fictitious names. They begged from individuals as well as from Hungarian organizations.</p>
   <p>The war put a stop to this detrimental business of begging. </p>
   <p>The never-ceasing begging that took place before the war was so great that those Hungarians who were financially able organized lodges and societies to care for this situation. The main idea of these organizations was to see that those deserving aid received it.</p>
   <p>The members of these organizations did not receive any benefits; all they did was donate. These benevolent organizations existed in New York, Chicago, and Cleveland. The Chicago Hungarian Charitable Society was famous throughout the nation. This organization was highly respected and favored for the honest and indiscriminating work it performed.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Charitable Society, after almost fifty years of active existence, disbanded during the war. There weren't enough needy people in this rich land of ours; therefore, there was no field for the society to work in. From the organization mentioned above, the Hungarian Charitable Ladies Society was formed. This Society centers its activities around cultural and social movements. Even today they are doing some wonderful work in their own exclusive circle.</p>
   <p>But the original aim of the Chicago Hungarian Charitable Society is lacking; even among its members the ever-increasing American ideas can be felt, although the membership consists of a large number of prominent Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Present conditions require the activities of the old Hungarian Charitable Society. There are a great number of Hungarians in and around Chicago who are in need of food, clothing, and shelter. All good Hungarian businessmen should give this careful thought. Through an organization such as this, work could be found for many. Aid received through an organization of this type, would be appreciated a lot more than aid from individuals.</p>
   <p>Today we have in Chicago a large group of influential Hungarians, who are both financially and socially prominent, and they could do a lot of good to help these unfortunate people.</p>
   <p>There are enough Hungarians in this city who could well afford to pay the yearly dues of ten dollars as was paid in the past by the members of the organization. There are many who could pay as high as two hundred dollars yearly.</p>
   <p>It is our idea that the time has come in Chicago when this group of beggars, and even more so those who are sitting back suffering quietly, should be taken care of by a regularly organized group of Hungarians. Those who are willing to aid financially should come out and put their arms around those sufferers, and help the more unfortunates across the deep ravines of starvation and hard times.</p>
   <p>This problem is a humanitarian duty, and it is needless to write more about it. This movement should be started, the sooner the better, because the hungry and ragged are at our doors, and there are many destitute Hungarians roaming the city streets. It is sorrowful, but we are satisfied that this is true.</p>
   <p>In the olden days, when the Austrian-Hungarian Empire existed, the Consul saw to it that aid was received from that government, because they had sufficient funds set aside for this purpose. It is useless to wait for such aid from the Hungarian Consul. Poverty is reigning in Hungary and it seems that they themselves will need help. We are left here alone to do this charitable work. We must bring this movement to life with our own strength, and start the work anew.</p>
   <p>This newspaper, keeping the interest of all Hungarians at heart, can be depended upon for a helping hand in promoting such a noble idea, but we will expect those Hungarians who know the value of this movement to help promote the idea and keep it from dying.</p>
