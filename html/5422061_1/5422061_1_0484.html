   <p>p. 6 - The time has come when Chicago's voters should come to the defense of the good name of their city, which is more notorious than any other city in America.</p>
   <p>This notoriety is deserved in part because crimes occur daily, protection and graft in public life is thriving, and gangsters can commit felonious crimes, because they know they will go free, if caught.</p>
   <p>Taxes are so high, especially on homes, that we are wondering how long we can hold on to them, or will we have to sacrifice them to the real estate sharks.</p>
   <p>The present city administration is responsible to a great extent for the unemployment situation, because it will not begin public works that were promised.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We can remedy this situation only in one way - if we change the present bad economical system by voting next Tuesday for Anton J. Cermak.</p>
   <p>He and his associates will deliver Chicago out of the mire.</p>
   <p>R. Lamping.</p>
