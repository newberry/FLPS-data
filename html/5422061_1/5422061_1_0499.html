   <p>The selection of a man to fill an important position in Illinois politics provides a very good indication of the attitude of the people of the United States toward the World Court.

   <p>The Chicago Hungarians lined up with the victors many weeks before the election took place. The Hungarian people were well-organized for this election, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>therefore played a very important part in it.</p>
