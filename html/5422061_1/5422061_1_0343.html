   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Some weeks ago, your valuable paper published the functions of the Cooperative Society of America. Allow me to discuss some of the most important facts contained therein.</p>
   <p>During its two years of existence, this society has waged a battle on high prices. This war has been waged not only in the business area, but also in the courts to prove how honesty and solidly we are working to forge ahead in a successful manner.</p>
   <p>On March 17, Judge Charles M. Foell enjoined State's attorney Brundage from interfering with the sale of the shares of the society. The State's attorney held that the shares of the society were not registered, according to Illinois law, in the correct classification with the Secretary of State, Louis Emmerson.</p>

   <p>Harris F. Williams, substituting for the State's attorney, did not find it necessary to re-register the issued and sold shares, but he maintained that the issued shares which have not as yet been sold, should be re-classified and re-registered from Class A to D, although a dollar for dollar security is shown.</p>
   <p>After the attorneys for both sides had been heard, the judge decided that the stockholders had been treated justly when their shares were placed in Class "A", Had the shares been in Class "D", and sold as Class "A", then the society would have been guilty of violating the law.</p>
   <p>That the society is functioning on a secure and reliable basis, is best shown by the fact that the society enjoys the patronage of one hundred forty stores and more than 93,000 members.</p>
