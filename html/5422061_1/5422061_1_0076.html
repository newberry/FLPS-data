   <p>It is more than a month now since Prohibition has gone into effect in the United States.</p>
   <p>The passage of this law did not surprise us. We were prepared for it. We knew it would become effective soon, but little did we realize how serious its effect would really be. We always believed that wine and beer would be legally sold, therefore, the people did not care much whether whiskey was taken away or not.</p>
   <p>When Prohibition first became effective, many newspapers stated that the sale of wine and beer was still permissible, but later, this permission <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was denied, in accordance with the law. We feel certain that this country is to remain "bone dry."</p>
   <p>If we give careful thought to this mania of Prohibition, we will notice that to prohibit the sale of wine and beer means to impair the health of many people. This fact is well known as far as medical science is concerned. Of course, it does not justify the attitude of those who over-indulge.</p>
   <p>Other than the fact that this law is of an undemocratic nature and is depriving us of individual liberties we do not condemn it. The people who introduced the bill, and those who made it a law knew what they were doing.</p>

   <p>It is not our aim to try to modify this law, but we will try to show the effects it will produce, and what profits society will reap thereby.</p>
   <p>If we look at this law from the standpoint of the workingman, then we will come to the conclusion that it might be of great financial benefit to the working classes. But only in the event that the law will be strictly enforced so that there should be absolutely no alcoholics in circulation. We know very well that only a man with clear faculties can wrestle the problems of the day, and is able to intelligently tell of his needs. If this law is carried out fully, we can only say that it will be a great help to the working class. It will realize more fully its responsibilities, and will improve the moral character of man.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>We do not believe that this law will have such strength because the worker, who was a habitual drinker, does not have the will-power to stop drinking before any harm has been done, either to himself or society. He continues without limit, feeling he has a right to drink as much as he desires. This is his personal liberty and he balks at any interference.</p>
   <p>Therefore, from a social standpoint, we are forced to criticize Prohibition and we are fully satisfied that Prohibition will be detrimental to society.</p>
   <p>It is only natural that if a person is told not to do a certain thing, that person generally tries to do it, regardless of its consequences.</p>
   <p>We can say the same thing about the man who drinks. He does not understand <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the law. All he knows is that he wants his drink and thinks he cannot live without it, therefore, he will get it, no matter what the price is.</p>
   <p>As a consequence, those people who are addicted to alcohol will prepare something which will have a far worse effect on them than whisky ever had. Many people will become dope addicts, which is much worse than alcoholism. It is only natural that forbidden fruit is much sweeter. We say without any hesitation that this law may mean a degenerated society in the United States.</p>
