   <p>A Roman Catholic bishop instructed the priests under his supervision to preach the gospel of Christ, to work in behalf of the spiritual interests of their parishioners, but to leave politics to politicians.</p>
   <p>It would be worthwhile to publish this bishop's letter, because it is not only an interesting church document, but the advice contained therein should be heeded by the Hungarians also.</p>
   <p>Individuals who lean toward the radical in Hungarian politics are unaccountably on the side of reactionary politicians here in America.</p>
   <p>Horthyists, Habsburgists, and followers of Karolyi and Kossuth--even socialists--are in one camp. They are all good American Republicans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This is a typical American-Hungarian political chop suey.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to be too consequential in politics, for politics is an elastic thing. Usually the character of a politician wavers, and it isn't always that he understands the deeper meaning of politics.</p>
   <p>The Catholic Church has learned its lesson from the mistakes of others. It has realized that where Catholics are in the minority, as in America, it should not interfere in politics. This attitude insures it peace of mind. If a Protestant is elected instead of a Catholic, no reproach, suspicion, revenge, or harm can come to the Church from the victor.....</p>
   <p>The present battle for the Presidential election has brought to light much dirt, and it is not surprising that the religions of the nominees are being given a public airing.....</p>
   <p>There should be other reasons besides religion for the voter to decide who <span class="page-break">\3</span>will make a better President--Hoover or Smith.</p>
   <p>According to our opinion, no one should vote for Hoover just because he is a Protestant or for Smith just because he is a devout Catholic.</p>
   <p>We would be belittling ourselves if, in 1928, in the world's most democratic country, we would decide this question of who will be our President for the next four years with such medieval stupidity.</p>
