   <p>I answer, with the above heading, to the article titled "Cave-Sleepers," which appeared in last week's issue of the Tribune. Perhaps should add my own name to the above heading, because my name was mentioned also by the Tribune.</p>
   <p>I agree with the ideas expressed in the article, and I would like to read that you would "peel the skin from the face" of John Bull. The shameful ingratitude accorded the United States for the services in saving England from being expelled from the face of the earth by the Germans is clearly shown in an article in the issue of Herald and Examiner on January 15, page 1. This article describes how the American Mariners are murdered by the English in Cork.</p>
   <p>I shall not mention again how the United States "raked the chestnuts from the fire" for the English, and the attitude they assumed toward the United <span class="page-break">2</span>States. It is enough to say that by God's grace the American people soon enough came to their senses and left the whole "crooked business" to England who alone is worthy of it. Nevertheless, America is cautious enough, and she declares she wants to be at peace with the whole world. Still she builds the largest navy in the world, which England cannot duplicate until she pays the debt owing to the United States. Since England is so beggarly that she cannot afford to pay even the interest, we have still less hope of ever getting the capital. England cannot be taken seriously, she cannot keep pace with us in the development of armaments.</p>
   <p>Who would furnish her with money for that? All Europe is bankrupt, and this bankruptcy was staged by England and we must admit that she was successful, at the same time, bled us. I am certain of this, however, England will not succeed in bluffing away the large amounts of money given to her by the United States, because if she were to resort to such tactics America will give her a thrashing, and that with not over-exertion.</p>

   <p>As to the German-Russian-Japanese alliance, it is not news to me, for I predicted it four years ago, and what the result would be. I have foretold too that England will be the first country to try to get away from the old alliance. She will join a new alliance to again be on the side of the victors. Of course, England forgets that Germany knows her cunning, hypocritical, policy, and she will not confer with her.</p>
   <p>If the German-Russian-Japanese alliance begins its work, I think that work will have a tendency to bring to reason the old English-French alliance, because these "running footmen" implored America, with tears, to save them, and since the people here were not very enthusiastic to stop the army of English-French alliance in their flight, certain business-interests might have forced our sons to go over whether or not to prevent the English and French army from disappearing from the earth. Thus, the great English-French victory was won. When the armistice was signed on the basis of the fourteen points of the president of the United States, everybody believed, not only the central powers, but the whole civilized <span class="page-break">4</span>world, was certain that these points would bring universal peace. Instead of peace, the English-French craze gained ground, the results of which are now apparent. I think the new alliance wants to replace what the Englsh-French craze spoiled.</p>
   <p>Although we believe that Germany would have enough reason to sulk as a result of the treatment accorded her but the Germans were wise, and they understood what happened. It was not the will of the American people that brought us into the conflict and the old friendship will return.</p>
