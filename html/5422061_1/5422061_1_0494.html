   <p>p.1.........The South Chicago Branch of the Hungarian Republican Club held a meeting January 9 in the Reformed Church School Hall. The club admitted a few new members.</p>
   <p>The aim of the club is to group the Hungarians into the one political organization. It is to the advantage of all the Hungarians in South Chicago and Burnside to rally under the flag of the Republican party.</p>
   <p>It is high time for the Hungarians to take their place in the political field, but they will have strength only in unity. All information supplied by John Meszaros, Jr. and Charles Banfy, president.</p>
