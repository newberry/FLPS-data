   <p>On Sunday June 24, 1917 the I.W.W. Organization held a very successful picnic. There were many interesting speakers present.</p>
   <p>There was one speaker who made a most interesting talk in regard to the laboring class in America. His speech, in part, was as follows: "We, the workers, who believe that conditions cannot be changed, are very badly mistaken; we are the ones who have power; the factory worker, the farm worker and the miner command a greater power than they realize. I would like to see the miners lay their tools down, and then we would see how long the railroads of the country could operate." Now, with reference to the war he spoke thus: "We, the workers, have no reason to be at war; we have no reason to nurse a grudge against our fellow-men. The Hungarian, Austrian, German, English, French, and Russian workers who are killing one another, have no reason for it.</p>
   <p>If President Wilson has business to settle with the "Kaiser" then he should go <span class="page-break">\2</span>over there and fight it out himself. We have only one interest and that is to break up the system of profiteering." The name of the speaker was not learned, but he spoke very nobly for the I.W.W. cause.</p>
   <p>The profits derived from this picnic will be used to publish a newspaper sponsored by the I.W.W.</p>
