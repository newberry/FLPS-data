   <p>The greatest and most important right that America can give its citizens is the right to vote. Every citizen can have a hand in the selection of officials, even the highest, the President of the United States.</p>
   <p>On the day of elections all differences of race, creed, and class are put aside. All citizens--men and women, native or naturalized, rich or poor--are alike. Each has only one vote. Each has the same right as any other fellow-citizen.</p>
   <p>It isn't only the right but the duty of every citizen to use this priceless privilege. What would be the use of one's having the right to vote in this the world's most powerful Republic, if one would refuse to make use of it?</p>
   
   <p>Hungarian-American citizens should not forget that they cannot vote without registering first. The day of registration in Chicago is Saturday. Therefore, all must register so that they can vote on election day.</p>
