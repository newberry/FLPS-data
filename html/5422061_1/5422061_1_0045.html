   <p>The Hungarian education which was gained by the Hungarian children of West Pullman, was most gloriously exhibited by the Reverend Eugene Boros and his assistant, Daniel Bodor. It was rather sad that the attendance at this affair was rather small compared to that at some of the ordinary dances sponsored by Hungarian societies. There are many reasons for this. One of the main reasons was the terrible heat of the day, and therefore the committee in charge of the affair should have made arrangements to hold it out in the forest preserves somewhere, in true Hungarian style. The other reason was that we noticed there were very few Hungarian Catholics present. In America this is the main fault of the Hungarians. At all of our Hungarian celebrations the different speakers emphasize the importance of co-operation; but when the time comes that a certain celebration should be given due publicity and honored by a large attendance, religious differences and many other things are brought up while the rest of the Hungarians pay little attention. This great holiday of which we are speaking was one in which all Hungarians should have been interested, for it was a celebration of public education in Hungarian for the benefit of our future Hungarian <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>population in America. This celebration should have been such that the American people would have sat up and taken notice of the great cultural development that was taking place among the Hungarians of America.</p>
   <p>The development, and the right of a nation to continue its existence depend upon the education and cultural activities of its youth. A nation that cannot show some development in its youth doesn't deserve to exist.</p>
   <p>The laws of the United States permit the different nationalities to teach their children the language of the nation from which they originated. It is only natural of course, that if this foreign language school idea is abused these different schools will be closed by the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>Approximately fifteen years ago the writer of these lines worked tirelessly to get free space in a public school for the Chicago Hungarians; in this school a Hungarian teacher was to be placed and the English language taught through Hungarian channels to adults. A thousand petitions were sent out by the Chicago Hungarian Independent Song Society to determine how many people were interested <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in going to evening school, and it was found that the number interested in this plan was much greater than a thousand. Then under the leadership of Dr. Weiner a committee of three appeared at a meeting of the Board of Education. Dr. Weiner presented the request of the Chicago Hungarians, whereupon one of the members of the board said in his reply to the request that it was impossible; his reasons were that the Hungarians did not become citizens of the United States because the Hungarian teachers taught them, and drilled into them undying patriotism. Dr. Weiner then answered this charge very nobly by asking this member of the board, if someone told him to disown his mother, would he do it?</p>
   <p>The plan finally won out even over the protest of this individual member of the board. The Hungarian people were allotted free space in one of the schools, and Dr. Erno Lowinger was appointed teacher. His efforts were successful as his classes were attended to capacity at all times. The board then saw how interested the Hungarians were in education and they allotted additional space and appointed an English teacher to conduct these classes, and also appointed an English teacher to assist Dr. Lowinger.</p>

   <p>It seems as though it won't be long before the teaching of all foreign languages will be stopped in these parochial institutions. But until that time comes, religious differences should be forgotten, and when these children exhibit their gains in Hungarian culture we should all attend.</p>
   <p>More of us should take part in these cultural activities out here in West Pullman because we do not have very many Hungarian cultural organizations, even though this is a good Hungarian community. We do not have a young people's society here; the only place they have to meet one another is in pool halls. Don't you think that it would be a splendid idea to organize a cultural society for the youth? We could have a place for these young people to meet, where there would be all sorts of games, a good library, and every once in a while one of our good Hungarian friends could take it upon himself to give lessons in Hungarian, so that this beautiful language of ours would never die.</p>
   <p>It is beautiful to see a Hungarian worker, be it man or woman, who can be at home in a circle of better educated people. I have also noticed that on <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>special occasions when these ordinary workers have been called on to make a speech, there wasn't one who could speak very intelligently. This and many other mistakes could be rectified through a movement for public education for Hungarian adults and young people. The whole world, whether it be in public or business life, loves a cultured and well-educated person.</p>
