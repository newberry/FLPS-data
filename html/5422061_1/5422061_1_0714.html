   <p>June 5th will long be remembered by every man in the United States. On this day the first call will go out for all men to register in order that the United States army officials may pick suitable men for duty overseas. The registration takes in every man regardless of whether he is a citizen of this country or not. At present, it is required that every man who has reached his 21st birthday, but has not reached his 31st should register for examination by the Army. It is the duty of every American citizen to protect his country. Only American citizens are being drafted into the Army, but every man regardless of citizenship will be required to register.</p>
   <p>The registration will take place at the polling places of the different precincts. There will be no excuses for not registering. Even those who are ill must register; there will be special provisions made for them.</p>

   <p>The Hungarian-Americans have always fulfilled all requirements of good citizenship. It does not seem necessary to warn the Hungarian citizens in this country of the importance of registering, because they all know that laws in this country are not considered as a joking matter. Now we must consider the Hungarians who are not citizens of the United States. They must register also, although they are not required to serve in the Army.</p>
   <p>It is very important that no Hungarian should consider this matter of registration lightly. No one should think that if they postpone their registration, the government will not catch up with them. When the offenders are caught no excuses will be accepted whether a man is a citizen of this country or not. The penalty for the offense of not registering is one year in jail, and this penalty can not be escaped by the payment of a fine.</p>
   <p>June the fifth should be kept in mind by all Hungarians and if any of them have any doubt as to the date let him find out about it.</p>
