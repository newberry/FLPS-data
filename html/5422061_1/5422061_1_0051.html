   <p>At its semiannual meeting, the board of directors of the Verhovay Aid Association adopted an important resolution to aid the Hungarian Schools. John Bencze, chief secretary, has written the following letter to the editor of Magyar Tribune:</p>
   <p>"Dear Editor: The board of directors of the Verhovay Aid Association at its July meeting decided to give the sum voted at the last grand meeting for the preservation of the Hungarian language and literature to the most successful students at Hungarian summer schools.</p>
   <p>"For this purpose there are three hundred dollars at the disposition of the Central Bureau of the Association, which will use this sum to reward those Hungarian children who, besides their regular attendance at American public schools enrolled as pupils of Hungarian schools, there achieving outstanding success through their diligence.</p>

   <p>"I have to ask you, dear Editor, to notify, through the medium of your newspaper, all societies supporting such schools to the effect that they send us the name of their most deserving student, one from each school, who in their opinion merits to be rewarded. </p>
   <p>"Your newspaper, being well read, is sufficient assurance to us that this request will reach everyone concerned. At the same time, we assure you that the distribution of the rewards will be done in public."</p>
   <p>It is with great pleasure that we reprint the above letter of the chief secretary of the Verhovay Aid Association, in the hope that those concerned will realize its importance and report the names of those children who deserve to be rewarded.</p>
