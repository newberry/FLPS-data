   <p>On November 2 a very important election will be held. It is your duty as citizens of the United States to cast your vote. But while casting your ballot it is also important to know that you are voting properly.</p>
   <p>This newspaper and its editorial staff has watched the campaign very closely and up to now has not stated whether they thought the Democratic candidates or the Republican candidates were more worthy of the votes of the Hungarian people. We have always been impartial and have tried to advise our readers to cast their ballots in such a way that it would be to the benefit of all Hungarian people, regardless of whether they were residents of Chicago or not. And in order to do this we think that the Hungarian people should cast their votes as a whole for the Republican party, because the candidates on the Republican ticket have done, and are doing, more for our people than <span class="page-break">\2</span>has ever been done before.</p>
   <p>We are sincere in our advice and urge all Hungarians to vote on November 2.</p>
