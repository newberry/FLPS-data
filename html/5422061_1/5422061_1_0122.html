   <p>From day to day, life in the busy city reveals many of the good and bad features of human existence. The opportunities for amusement offered by the city serve to influence the younger generation to engage in criminal activities. They also serve to disrupt family organization.</p>
   <p>Life in the city takes no heed of church, school, or family activities. The city is like a gigantic monster; it swallows the surplus population of small towns and villages because it offers so many more places of amusement.</p>
   <p>These aspects of modern life naturally do not fail to affect the Hungarian people. We have known of many unfortunate cases where city life has proved 
detrimental to the entire family. Fathers and mothers are continually complaining, saying that no matter how hard they try to educate and help their children, the latter leave home when they become of age and show little or no respect toward their parents, who worked so hard to make life worth-while for their children. We must admit that this is not a very pleasant situation for the parents.</p>
   <p>Changes in education in the home have taken place, but these changes have developed rather slowly. The parents of today are still sticking to the old-fashioned ideas of their parents. When the parents of today were children they had to be good and obedient, because they realized that they were at the mercy of their parents. They could not go out and find work as readily as can be done today.</p>
   <p>But during the last generation the world has gone through a great revolution. The profound changes in our economic life have created new problems. The new conditions have forced the parents to send forth their young children to sell papers, magazines, etc. in order that they might earn money. As the child grew older, he or she began to realize the value of money. The child began to realize that he did not have to beg his parents for a nickel so that he could go to a movie. He knew that he could go out and earn money whenever he so desired.</p>
   <p>Soon the child goes to work in a factory. His parents force him to turn his wages over to them, and on Saturday or Sunday he is given a few cents for spending money. When this happens, the child wakes up to the fact that he can do better for himself by going elsewhere for room and board, not only because he will then be free to do whatever he wants to with his money but also because there is no one to dictate to him about the regulation of his habits.</p>
   <p>The parents must realize that the good old days they enjoyed so much are a thing of the past. The children of today cannot be reared in the same way as we were.</p>
   
   <p>The children of today maintain an attitude of independence, but we think that they should remember the Fourth Commandment: "Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land....." But more important than this commandment is the law which says that the child will receive the same respect from his children that he has shown his own father and mother.</p>
   <p>It is not a very pleasant spectacle to see a tired mother, who has worked hard all day around the house, burdened with a sophisticated daughter who thinks that she is too good to lend a helping hand when she returns home from her job in the office or factory. These haughty girls are not even ashamed to ask their mothers to act as servants to them. We do not say that every girl is like this. There are good girls who help their mothers, but harsh as this may sound, even they will become spoiled when they acquire friends who are not so good to their mothers.</p>
   <p>We can see only one way in which this difficult and delicate problem can be solved. The parents must decide whether they want to raise a small number of good children or a large number of bad ones.</p>
   <p>The second part of the solution to the problem [calls for a new attitude on the part of the parents]. The parents should be more than mere father and mother to the child; they should also be his good friends, so that whenever he has a problem to solve he can come to his father or mother and discuss the matter as frankly as he would with a friend.</p>
   <p>Many parents commit a great mistake in neglecting the child. When they fail to praise the child for the things he has done, the child becomes discouraged and eventually adopts a hostile attitude toward his own parents.</p>
   <p>The most important problem of the bay is the maintenance of the family and the home. If these institutions--the family and the home--were to collapse, civilization itself would disappear.</p>
   
   <p>The struggle for existence becomes harder and harder. Competition is taxing the physical and mental powers of man to the utmost. When a man comes home from work he is tired; his desire for rest keeps him away from his children. With this in mind, the next generation must realize what a great responsibility it assumes in raising children. The lives of the parents must be adjusted; they must be adapted to the standards of modern times. Parents and children must join hands and reveal their love for one another. Harmony in the home forges the strongest ties which keep the family together.</p>
