   <p>Recently we received the following notice, and we are glad to give it space in our paper:</p>
   <p>"Dear Countrymen: The time has come for Hungarian-American citizens to take their place among other nationality groups in Chicago to do their part in the social work of the city. To achieve this purpose the Citizens' Club has been formed on Chicago's South Side. This Club is arranging a mass meeting which will be held on March 15, together with the celebration of the Hungarian Independence Day. Eminent speakers will discuss the subjects of good citizenship and Hungarian unity under one flag. </p>
   <p>"Let us make this a great occasion! Bring your families with you.</p>
   <p>"The procession begins at 2 P.M.; it will start from the Hungarian Home, and will 
<span class="page-break">\2</span>proceed to Roseland, West Pullman, and South Chicago, then back to the Magyar Home where the mass meeting will take place.</p>
   <p>"Patriotically,</p>
   <p>"The Committee of the Citizens' Club."</p>
