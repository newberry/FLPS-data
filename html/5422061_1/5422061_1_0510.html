   <p>There are three Hungarian associations for political purposes in Burnside and that is just the reason why none of them could succeed in the past. Some farseeing leading persons saw this, and have tried to unite the associations into one, by calling a general meeting, where this proposition might be discussed and a greater formation founded, which could demand and merely plead for the rights of the Hungarians. Friday the 3rd of May this general meeting was held in the Hungarian House. Two out of three political clubs consented without opposition to the fusion, and submitted themselves to the wishes of the meeting. As the meeting discussed all the questions thoroughly, the time was so far advanced, that the participants could only elect the new president in the person of Jack Rosenfeld, and as for the election of the other officers it was decided, that a new meeting should convene on the next Friday, the 10th of May at the same place.</p>
