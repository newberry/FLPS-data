   <p>"Let us end the discord!" This was the slogan which, in spite of all hindrances and regardless of religious and political beliefs, brought together from all over America the delegates of the different Hungarian associations to the history-making convention held in Chicago on June 23, 24, and 25.</p>
   <p>Let us save our sick benefit associations which operate on a fraternal basis, and which, in case of sickness or death, are the last line of defense of many thousands of Hungarian-Americans. Let us save these associations for their aged and jobless members, who either have already been dropped or face being dropped from the membership rolls, and who through decades have faithfully paid their dues from their hard-earned wages. Let us help one another in every emergency.</p>
   
   <p>This was the problem the Chicago Convention was busy with--and it was with it in mind that it drew up plans to protect the members of all Hungarian associations. At this Convention no word was uttered on political or religious issues.</p>
   <p>But those individuals and groups that take advantage of the discord existing between the members to prey as parasites upon the already hard-pressed associations are alarmed at the thought that the latter have found at long last a way to act jointly for the interest of all. With the bugaboo of politics these parasites have endeavored to frustrate the Convention by attempting to frighten away the associations from sending their delegates to it. Those who have always exploited the members of the associations and who have never done for the Hungarian-Americans anything in which they did not skim off the cream--those very same groups and individuals are now shouting: "Attention, the money of the associations is coveted here!"</p>
   
   <p>The Convention has declared that it does not want the money of any of the associations. They handle their own money; we only want to obtain through our joined forces Government aid to cover the bond and bank deposit losses suffered by them.</p>
   <p>Despite the fact that these attackers and slanderers could have easily convinced themselves at the Convention that no one could be fooled this time by their attacks--for, without exception, all the great Hungarian settlements were represented there and no political questions were raised, nor was there a word about anybody making money--yet they not only kept up their unjust assaults but, by smearing honest and worthy delegates, also attempted to sidetrack the attention of the well-intentioned association leaders and members from the important issues to other channels. These individuals and groups not only do not help in the great work of the National Protective Federation which was formed at the Convention to save the associations and their members but do everything possible to frustrate the fulfillment of the Federation's beautiful and worthwhile program.</p>
   <p>Association leaders and members! Do not listen to the sowers of discord! Do not fall for the slanderers! You know them; you ought to know them from their harmful activity to disunite the Hungarians!</p>
   <p>Association members! The Protective Federation is yours--it is with you and for you and it aims to bring about results that will be useful for the members of the Hungarian-American associations. You are the guarantee that the Protective Federation belongs to every Hungarian-American, regardless of his political or religious creed.</p>
   <p>Leaders of national and local associations! Association members! Let us get together to protect our mutual interests and to rescue our old members! This is a great and important task. Join the Protective Federation. We are inviting all associations to the common work.</p>
   
   <p>Let us end the discord!</p>
