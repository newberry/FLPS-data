   <p>Louis Nagy, chairman, opened the meeting and called upon Ignac Izsak to explain the object of the meeting.....</p>
   <p>Ignac Izsak told the audience that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocently condemned to die and that they were only exercising their constitutional rights when they tried to organize shoe factory workers into a union. And, although the defense proved that the witnesses were perjured and Judge Thayer biased, Sacco and Vanzetti have been incarcerated for seven years, and the judiciary, which serves the interests of the capitalists, is trying its utmost to have these two innocent men electrocuted, legally murdered. Izsak invited the mass meeting to join other labor groups and launch immediate action.</p>
   <p>Other speakers were Lazar Berta, delegate of the Workers' Sick Benefit <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and Culture Society of West Pullman; Louis Barta, representative of the Hungarian branch of the I. W. W.....</p>
   <p>Paul Pika, representing branches 13, 58, and 128 of the Workers' Sick Benefit Union, also spoke of the unjust verdict and said that we should not only protest, but should demand the release of Sacco and Vanzetti. At the same time, he asked the audience to contribute toward the defense fund. The result of the collection was $53.61.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Louis Nagy read the message to be sent to Governor Fuller....which was unanimously approved by the meeting.</p>
