   <p>Those who live on the North West Side and travel on streetcars unconsciously notice the conspicuously placed placards advertising the Polish Day that will take place on July 21, the proceeds of which will be turned over to charity.</p>
   <p>The Germans had a German Day at Grant Park a few weeks ago. The Czechoslovaks had a Czechoslovak Day displaying grand athletic exercises. The Swedes are also heralding a Swedish Day in the near future.</p>
   <p>All these national groups show thus how strongly they are united. Thousands of their peoples attend these national days. They consider it their duty to take part in these national demonstrations in their adopted country.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The financial success of these affairs enables the national groups to aid their mother countries.</p>
   <p>Viewing all this, one thinks sadly about the Hungarian situation here. Who of us gives a thought to Magyar Day? Our societies and churches are wrapped up in their own insignificant problems. They believe that if they concern themselves with a general Hungarian problem, it will be detrimental to their activities.</p>
   <p>While other national groups call attention to themselves by these national days, we Hungarians sit back with folded hands, idly, waiting for public opinion to be aroused to sympathy.</p>
   <p>It is much more important for the Hungarians to hold a Magyar Day which would be attended by all Hungarians regardless of religion or political views.</p>
   <p>The Poles hold their Polish Day for cultural and charitable purposes. Is <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>there a better cultural aim than to give assistance to the victims of the numerus clausus?</p>
   <p>The Hungarian youths who want to study have to go to other countries because their own country denies them this opportunity. These students, especially those in the field of the sciences, bring glory to the Hungarian race.</p>
   <p>How much good could be accomplished on such a Magyar Day, when thousands of Hungarians would get together. We could discuss our mother country's plight and how we could be of help. We could use our influence to put a stop to the yellow brand that is being stamped on the children of another religion (Jews).</p>
   <p>The best proof of the indifference of the local Hungarians is that last year, when the barbarous Rumanians butchered our Hungarian brethren in Nagyvarad, they did nothing, although this newspaper called their attention <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to these atrocities. Then it would have been the opportune time to show official circles here the brutality of the people to whom parts of our country of birth were thrown.</p>
   <p>Magyars! At long last, do something for the common cause of all Hungarians.</p>
