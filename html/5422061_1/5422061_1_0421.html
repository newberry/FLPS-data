   <p>As the Fascist terror in Germany is growing more terrible from day to day and the workers in all parts of the world are protesting against it, the workers of Chicago have decided to do their duty and will protest on April 9.</p>
   <p>Since the Chicago Hungarian Workers Club had announced a bunco party for April 9, the members of the Club decided in their meeting held on April 3, that, inasmuch as the protest of the workers against the raging Fascist terror is much more important than a mere bunco party, they will hold the latter on April 8.</p>
