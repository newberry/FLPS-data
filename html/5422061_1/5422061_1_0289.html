   <p>Now that the new immigration quotas have been enacted, we must start watching the future of the Hungarian-Americans because this law is a serious problem in our lives.</p>
   <p>We older Americans realize what this new blood had meant from year to year, which has been flowing into this country in the form of the new immigrant. We knew and we gazed at this young ambition and enthusiasm which they so sincerely poured into the work which they were doing.</p>
   <p>Even those who had left a sorrowful past behind them came to this country, and upon reaching its shores seemed as though they were reborn. They pitched in and worked for the betterment of the Hungarian population of this country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Just as we said we knew all this very well, because we ourselves had to go through the same thing, we older, more tired, more experienced, weather-beaten Americans were inspired by the younger blood. It was from this undivided enthusiasm that the different Hungarian activities were brought forth in this city and throughout the country.</p>
   <p>Now this new life-giving stream is going to stop, because from now on there will be very few new Hungarians coming to this city and to other cities throughout the country. We are left alone just as we were during the World War.</p>
   <p>During the World War Hungarian life was not dead, as a matter of fact it was quite active even though immigration was at a standstill. We can't credit all this activity to the Hungarian people, because it was an outside source that created this activity; it was the unavoidable influence of the World War.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The first activity that took place was in aiding the war orphans of Hungary. Later, when the United States became involved in the war, it was our duty as citizens of this country to aid it in order that the war might end as soon as possible, and to assure this country of victory.</p>
   <p>These activities were prompted by outside influences, although we were all willing to do these things, knowing that it was our duty.</p>
   <p>But now we are facing a new problem.</p>
   <p>Now there is no war, nor is there any outside influence to force new activities on us.</p>
   <p>Things are just the opposite today. A heavy fog has engulfed the souls of the Hungarian-Americans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The political life of Hungary has caused a great turmoil among the Hungarians of America; we all look at this in a very indifferent manner, and watch this terrible insect of destruction chew us apart.</p>
   <p>We must start planning now. These heavy and sorrowful facts must be rectified and ways and means must be found in order that the social life of the Hungarian people may be straightened out. Because it is the social life of the people that the political life and other activities depend on; in other words, it is their future.</p>
   <p>The societies that now exist are devoted to sick benefit and death benefit organizations. We must admit that in the past twenty-five years these societies and the different churches have been the springs of many activities that were promoted among the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Usually church life is directed from other sources besides the local church; <span class="page-break">\5</span>often they are helped out financially so that their existence may be assured, so naturally each Saint's hand is closest to his own pocket, and so each church thinks of its own members first, and this membership is the majority. But then there are those who are outside of the church, it seems as though the remaining few will be so neglected that in time they will even lose the Hungarian language.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we must look for ways and means, outside the societies and churches, by which the future strength of the Hungarian people may be assured, even under adverse conditions. In view of this we are submitting the following program which we think will help bring back this needed strength:</p>
   <p>1) Continual aid to the Hungarian-American press.</p>
   <p>2) Continual aid to the Hungarian theatre.</p>
   <p>3) Keep the Hungarian folk song, dance, and other musical activities intact.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>4) Support sport activities among the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>5) Promote the teaching of Hungarian literature, and become better acquainted with the authors of Hungarian literature.</p>
   <p>6) Promote co-operative political activities.</p>
   <p>7) Become familiar with conditions in the homeland and wherever possible lend a helping hand.</p>
   <p>8) Constantly keep the financial problems of our people in mind.</p>
   <p>9) Draw the new generation, the Hungarian-American children, into Hungarian life in a satisfactory manner.</p>
   <p>There are many other things that might be added to this program, and we <span class="page-break">\7</span>would be very pleased if those people who think seriously of this great problem would submit some of their own suggestions to the editor of this newspaper.</p>
   <p>We would be very interested and we feel sure that the rest of our fellow Hungarians would be just as interested in new ideas and suggestions.</p>
