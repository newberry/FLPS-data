   <p>It is not necessary to dig into history to discover that Hungary, before the war, was a natural country, just as Bohemia, the Czechs part of Czecho-Slovakia, is also a natural country. Its natural boundaries were perfect. On the north, the west and the southeast, it was rimmed with high mountains. On the south, its boundaries are formed by large rivers. It is one of the most perfectly closed basins that can be found on any of the five continents. The Czechs argue that their country is a natural country, and has always belonged to them, therefore, the millions of Germans within their boundaries must bow to the will of the Czechs. For this same reason, Hungary wants to keep her natural country intact. Strangely enough, there are many people, who recognize the justice of the argument of the Czechs, but cannot see where a similar argument on the part of the Magyars is worth its weight in sour apples. As a result, the boundaries of Hungary to-day are nothing but red lines on maps. They are natural boundaries, and Hungary is bound and determined to regain most of the land that has been taken from her.</p>
   <p>In the north, Hungary has lost Slovakia and Russiani, these two countries being at the extreme tip of Hungary. In the east, she has lost the huge rough triangle of Transylvania to the Rumanians. In the west, she has lost the small strip of Germany west of Hungary to Austria, and in the south, she has lost Croatia and Slovenia to the Jugo-Slavs. All that remains is the Magyar kernel, which was the center of the old Hungary.</p>
   <p>There is practically no outcry from the Magyars over the loss of Croatia and Slovania, the districts behind Fiume and the Dalmatian coast, which now make up the upper end of Jugo-Slavia. The Croats have been a distinct, warlike, and progressive people for centuries. Until the day of the Armistice, they fought hard and valiantly against Italy and the Allies on the side of Austria-Hungary. So the esteem of the Magyars for the Croats is high as brother warriors, whereas they loathe the Czechs. Of all their enemies, the Italians held the Croat regiments of the Austro-Hungarian Army in the highest respect. The Magyars have great sympathy and love for them. For years, Croatia has been a state under the care of Hungary. Hungary is sorry to lose Croatia, but so far as we can find out, there is no bitterness over the slicing of Croatia.</p>
   <p>But over the losses to the Slovaks, Rumanians, and Austrians, the Magyars are making such an uproar that the ear drums of any stranger in Hungary are constantly being dulled. They say that the wrenching away of these parts of Hungary is comparable only to the partition in Poland, and the theft of Alsace and Lorraine by Germany.</p>
   <p>One hears the phrase, "For over a thousand years," so many times in the course of a day here in Hungary that he finds himself walking along whispering over and over again in tune with his footsteps: "For over a thousand years." He unconsciously sets it to all the tunes of the Hungarian orchestra music. The rattle of horses' hoofs seem to click out the words, "For over a thousand years."</p>
   <p>All Magyar arguments are based on these very words. Because of those thousand years, the Magyars grit their teeth, and say, No! No! Never! when asked to submit to the partition of their country.</p>
   <p>The Magyars are the direct descendants of an Asiatic tribe of people who hailed from the rich lands around the sea of Asov, and their chief means of support was obtained by swooping on a neighboring tribe, the reby providing themselves with supplies and moving on. It is highly probable that if Attila, the well-known Hun, had not damaged his reputation by his loose methods of waging war, the Magyars would claim a distant relationship with Attila and his warriors. Attila, at the present time, is rather neglected in most histories of the Magyars. The greatest of all Magyar leaders is said to be Arpad.</p>
   
   <p>However, none of these early Magyar leaders were honored with triumph for their clever work.</p>
   <p>Many men were lost in the thousand years of conquest of Hungary, and now after a thousand years the real Hungary is to be crippled, and the most vital sections taken from her.</p>
