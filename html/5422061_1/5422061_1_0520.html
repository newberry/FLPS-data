   <p>"United we stand, divided we fall," is a true expression, and Hungarians of Chicago's South Side gave heed to it when the Citizens' Club was organized.</p>
   <p>Even though the Citizens' Club has many members, the directors wish to ask every one to join.</p>
   <p>It is time that the Hungarian-American citizens are given their rightful place in local politics. In the past this has been impossible because of petty jealousies.</p>
   <p>The Club is nonpartisan, but its aim is to have the Hungarians vote as a bloc for the man who is best fitted for office.</p>
   <p>We believe that Hungarians of the South Side will realize that it is in their interest to become members of this Club. The monthly dues are only ten cents.</p>

   <p>The meetings are held on the first and third Wednesdays of every month at the Magyar Home.</p>
