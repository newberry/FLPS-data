   <p>It is just a few days since the Hungarian Republican Club was formed. At the organizing meeting it gave one great pleasure to see that there were so many Hungarian-American citizens who were interested in the political life of this country.</p>
   <p>As yet we have not found out who was on the organizing committee, but the latter asks all the Hungarian Republican voters to join this organization. Its purpose is to get more Hungarian people interested in American politics.</p>
   <p>It will also try to co-ordinate social life with political activities, and impress upon the voters the importance of taking an active part in the conduct of our country's affairs.</p>
