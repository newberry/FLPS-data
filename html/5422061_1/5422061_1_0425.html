   <p>p. 1 - From time to time more or less sarcastically humorous articles have appeared in American newspapers about Hungary's king-problem. We believe that these articles have their original background in that band of sympathy with the Entente, which is still smouldering in the so-called Anglo-Saxon hearts.</p>
   <p>America still considers itself part of this imaginary group of people so that in Hungarian matters it usually sides with the views of the big and little Entente.</p>
   <p>We do not want to discuss at length the desirability of being subjects of a "tyrannical" king or the advantages of man's rights in a land infested with thousands of petty magistrates, police chiefs, etc.</p>

   <p>We wish to point to the address of the logic of the Chicago Tribune, which a few weeks ago lauded Alphonse, ex-king of Spain's wise statesmanship; the elaborate preparations to welcome the King of Siam; its hysterical reception of the Roumanian Queen Marie. Now the Chicago Tribune in an editorial of April 28, expresses disdain about Count Bethlen's speech on his tenth anniversary as prime minister of Hungary, in which he says that he believes in a monarchial form of government.</p>
   <p>The title of the editorial was "A Kingless Kingdom."</p>
