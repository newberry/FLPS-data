   <p>The Hungarians of Chicago have had an opportunity to lend their support to dramatic art since Jeno Endrey founded the Permanent Hungarian Theater. I believe that the Hungarian businessmen of Chicago have contributed their share in an effort to maintain this theater on a permanent basis.</p>
   <p>However, we find it unpleasant when, on every occasion, Mr. Ignac Izsak delivers a lecture about [i.e. criticizing]the businessmen. He has no reason to do this. Chicago's Hungarian businessmen have always done their duty in public affairs. It is not their fault that plans for a Magyar Home have failed. The Magyar Home of Burnside was not built by businessmen, but by the thousands of members of the Virgin Mary Society. If there were such a group on the North Side, we too would probably have a Magyar Home, but here each organization segregates itself and there is no <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>co-operation.</p>
   <p>There are no Hungarian businessmen on the North Side who make a living from Hungarians only. If they have Hungarian customers, they give one hundred cents value for every dollar spent. Those who deal only with Hungarians can afford to contribute much more toward such a cause, because for them it is an investment that will draw interest eventually.</p>
   <p>I believe that if all the Hungarian businessmen were to turn over to the fund all the profits made from transactions with Hungarian customers, they still would not have enough money to build a Magyar Home. When the societies on the North Side did want to raise money for a Magyar Home, then was the time for Mr. Izsak to make speeches and boost this proposed undertaking. But at that time, Mr. Izsak was not enthusiastic. Now that the building and financing of one Magyar Home has been successful, Mr. Izsak wants another one and is prompting the Hungarians [to act]and accusing the businessmen.</p>

   <p>We are all willing to listen to Mr. Izsak's speeches about Hungarian politics, because anyone may have political views, but many of the Hungarian businessmen object to being made the butt of his recriminations. In the event that the societies on the North Side will agree on their desire to build a Magyar Home, Mr. Izsak may rest assured that we Hungarian businessmen will not shirk our duty. In the meanwhile, we ask Mr. Izsak not to try to cause dissension between the businessmen and the people, but to use his efforts to unite all classes, so that we may all work together for the same end.</p>
