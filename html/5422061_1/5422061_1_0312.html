   <p>The excellent Hungarian newspaper, the Egyetertes (Concord) of New York, published a very interesting article on American bank failures. The article was prompted by the fact that last week several New York banks closed their doors, in particular the bank established by John Nemeth which was later called the American Union Bank. Many Hungarian families had their life savings in this Hungarian bank.</p>
   <p>We Chicagoans are no longer afflicted with this contagious disease of bank failures. At least, we believe this is the case. Because last spring this plague ruthlessly took its toll in our midst and we could not offer calm advice while nerves were taut and feelings at fever pitch, we waited until the present time when people have become more or less accustomed to the situation. We give our opinion now because we are not satisfied with the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>view taken by the editor of the Egyetertes.</p>
   <p>For example, the first conclusion of the Egyetertes is the following:</p>
   <p>"When a bank fails, the loser is not the banker but the thousands of depositors. The bank itself is only a depository, the handler of the money. The real losers, therefore, are the depositors."</p>
   <p>The foregoing comment is either a faulty conception or a malicious misrepresentation. We believe that the Egyetertes based its conclusion on erroneous information. In our opinion the biggest loser is the bank, which loses its prestige when its doors are closed by state authorities. The bank is then completely ruined. It loses the faith of its depositors, and its capital is in imminent danger. Moreover, the directors and stockholders of the bank face a critical and dark future. The stockholders may lose their invested capital and also be held responsible for the stock in their possession at the time the bank becomes insolvent. The directors, on the other hand, lose <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>their invested capital; and, according to state and federal laws, they are faced with double liability for the stock in their possession...Therefore, their wealth is gone and their source of income is cut off. They add to the number of unemployed. This happens if there is no criminal liability involved and if everything was aboveboard and within the law when the bank failed. If the directors of the bank are found guilty of embezzlement or mishandling of funds, thereby violating the banking laws, dire punishment--the darkness of the penitentiary--awaits them. This happened to officials of the New York Bank of the United States and this fate awaits some of the officials of Chicago's closed banks. In other words, the owners and directors lose at least as much as the depositors. Let no one be under the impression that only the depositors are the losers. In such an economic upheaval as that which is sweeping the world, it is a wonder that any small bank can remain open. We see century-old European banking institutions wavering like the leaves of the poplar tree in a storm.</p>
   <p>In America the only big bank catastrophe was the failure of the Bank of the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>United States. The other 560 bank failures were only comparatively disastrous. According to the prevailing American view, the really large banks withstood the tempest, and the failure of the smaller banks was due to the economic depression which ruined farmers and property owners. The depositors deserve our deepest sympathy in the economic catastrophe; and without a doubt, more stringent state and federal laws are needed to put a stop to this contagion of bank failures.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the depositors had a fair share in the failure of the smaller banks. There isn't a bank in the world which is strong enough to withstand a run in which from ninety to a hundred per cent of its depositors demand all their money.....Even the German National Bank could not withstand such a run, although its capital was much larger than that of any of the American banks which failed. Naturally the depositor has a right to withdraw his hard-earned savings from the bank. However, when thousands demand their money at once, it is unfair to the bank. With this act the depositors announce that their faith in the bank is gone. The bank having capitalized on <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the faith of its depositors, placed the money into interest-bearing securities and kept on hand only fifteen to twenty per cent of the cash deposits. Therefore, the bank can return only fifteen or twenty per cent of the total deposits on immediate demand. The other depositors must either wait or report the insolvency of the bank, which means the failure of the bank and even greater danger to the deposits. When a bank fails in prosperous times, we immediately suspect the directors, but in such panicky times as the present, mass hysteria and economic paralysis are the basic reasons.....In summary, this is our opinion of bank failures.....</p>
   <p>The other question is: What to do?</p>
   <p>"This is a very serious question [writes the Egyetertes] and we are taking a great deal of responsibility upon ourselves when we endeavor to answer it. As can be seen from the foregoing statements, no matter how much capital a bank has or how strong its foundation may be, an unscrupulous director who irresponsibly flirts with the penitentiary can ruin it.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"Withdraw the money from the bank? If it is safe at home from burglars and thieves, then that is the proper place for it--especially until the economic crisis blows over--because the thought of waking someday to the knowledge that our life savings are gone must be a terrible feeling. In a moment our hard-earned money is no more--a consequence of the unscrupulousness of some banker. We cannot even hope to begin saving anew, because time has flown away and we are old.</p>
   <p>"Everyone, therefore, must carefully consider what he should do with his money."</p>
   <p>Illinois laws are very strict. There isn't one newspaper here which would dare to advise its readers to withdraw their money from the bank. This is considered a crime punishable with imprisonment.....Even if it were permissible, it would not be fair. Just imagine what would happen if all American and foreign-language newspapers advised their readers to withdraw their deposits from the bank for the duration of the economic depression. Immediately the number of unemployed would be tripled and commerce would be <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>paralyzed.....This advice is bad. It would induce a revolution.....We believe that no large amount of cash should be kept at home.</p>
   <p>There are many reliable banks where we can safely keep our money....There are several ways of investing our money. Depositing it in a savings account is only one of the many ways. If there is anyone who does not know how to invest his money he should ask some one who is familiar with the question and who is also honest and reliable. In case of illness we consult a physician; in time of trouble--a lawyer; when building--an architect; and when investing, we ask the advice of a reliable banking institution. In every phase of our life there is risk. This is true in investments, too, but still the risk is minimized when we deal with a good banking institution.....If anyone wishes to make the economic crisis even more serious, he will advise the reader to take his money from the bank and keep it at home. We believe the Egyetertes, which is a conservative newspaper, never intended to be an instrument of radical ideals and will correct the false impression which <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>its articles created.</p>
   <p>For the present we wished to amplify this question for our readers so that they may be reassured of the fact that there are many good, firm banking institutions and solid investments left in America which stand as rocks in this world economic crisis.</p>
