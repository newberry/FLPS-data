   <p>The waves of election are piling on us, and out of the many candidates, we feel that we should remind our readers of a few who deserve our votes.</p>
   <p>This election is of very great importance due to the fact that the leaders of the nation will be elected.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>We feel that we do not want to be involved in influencing Hungarian voters with reference to the national election. But we feel that there are a few candidates who are running on the State ticket who deserve recommendation.</p>
   <p>First, we must examine the position and its responsibilities, then the men who are seeking these positions, finding out if they are capable of handling the responsibilities connected therewith.</p>
   <p>In Chicago and Cook county the battle for election has been furious. This election involves unusually important positions; therefore, it is <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>necessary that the voters consider very carefully each candidate. The highest position in the county and city is the States Attorney.</p>
   <p>Present conditions as they exist in Chicago are shameful. There is hardly a week that goes by without a bank, train, or payroll wagon robbery. These conditions were probably brought about by the World War because during that period all pickpockets and petty larceny thieves came to Chicago, figuring it an easy city in which to work.</p>
   <p>There have been more hangings in Chicago than in any civilized section in the world, and still there are quite a few people loose who belong in a hangman's noose. Today the voters of Chicago are facing a very grave <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>problem: the office designated to punish criminals and to prevent crime is to be filled.</p>
   <p>Two very worthy gentlemen are seeking the States attorney's job: Judge Crowe, the republican candidate, and Michael Igoe, the democratic candidate.</p>
   <p>It is not our policy to belittle or involve anyone in scandal. We will not commit ourselves with reference to Judge Crowe, but we will say that Michael Igoe is the better-fitted man for the position. We do not select him in the interest of the party to which he belongs, because we are <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>absolutely independent in passing our verdict.</p>
   <p>Igoe has been assistant State's attorney for eight years and has fulfilled the requirements of that office most nobly. We think that if Igod is elected, we can be assured that he will always have the people's interest at heart.</p>
   <p>During the past eight years, Mr. Igoe has been the Democratic majority leader of Illinois and his record shows that he has always stood by the interest of the working class. Mr. Igoe has built an enviable record for himself.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>We also want to tell our readers that Mr. Igoe knows that there are a great number of Hungarian votes in Chicago. If Igoe is elected, the Hungarian people can rest assured that they will receive adequate protection. He has also promised to put a Hungarian-speaking man in his office, to whom all Hungarians may go in order to solve their problems.</p>
   <p>Two very good Hungarian men guarantee us that Mr. Igoe will not forget the Hungarian people of Chicago.</p>
   <p>They are Dr. Ernest Towinger and Joseph Fekete, the lawyer.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>It is our duty, therefore, to win every Hungarian vote for Mr. Igoe. Regardless of political affiliation, you should make an exception and vote for Michael Igoe.</p>
   <p>Those who vote for Michael Igoe will be voting for a deserving man. He is the friend of the people and especially a friend of the Hungarian.</p>
   <p>The most prominent people of Chicago are fighting the battle for the election of Mr. Igoe. We gladly join hands in this battle and warmly recommend the election of Igoe. We sincerely hope that Michael Igoe will be our next States attorney.</p>
