The aim of this committee is to find a suitable place to settle for those Hungarians who are tired of working in factories and would rather farm their land as they did in Hungary. The report of the committee is as follows:</p>
   <p>"We came to the conclusion that the 250,000 acres of land offered by the Florida Industrial Corporation to the Hungarians for colonization purposes is the most acceptable proposition. The land is fertile and free of pebbles. Anyone wishing more information may inquire of Wendell Hajdn, Charles Boros, David A. Kovach, C. K. Katona, and Louis Meszaros, committee members."</p>
