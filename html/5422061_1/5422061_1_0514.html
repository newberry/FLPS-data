   <p>The South Side Hungarian Citizens Club will hold its last meeting of the year on December 13, at 8 P.M., at Liberty Hall. As has been the custom of the club throughout its period of existence, new officers for the ensuing year will be elected on this occasion.</p>
   <p>All Hungarian-American citizens are requested to take a greater interest in using their political rights and also in all the activities of the Club. We urge all to attend this meeting in a body, particularly because this is the only club officially recognized in the 8th ward and considered by politicians as the only representative organization of the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>We have proved that the above statement is true when political assistance or influence required to promote Hungarian interests.</p>
   <p>Everyone should be present at this year's final meeting and take part in the work.</p>
   <p>Till we meet at the Liberty Hall, December 13, we are the Hungarian-American Citizens Association.</p>
   <p>Michael Hornok, president.</p>
