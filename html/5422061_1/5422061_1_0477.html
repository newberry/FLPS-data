   <p>Last October, Federal Judge Landis sentenced many I.W.W. leaders to serve prison terms at Fort Leavenworth. Among these leaders, several have won pardons, and are being released.</p>
   <p>One of the few who will be set free is Charles Rothfisher, formerly the editor of the Hungarian I.W.W. newspaper called A Bermunkas. He was sentenced to serve twenty years in the Federal penitentiary.</p>
   <p>A bond of ten thousand dollars was set in order that he may be freed. The friends of Mr. Rothfisher succeeded in raising this sum, thereby insuring his freedom.</p>
