   <p>Of late we have been noticing a certain state of unrest in our Hungarian circles--produced no doubt by the Chicago representative of Szabadsag (Liberty), with the intention of disturbing the peaceful co-operation now existing among our people for his own personal interests.</p>
   <p>It seems that of late Mr. [Emery] Frank has told so many fibs: to express it as harmlessly as possible--that now he himself believes them. Right here, however, let it be said that he is the only one believing them and that he has lost his prestige in the eyes of the Hungarians, especially those in the South Side.</p>
   <p>Well, there is an old Hungarian proverb that the pitcher goes so long to the spring that at last it breaks.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The Hungarian Federation of Associations and Churches in the South Side held a meeting last week at which Mr. Frank, directly in opposition to the ethics of journalism, behaved like the dictator of the Chicago Hungarians, or at least he tried to show himself up in that role when he tried to force his will on the meeting.</p>
   <p>It seems, though, that he found a hard not to crack, for many in the gathering spoke not so very flatteringly about this domineering news representative. No man of good taste likes to hear a newspaper man attack another.</p>
   <p>Acknowledgment is due the Hungarian Federation of Associations and Churches in the South Side, whose management is composed of the presidents and other officials of the associations belonging to the Federation, for its correct Hungarian attitude of not paying any attention to lies and malicious calumnies and by remaining on the straight path of justice.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Yes, there are many things the Hungarians of Chicago could learn from these brave brothers of ours in the South Side; in the first place, they could learn how to guard our present good mutual understanding and how to vanquish all ill-willed attempts to foment hate among us.</p>
   <p>Our brothers in the South Side have proved again that they stand on their feet and think with their heads, and that they do not allow themselves to be led astray by malevolent people.</p>
   <p>We dip the flag of acknowledgment before them.</p>
   <p>The National Protective Federation of Hungarian-American Associations is still under heavy bombardment, as some persons--to whom the Federation is a bone in the throat--are trying again to paint it red, no doubt because they see in it a danger that will eventually overtake them.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Their efforts are in vain. They are unable to deny facts, and their shameless distortion of the truth is coming to light again, and truth, like the sun, shines once more through the dark clouds of lies. It is a fact that truth can be held back awhile but never stopped in its victorious march.</p>
   <p>Steve Serator, a delegate from Trenton, is again in the limelight. He is accused--as we reported in one of our previous issues--of having made a derogatory remark about an association in Trenton at the Chicago convention. We predicted then that this accusation would burst like a soap bubble.</p>
   <p>And that is exactly what happened when it was found that the person who made the accusation in a letter published by the [Hungarian] newspaper in Trenton had not even been present at the convention and naturally could not have known what happened there. This Hungarian now notifies those concerned to this effect, and so, on this occasion also, a delegate is cleared of a <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>charge of which he was unjustly accused.</p>
   <p>In the meantime the Federation's work is unrelentingly going on, and the National Board of Directors receives day by day reports from all over the country favorable to the movement, thus proving that the work being done has found an echo in the hearts of the Hungarian-Americans, which is only natural, as anyone can convince himself by a thorough and unbiased study of the movement, whose sole aim is to protect the interests of the Hungarians of America.</p>
   <p>Now that the Chicago District Board has been formed, work has begun to assume imposing proportions since the members of its committees are men who would rather disregard their own personal interests than those of the Hungarian-Americans as a whole.</p>
   <p>And this is what gives living force to this movement.</p>
