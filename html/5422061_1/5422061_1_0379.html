   <p>p.2. Peter Meszaros committed suicide by inhaling gas.</p>
   <p>Meszaros came to the United States many years ago, leaving his wife in Hungary. Recently he wrote to her to sell their property and send him some money, because he could not find work. Just before committing suicide, he received a letter from his wife, in which she wrote that she could not sell the property. His despondency over his unemployment and the failure of realizing any money from the sale of his property drove him to suicide.</p>
