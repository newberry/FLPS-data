   <p>When it became known that Countess Karolyi was refused a passport for entrance into the United States, the Chicago Hungarian University Club demonstrated its protest against this action in front of President Coolidge, and asked Senator Deneen of Chicago for help. At that time we wrote in detail about all this.</p>
   <p>Now individuals are protesting that the University Club has taken it upon itself to represent the entire Hungarian population of Chicago. This protest seems to be an echo from the past.</p>
   <p>At one time we felt rather peeved about this also, because it did not seem fair to us. Today we look at these activities in a different light.</p>
   <p>Since that time, through our co-operation and our help, the Chicago <span class="page-break">\2</span>Hungarian Societies' Central Committee has been organized. Through this organization we thought that all those misunderstandings of the past would be erased. We also thought that through this organization, we would be able to see the great masses of Hungarians take part in all Hungarian activities, and in this way the weight of responsibility would be more evenly distributed, and honors would be evenly divided, and naturally the results of our activities would be much greater.</p>
   <p>For a while the wagon of the Central Committee bounced along a rocky road. Their activities were enthusiastic, they took part in elections, and all these things seemed to be giving this new Hungarian organization renewed life.</p>
   <p>All these activities in which they participated filled us with joy, because with each new activity we saw the Hungarian people move forward, and they were starting to realize their ambitions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But in the end we were mistaken.</p>
   <p>Now we realize that all these things were merely flickering flames.</p>
   <p>It seems as though an anesthetic has been given to this organization for which we had so much hope. It is fast asleep. It doesn't even snore. It is probably having its last dream. All indications are that it has seen an early death.</p>
   <p>These thoughts occurred to us at this time because we think the Central Committee should have taken some part in the Countess Karolyi movement, not because they necessarily favor her ideas. In the present case this would mean little or nothing.</p>
   <p>Activities in this case are necessary because the action of Secretary of State Kellogg has seriously injured American thought, ideals and traditions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>We think that serious thought should have been given to the action of Secretary of State Kellogg because Countess Karolyi should have been considered as just another Hungarian lady trying to gain entrance into the United States.</p>
   <p>Today this lady is called Countess Karolyi; tomorrow she will be called by a different name.</p>
   <p>All the Washington bureaucracy wants is a precedent to act on, and then they will deal severely with all immigrants, using the original interpretation as a means of refusing them admittance.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Hungarian Societies' Central Committee to raise its' voice in protest when a law is being interpreted unjustly and to the disadvantage of a brother Hungarian.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Probably their protest would not help the present situation a bit. It is natural that it would be only a small step towards an accomplished deed.</p>
   <p>But with this [action], and this is the most important [thing], the reputation of the Chicago Hungarians would be saved and the activities of the Central Committee would be kept alive. We sincerely hope for this from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
   <p>But life will be kept only through activity.</p>
   <p>Regardless of how simple or small these activities are, something must be done. A program must be made up, and this program must consist of such activities as are of common interest to our people, and our activities must be for the welfare of our people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>These facts must be realized and the realization must be put before the Central Committee. This realization must come quickly and activities must be started immediately.</p>
   <p>If this does not happen, death will come quickly.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Societies must realize that their activities have been insufficient, or else they can dig their own grave and die silently</p>
   <p>As long as we are faced with such a sad situation as this, no one should protest against the action of the University Club. Any activity sponsored by the University Club is sponsored for the welfare of an individual, or for the welfare of every Hungarian, be it here or abroad.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian people have a right to divide into factions. They <span class="page-break">\7</span>are allowed to discuss these questions amongst themselves, but their activities must not be allowed to stagnate.</p>
   <p>If co-operation is impossible, then something will have to be done to show the rest of the world that there are still Hungarians living in Chicago.</p>
