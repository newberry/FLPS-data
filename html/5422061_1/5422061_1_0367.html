   <p>The economic crisis at the present time is doubly critical for the immigrants of America. The Foreign Language Information Service, in the thirteen years of its existence, has answered untold thousands of questions pertaining to the problems of the immigrants, but up to the present time no question was more difficult to answer than that of the unemployment situation. We are confronted with this serious problem: what shall the immigrant do who speaks no English and has a family to support, and who is afraid to apply to the State Employment Agency because he may be deported?</p>
   <p>Even in normal times the immigrant who speaks no English has a difficult time looking for employment, but now when native citizens, too, are without jobs and are walking the streets, and when most factories require that one have at least his first papers, it is almost hopeless.....</p>
   <p>There is truth in the old saying that one works hardest when one is un <span class="page-break">2</span>employed. Those people who have saved a little money try to find work before all the savings are gone. But the lot of one who has no money whatsoever is pitiful because he has to worry about where he can get bread for his family. We don't mean bread in a metaphorical sense, or bread for tomorrow, but literally for dinner.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately we cannot give concrete information as to when and where the immigrant can get employment; all we can do is to give advice, so that it will be a little easier for the immigrant seeking employment.....</p>
   <p>What is the most important thing for one who seeks employment to observe? First of all he must try to come in contact with as many people as possible ....He must look up his society and his union. Furthermore, he should register at several commercial employment agencies and at the recently opened free employment agencies.</p>
   <p>Many skilled workers feel that they must work only at their trade. In these <span class="page-break">3</span>troubled times this is the wrong attitude....</p>
   <p>When we apply for a job let us not emphasize the fact that we need it badly; rather let us show our ability to fill it properly. The American employer is interested primarily in the applicant's qualifications.</p>
   <p>Let us be careful when we answer the classified ads. It must be admitted that many thousands have found jobs through the classified ads, but it is also true that there are some unscrupulous people who take advantage of the unfortunate situation of the job-seeker and rob him of his few remaining dollars. This is usually practised on foreigners....</p>
   <p>Today larger factories have their own employment office and old employees should apply at these places first....If the immigrant cannot speak English he should have someone speak for him.....</p>
