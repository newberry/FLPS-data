   <p>One of the most important functioning organs in man's body is the heart. Its functions are similar to the activities of a pump; it forces blood up to the brain and then through the different channels provides for the flow of blood into the body. This continuous and endless circulation of blood is indicative of life, and if the heart stops, the flow of blood stops and consequently there is no life.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact therefore that there is a connection between the brain and the heart. Since the creation of man, his activities and his behavior have been guided by both his heart and his brain. The great writers attribute the activities of man to the heart, while the scientists and students claim that it is the brain which regulates the behavior of man.</p>
   <p>According to the Hungarian viewpoint, it is alarmingly true that both these organs play an important part in the behavior and temperament of the human being. The Hungarian person has a very good heart, which reacts rather quickly when the time comes for the performance of good deeds, if the brain is in an absolutely sober condition. While we are a wine-drinking nation, in many instances our hearts are not governed by our brain, but are dictated to by the glasses which we have tilted.</p>
   <p>Under the influence of wine, we become rather sympathetic and we would like to hold the world in our laps. We are liable to make unheard of promises with wine-tainted lips. Then when we sober up we realize what shameful things we have said and done. When we remember our actions while under the influence of wine we would like to find some form of punishment for ourselves, and we also avoid meeting those persons with whom we came in contact while under the influence of wine.</p>
   
   <p>If we wanted to be honest, we would say that our richer class of people is seen under the influence of wine more often than is our poorer class.</p>
   <p>The so-called upper class make many promises while they are drunk, and then when they sober up they consider it to be a big joke to have been trifling with the truth. While the promises made by the working class of people whether they are drunk or sober are carried out in order to maintain self-respect.</p>
   <p>After making a careful study of the working class of people we have come to the conclusion that they fulfill their duties better than do the upper class. We know of a man who was injured a few years ago at the Illinois Steel Company plant. The Virgin Mary Society has been helping this man for years and although they didn't have to, they paid all the expenses for an examination by a nerve specialist, and after the doctor submitted his report in regards to the case, a large sum of money was given the patient in the form of a donation.</p>
   <p>We know of instances where men and women have made promises and in order to fulfill those promises, they are depriving themselves of many vital things in their life.</p>
   
   <p>We hear of many cases where the individual is not fortunate enough to secure a better or higher salaried job, and he feels despondent because he can't aid those whom he left behind in Europe, after he had promised to help them.</p>
   <p>The above incidents show the co-operation between the heart and the brain, regardless of whether or not these promises were made under the influence of wine.</p>
   <p>The human race, in the past seven years, has adopted the attitude of a Cain towards life, which means an attitude of little thought or solicitude for one's fellow man.</p>
   <p>People who have thoughts like these do not have the proper outlook on life. The human race is dependent upon each other. There are many people who for some reason or other can't earn their daily bread. But this is not a valid reason for us to let these people perish. We must naturally condemn those who wilfully steer clear of a chance to earn their own living and are continually dependent on others.</p>
   
   <p>Annimal life shows us what happens to those who continually neglect their duties that go with the right to live. It is not necessary to explain to Hungarians that to be successful and humanitarian one must strive for the better things in life, and the goblet of wine is an item which will not co-operate with the reactions of the heart and soul.</p>
