   <p>Sunday, Dec. 24, Eugene Petrovits and his wife held the first Christmas party for Hungarian gypsy children. There were about forty black-eyed, raven-haired gypsy children. Not one was a blonde. There were toys for all.</p>
   <p>It may seem a little strange that Petrovits, a leading Hungarian, should do this for the gypsy children, but he says that we must give a little credit and pleasure to these nameless pioneers of culture. Our Hungarian gypsies are glad when we are glad, sad when we are sad, and play our music for our pleasure in a manner no one can imitate.</p>
