   <p>The thoroughbred American is very proud of his liberty and the democracy that insures the greatness of this country.</p>
   <p>How free are we? How democratic are we?</p>
   <p>A few examples can illustrate the untruth of these elegantly phrased slogans said to be the American spirit.</p>
   <p>Prohibition is one proof of how little we respect the sanctity of personal liberty.</p>
   <p>The free spirit of labor and commerce, which made this country great, will be regimented now and the rest will follow rapidly.</p>

   <p>The Secretary of Labor has discovered that many children under ten years of age are wage earners. He wants to license newsboys and prohibit bootblacks from working.</p>
   <p>We are not saying that this attitude of the Honorable Secretary of Labor is right or wrong, but we do think that if the parents of these children-workers were employed continuously and paid a living wage, child labor would automatically cease.</p>
   <p>A shining example of democracy was given at Bailey's Beach in New York.</p>
   <p>The upper "400" wouldn't allow actors and actresses to bathe at their beach--in the ocean. In their eyes these people are not in their class, therefore, they are not fit to bathe in their company--in the ocean.</p>
   <p>Beautiful examples! Pride of liberty and democracy! <span class="page-break">\3</span>The most insignificant chorus girl is a worthier member of society, through her work, than any of the idle rich, who--because they have millions--think that they are better than those who produce the millions for them by the sweat of their brows.</p>
   <p>This is a picture of democracy in this beautiful adopted country of ours.</p>
