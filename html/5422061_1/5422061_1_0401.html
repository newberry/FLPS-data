   <p>Recently, the working conditions in the United States have turned from bad to worse. The cost of living has not been reduced, instead, it has become higher, and the number of unemployed has become greater with the return of the Soldiers from overseas. For this reason unemployment in this country has really become a serious question. The United States, previous to the War, was very happy and blossoming as a great consuming country. It produced cheaply, and it consumed lavishly.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The War brought about a great export business in the United States, and now that peace is about to come, this export business is falling. Consequently, unemployment is increasing.</p>
   <p>The true purpose of the World War has not been realized as yet, nor have we felt its effects. What has happened in Europe in the past five years we know very little about. The effects of the War are greater than the War itself. The shattered morale, the horrors of hunger, the cessation of industrial life, the transportation systems being ruined, the transportation centers demolished, and the financial status of the countries, are the factors that have put Europe in a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>more precarious spot than the War itself.</p>
   <p>We cannot compare this War with any other of the past. For that reason, we should not compare the effects of the present and past Wars. The hardships of today are altogether different from what they were after the Napoleonic Wars. Since the Napoleonic Wars, the industries of both the United States and Europe have been going through a stage of development. Social life is also a great deal different today than it was a hundred years ago.</p>
   <p>During the Napoleonic Wars, the population of Europe was only one hundred seventy-five million, while today, the population is over four hundred million. For example, we take England. This country has the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>most dense population of any European country. Here, the population averages about seven hundred people to the square mile. Agricultural activities in England are negligible. Only the small gardens of individual home owners are cultivated. In order that these people survive, they must keep up their industries in full operation at all times. During the past twenty-five years, England has been the master of international trade, which was due to the fact that her labor was very cheaply done.</p>
   <p>But in more recent times, the cost of living has gone up, while the wages remained the same. Consequently, the average man did not earn enough to buy the ordinary necessities of life.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>It happens today that the government of England must build a million new homes, and the money for these homes is to be taken out of the treasury of England.</p>
   <p>If the earning power of the people of Europe is cut down to little or nothing, then England's industries can not purchase food and raw materials. For this reason, the future of England hinges on the future of Europe. And if this uncertainty continues much longer, the people will emigrate from England or else, go into agriculture for a livelihood, which would impair the future of England.</p>
   <p>France, also, has a great deal of trouble. The cost of the government operation alone there is twenty-two million francs a year. But their <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>greatest trouble lies in their industrial world. The largest part of their factories were ruined by the War, or else, they remained idle. Unemployment and the cessation of agricultural activities will cause an economic revolution sooner or later.</p>
   <p>Today, the future of the United States is tied much closer to Europe than it was previous to the War. The entire world owes the United States, therefore, the United States is interested in the future of the European nations. Before the nations of Europe can return to normal, the United States will have reached a point where the factories will be running at full capacity, and the United States will furnish the countries of Europe with both money and raw materials, and unemployment will have faded.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>But as long as there is no peace in Europe, factories are at a standstill and workers there do not start production.</p>
   <p>The situation in this country will remain as it is at present. The situation will change but it will take quite a while for things to settle back to normal.</p>
