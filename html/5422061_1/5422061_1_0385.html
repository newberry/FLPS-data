   <p>Floyd R. Mays, Superintendent of the Burnside plant of the Illinois Central, announced that the company is unable to re-employ the workers who were recently laid off. The freight cars will not be repaired in the Burnside shops, because the company has a better-equipped plant at Centralia. As more and more electric engines are taking the place of the steam engines, the company will soon close the Burnside plant altogether.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mays explained that the company regrets having to lay off so many men, but assured them that the company will try to employ some of them elsewhere. Those workers who have been unable to find other employment or are physically handicapped may fill out a request for a pension.</p>
   <p>In view of the importance of this statement we immediately contacted Mr. Fisher, who said that the layoffs are due to bad business conditions, but that he hopes to re-employ the workers as soon as conditions improve.</p>
