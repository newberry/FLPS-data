   <p>It won't be long before we have elections in the city of Chicago, and all the parties and those who won in the primaries are getting prepared for the campaign. These politicians use many devices in trying to convince people that they are the better candidates. One device is the medium of advertising. While traveling around through the city we were attracted by a sign, which had the following phrase printed on it. "Protect against the high cost of living, and elect Laflin for alderman." We don't hold anything against Mr. Laflin, nor do we want to stand in his way against becoming alderman. We believe that he can accept the salary of an alderman and spend that salary just as well as any one else can, without hurting us any. If this man were really a man who would come out with facts,and he told us that what he wanted was the money, maybe we might give him a hand, and help;and why shouldn't we?</p>

   <p>Mr. Laflin,as a Socialist, believes in the teachings of Carl Marx.</p>
   <p>Mr. Laflin can do no more against the high cost of living than he can do about a cure for tuberculosis,or a cure for infantile paralysis. He is very humble in making this promise,because he could promise a lot more, but by making this promise he is telling us that he is going to cure all our troubles. Therefore,if you are easily led,and believe in the same principles as Mr. Laflin, vote for him. After all, we do not believe that Mr. Laflin can lower the cost of living, but he can't make it any higher either,even if he wanted to, due to that fact that he does not have anything to say about distribution of products.</p>
