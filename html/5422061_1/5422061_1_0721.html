   <p>We do hereby urge those Hungarians who are not citizens of the United States, to adhere strictly to laws of the United States.</p>
   <p>Every Hungarian citizen should guard against critizing Congress and the President of the United States in regard to their action on the war situation. Free speech is not the privilege of those who are only guests of this country.</p>
   <p>The only ones that have a right to criticize the acts of the President and Congress are the people of the United States who are citizens of the United States.</p>
   <p>To those of us who are only guests of the United States, the war between the allies and Germany is of no concern. We should keep to our usual business and avoid dissention among our fellow-workers with reference to the war question.</p>
