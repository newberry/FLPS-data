   <p>When we consider the remarkable history of mankind, we observe that on various occasions certain fanatics have tried to impose their narrow-minded views on the helpless masses.</p>
   <p>During the Middle Ages there was an institution known as the Inquisition. This institution persecuted heretics in a most horrible manner, in the sincere belief that by putting these heretics on the rack or by breaking their backs on the cross their souls would be saved.</p>
   <p>Fortunately the progress of civilization has swept away these horrible shadows of the past, but even today we encounter them, although in a somewhat modified form.</p>

   <p>The unexpected World War brought in its wake an era of Prohibition in America. The wine-loving Hungarian people as well as the rest of the population were too busy making good American dollars to pay much attention to what was going on around them. The small but well-organized group of Prohibition fanatics realized, and took advantage of the wide-spread indifference of the masses, their I-can't-be-bothered attitude, and before people knew what was happening they had been shackled with Prohibition. The majority of the States voted for Prohibition, and consequently the Eighteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the war, people realized that they had lost their birthright, and that they had received nothing to compensate them for their loss. Of course, the Prohibition fanatics were responsible for this failure to provide a substitute [for this lost birthright]. As soon as people realized that they had gotten the worst of the deal, the honorable profession of bootlegging came into being. This profession wrought greater havoc in America than the World War ever had. The underworld <span class="page-break">3</span>took on new life and beer-barons sprang up like mushrooms. These gangsters and beer-barons were usually Sicilians, and were naturally quite handy with the gun and the stiletto. Whenever one of their number was killed in gang-warfare, his funeral commanded more respect from the general public than that of a king of a nation.</p>
   <p>The police are unable to do anything about the situation, and they are now resolved to put their trust in the old maxim which says that the only good gangster is a dead gangster. And so they are quietly sitting back, waiting for the day when the gangsters will have exterminated one another.</p>
   <p>It is surprising that certain Protestant churches, which are supposed to be so liberal, are more militant in the crusade than the churches of other denominations. The reason we say "certain churches" is that it seems that our Hungarian churches, regardless of denomination, have not assumed any position in regard to this question.</p>
   <p>The Prohibition fanatics do not shrink from drawing the Holy Father <span class="page-break">4</span>[the Pope] into this controversy. They want him to issue a manifesto to the Italian, Irish, and Polish Catholics, urging them to give up their prosperous occupation of bootlegging because it is against the law. We hope that the honored head of the Church keeps out of this controversy. We believe that with the aid of good will and tolerance this issue can be solved in a manner which will satisfy everyone.</p>
   <p>In nature, everything has a purpose; as our ancestor, Noah, said, the seed of the grape also has a purpose. The Bible relates the story of Noah, who had partaken too freely of the juice of the grape. He presented such a sight to his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, that they had quite a laugh at the sorry plight of their father. Thereupon, an angel of the Lord gave them a piece of his mind. This proves that the scribe who wrote the story of Noah as it appears in the Good Book regarded wine as an excellent thirst-quencher. There are various places in the Bible where the Master openly approves of the use of wine. If wine met with His approval, it must not be wrong for us Hungarians to continue to use it for our own personal pleasure.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>We admit that the saloons were largely responsible for Prohibition in America. The saloon-keepers showed us how they got rich at the expense of their own fellowmen. We must admit that wives and children suffered in many cases. We also know that these same saloon-keepers, who made others suffer, would never lend a helping hand to a worthy humanitarian or social cause. We are not sorry to see the saloons go, but we do not understand why a man who sits down to eat a hearty meal should be deprived of enjoying a glass of wine or beer with it.</p>
   <p>The pages of history reveal that geniuses were all users of good wine, and that they did their best work while more or less under the influence of the sparkling juice of the grape. These people left behind great master-pieces, the very ones which are admired by our most ardent Prohibitionists.</p>
   <p>We admit that some people are rather weak and cannot control their cravings [for liquor]. But why should the majority suffer because a few people cannot control themselves? We Hungarians must suffer, although we enjoy the reputation of being temperate. We are moderate drinkers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>We favor and advocate regulation; we oppose the enactment of Prohibition as contrary to human nature and wise judgment. Legalize light wines and beer! If the fanatics continue in their obstinate insistence on absolute prohibition of liquor, then the next generation of Americans will be composed of imbeciles and degenerates. This will be the consequence of the effects of the poisonous drinks which produce blindness, insanity, and all kinds of social diseases.</p>
   <p>Let us recover our common sense! If all national groups will cooperate with the Hungarians, who have already expressed their willingness to participate in a movement to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment, we can soon put an end to a law which breeds lawbreakers and hypocrites.</p>
