   <p>More than two hundred Hungarians, among whom were leaders of various political organizations, gathered at Democratic Headquarters in the Walnut Room of the Morrison Hotel, Sunday afternoon.</p>
   <p>Dr. Erno Lowinger, noted physician, leader of the Chicago-Hungarian democrats, and who also fills an important position in the City Health Department, acted as chairman.</p>
   <p>In a short talk, Dr. Lowinger stated that this meeting was called together by the Kelly-for-Mayor Hungarian organization, a non-partisan club, with a view of inducing all Hungarians to vote for the administration in office at the present time. He voiced the fact that the Hungarians are <span class="page-break">2</span>welcomed by the Democratic party and that it is not only the duty of the Hungarians, as citizens, to vote for Kelly, but it is to their political advantage.</p>
   <p>Dr. Joseph Kovach moved that all Hungarians pledge their support to Kelly on his past record as Mayor. Louis Szappanos seconded this motion and the meeting unanimously accepted it.</p>
   <p>The outstanding feature of the afternoon was the speech of Quin O'Brien, City Attorney, who represented Mayor Kelly at the meeting. He assured the gathering of Kelly's gratitude for the support given by the Hungarians and promised to do his best toward them in the future as in the past. Mr. O'Brien also solicited the support for the Mayor in his difficult, but effective work.</p>
