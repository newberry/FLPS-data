   <p>In the Tenth ward of Chicago, where there are a large number of Hungarian-American citizens, a new Hungarian political club, called "Illinois Democracy," has been formed. The purpose of the new club is to get rid of those candidates who have been forced on the people by Dever and Brennan, the well-known political bosses. This new club will endeavor to elect candidates who are best fitted for office.</p>
   <p>There is a demand that at least one Hungarian should be elected judge of the Municipal Court, inasmuch as it seems that every other nationality is represented on the bench. The Hungarians are apparently the forgotten people of Chicago. They have received no recognition whatsoever.</p>
   <p>It is high time that the Hungarians come to life. By uniting their efforts they can accomplish a great deal, if they really want to.</p>
