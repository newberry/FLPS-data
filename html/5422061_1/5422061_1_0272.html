   <p>Something that the entire Hungarian population of Chicago can't do has been realized by the comparatively small Dr. Herzl Society.</p>
   <p>This society has a membership of one hundred and fifty people and they have bought a piece of property on which they are putting up a building which will cost approximately $100,000.</p>
   <p>In order to pay for this building, the dues were raised--this decision being made by the members.</p>
   <p>This is an example of what a really active organization can accomplish. The plan wasn't brought about by thoughts alone, but was brought about by activities.</p>
   <p>We feel sure that the Virgin Mary Society and its members will follow the <span class="page-break">\2</span>the example set by the Dr. Herzl Society, because we think that if an organization consisting of 150 members is not afraid to tackle a project of this kind, then an organization with a membership close to a thousand can step right in without any fear whatsoever.</p>
