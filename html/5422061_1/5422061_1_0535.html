   <p>The delegates of all branches reported a great increase in membership and activity. They decided that beginning in December they will start evening lectures on citizenship, constitution, and politics at all the branch meeting places. Some of the branches will hold evening gatherings with the purpose that the members may get acquainted with the ward politicians. The North Side Branch is having a tea party in honor of Titus Haffa, alderman of the 43rd Ward, on November 17. The South Chicago Branch will invite ward politicians to their meeting place at 8506 Burley Avenue on November 19.....</p>
