   <p>The Cook County Hungarian Republican Club held a special meeting last Friday evening at which several important questions were discussed. Ignac Izsak discussed the purposes of the organization. He made it understood that the Republican Club did not want to be an enemy to any other Hungarian organization, be it political or otherwise. He also stated that the Club was organized for the good of the Hungarian people. He said that the Club was open to every serious thinking Hungarian person who might be interested in being of some service to the Hungarian people in the future. He made an important issue of the fact that the members should be selected cautiously because, he said, his experience in the past had taught him that there were many Hungarians who were jealous and who had different hatreds in their hearts, and that eventually these people broke up or disrupted the work of the organizations to which they belonged.</p>

   <p>The Club endorsed the Harding-Crowe, Barrett-Thompson Republican faction. They also decided to invite a few of the candidates to one of their meetings where they would honor them with a good Hungarian supper. This Club is legally chartered and recorded according to the laws of the State of Illinois.</p>
