   <p>On June 23, 24, and 25 a very important grand meeting was held in Chicago. Delegates from all over the country gathered here to find a solution to important problems and to seek ways and means to heal the painful wounds inflicted on the Hungarian-American associations by the economic crisis which started four years ago.</p>
   <p>During its three days' debate the Convention worked out such a splendid program that were we to follow it with joined forces, we could remedy our grave situation in spite of all calumnies and hindrances, and could retain among us the old and jobless members, who otherwise would have to be dropped.</p>
   <p>As one of the delegates present at this worthy grand meeting, I find it essential that, regardless of what association we belong to or if we do not <span class="page-break">2</span>belong to any institution, and regardless of our religion, we, the Hungarian-American women, establish connection with this movement to fulfill the magnificent program laid down by the Convention.</p>
   <p>Sister compatriots and workers! Let us see what is our situation today. In these critical times of unemployment, which has lasted already four years, our husbands, fathers, and sons have been unable to work. Haven't we been, as the workmen's wives and mothers, the ones most bitterly touched and stricken? We are the ones who have to think about the future, of what will happen to us in case of sickness or death! Through years we have been saving our pennies to pay the dues of different sick benefit associations, giving even our last cent so that we could get something in return in case of sickness or death in the family. Now we find we may lose even this, and there are many who have already lost this consolation.</p>
   <p>Hungarian sisters! Just think what would become of us and our poor little orphans if we lose our last ditch of defense and are left without a penny?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>There are cases in which many of our sisters have not enough money left to bury their dead, because they have lost that for which they paid through many years and on which they built their hopes as on something positively certain. It is a very, very sad situation indeed.</p>
   <p>Sister countrywomen! Hungarian working women! The time has arrived. Let us all get out and help save what there is yet to save! Let us join and participate in this great work for the common interest of the Hungarian-Americans, which will succeed provided we start immediately and stay united!</p>
   <p>The aim of the National Protective Federation of the Hungarian-American Associations is to retain the aged and unemployed members on the rolls and to reinstate those who have already been dropped; besides this, it seeks government aid for the associations, and there is a possibility that this aid will be obtained.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Forward sister working women! To action for our common interests!</p>
   <p>A. S. Working Woman.</p>
