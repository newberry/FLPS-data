   <p>We wrote in our columns about the program of the Revisionist meeting arranged by the Federation of the Churches and Associations of Chicago South Side last Thursday evening, but to be very frank, we do not believe much in its merits. We know that the fiasco of the Revisionist meeting in New York still lingers in the memory of the Hungarians. We saw the frequent changing of plans for the arrangements of the meeting. Also, we did not think that the short time allowed would suffice for debating the subjects of Revisionist meeting. But we would be mistaken, if we said that this meeting was unimportant.</p>
   <p>Apparently, it was a success. Thirty-five Associations had sent about one hundred representatives besides some two hundred Hungarians, interested in the aims of the meeting and to participate in the debate about revision.</p>
   <p>The meeting scheduled for 7 P.M. was opened at 8:15 P.M. by John Bartus, president of the Federation of Churches and Associations of Chicago South Side. At the request of Etelka Revesz, the Hungarian anthem was sung. Mr. Bartus asked the audience to appoint a committee whose duty should be to formulate a program. He proposed that one delegate from each district in Chicago and vicinity should be elected to serve on this committee.</p>
   <p>The committee was made up as follows: The Hungarians of Chicago North Side were represented by Paul Soos, president of the Culture Club; the Hungarians of Chicago West Side were represented by William Mayer; those of Burnside by Charles Tarjanyi; of South Chicago by Emery Fegyverneki; East Chicago by John Tenkely; Indiana Harbor by George Soltesz; Hammond by John Bander. The committee nominated as chairman, George Mihok, president of the district of Verhovay branches; and as recorders; Emery Fegyverneki and Frank Foldi.</p>
   <p>At this time Mihok took the chair. William Mayer arose to report that he had with him a copy of a letter written by Frank Gondor, the original of which was sent to the committee from New York, but if the bad weather conditions had prevented the mailman from delivering the letters, he brought a copy along in case the original had not arrived in time. He asked to have it read before the assembly. John Bartus answered that the letter had arrived and would be read together with other correspondence. This started a controversy of an hour and a half duration. The I W O members demanded that the letters be read; the Hungarians opposed them.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, Ernest Kasas, Frank Szabo, Cornel Bors, Louis Nemeth, Mrs. John Paszternak and others spoke. Some spoke of the Revision, some of the letter of Gombos, some again of the scandal in New York. The majority, evidently, were against the reading of the letter, so the recorder read the first of the proposals for a resolution, which contained about five or six points. The audience decided it would debate the points separately.</p>
   <p>The letter of Gombos still proved a source of interest and most certainly there were many, who although opposing its being read, yet were curious about its contents. Everybody awaited some sensation from it. As the demands for its reading were renewed, although the audience had not yet voted, on even one of the points under discussion, the chairman ordered the reading of the letter. It is hard to imagine what the communists expected from it, but those who were waiting for some exictement from it, were bitterly disappointed.</p>
   <p>Frank Gondor, on behalf of the committee in New York greeted the audience of Chicagoans and asked them not to make the same mistake as did the people in New York, but try to arrive at a mutual understanding. He urged them to work for the benefit of the noble cause for which the meeting had been arranged.</p>
   <p>Whether or not to have this letter read stirred up a debate for one and one half hours. The mischievous Mayer again fooled the Hungarians. But after the letter had been read you could not hold them there any longer. It was now after ten P.M. Of the many very serious and very useful propositions, only one point of the first proposition was accepted by the meeting. We reprint it here. It is a nice bouquet for the Szabadsag [Hungarian Daily]:</p>
   <p>"The Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity declared at their meeting, held on February 20, in the Hungarian House in Chicago, that they fully approve and regard as absolutely useful the movement of the Hungarian Daily, Szabadsag under the title "One million signatures plan" which we support and highly recommend to every good Hungarian. We ask the Szabadsag to continue with renewed zeal to sponsor the seemingly lagging movement and we also ask the Nepszava and all the local Hungarian weeklies to support the movement to the best of their ability.</p>
   <p>There was no time for anything else. These men, who work hard all day, usually want to be home not later than eleven P.M. The members of the I W O would stay till dawn, but with them alone, the chairman was not willing to pass resolutions in regard of revision. At 10:30 P.M., he declared the meeting adjourned.</p>
   
   <p>Speaking of the I W O members, we gladly note it for the sake of truth, that at this meeting they behaved themselves much better then we expected. There were suggestions about "inner-revision," but they did not go so far as to even mention the names of their Rakosi or that of Bela Kun who, incidentally, on that same day celebrated his fiftieth birthday. It was Joseph Hernes, the member of Branch 1035 of the I W O, who answered the speech made by Ernest Kasas, who spoke on the subject of the expected results of the plebiscite for those coming from the territories lost by Hungary in the peace treaties. Hernes said:</p>
   <p>"The government should create such living conditions for the working people living in Hungary that in case a plebiscite should be ordered in the detached parts of old Hungary, the people living there should vote of their own volition, in their own interest, so that they should be anxious to get back to their own old mother country."</p>
   <p>That is just what the Gombos government at home is striving for.</p>
