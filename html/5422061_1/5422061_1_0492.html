   <p>p.2...The Hungarians are exerting every effort to have Louis N. Blumenthal, Republican nominee for Judge of Municipal Court, elected.</p>
   <p>Louis N. Blumenthal was attorney for the Austria-Hungarian Consulate years ago. At the beginning of the world war when the Swedish Consul took over the leadership of our Consulate, they sent Blumenthal to Frankfurt, I11., to investigate the circumstances of the deaths of several Hungarian miners who according to reports, were killed by deputy sheriffs during the strike. He made his report to the Department of Labor in Washington.</p>
   <p>For five years he was Assistant Prosecutor. At present he is the member of the law firm of Ungaro, Blumenthal and Romano with offices at 134 North La Salle Street.</p>
   <p>As assistant prosecuting attorney, he was of invaluable service to the Hungarians and deserves our whole hearted support.</p>
