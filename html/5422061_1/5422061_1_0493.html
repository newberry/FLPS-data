   <p>p.1.... Chicago's foreign born citizens, regardless of nationality, or religion, are working for the election of William Hale Thompson for mayor.</p>
   <p>The Organizing Committee held its second meeting Tuesday,and new committee members were chosen. We can safely say that all nationalities are represented on the committee. There are many, who were for Dever, but for the good of the majority, rallied around Thompson.</p>
   <p>These foreign born voters will have a banquet in Thompson's honor March 27, at the Sherman Hotel.</p>
