   <p>There are few American problems which concern the Hungarian people as much as does the question of prohibition. We Hungarians have been broadminded in regard to the question of alcohol and its use from the time we were born, even though we saw the bad effects of alcoholism. But at the same time the Hungarian-Americans cannot understand why light wines should be prohibited. It seems rather unfair that the Volstead Act was enacted without some of us having had something to say about it. The enforcement of the Volstead Act is becoming more stringent each day.</p>
   <p>The government has gone so far as to poison alcohol so that anyone who drinks it, condemns himself to death for breaking a law.</p>
   <p>The few who are observing the Volstead Act are doing so only because they believe it will be repealed soon. The people who have followed this <span class="page-break">2</span>prohibition question very closely realize that repeal is hardly possible at the present time.</p>
   <p>The absolate enforcement of prohibition is practically impossible.</p>
   <p>The owners of hotels and large cafes in Chicago are against this law, but they do not dare break it.</p>
   <p>American business is a against it and every sober-minded person has protested against prohibition, but it is the law and they do not dare break it.</p>
   <p>This prohibition condition being so unsettled, we feel that we have a duty to perform. We advocate that the laws of the country should be obeyed. We have always been for what is right. We believe that the Volstead Act is unjustifiable, and [that] it deprives individuals of personal liberties. But we also believe that the excessive use of alcohol is detrimental to the user, as well as to society as a whole. This is not only true about <span class="page-break">3</span>the alcohol which is manufactured scientifically, but we must consider the harm brought about by alcohol manufactured in homes and [under]other unsanitary conditions; the alcohol manufactured this way probably means death after it has been used for a certain length of time.</p>
   <p>We want to call the attention of leaders of societies and churches to one fact. We are well aware of the fact that when these organizations run affairs, alcoholic drinks are liable to be served, and if these organizations are caught doing so, they are liable to arrest. We have been informed that the prohibition agents are going to pay more attention to these affairs , sponsored by societies and churches, to see that the prohibition law is strictly enforced. These affairs can be run successfully without breaking any laws. One evening of Hungarian entertainment where alcoholic beverages are sold, can rain the good Hungarian make to an extent where this rain can't be repaired by ten other lawful evenings of entertainment.</p>
   <p>We want to say again that we are not picking on any individual organization 
<span class="page-break">4</span>or person because we are not reformers. All we are doing is warning our Hungarian organizations to avoid situations which may become embarrassing.</p>
   <p>Up to date we have not encountered any trouble with the law-enforcing bodies and we hope we will not have any trouble in the future.</p>
   <p>Those who do not like the Volstead Act should fight against it. We ourselves advocate the modification of it. The United States is a democratic country, and the people here have a right to voice their opinions.</p>
   <p>We Hungarian-American citizens have the right to voice our opinions openly. We have the same right that any other American citizen has, but we must be brave and sincere.</p>
