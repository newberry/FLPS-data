   <p>Prohibition--it certainly means a lot of trouble for the unlucky dry agents.</p>
   <p>It is all caused by the unfortunate circumstances under which the prohibition law was passed, and the longer this law exists the longer it will be ridiculed.</p>
   <p>It is true that the United States is dry according to the law, but it is easy to see that people drink more today than they drank before prohibition.</p>
   <p>The difference is that people drank good wholesome drinks before prohibition, while today they drink any intoxicating mixture, and they drink it in larger quantity than they drank before.</p>
   <p>It seems as though any forbidden fruit is the sweetest.</p>

   <p>This prohibition law of ours is certainly a laughable matter; it is ridiculed by everyone in the country and some day we certainly hope to see it repealed for the benefit of our country and its people.</p>
