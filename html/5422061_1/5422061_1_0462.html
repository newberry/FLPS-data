   <p>The presidential election in America is over, and as a result the old system has been wiped away, at least for the present. We believe that the old system will not soon be revived, because here in America a system begins to develop that will give some rights to the workingman; and though it cannot be developed at once, the time will come when its prudent, sensible idea will be entirely realized.</p>
   <p>The old system has been responsible for so many evils here, and has contributed so largely to the absurd upheaval in Europe today that we can only guess at the losses and the suffering it has involved. We will know precisely what it cost the world only when the new system of social organization, which we prophesied long ago, comes into power. It looks as though that time may come sooner than we could ever dare to hope.</p>
   <p>There is already a plan for a Russo-German-Japanese alliance. The parties to <span class="page-break">2</span>it claim before the world that the plan is only a dream, but we firmly believe that the alliance has been formed, and that it will be announced when an opportune moment arrives.</p>
   <p>Naturally, shrewd John Bull likes the idea and would like to belong to this alliance too; although in the beginning he would be only an equal, later, according to his tested tactics, he would assume the role of a dictator and would watch, with a satisfied grin on his face, while the others prepared the good meal for him. But this time we know that John Bull will not succeed by using his customary method, because we are convinced that the Germans are more cautious and will not be deceived.</p>
   <p>Here in America we should come to our senses and realize that John Bull has let us Americans pull his chestnuts out of the fire, thinking, as we speedily accomplished the task: "Der Mohr hat seine Schuldigkeit getan, der Mohr kann <span class="page-break">3</span>gehen". (The Moor has finished his task, the Moor can go) [Quotation from Schiller's "Fiesco", Act III].</p>
   <p>It is true that John Bull was not able to consume all the chestnuts raked out, because the American people were not willing to support the policy of the English. The powerful American people were brave enough to tell the leaders of the old system: "Stop!" Let us be on guard and let us tell them not to trouble their heads over our problems; we will face these wild lions ourselves; we will finish the job which John Bull was strong enough to begin, but was too shamefully weak to finish.</p>
   <p>Losers in politics never entirely give up hope of a triumphant return to the political stage. Their customary habit is to withdraw into their caves for a time; they sleep and dream, trying to figure out what would have happened had they been successful. Then, after a while, they put their heads out of <span class="page-break">4</span>the cave again, sniffing to learn whether or not the time has arrived for them to come out and begin their plays again.</p>
   <p>We Magyars are interested, in the first place, in Hungarian cave-dreamers, although as Americans we shall discuss other cave-dreamers too, whose operations can be injurious to us. It is to the interest of the Magyar-Americans--and the future of Hungary depends on it--to be certain whether or not these Magyar cave-dreamers have crept out finally and have succeeded in resuming the scornful roles which their defeat had forced them to give up.</p>
   <p>We do not have to go into details as to how the great Lords managed everything--the public property, the national interest, and, most of all, the most precious property of the country, the working people--before the war....after them came bolshevism, and after that "misery-ism". No one knows through how many other kinds of "ism" unfortunate Hungary will go yet, while again and again the masters of the old system treat the working people as guinea pigs. The old system <span class="page-break">5</span>gave such privileges to those "Great Seigniors" that, even if they had trash in their heads, they could sponge on the state and on the workingpeople.</p>
   <p>To avoid becoming again victims of the old sickness, we have to insist that the Hungarian "cave-sleepers" should not be wakened, lest they bring back the old system, if not on us, at least on the Magyars living in Hungary. Let us abolish everything of the past. Let the workingpeople assume the rights which are justly theirs, and let them give the great lords what they deserve for their detrimental work.</p>
   <p>We Magyar-Americans have to be very careful whose words we believe, if we intend to take part in the rebuilding of the old country; and we know that if we do not set ourselves to work them all of Hungary is lost forever. We know our duty very well and we do not need sweet, endearing words from the old country to exhort us, any more than we need the courtship of the great lords in this respect.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>We want to be the same to those great lords as we were before, and we want them to leave us alone, because we pay no attention to their speeches. Before the war, when these great lords were full of hopes of victory, they did not flatter us as they do now. Then, a working man or Magyar-American could not come near to a great lord; now, the times have changed, and the newspapers are full of the nice-sounding words of Count Apponyi, who calls us his "kin". We read also a letter of Count Zichy, who surpasses everybody; the old Count has veritably adopted every Magyar-American, calling us all "my dear sons".</p>
   <p>Yes, these great lords, every one of them, would like to win us over, but it is not so easy; today we are thinking over cautiously what and whom we should follow. In the old days, when we were not so particular, they took off our last rags, and let us go to blazes.</p>
   <p>As we see it now, a big campaign has begun to determine who should become <span class="page-break">7</span>American Ambassador; it is a nice fat job. Naturally the great lords are anxious to make us believe that they were always good to us. We, however, following after the old proverb, "One cannot cut bacon from a dog," think it a prudent thing to wait until the time comes; let them see first what they can accomplish without us. Meanwhile let us put the uninvited visitor in his proper place.</p>
   <p>We entreat our fellow countrymen to be cautious about everything which originates with the great lords, because we cannot expect anything good from them either for ourselves or for the workingmen living in the old country.</p>
   <p>There is among us Mr. Von Lorthy, whom we have tried so many times to obtain as our leader. He understands workingpeople, and he can sympathize with them, because he knows what it means to fight for anything by one's own hard work, without help from outside, while others are obtaining the same things <span class="page-break">8</span>through influence. He also knows the ailments of the great lords. We need the leadership of such a man, when the matter of our whole future is in question. </p>
