   <p>On November 4, Calvin Coolidge was elected President of the United States by a big majority, and at the same time, the majority of Republican candidates were also elected to office.</p>
   <p>Since we love America deeply, we hope that this election will mean peace, happiness, prosperity, and generally speaking, good times, for the people and the country. But still with all this we have more to say about the results of the election.</p>
   <p>Outside of the victor, we have two "dead" individuals with whom we must deal. We cannot bury these people with simple ceremonies and an ordinary farewell, because this incident is of great importance.</p>
   <p>We must have the bisecting (sic) knife of a doctor to carefully analyze the importance of this election, and the powers of the people in wielding it.</p>
   <p>Calvin Coolidge became a presidential candidate without much effort on his part. He was well behaved in the political circles, so the Republicans selected him unanimously as their presidential candidate.</p>
   <p>Coolidge is not a bad fellow. He is a Puritan, he is sincere, respectable, plain, and a North American type of a man.</p>
   <p>He has kept his truly great possibilities a secret. Probably in the next four years we will see the greatness of this man. Maybe time will reveal a great man? It looks as though he will be good to the American people, even after he defeated two very prominent men: John W. Davis and Robert M. LaFollette.</p>
   
   <p>Now we can say without partiality and without campaigning that John W. Davis was the man best fitted and qualified for the presidency of the United States. It seems as though Davis had prepared his entire life in such a way that would fit him to be the President of this great Union some day. He advanced step by step with high respect, and with truly great intelligence he represented all. He was a representative of the people, and through his various achievements he reached the highest goal. He has broad experiences in diplomatic circles, and is well versed with Democratic activities. But all this did not impress the people.</p>
   <p>The other candidate was LaFollette. His entire life was devoted to the public, and he was a fighter for the welfare of his people. He fought the big heads and individuals who were against the working people. In his own State, Wisconsin, as a law maker and Governor, he fought bitterly against graft in politics and for improved conditions for the people of his State.</p>
   
   <p>While serving in the Senate, the trusts and big capitalists were afraid of him. He is seventy years old. Probably this was the draw back. His talent, his experience, and his interest in the welfare of his people are far above the ability of Coolidge, and still the people did not cast their ballots for him.</p>
   <p>To compare the three platforms is useless. The Republicans are conservative. The Democrats are liberals, and the followers of LaFollette are the more radical type. But the people were impressed by the conservative type. Davis and LaFollette openly declared themselves against the Klan.</p>
   <p>Coolidge showed a rather independent attitude towards the Klan. There are those who believe that Coolidge is a strong believer of the principles of the Ku Klux Klan. And yet there were millions of colored people, millions of Catholics, and even millions of immigrants who voted for him. Disregarding the Klan, these people were impressed by the Republican party and Coolidge. These people must be happy now that their hopes have come true. The reactionary leaders of the Ku Klux Klan are riding high and fast throughout the nation. The people voted for a full kettle of meat.</p>
   <p>Prosperity and a threat of economic disturbances forced the people to vote the way they did. The present unemployment and unsettled economic conditions scared the short-sighted, spineless ones. Setting all intelligence aside, and all the other soul-stirring matters, these people believed the sweet words and flattery of the campaigners. They believed that the banks would close for the next four years, that the furnaces in the steel mills would shut down, they believed that coal and iron ore mines would cease operating, in other words, they believed that the entire industrial world would come to a standstill if Coolidge were not elected.</p>
   
   <p>The workers of industrial organizations applauded LaFollette. Davis was met with high acclaim, but when voters stepped into the voting booths, eighteen million voted for Coolidge. LaFollette was branded as a "Red" through and through by the Republicans, and this proved to be the fact that made his campaign such a failure. They could not find much fault with Davis, so they claimed that if he were elected there would be a panic, because Wall Street only favors the Republican party. Where is the logic? Where will this end?</p>
   <p>It was the people, these cultured people, who took all this in and believed it. The millions of people who were entrusted with the work of the Republican party did their work very well. The strength of propaganda can not be figured under conditions existing today. The one who becomes victorious is the one who has the greatest amount of money to spend on propaganda and this will either enlighten or fool the people, depending upon how intelligently it is used.</p>
   
   <p>We must admit that the Republicans knew how to use the method of propaganda and at the same time they had enough money to publicize and spread their ideas. Clear thinking, satisfaction, advancement, and the future, seem to be secondary. The important items seem to be the meat kettle, money, and tobacco. They have forgotten about those who deprived the people of their rights and other faithless representatives,among whom, Fall, Daugherty, Denby, and their activities are not thought of. </p>
   <p>Every damaging veto made by Coolidge was forgiven on November 4, and their motto became: "Re-elect Coolidge, because he will be the one to bring good times."</p>
   <p>To the girls, silks; the boys, Fords; the fathers, radios; and the mothers, the movies. This is what the people want.</p>
   <p>Many years ago, in the days of the Roman Empire, when it was at its height, the easygoing and thoughless people asked their emperor for bread and a circus. They received both. But this powerful Roman Empire met its downfall.</p>
   <p>If the American people are looking for ordinary good times, movies, etc., at the time of election, then this great nation, which was formed under the leadership of Washington and Jefferson, will meet the same fate of Rome.</p>
   <p>This presidential election meant a backward step, and not one that will advance us, as it would have happened if Davis or La Follette had been elected.</p>
   <p>We hope we are false prophets, and that the election of Coolidge and Dawes will be the beginning of a more liberal form of people's rights. We hope this from the bottom of our hearts, but we will not lose sight of them.</p>
   <p>Since Coolidge is our President, even though we did not vote for him, we sincerely beg of him to talk to Morgan, Gary, Mellon, and others belonging to the Republican group, so that they can start the train of prosperity and good times, because we, the working people, could use some of it now. We are tired of old Republican promises, high cost of living, and unemployment. These conditions exist throughout the nation, and we are getting tired of it all.</p>
