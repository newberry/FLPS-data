   <p>In the political turmoil of today, the question arises as to which political party one has a right to belong. Today, people are free to join any political party they choose. But due to the fact that certain political organizations are now working against the laws of the country, one must think twice before affiliating himself with any party.</p>
   <p>In other words, political activity of today is so complicated that one does not know what course to choose. Because of the many political parties springing up on all sides today, one does not know which is the right one or which one that really represents the best interests of the people.</p>
   <p>Each political party claims certain distinctions, Each party has its individual platform on which its promises are made. The people weigh <span class="page-break">\2</span>the merits of each party and reach their decision in the matter of choice of parties. Each party promises much in order to pull the largest number of votes for itself, thereby ranking first among political organizations.</p>
   <p>Just as the politicians have a right to represent and organize different political groups, the people have the right to select the political party which they believe will do the most good for them.</p>
   <p>Not so long ago, the entire world was praising American democracy. Whether the subject concerned free speech or freedom of the press, it was the United States that commanded high respect of all nations. The government of the United States was regarded as a government instituted to protect the rights of the people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Today, the entire world has gone through a process of reorganization. This reorganization has not left the United States without a blemish. The world's greatest countries have bowed before democracy. They have instituted reforms which have brought about more rights for the people; they have granted the working people greater powers in political affairs. The working people are no longer considered as cogs in a machine. They are to be important factors in civic, state and national affairs.</p>
   <p>In other countries, the people are recognized more politically and granted more privileges, while in the United States, the largest democratic country in the world, there is an increased tendency to curb the rights of the people.</p>
   <p>Theoretically the American government secures for the people the greatest right in the world, but in practical life, the people can not exercise <span class="page-break">\4</span>these rights.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, the Socialist Party is as well recognized a political party as the Democratic or Republican Party. According to this statement the American system of government should grant the Socialist Party the same rights and recognition shown the other two parties.</p>
   <p>And yet, what do we find? We find that when the people do elect a Socialist representative, he is not admitted to the House of Representatives. If a man is elected by the people, he should have the right to take his place regardless of party affiliation. If the Socialist Party is a lawfully recognized political party, then the people have a right to elect Socialist representatives, and if a Socialist representative is elected, his mandate should be as legal and binding as those of other parties. There is every <span class="page-break">\5</span>indication that certain groups are trying to destroy the Socialist Party by ignoring it. According to our idea, this is very had tactics, because by doing this they create agitation and help to make it stronger.</p>
   <p>It is our hope that the gentlemen in Washington will become aware of their mistakes, and realize how futile their efforts are. Let them pay more attention to the rights of the people. They will accomplish more with words than force.</p>
