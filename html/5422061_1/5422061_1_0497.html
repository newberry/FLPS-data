   <p>We are all aware of the fact that we are nearing a very important election. Very seldom has there been a campaign as interesting as the present one.</p>
   <p>Senator Deneen, who has shown great interest in the affairs of the Hungarian people of Chicago, has asked Miss Marie Dienes to make a tour of the Hungarian colonies in Chicago and make speeches in behalf of the Republican party and to campaign especially for the Republican Senatorial candidate, Frank L. Smith.</p>
   <p>Miss Marie Dienes at the present time is a law student at Northwestern University. In a very short time she will be the first Hungarian lady ever to become a lawyer in the city of Chicago.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Miss Marie Dienes is related to the former Representative Marton Dienes, who is one of the oldest Hungarian persons in the United States.</p>
   <p>We believe that this young lady has the interest of the Hungarian people at heart; she is truly a very intelligent person and has an exceptional oratorical talent.</p>
   <p>We urge all societies to welcome Miss Dienes and to accept her as a guest, because she is there for a good cause in the name of the Republican party.</p>
   <p>We are well aware of the fact that we can not expect every Hungarian to vote Republican and it would be a narrow-minded statement to say that the Republicans are the only ones who are right.</p>
   <p>Our only hope is that Miss Dienes can return to Senator Deneen who is sending her on this mission in the name of the Republican party, and say that the Hungarian people accepted her in true Hungarian spirit.</p>
