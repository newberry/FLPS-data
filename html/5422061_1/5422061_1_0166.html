   <p>Our public life in Chicago has again some sensation of its own, as the Royal Hungarian Consul, in his speech over the radio the other day, made the statement that if the projected Hungarian Day at the World's Fair is not successful, the cause will be the Cultural Federation's failure to support it.</p>
   <p>It is very nice of the Consul so to recognize the influence the Cultural Federation wields--an influence of which he is afraid.</p>
   <p>His words, indeed, are proof of the Consul's mental poverty.</p>
   <p>If we want to be objective, we must state that the Consul is just the person with the least right to speak on this matter, for, as it is well known, the Hungarian government is not officially represented at the World's Fair, so he has no right to interfere officially.</p>
   <p>The Consul, as a commercial representative of Hungary, would do well if he would keep himself well inside the borders of his calling, and it surely would be better if he would rather endeavor to build up better commercial connections between Hungary and America instead of interfering with the private affairs of the Hungarians of Chicago and trying to disunite them. As it is, they are already torn enough between themselves. And, as the proverb says:"Had you kept still, you would have been wiser."</p>
   <p>As to the Cultural Federation itself, not belittling the importance of its moral influence, we cannot believe that it would do anything to prevent the success of the Hungarian Day. Standing on the height of its calling, the Federation has much more noble things to do than to stoop to waste its energy on such frivolous activities.</p>
   <p>If there is anything which may frustrate the success of the Day, look for it somewhere else, not in the Cultural Federation; and we think it would be wiser to find the real reason than to look for a scapegoat.</p>
   <p>The real reason, is found in the fact that, by arranging a Hungarian Day, the Magyar Club wants to earn laurels. The leaders of the Club are directing the whole action from behind the curtains, in order to endear themselves to the Hungarian government. To attain this aim, they exploit the zeal of some well-meaning and honest leaders of the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The masses, however, are not prone to swallow the hook, since they know very well that the white-collar gentlemen, after letting the former pick the chestnuts out of the fire for them, look upon the common people as "stinky peasants". The masses, therefore, are not so very enthusiastic about eating cherries from a common plate with them.</p>
   <p>And you cannot blame the Hungarians of Chicago.</p>
