   <p>The Jugoslav "fake" nation, which can thank its being to Wilson's ignorant kindness, celebrated its 15th birthday anniversary on Dec. 7 at the Hamilton Club.</p>
   <p>No matter how much this celebration hurts us Hungarians, we must admit that they have a right to celebrate.</p>
   <p>We noted with surprise and distaste, that there was a Hungarian among those present. This man was Dr. Arpad Barothy, so-called leader among Hungarians in Chicago. He is the president of the Magyar Revision (of the Treaty of Trianon) League.</p>
   <p>Perhaps Dr. Barothy will say that he is an American and owes no allegiance to Hungary. This is a matter of taste. We wouldn't sit at one table with those who robbed our Mother-country and killed our kin. This man has no right to call himself Magyar even when his vanity or interests make it desirable. Especially, he shouldn't act the leader in Hungarian movements, because he would shame the cause.</p>
