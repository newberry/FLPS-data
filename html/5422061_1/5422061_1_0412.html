   <p>About two weeks ago, many Hungarian newspapers published conspicuous articles, calling the attention of all Hungarian-American organizations to put aside any differences and find a solution to the problems of Hungarian-Americans. The solution and the remedy will be discussed at a conference of societies to be held June 23 to June 26 in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Under this seemingly red, white, and green national flag, the red is substituted by the Moscow blood red, and the political and social synod is not concerned with merely finding a remedy for the ills of the American-Hungarian, but its program includes the application of the Moscow patent medicine for world politics, another impending world war, fascism, and Hitlerism.</p>
   <p>The list of these world reformers contains some respectable names, undoubtedly these through some misunderstanding or misrepresentation. The real leaders of this conference, who wish to use the Hungarians as puppets, are bolsheviks and radicals. Those who call themselves Magyars, not only <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in language but sentiments, cannot be identified with this group. These radicals, with their anarchistic tendencies, are like the pirates of old, who never sailed under their own flag. They wish to practice their "boring-from within" tactics under the Hungarian tri-color.</p>
   <p>The bolshevik ruse is apparent, and all sane Hungarians will see through it, and have nothing to do with the movement.</p>
