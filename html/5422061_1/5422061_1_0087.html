   <p>Whiskey is dead! For the duration of the war the people living in the United States will not be able to drink whiskey. During the recent session of Congress the United States was declared bone-dry.</p>
   <p>The law not only prohibits the manufacture of liquor in the United States, but also prohibits the importation of whiskey from foreign countries. This does not mean that this law is a measure to economize food supplies. It is intended to stop the people in the United States from drinking; and it is not a victory in food economy, but a victory for the Temperance League. The law does not prohibit the manufacture of beer and wine. It authorizes the government to take over all whiskey stocks in warehouses. The government must, of course, pay for the whiskey it confiscates, allowing a ten per cent profit to the manufacturer. The bill has been passed, but the House wants to prohibit the sale of all alcoholic beverages. We feel quite certain that the Senate will not approve of this.</p>
   
   <p>No one can estimate accurately how much whiskey is stored in warehouses, but there must be between two-hundred and three-hundred million gallons. It will cost the government almost one-thousand million dollars to buy up all this whiskey, and at the same time it will be losing four-hundred million dollars a year in taxes. We, the people, will pay for whiskey we do not drink.</p>
