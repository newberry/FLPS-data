   <p>The report was officially confirmed that soon the Hungarian foreign representation will be organized in America, and consulates will be set up at four Magyar - American centers.</p>
   <p>Chicago, one of the most important centers of Magyar activity, as well as nearby communities, will also get a Hungarian consul. Naturally, it will be rather unusual, after getting used to the Austro - Hungarian consulate, to establish one purely Hungarian, but we will get used to it. The main thing is that the new Magyar consulate will not assume the superior lordly air, and bureaucratic spirit of the old one.</p>
   
   <p>The old unhappy spirit, along with the unhappy old relations with Austria, was wiped out by the War; therefore, we should not be concerned with the past, but look ahead to the future.</p>
   <p>We hope that everybody has learned by the errors of the past and that the new consuls will bring the spirit of the new times with them. The consuls are chiefly commercial representatives and as such they will be of great significance of Chicago, which is an important market as well as a railroad and industrial center. </p>
   <p>A clever consul can render great services to crippled Hungarian commerce, and give an impulse to Hungarian industrial life. An expert consul can improve business between the United States and Hungary.</p>
   
   <p>We know from the past that the Hungarian consulates, as commercial representatives, were of very little service in this respect, since their activities were chiefly directed to settle some more or less difficult affairs of Hungarian subjects. Most of the complaints originated on that account, and we expect some improvement along this line.</p>
   <p>Because we serve the same public as the Hungarian consulate will serve, our range of interest is closely related to that of the Consulate. We promise that as long as the Hungarian consulate serves the interests of the Hungarian subjects living here and the interests of the United States citizens of Hungarian descent, with loyalty, love, punctuality, and sincerity, the consulate can always count on our support, without expecting any compensation or acknowledgement in return.</p>
   
   <p>This we sincerely promise partly in the interest of our unlucky country and partly for the sake of our Magyar brothers living here. But be it known too, that we (our newspaper) will be no lackey, cover for crime, or a household newspaper for the consulate.</p>
   <p>We will preserve our independence under every circumstance. Our independence, first and last, belongs to the Magyars, and it is not for sale. We will be brave and open enemies of consular grafters. We shall constantly and relentlessly expose any bad tendencies of the consulate and we will put a stop to the continuation of any condition of this nature with all our strength.</p>
   <p>We have to declare that the consulates in the past were the nests of many kinds of graft, abuse, and partiality, and for that reason they were unpopular among Hungarians, with the exception of a few good friends and proteges.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of the future consuls should be to attain popularity and to be liked by all not only by the Magyar people, but by the Americans as well.</p>
   <p>World changes have put the Hungarian consulates in a new situation, investing them with an entirely new mission.</p>
   <p>Besides their regular duties, they have to take part in the affairs of the Magyars, not in a lordly manner, but so as to cooperate with them on a Democratic basis.</p>
   <p>The support, self - sacrifice, and patriotic sentiment of the American Magyars towards their suffering native country is of great importance and should be sustained and augmented by the consulates. In Chicago a great and difficult task awaits the consulate in this respect, not because the Magyars of Chicago refuse to perform their duty to their native country, but because Chicago Magyar social life is in a period of dullness. Magyar social life in Chicago is desolate, inactive, barren, and quiet.</p>
   <p>We cannot let conditions stand as they are now. American Magyar social activities must be given new life and made friutful, and every meeting of Magyar societies and organizations should strive toward this end. And here is where the consulate faces its great and difficult task.</p>
   <p>Besides, as it is known to all of us, Chicago is the stronghold of the pan - Slavic movement in America, and the anti - Magyar movement of the Czechs, Yugoslavs, and Slovaks spread out from Chicago. We have to consider too that the newly born Czechoslovakia has very strong supporters and loyal adherents in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Consequently, we have to face these anti - Magyar movements, which means that we have to develop a Magyar irredentism movement.</p>
   
   <p>We believe that the Magyar leaders, regardless of whether they are Hungarian subjects or American Magyar citizens, will receive the consuls with warm friendship and they will help them in their work where it is possible and permissible. It depends on the consuls, whether they want to cultivate this friendship or let it cool off as before.</p>
   <p>As long as the consulates cooperate with Magyar brotherly sentiment, their work will be successful because the American Magyars, and especially the leaders of the Chicago Magyars, are always ready to work for the interest of the native country. But we will not allow anyone to treat us with scorn, arrogance, or snobbishness.</p>
