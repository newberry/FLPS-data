   <p>With reference to laws governing the manufacture of goods which aid the enemies of our country,there has been a misconception in their interpretation with regard to those of the foreign population of the country who have deposited their savings in postal banks. Citizens of Germany residing in this country are not considered enemies according to the interpretation of the law. These people who have their savings in the postal banks of the United States need not worry about having these savings confiscated by the United States Government.</p>
