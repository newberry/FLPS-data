   <p>p. 1 - State's Attorney Swanson warns the public through the press not to believe malignant reports, which disturb our peace of mind and in many cases incite people to make runs on perfectly safe banks.</p>
   <p>These false reports usually have as their source anonymous telephone calls, telling that certain banks are on the verge of failure.</p>
   <p>Many attribute these false alarms to Bolsheviki agitators, who are trying to cause dissatisfaction and rioting by this new method. It is perfectly apparent that any bank would have difficulties if all its depositors demanded their money at the same time. But if a bank rests on a solid footing, a run is only detrimental to the depositors.</p>

   <p>Swanson asks the public to heed his warning and not let themselves be fooled by these false alarmists. If apprehended, anyone spreading false reports will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and the penalty for such offense may be as much as five years in prison.</p>
