   <p>In last week's New York newspapers, I have read that the Women's City Club--whose membership includes not only women of New York but the most prominent and nationally famous women of America--will officially support the Birth Control Amendment, which bill will be introduced in the New York State House of Representatives. This amendment would permit physicians to instruct married couples in the methods of birth control and in some cases to perform surgical abortion.</p>
   <p>The social significance of this amendment and the support given it by a nationally known women's club, can be called revolutionary.</p>

   <p>Newspapers haven't given much space to comments on this new issue, possibly because of habitual prudery or because the general reader is probably not interested in this question. Headlines about the Nicaraguan military excursion, Lindbergh's brave flying maneuvers, or a sensational kidnaping, distract the attention of the public.</p>
   <p>However, we wish to look into this matter. The institution of marriage has gone through such radical changes in the last twenty-five years that now one of the most important phases of marriage, sexual life, will be governed by laws, according to the news article.</p>
   <p>Woman's emancipation, woman's freedom, woman's equality with man, woman's economic independence caused this revolutionary movement.</p>
   <p>What was woman's calling previously?</p>

   <p>Marriage and problems arising in married life.</p>
   <p>In the days before the twentieth century, the poorest as well as the wealthiest families brought up their daughters to be wives. The girl who failed to get married before she reached the age of thirty missed her aim in life and was a disappointment to her parents. She became an old maid, the most tragic fate of a girl in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
   <p>The modern woman in many instances keeps her job after marriage. She does not approach marriage with the same ideals as her grandmother did.....</p>
   <p>At present, stringent laws prohibit birth control and abortions, but it is safe to say that both in Chicago and in Budapest not a day passes without violations.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>On the other hand, if birth control would be legal, women wouldn't be forced to go through illegal operations which endanger their lives.</p>
   <p>In Hungary, especially in the counties of Baranya, Somogy, and Zala, it has become a prevailing custom to have only one child per family. In America, the land of milk and honey, there are usually two heirs in each family. The only exception to this rule is the immigrant family. We are slightly more prolific....</p>
   <p>Ben Lindsey, a Denver judge, wrote a book about companionate marriage and birth control. This book elicited wide publicity in newspapers..... Judge Lindsey advocates trial marriages lasting two years and resulting in no offspring, and then, if both parties find the arrangement satisfactory, to marry and raise a family. According to Judge Lindsey, the wife's place is in the home and the husband should be the provider.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>There are friends and opposers of Judge Lindsey's ideas....</p>
   <p>Whether we approve of Judge Lindsey's theories or not, we do think that it is time something was done about the tottering institution of marriage.</p>
   <p>American public opinion is aroused, which means that there will be changes in the principles of married life.....</p>
   <p>I feel that I did the right thing in writing about this new American problem so that my Hungarian brethren may be well informed. In our own circles--family, church, and social--this matter should be discussed and thoughts exchanged.</p>
