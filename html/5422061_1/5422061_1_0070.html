   <p>Since July 1, the whiskey glasses, wine bottles, and beer barrels have become dry. This was the result of the 18th Amendment, which went into effect just after the War. Why should we deny the fact that this was prohibition only in name and that the law has not served its purpose? There exists only a slight change brought about by this law. If one wants to drink wine, whiskey or beer, he may do so, but it must be done in secrecy. The liquor sold today is of a lower grade and the cost is much higher than previous to prohibition. To be subjected to such a condition is not exactly desirable, but who is satisfied with his present state today? We must adjust ourselves to the situation, regardless of the price we must pay for it.</p>
   <p>Now, the whole country is to get a terrible jolt. It was believed that the saloons would be opened so that the people might be able to <span class="page-break">\2</span>stock up for the coming dry era. But what happened? The law which was passed to keep this country dry during the War is now going to be fully enforced at once, because Congress has just released millions of dollars to that department of government necessary for this purpose.</p>
   <p>We all know that after January 16, the United States will be observing prohibition, and for the next four years there will be no chance of modifying the law. There is very little we can do in the matter, so we must remain satisfied. We have only one hope: that the United States Supreme Court rules it out, saying that this law does not agree with one of the principles of the American government, that is, liberty, which is every man's right. We must not talk about this now. The law has been passed by Congress and signed by the President which means that the 18th Amendment <span class="page-break">\3</span>will be strictly enforced within a week. Personally, we do not indulge in alcoholic beverages, nor do we advertise the sale of them, but the whole affair to us seems a laughing matter, because it ignores man's freedom. We will try to explain our ideas very briefly.</p>
   <p>There was probably some use for prohibition during the War, because the ingredients of alcoholic beverages were necessary to provide more food for the world. Labor used in the manufacture of liquor was necessary in other industries, and money that was being spent for alcoholic beverages was more valuable as loans to the government during the War.</p>
   <p>We are well aware of the fact that prohibition was originally passed as a war measure but that it became effective seven and a half <span class="page-break">\4</span>months after the Armistice had been signed. July 1, the saloons were closed as a matter of form only, because the closing did not have any effect on the War situation at that time. Today, it is approximately a year since the War ended and it is a well known fact that due to political entanglements, peace pacts have not been signed, but the lawmakers want to spend millions of dollars on this law as a War measure in order that it might be enforced. To turn a law of this kind into a War measure during the time of peace, does not show any wisdom on the part of congress, nor will it gain the support of the people. On the contrary, the people are certain to show their disrespect for the law and it will increase the number of agitators and crime-bent organizations in this country which are two very undesirable elements to be dealt with now.</p>
   <p>At this time we want to warn our readers to avoid any violation of the prohibition law and as far as possible avoid places where alcoholic <span class="page-break">\5</span>beverages are sold. This is a timely warning, because the law provides severe punishment for those who sell, buy, or manufacture, alcoholic beverages. We have also heard that some Hungarians are setting up their own stills to make their own brandies and other alcoholic concoctions. People found guilty of doing this can prepare themselves for jail sentences and heavy fines. Many illicit alcohol dealers and manufacturers have been caught already, and the time will come when every one convicted of such crimes will be imprisoned. We advise everyone to give up the unlawful practice of manufacturing alcohol. It is permissible, however to manufacture grape juice for one's own personal use. This, of course, will turn into wine later. We advise people to remain sober in order to avoid entanglements with the law and suffer the consequences.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>What our personal ideas are concerning prohibition is of little concern to the law-makers. It is our duty to obey the law and to constrain others to do the same.</p>
