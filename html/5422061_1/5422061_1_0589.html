   <p>We hear that our editorial, of last week, about the Wilson-Harding Presidential change, has become an issue of centralized interest resulting in many inquiries, and remarks. Many objected to some of the facts brought out in the article, in reference to our defense of the Wilson administration, and our criticism of Harding.</p>
   <p>We did not defend Wilson! We merely expressed our appreciation of the objective accomplishments made by Wilson's pen at a critical time. We advanced our confidence in Harding, but we insist on our privilege to <span class="page-break">2</span>criticize, because we are not going to blindly agree to all the Republicans' actions. We want our readers to see what the entire political change means, and why the American political situation is an eye-sore. Those politicians who sought positions and are now job olders have a livelihood, while we poor workers can expect no exceptional economic change.</p>
   <p>If there is work, then we will work, if not, then we starve, whether Harding or anyone else sits in the White House. Harding will bring neither work nor good wages. The domination of the capitalists, over both political parties, is the cause behind the depression.</p>
   <p>The political change is more or less only a change in names. For those who still are doubtful of our opinions and maintain and believe, that under <span class="page-break">3</span>Harding's leadership some radical changes for the better in our political life will result, we are at your service and will review some of the great changes brought about by Harding.</p>
   <p>Look at some of the construction changes. From Harding's first actions and steps we can already see a great change. His first action was to name his life-long friend and family physician, to be the Chief U. S. medical officer with a mere $6,000 salary and other considerations, which boost his income to the $10,000 mark.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the small town doctor from Marion, Ohio, becomes a Brigadier General, but not because there is a great need for a house physician in the White House.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Dr. Sawyer himself said, he had never taken care of Harding, because he is very healthy and was never seriously ill.</p>
   <p>What is the value of a friendship, if a man does not prove its value with good deeds? So, President Harding set a precedent by putting his old friend on the taxpayers' necks, without serving any good purpose.</p>
   <p>This is truly a change. Wilson did not do such things. That is an old Republican custom. Was this change worth voting for? Let us go on. From Marion, Ohio, Harding called to Washington another good old neighbor, a very wealthy friend, Crissinger by name. Hurriedly he named him to a very fat position, Treasurer of the United States. This position pays <span class="page-break">5</span>only a very meager salary of $10,000 a year, but what is that between brothers? Well, Harding will not become lonely in Washington because of the great change. Dr. Sawyer and Mr. Crissinger, his bosom friends, will be there to ease the pains of homesickness.</p>
   <p>This is the way he is introducing the great change. Harding named Farrell to the Shipping Board, where he will handle billions of dollars worth of important transactions. Farrell is the president of the Steel trust. This is another great change, the great result of our vote.</p>
   <p>We see that Harding is very choosey with his appointments. He is always appointing those whom he favors most, whether it be the president of the Steel trust or a friendly neighbor. By this, without any doubt, he is <span class="page-break">6</span>outdoing Wilson tremendously, and truly we will agree that the election of Harding means a change. Not only do we feel the results of the change from the appointments, but also the change of foreign and political principles are felt. President Harding also created this change.</p>
   <p>Let us not forget, that during the election campaigns, from Harding down to the last grafting politician, they preached to the people, that when they come into power, among other things, they would create a new order in foreign policies. Let us see in what way have they changed their policies from those of the terrible days of Wilson.</p>
   <p>Harding asked the Senators to allow the treaty made with Columbia to stand.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>This is the treaty which was bitterly opposed by the Republican Senators for over two years, while Wilson was President. Our readers can be assured that the Republican Senators and Harding are now doing this in behalf of the great change, though, in the first place, Wilson asked this of them.</p>
   <p>The new Secretary of State, strange to relate, has accepted without change, Wilson's pacts regarding the Japs and Mesopotamia. For the time being, Harding is quietly watching and waiting the Mexican situation, again following Wilson's course. Here Harding forgot to make a change. We believe, this great change, is rather a change in people only, and we will find some new gentlemen, strange faces, and hungry politicians around the meat pot. The old order will remain the same.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>For all of that, we are not angry at Mr. Harding. He cannot do anything more clever than to forget his party's election promises and platform. This sudden loss of memory is an asset that is understood by all politicians. Why bother making changes here or there, let it remain as it is, even in Foreign affairs.</p>
   <p>This is the great change, that we can expect from Harding--an attitude of indifference, that is all.</p>
