   <p>In all probability, Chicago is the only city in the United States where the Hungarian people have not received the political recognition which is their due.</p>
   <p>Our growth and our activities seem to indicate that we should play an important part in politics, but there is a reason for our being so far behind in political achievements. That reason is that there is a great deal of jealousy existing among us.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, it is possible that the politicians regard us as being rather stupid. They feel that we are easily led, or else they think that we are incapable of selecting an able spokesman from our midst. There is nothing more disgusting in the eyes of the American people than the spectacle of one national group being dependent on another for political favors.</p>
   
   <p>The truth of the above statements was clearly demonstrated last Friday when a committee composed of Frank, Kalman, Banffy, Butscher, Schwartz, Reiger, Nagy, Grosz, and Izsak, representing the Chicago Hungarian Republican Club, took part in a Republican rally at the Sherman House. The appearance of the Hungarian committee came as a surprise to the other people who attended this meeting, and the presence of the Hungarians became the general topic of the day.</p>
   <p>At 3:30 P. M. the Hungarian delegation was introduced from the speakers' platform, from which Senator Harding, State's Attorney Crowe and Colonel Luby very cordially greeted them. The introductions were performed by Mr. Frank, the chairman of the committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. Izsak, the secretary of the committee, then explained why the Hungarian delegation had come. During the course of his speech, he pointed out how unfairly the Hungarian people had been dealt with in the field of politics during the past twenty-five years. He stressed the fact that the Hungarian people had been loyal to the party, but that they had never received any favors in return. He openly admitted that if the Republican party did not favor the Hungarians with three political jobs, the Hungarians would swing to the party that has already promised these [jobs].</p>
   <p>The answer that State's Attorney Crowe gave to all this was rather surprising. He said that he knew just exactly how the committee felt about this matter. He frankly admitted that the Hungarians were not represented in any of the political offices in the city. He said that was neither his nor the party's fault. The Hungarians had never formally asked for anything. It has always been thought that if someone wants something, he generally asks for it. He sincerely promised that the Republican party would satisfy the request of the committee, and then asked for the names of the members of the Hungarian Republican Club who were worthy of receiving these three appointments.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Club has done its duty. A bargain has been struck, and it has been concluded in a gentlemanly manner. The promise was thoroughly sincere, but if it remains a promise with nothing really being done, then the Hungarian Republican Club will know what to do.</p>
   <p>State's Attorney Crowe said that if someone wants something he generally asks for it, but if the request is to be at all effective it must be accompanied by action. In the first place, we must organize under one banner, and we must trust our leaders; we must work in harmony for one big cause. We must not permit jealousies to arise when some individual makes more headway in the field of politics than another. We want to safeguard the good name of the Hungarians; we do not want that name to be ridiculed. If we all pull together then the Hungarian people of Chicago can reach the same heights in the political world that other nationalities have attained.</p>
