   <p>A bitter mayoralty campaign is being waged in Chicago. The primary election elicited ridicule and nausea throughout the nation and the world.</p>
   <p>The life-and-death struggle will be decided on April 7 and the contestants will not be particular in choosing their weapons....</p>
   <p>In spite of the fact that we Hungarians are just as vitally interested in the affairs of our city as any other national group, it was not our intention to discuss the mayoralty struggle in an editorial, but the developments compel us to do so.</p>
   <p>For weeks a whispering campaign has been going on in Hungarian- and German-speaking circles. The rumor is being spread that because of national hatred <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and jealousy the Hungarians and Germans will not vote for [Anton J.] Cermak. These poisoners make deprecating allusion to Cermak's name and Czech origin in their appeals to the unsuspecting and innocent voter. The so-called Yankee voters are taunted with the foreign name of Cermak and the fact that he is an immigrant. There is a poison ready for every type of voter.</p>
   <p>Intelligent native Americans, and citizens of Hungarian and German stock are familiar with this low form of incitement and condemn it with disgust. However, there are many gullible people among the immigrants who believe this underhanded propaganda....</p>
   <p>No people in the world have been so disillusioned with campaigns of incitement as the Hungarians, who were dupes of the Hapsburgs' poisonous propaganda....</p>
   <p>Hungary was ruined by the inciters, but in America the self-styled patriots will meet with no response.</p>

   <p>America is the melting pot of nations. She became great and powerful because the motto here is unity and co-operation. We must bury the prejudices, the hatred and jealousy, which have been instilled into the hearts of the children of Central Europe. Here in America, under the Stars and Stripes, we are blended together, make peace with one another, live side by side, struggle for existence together, and become Americans not only in outward appearance but in our speech and convictions as well.</p>
   <p>We do not for a moment deny our brothers across the ocean, or forget our dismembered mother country...., but our thoughts and spirit are American. We think of a brighter future, and not merely of a sad past.</p>
   <p>Anyone who wants to mix Central European or Hungarian national politics into the Chicago mayoralty election is either a half-witted clown or a paid propagandist.</p>
   <p>Nothing should be taken into consideration in this election except our personal <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>liberty, our homes, our taxes, the education of our children, our daily bread, our health, and Chicago's future. If anyone says anything different, he is lying and we should not listen.</p>
   <p>My Hungarian brethren! Don't let our most holy sorrow be bandied about by cheap politicians!</p>
   <p>Two distinguished candidates are contending for the office of mayor. Both have had long public careers from which any citizen who is sane in his thinking and voting can judge whether or not they are qualified to fill the office of mayor for four years.....</p>
   <p>Let us weigh the mistakes of Cermak in the last twenty or more years in public office, and Thompson's, too, and select one who is more worthy of our vote.</p>
   <p>Deeds and achievements alone should decide the question, and not these <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>provocative harangues, because this is the only way that we can contribute to the welfare of our city, ourselves, our families, and also of our fellow citizens of Hungarian stock.....</p>
