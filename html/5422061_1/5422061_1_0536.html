   <p>The Illinois Hungarian Republican Club has increased its zone of influence by establishing branches in the Ninth and Nineteenth Wards. They had their first meeting at 924 West 119th Street, with Kalman Balogh acting as president. It was decided to name the new addition "The West Pullman Branch of the Illinois Hungarian Republican Club." The officers are Joseph Stratinszky, president; Stephen Beluschak, secretary; Julius Drogpoty, treasurer.....It would be well for our countrymen to join this organization in great numbers.</p>
