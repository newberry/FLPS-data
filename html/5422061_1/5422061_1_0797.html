   <p>More than a quarter of a million babies die yearly in the United States, or in other words, more than a million babies are lost every four years. This figure is amazing, and it means that we, as a civilized nation, must do something about this situation. According to baby specialists in the medical field, the death rate among babies can be lowered. This terrible death rate among babies must awaken society to realize that it must be stopped. We all know or should know that in order that a child may be healthy, the mother must receive proper care before and after the child is born, and the child in turn must receive proper medical care when it is born and proper parental care after it is born. The above-mentioned things are the only means by which we, as a human and civilized race, can save yearly a quarter of a million babies.</p>
   <p>We must realize that the mortality rate among mothers, in seventeen nations, is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>much lower than it is here in the United States; we also know that the death rate among babies is lower in nine nations than it is here. The aid of every person is needed to help lower this death rate. We Hungarians are especially concerned because the birth rate per family amongst us seems to be a little higher than the average.</p>
   <p>We must protect the children and the mothers in order that the future generation may be clean, strong and healthy, thereby ensuring a strong, able-bodied nation.</p>
