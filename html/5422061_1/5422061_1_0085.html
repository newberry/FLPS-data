   <p>From Union headquarters, Ernest Bohm, president of the Central Federated Unions, reports that he has sent letters to all locals advising them that the Union is declaring a nation-wide strike if the sale of beer and light wines is prohibited. Mr. Bohm said that he would withdraw strike movements, providing the prohibition movement is withdrawn.</p>
   <p>This strike movement is being encouraged not only because the average worker needs light wines and beer, but also to keep over one million people at work. If prohibition in the fullest sense went into effect, over one million workers would be thrown out of work. Consequently, every line of trade would be affected.</p>
   <p>We must remind the people that this strike threat is not a bluff. The workers <span class="page-break">\2</span>will drive this point with all the seriousness that they can command. This Union has over a million members who will drop work immediately.</p>
   <p>The working class is openly declaring itself against Prohibition. From day to day, open declarations are made that the workingman has a right to indulge in drinking light wines and beer in order to stimulate his tired body. By this, they do not mean that they want to drink the deadly poisonous whiskey, but they would enjoy a refreshing glass of wine or beer.</p>
   <p>The Prohibition question is continually causing unrest among the workers. This unrest will bring about a very serious situation, if the prohibitionists cannot see the viewpoint of the working-man on this question.</p>
