   <p>This newspaper has received numerous inquiries from Hungarian citizens in regards to why so many criminals are out on the streets, when they should be behind bars in jails. This condition has impressed other people also. They in turn have called Sheriff Traeger's attention to the facts. The reason he gives for this condition is that the Cook County Jail is filled to more than capacity. The jail was built to accommodate five hundred and twenty people and at present there are eight hundred and twenty occupants. The crime rate has risen so fast that the sheriff will have to provide for more than twelve hundred prisoners within a very short time. But there is no room at the present time to take care of these criminals; arrangements are being made, whereby the criminals will be rounded up and there will be enough room for them all. So if the citizens will wait a while, everything will be taken care of.</p>
