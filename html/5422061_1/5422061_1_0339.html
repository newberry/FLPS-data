   <p>The Chicago Class-conscious Hungarian Workers' Committee for the Colorado Strikers' Aid and Defense wishes to express their thanks to all those who attended the benefit dances held on November 27 and December 25, 1927. The clear proceeds of these benefit affairs were four hundred fifty and one hundred fifty dollars respectively.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the class-conscious workers, we were able to send six hundred dollars to the starving, struggling miners of Colorado. Chicago's class-conscious workers proved that when called upon to do something for struggling fathers and mothers and starving children, they contribute freely so that these strikers may be fed.</p>
   <p>The miners are still striking and more than five hundred of them have been imprisoned, many of whom are accused of murder, because six miners were killed by the company's henchmen, and instead of charging the murders to them, they are charged to the strikers and their organizers. Knowing this, the Strikers' <span class="page-break">2</span>Aid and Defense Committee decided to raise more money for them, so that these strikers won't be the victims of another legal murder like that of Sacco and Vanzetti, for whose death the workers are responsible. Further funds will be raised by holding dances, entertainments, and socials.....</p>
