   <p>On January 31, the South Side Hungarian Independent Citizens' Club was formed. The meeting held at the Magyar Home was well attended by Hungarian-American citizens. The officers are the following: John Soltesz, president; Samuel Loewy, recorder; and Albert Zenovics, secretary.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Club is to gather Hungarian-American citizens who live on the South Side of Chicago into one large group, so that they may take active part in politics as other national groups do.</p>
   <p>It is advisable that those Hungarians who are American citizens join this organization, because it is necessary that the Hungarians have an audible voice in politics.</p>
