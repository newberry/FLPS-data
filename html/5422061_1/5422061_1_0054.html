   <p>At the beginning of the school year free books were distributed to the pupils of the parish schools by the Catholic Church of Our Lady of Hungary. At that time it was understood that the money spent for books was to be supplied from the proceeds of two benefit plays. The purchase of tickets to these benefit performances is compulsory for each church member.</p>
   <p>The Altar Society has selected the play "The Red Head," which will be staged at the Magyar Home, Sunday, April 26, at 5 P.M.</p>
   <p>In order that our children may continue to receive training in religion and in the Hungarian language and customs, and that children of the poorer families may also avail themselves of these benefits, it is our duty to attend these benefit performances.</p>
