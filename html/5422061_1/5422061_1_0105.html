   <p>We should be celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Volstead Act, which was to improve mankind and to save them from sin. The law prohibits the manufacture, sale, transportation, ownership and use [sic] of intoxicating liquors. That this law did not become popular is only natural, because it prohibits but does not protect. By this time everyone has realized that the opposite result was achieved from that originally intended.....</p>
   <p>A conference was arranged between a prohibition administrator and bootleggers in another state. The purpose of this conference was to determine the amount of income tax that bootleggers should pay.</p>
   <p>The sale of liquor is prohibited. Anyone found guilty of breaking the prohibition law is punished. Therefore, the penalty has been paid, probably the bootlegger was even jailed. Why should he pay an income tax also?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The administrator's idea is novel. By the same right bank robbers and hired assassins should pay income tax also.....</p>
   <p>If a law is enacted it should be enforced. If the law is not satisfactory and cannot be enforced, it should be repealed instead of compromising with the lawbreakers. This way it seems as if lawbreaking is approved.</p>
