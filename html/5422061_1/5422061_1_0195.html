   <p>At the jubilee celebration of Branch 164 of the Verhovay Aid Society last Sunday, one of the speakers made some assertions with which we do not agree; we will endeavor to show here why we disagree.</p>
   <p>The speaker in his masterly oration bemoaned the fact that the Hungarian-Americans are the most backward of all national groups living in America. The Hungarian-Americans have not one institution which serves the good of the public--no orphanage, no home for the aged, etc. After the foregoing assertion, the speaker assumed the role of accuser. He blamed the old country, the local Hungarian consul, the clergy, the Hungarian-American press, and the Hungarian-Americans generally. He concluded his speech with the assertion that the Hungarian-Americans cannot create anything permanent, because they lead a useless life.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Undoubtedly there is a bit of truth in these assertions, because the pre-war Hungarian governments neglected the Hungarian-Americans entirely and did not even maintain contact with them. In those times Hungarians were not known as a separate national group, but were called Austro-Hungarians by the Americans.... Neverthless, the Hungarians of that time did not despair; instead, a few unselfish men, who recognized the isolation of their people, organized the Hungarian-Americans into groups. To prove that the work of these pioneers was worth while, we have institutions that are today celebrating their anniversaries of twenty, twenty-five, thirty, and thirty-five years. We are not, therefore, leading an entirely useless life.</p>
   <p>That up to the present time we have been unable to create anything permanent--as the speaker asserted--is not entirely the fault of the Hungarians, because for the past few decades the Hungarian-Americans have sacrificed much and contributed always to different Hungarian movements. Consequently, the fault must be found elsewhere.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>For anyone who has been attentively following the movements of the Hungarian-Americans in the past years, it is not difficult to place the blame. The battle is never lost by the troops, but by those officers who, to reap laurels for themselves, incite their men to sacrifice. Recent arrivals from Hungary cannot realize the extent of the work of the pioneers, because they find smoothly paved roads, the work of unselfish Hungarian workers. However, the leaders of national movements--in the past-were not so unselfish. The white-collar, pressed-trouser class of gentlemen--with rare exceptions--participated in these movements for personal glory, and, if obstacles arose and they were thwarted in their desire, they did not hesitate to wreck the most noble causes. Such scoundrels created a useless life here.....</p>
   <p>Thousands of dollars were taken from the Hungarian-Americans for various purposes. When, subsequently, these plans did not materialize, the hard-earned money of the contributors was never returned.....After many such experiences, is it any wonder that the Hungarian-Americans have become less gullible and less willing to make contributions?....The Hungarian-Americans today are less <span class="page-break">\4</span>naive and more cautious than in the past, and they do not so readily believe nicely-phrased requests for donations. They have learned to their sorrow not to believe everything that the aristocratic leaders say....</p>
   <p>But by no means does this newly-acquired conservatism of the Hungarian-Americans mean that they are leading a useless life. It does prove, however, that they are more mature and more able to judge sanely. It is not so easy today to organize the Hungarians in the old-fashioned way that was used in the old country--coercion by the county squire with the aid of the gendarmes.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, when accusations and reproaches are voiced, each individual who has had more education than his fellow men should look for the fault in himself; possibly in that way we could find the cause for our useless life.</p>
