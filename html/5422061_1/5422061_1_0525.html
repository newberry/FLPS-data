   <p>Fellow-Citizens!</p>
   <p>The report of the Committee investigating the expenditures of Mrs. Hanna McCormick in the primary elections, published in the Chicago American, shows that of all the national groups, the Hungarian is the only one mentioned as having accepted money for its co-operation.</p>
   <p>We all know that our by-laws strictly prohibit the acceptance of money. Therefore, I request all the officers of the branches, including the West Side and West Pullman branches, to contact the writer so that we may take steps not only to find out who were the individuals who took this money but also to question their right to represent the respectable Hungarians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The writer deems it imperative to call a conference together, because <span class="page-break">\2</span>our president has left the city without notice and the secretary is incompetent.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Charles Banffy,</p>
   <p>First Vice-President.</p>
