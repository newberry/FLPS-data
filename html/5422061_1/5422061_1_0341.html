   <p>For more than two months, now, the Ladies Dressmakers Union has been on strike. This strike involves close to 8,000 workers. The union wants recognition; they demand that the working hours be cut; they also demand a raise in salary. The workers believe they will win the strike. The striking ladies ask all Hungarian women not to accept jobs in the plants that are on strike-in other words, not be strike breakers.</p>
