   <p>During the course of the farewell banquet sponsored by the Chicago Hungarian branch of the Protected Home Circle organization, in honor of Bernard Henrik, many important speeches were made, some of which referred to the social life of the Chicago Hungarians who reside on the South Side.</p>
   <p>The social life of the Hungarians of the South Side has reached a new milestone in its life and this fact cannot be denied by anyone. The Hungarians have awakened, and now are taking steps to accomplish things on a large scale.</p>
   <p>As we said in a foregoing paragraph, there were many important and educational talks given, but a speech which was delivered by Kalman Balogh gave a perfect picture of what has happened among the Hungarians of the South Side, [showing] how their situation has been improved.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>He said that he can see where religious hatreds have been dropped and the Hungarian population is again working together in their social activities in order that their real culture might be recognized by other national groups.</p>
   <p>A more courageous speech than the one given by Balogh could not have been given by any other person who attended the banquet.</p>
   <p>He also said, "The Hungarian people have tried to act many times, but somehow or other always got entangled with an enemy. This enemy constantly tried to tear us apart and for this reason we could not go forward in our activities."</p>
   <p>We must admit that our brother Balogh is right in the above statement. We all know that there are certain people among us who take great pleasure in tearing down those ideas which were conceived by people who have sacrificed <span class="page-break">\3</span>a great deal of time and energy.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian people must get rid of these enemies, and we feel sure that they have started to get rid of them. We feel that the speech delivered by Balogh has aroused the feelings of the Hungarian people, and from now on every step they take, will be one that is forward and not backward.</p>
   <p>At the present time the co-operation of the Chicago Hungarians is needed. It is now that they must show how they feel towards Hungarian social life and Hungarian culture. </p>
   <p>At the present time the Chicago Hungarians have two very important cultural activities developing. One is the Hungarian Home which is being built on the South Side, and the other is the Hungarian Peoples Theatre. </p>
   <p>Both of these glorify the Hungarian name and Hungarian culture. We must give <span class="page-break">\4</span>the Virgin Mary Society due credit for the conception of the Hungarian Home project. The credit for establishing a permanent Hungarian Theatre in Chicago must go to Eugene Endrey.</p>
   <p>Both of these cultural organizations depend upon the support extended to them by the Chicago Hungarians.</p>
   <p>By aiding and supporting the theatre we are helping ourselves because we all know that the human being needs recreation, and through this type of recreation one gains culture.</p>
   <p>The situation in regards to the Hungarian Home is that this Home will be built regardless of whether [or not] it receives the support of other Hungarian societies.</p>
   <p>The building of the Hungarian Home will bring about the recognition of the <span class="page-break">\5</span>Hungarian people in the cultural world, and the other national groups will recognize us as a culturally developed nationality.</p>
   <p>If the Hungarian Home is not supported, then we can say that there is a lack of co-operation, and our people of Chicago still have religious hatreds in their hearts. The realization of this Home means a permanent monument to Hungarian culture, and this is the most important [thing].</p>
   <p>If we want co-operation we must not think about who is the originator of this idea, nor must we oppose the name that will be given this Home--the only thing we must consider is that it will be a Hungarian institution. We are all Hungarians, and as long as we are Hungarians we must do things that will benefit the Hungarian people as a whole.</p>
   <p>We must get rid of our enemies, and our enemies are those people who have religious hatreds in their hearts or people who are willing to work only when they can see profit in their work for themselves.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>These people are selfish and the Hungarian people as a whole do not want them.</p>
   <p>It is very important that the Hungarian people co-operate in order that both the Hungarian Peoples Theatre and the Hungarian Home may be successful cultural developments in the lives of the Hungarian people of Chicago. If both these projects are successful, they will bring us closer together in our social activities, we will learn to love each other, thereby assuring the development of a strong Hungarian spirit which will enable us to fight off those enemies which have kept us down.</p>
   <p>We must not forget that these cultural movements are for the benefit of each and every Hungarian person living in Chicago and the vicinity.</p>
