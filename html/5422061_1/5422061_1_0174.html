   <p>To the uninvited busybodies of our associations, the National Protective Federation of Hungarian-American Associations is still a nut hard to crack, not only because this organization was not called into life for parading under the false password of patriotism, which would only add new burdens to its members, but also because it was created with the purpose of pulling the associations and their members out of the quagmire into which they fell as a result of the present economic crisis.</p>
   <p>Naturally, in an action such as this, there is no room for parading ourselves clad in national costumes to the tunes of Hungarian gypsy bands or for blasting away high-sounding empty phrases in highfalutin speeches, but there certainly is plenty of room for the tiresome work of uncovering the sad facts in their plain truthfulness, which work is much more serious than any parading.</p>
   
   <p>And that is what the uninvited busybodies do not like.</p>
   <p>At first these men had the temerity, for lack of a better argument, to smear this movement as red. Now when they see that this calumny didn't work they are directing their efforts in another direction, loudly announcing that the associations have to get back on their feet through their own initiative, as there is no chance that the American Government will ever aid them and their members, and that--in their opinion--the whole movement is only a waste of time.</p>
   <p>This, of course, is only the opinion of uninvited busybodies, and as such it has no value at all.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, they have never stopped to think that the originators of this movement might have planned the whole action carefully. In fact, long before anything was started, the initiators of the movement had collected all the required information from authoritative sources, so that they know the chances there are for the success of such country-wide movement. And it was not until they were convinced that the execution of the program could not be done exactly as planned but that the greater part of it was still possible, that the action was begun, an action which still goes on unremittingly, since the men who conduct it are not directed by human vanity but by brotherly love.</p>
   <p>And if that is a crime, it is only in the eyes of those who serve selfish interests.</p>
   <p>We are certain that John P. Csizmadia, a Hungarian attorney in Cleveland; Coloman Kolozsvary; Ignacius Fancsali; Steve Gyurica; John Szereto, etc., all members of the Federation's national board of directors, are at least as smart as any of the uninvited busybodies, and that if they would see no possibilities in the movement, they would not participate in it.</p>
   <p>Naturally, if we go to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation only with fables, certainly the result would be sad, but the National Protective Federation will not approach this great national institution with stories but with acceptable and unquestionable facts.</p>
   <p>That this is true is best proved by the letter received by John P. Csizmadia from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</p>
   <p>So, then, the argument that the Government wouldn't help has also suffered defeat. What comes next?</p>
   <p>Last Saturday evening our newspaper was subjected to a tirade from a leading personality, who loudly announced that our weekly feeds the public with dope. We are not angry, for our conviction is that this very worthy compatriot of ours has been misled, as otherwise he would have spoken differently.</p>
   <p>However, we have to remind this very esteemable countryman of ours that it is not gentlemanlike and by no means dignified for a Hungarian to pass an ignominious sentence over something without first examining the "crime".</p>
   
   <p>We are sure that if this very respectable compatriot of ours would have thought over the whole affair and would not have gulped the hook of others, or if he would have taken the trouble to look a little deeper into the case, then he could have seen that here there is no dope but only plain facts.</p>
   <p>Everybody knows that superficiality does not burden the brain, so it is no wonder that many persons find it easier to use. Those who really care for the fate of their fellow men are not afraid of a little brain work.</p>
   <p>For not always is the individual the most important; there are cases in which the individual should shove back his ego, especially if by so doing he serves the common good.</p>
   <p>And in this lies real brotherly love.</p>
