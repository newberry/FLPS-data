   <p>Martin Himler is one of the brainiest journalists in Magyar America, and his article--which can be found on another page in this issue--deserves to be read attentively and that we should discuss it in this editorial. The topic of which he writes is extremely important and an actuality in all of our lives.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the publishing of the article does not mean that we agree one hundred per cent with its point of view and that we accept its analysis. We respect Himler's sincere and brave words, we applaud his sense of social justice, but he colors his conclusions with pessimistic hues and views the future in dark colors. Even concrete facts and events can be easily interpreted in several ways, and prophecies or presentiments can be presented from an individual point of view by an adept journalist.</p>
   
   <p>Let us comment on the present economic crisis and on Martin Himler's question "When Will There Be Work?" from our angle.</p>
   <p>Evidently, the past two months and the next two months will see the depth, the bottom of this economic depression. In a few years, a more accurate description will be given by the economic barometer. Probably the all-time low will be in December 1930.</p>
   <p>But when we live in an era of crisis, the doubters, the pessimists, and the shortsighted fall into deep despair; they prophesy utter ruin....they attempt revolution, moan and think of the worst.</p>
   <p>This is the time when sanity, cold calculation, ability to face the future, discipline, and a thorough weighing of consequences and possibilities are necessary.</p>
   
   <p>Extreme optimism, foolish hopes, the belief in sure success are unfortunate and dangerous. A calm weighing of the past, investigating facts circumspectly and, of the two magnified possibilities choosing the middle course, will in all probability lead us in the right direction.</p>
   <p>In the present serious crisis, too, we can draw our conclusions for the future from two outstanding important circumstances. We accept Martin Himler's assertion (although we think he exaggerates) that capital is the unlimited master of society and countries. Capital is usually represented by banks, financial institutions, and the stock markets. It is also generally known that in the stock markets and in financial institutions, the depression is felt to a dangerous degree. Naturally, this is an artificial, manufactured result--smart tactics on the part of big capital.....</p>
   <p>Although this is despicably unjust from the viewpoint of the ordinary citizen or the worker, the fact is that this is the method of manipulation of big capital. This is their cure for the seriously ill society....</p>
   <p>It is purely a matter of time--we can say a relatively short time--when capital will become active again and will bring circulation back by degrees to rigid economic life....</p>
   <p>The greatest commercial and industrial concerns of America--in other words, capital--are gravitating toward gradual industrial democracy and even persuade the workers to buy stocks under favorable conditions.</p>
   <p>This is a clever and purposeful tactic. Through democracy, men and women are invested with political rights which gradually will bring about the more equal distribution of wealth....</p>
   <p>It is the stupidity, indifference, and inertia of the voters that is at fault in the slow progress of a more equal distribution of wealth.</p>
   <p>However, no one should think that those billions of dollars lying idle in banks, financial institutions, and industry will remain so for long or that the generals of big capital will allow unemployment and business depression to persist without doing anything about it.</p>
   <p>The most simple-minded man, with an elementary education, knows that this unemployment situation--the starving people of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Chicago, and New York--is the most fertile soil and the best opening for fanatical experimentation and the outbreak of hostilities on the part of the dissatisfied population.</p>
   <p>But American capital does not want this to happen. American capital will not commit suicide. Its past of a hundred years proves the contrary. Just as it will provide food, clothing, and housing, it will provide employment too.</p>
   
   <p>At this time capital is gathering strength for a new era. It needs this lengthy rest.....</p>
   <p>Already two important symptoms are apparent which foretell the end of the crisis.....As we have been suffering from the depression for a year and a half, a quick recovery is not anticipated, and employment will not be available for millions of people this year. The beginning of employment for all will be gradual and will start in the most vital branches of industry.</p>
   <p>We believe that the number of the unemployed will diminish this spring, but within a year or two, in 1932, the number of the unemployed will be at normal, and even if we will not have loud-noised prosperity, we will have enough opportunities for work.</p>
   <p>In such a powerful industrial and farming country as the United States, where machinery causes such drastic changes every year for industrial workers and farmers alike, there is bound to be and there always is a great number of unemployed.....</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, there are several weighty problems unsolved and these retard economic prosperity, but we do not believe that the American citizens will consider applying the teachings of Marx to their troubles or will make an issue of this at the next election.</p>
   <p>For oratorical effect the injustice of the unequal distribution of wealth will often be heard in campaign speeches because it is a sore spot to all of us. Nevertheless, we think that less radical thoughts will be upper-most in the minds of the voters when they have recuperated from the effects of this depression. They will again dream of six- or eight-cylinder automobiles and will discuss Prohibition. This is our conception of the future!.....</p>
   
   <p>We would like to dwell briefly on the fact that although the philosophy and physiology of capital is identical internationally, its tactics, methods, and instruments differ. In England and in Germany, capital has to contend with problems different from those in America.....</p>
   <p>America is not independent of international problems, but neither is it wholly dependent upon them. Although it would be very important and profitable that peace and order prevail in other parts of the world, to put at least half of our five million unemployed to work the internal problems of the United States have to be remedied gradually, with the timely co-operation of big capital only. Neither England nor Germany could do this.</p>
   <p>Our conclusion is that in time external problems will be solved either peacefully or otherwise, and this will have a beneficial effect on the American economic situation.</p>
   
   <p>Our internal economic problems are nearing solution, and although we do not believe that this solution will be ideal and perfect, it will bring another ten years of happy times, when those who are willing to work will have employment and will not have to loiter in the streets in despair to beg for bread, lodging, and fuel. By virtue of reasonable wages, a livelihood and some measure of comfort will be assured the majority of the workers, just as in the so-called good old times, under the old imperfect order.</p>
   <p>We are not writing the foregoing to present the facts through rose-colored glasses, but it is an attempt to show the right way on the basis of our observations and analysis.</p>
