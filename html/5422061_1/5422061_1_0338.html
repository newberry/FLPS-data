   <p>There is a great despair in Burnside, as the shops of the Illinois Central were shut down last week. In those shops were employed mostly the older Hungarians of Burnside, those who are in the descending years of their lives. They let themselves be persuaded to a strike, demanding a 20% raise in pay. The railroad was willing to grant them 5%, which the workers declined to accept. As an answer, the railroad closed the shops, and now, as the workers affected are over forty-five years of age, they have almost no prospect to be able to secure for themselves another job elsewhere.</p>
