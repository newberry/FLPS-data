   <p>Several hundred persons attended last Sunday's massmeeting, called together by the Chicago Branch of the Cultural Federation, and supported by a number of Hungarian associations in Chicago and vicinity. The massmeeting, held at the Masonic Hall, was to protest against the wave of Hitlerism now sweeping over Germany. On calling this massmeeting, the Cultural Federation issued a call to all Hungarian associations in Chicago and vicinity to a conference on April 5. At this conference thirty-two delegates were present, representing--some officially and some unofficially--seventeen associations. Other associations had no time to send their official representatives but promised they would join the movement.</p>
   <p>The associations that took part in this meeting formed a body of nine members, which will later be transformed into an executive committee, whose aim will be to organize a federation against Hitlerism and war. This federation will be composed of Hungarian associations and private persons in Chicago and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>vicinity.</p>
   <p>The following associations were represented at the conference: The District Executive Committee, Second and Sixth branches of the Cultural Federation, Chicago Hungarian Workers Singing Club, Chicago Hungarian Cultural and Benevolent Association, Chicago Hungarian Group of the I. W. W., Hungarian Democrat Club, Workers Club, Chicago Hungarian Workers Orchestra, Chicago Hungarian Cultural and Singing Club, Association of Independent Hungarian-Americans, Workers Sick Aid Federation Branch 13, Hungarian branches 1003 and 1011 of the I. W. O., Austro-Hungarian Sick Benefit Association, and Twentieth Century Ladies' Society.</p>
   <p>The grand protest massmeeting on April 9 was opened at 3:30 P.M. by Andrew J. Szabo, secretary of the Chicago District of the Cultural Federation, who spoke of the work of the committee in charge of arranging the massmeeting and asked Dr. Zoltan Galambos to act as chairman.</p>

   <p>In his short opening speech, Dr. Galambos pointed out the danger of Hitlerism not only in relation to Germany but in relation to the world as well, as a result of Hitler's race-hatred theory, which disturbs the hitherto prevailing peace between peoples of different nationalities and creeds living together throughout the world. Dr. Galambos was followed by Dr. Ernest Lovinger, Andor Wiener, Ignacio Izsak, and Joseph Pataki, all well-known speakers and noted public personalities of Chicago and vicinity, who in their turn delivered excellent speeches, enlightening the question from all points of view. The delegate from the John Reed Club spoke in English in the name of the American journalists, writers, and artists, assuring the meeting of their sympathy and praising the Hungarians for this magnificent and thoroughly human movement.</p>
   <p>All the speakers agreed on the necessity of promoting unity and solidarity between the associations, so that all of us may, hand in hand, help bring about a better and nobler future.</p>
   <p>The massmeeting adopted the following resolution:</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"Whereas, The Hungarian associations of Chicago and vicinity, at their joint meeting, held on April 9, 1933, have declared that they join with enthusiasm those organizations which are aware of the dire necessity for human solidarity; and have protested against the Hitler regime in Germany, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The Grand Meeting sees in Hitlerism the qualified enemy of human society and looks upon it as a danger against world peace; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the meeting not only recognizes the necessity of organizing an all-embracing Anti-Fascist World Federation to combat Hitlerism and preserve the peace of the world but also condemns with disdain the now existing political system in Germany, branding its leaders and supporters as the sworn enemies of human rights, civilization, progress, culture, and peace. Be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the meeting demands the restoration of the rights of democratic <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>freedom, such as freedom of speech, press, and assembly; the immediate discontinuation of the persecution of the Jews; the immediate release of imprisoned workers, and the restoration of the workers' political and organizational rights. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be telegraphed to the German Government, the German Ambassador in Washington, and the Secretary of State of the United States, as well as to the American and Hungarian press."</p>
