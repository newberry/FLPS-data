   <p>The Protection of Foreign Born Organization held a huge conference on Nov. 20.</p>
   <p>Two hundred and forty delegates, representing 250 organizations, were present and discussed ways and means how to voice their objections against the Dies Bill, now in Congress.</p>
   <p>There never has been a conference of such proportions, where so many nationalities and organizations took part.</p>
   <p>Among those present were delegates of churches, benefit societies, social clubs, branches of the A. F. of L., and radical organizations. Albert Goldman, attorney, explained the danger of the Dies law to all workers, whether native or foreign-born, of the deportation in progress of ignorant workers. He showed in his talk that the greatest danger is to those workers and organizations that are not familiar with immigration laws.</p>

   <p>We have to do everything in our power to enlighten the people about the Dies Bill and other anti-foreign policy laws, to protect them from unofficial persecution by officious government employees.</p>
   <p>We must organize before taking any steps, and everyone has to take part in this movement.</p>
