   <p>p.2......................Norway was under Danish rule for a long period of time. One hundred years ago they declared their independence. Later they had a union with Sweden that is they had one king. About twenty-five years ago the Norwegian House of Representatives, the Storthing, decided to dissolve this arrangement and offered the royal crown to the younger son of the king of Denmark,thereby becoming an independent kingdom.</p>
   <p>That this didn't bring about a war between Sweden and Norway can be attributed to their king, Oscar II, who bowed to the wishes of the people and didn't try to use force.</p>
   <p>This 100th anniversary was celebrated by the Norwegians in Chicago, Friday. May 17. The first part of the celebration was held in Lincoln Park in the afternoon and at the Medinah Temple (Rush &amp; Ontario) in the evening.</p>
   <p>The Hungarians who love liberty and are always fighting for it, have always had a sympathetic feeling toward the Norwegians. At the suggestion of our editor, the Chicago Magyar Club was represented at this occassion by a committee. They presented their congratulations in writing. The document was decorated with the Hungarian national colors. The text written by Louis K. Birinyr is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Our highly Respected and Happy Fellow-American-Citizens of Norwegian Descent:</p>
   <p>We, the undersigned American citizens of Hungarian descent, cordially greet you on this happy occasion where you are celebrating the glorious independence of the great and good people and democratic Kingdom of Norway. We rejoice and are deeply thankful with you that we are living in and are privileged to enjoy the sacred rights and to share in the performance of the duties of the citizenship of this great and glorious democratic country of ours, wherein we are permitted to recall the greatness of our ancesters, to respect their hallowed memories and to publicly celebrate their achievements in the spheres of religious, educational, cultural, economic and political freedom and independence. We believe that there is a real and lasting American value in men and women, living in,and citizens of this, our country, who respect and honor the memories of their ancesters and are jubilant over the successes of their kins, across the ocean , in every form of honorable human advancement. Highly respected and eminently useful American citizens are they, in whose bosom burns the candle of filial love and who cherish respected solicitude for the well-being of their children's children. We,therefore, your fellow American citizens deem it an exceptionally great privilege to congratulate you for the exceedingly high and honorable human qualities which you are publicly manifesting on the occasion of your happy celebration of the independence of the people and democratic Kingdom of Norway.</p>
   <p>On this happy occasion we recall with you the supreme test to which your ancestors were subjected, when against their will they and their country, Norway, were bartered from Denmark to Sweden, merely as a pawn in the international game then played in Europe. Denmark was an ally of Napoleon and Norway was compelled to pay the price. The Treaty of Kiel (January 1814) was forced upon the Norwegian people, and therein they were robbed of their right of self-determination, their liberty and independence. Against her will Norway was ceded to Sweden. But your ancestors vigorously protested and so successfully resisted the unholy attempt to deprive them of their liberty and independence that on May 17, 1814, they elected a king of their own, adopted a liberal constitution, established a Norwegian Parliament and gave notice to the whole world that Norway thenceforth shall be a free and independent kingdom. But the God-given right of the people of Norway to liberty and independence was disputed. A war followed between Sweden and Norway. The liberty-loving people of Norway were victorious. The great Powers of Europe, however, intervened and Norway was forced against her will into an unnatural union with Sweden. They never consented to the loss of their liberty and independence and on June 7, 1905 the Norwegian Parliament declared unanimously that the union with Sweden under one king has ceased. Ever since, Norway is free and independent.</p>
   <p>While we partake in your joy and unite with you in your celebration of the independence of Norway, our thoughts are naturally directed to unfortunate, inhumanly mutilated and cruelly crucified Hungary, the land of our ancestors. For one-thousand years past, Hungary was the rear guard of European Christian civilization. Time after time, the Hungarians fought, bled and died to protect Western Europe and her Christian civilization from the invasion of the East, - the Mongols and the Turks. History has given the Hungarian people the title,"Defenders and Protectors of Christianity and Christian Civilization." Even in this age, the bells in the towers of Christian churches toll each noon the message that on July 21, 1456, the Hungarians, led by John Hunyadi, delivered the final blow to the Turks and settled once and for all time to come the freedom of Western Europe from Turkish invasion.</p>
   <p>We proudly recall that the Hungarians were always a liberty-loving people. Originally, Hungary was an independent kingdom and she was the first country in continental Europe to have a constitution (1222), the English Magna Charta preceding it only by seven years. We are proud that it was in Hungary, for the first time in Europe a law was enacted, which gave freedom of religion and liberty of conscience to all inhabitants of Hungary.</p>
   <p>The constant struggle of the Hungarian people against invasion weakened them and subsequently they fell under the control of the Hapsburg dynasty of Austria and there they remained against their will until after the termination of the World War,</p>
   <p>At the out break of the World War, Hungary had no international will of her own. Her will was subjected to that of the Hapsburg dynasty of Austria. In turn the Hapsburg dynasty was under the control of its Austrian, Czech, Polish and Slavic leaders.</p>
   
   <p>It is now a matter of open historical knowledge that of all the European countries involved in the World War, Hungary was the only one that earnestly and vigorously opposed the provocation and outbreak of the World War; yet she was forced into it and was ordered to fight although she had no appreciable interest in the outcome of the World War. Yet, after the termination of the World War, an unprecedentedly cruel punishment was meted out to Hungary. In the Treaty of Trianon more than two-thirds of her population were taken from her. The perfect territorial integrity and economic unity of Hungary were most cruelly violated; her commerce and industry were ruined; her people - ten millions of them - with more than two-thirds of her territory were given over to foreign control of much less civilization. Her remaining eight million people were reduced to unheard of suffering and privations. Cut off the head, amputate the arms and limbs of a human being, take out his lungs, cut the cord of his heart and then tell him to live - then you will have a correct conception of what was done to Hungary in the unholy Treaty of Trianon.</p>
   <p>As the result of the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary is slowly bleeding to death. A great people, who have given so much to the world, who have contributed so much to the advancement of civilization, have been condemed to slow starvation and eventual death.</p>
   
   <p>While you, our happy fellow American citizens of Norwegian descent,happily celebrate the rebirth of Norway, we, American citizens of Hungarian descent,are earnestly pleading with civilized mankind for justice,a fair deal,and renewed life for Hungary."</p>
   <p>Long live free and independent Norway!</p>
   <p>Long live the Resurrection of Hungary!</p>
