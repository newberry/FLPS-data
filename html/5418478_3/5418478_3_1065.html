   <p>No doubt the report of the organization of a Bohemian Artists Society, bearing the name of one of the greatest living Bohemian masters, will interest our public in the greatest degree. The number of artists in our midst continues to grow and become more powerful, in this respect we can boast that we have far surpassed many other nationalities. The number of creative artists is increasing unusually rapidly and of these, painters decisively occupy first place. These young artists finally came to the realization that it will be for better for them, and for art in particular, if they are united in one strong organization. The work of organizing the Bohemian artists had been going on for a long time until finally on the 22nd of Sep. the Mikulas Ales society of Bohemian artists was organized.</p>
   <p>The society will meet every Sunday morning between 8:00 and 11:30 A.M. in the Bohemian-American Hall at 588 West 18th street. At these meetings, lectures will be given about art and at the same time drawings from models will be done. For the membership this will be not only entertainment but excellent practice. As we are informed, it is the goal of this society to hold expositions twice each year, in spring and fall.</p>
   
   <p>Every Bohemian painter may become a member of this society by merely paying fifty cents a month dues, no initiation fee is required. At the time of the organization of this society the following officers were elected: Jan Jirse, Chairman. Ladies are also accepted in the society and many of them applied. This is a welcome revelation, because it convinces us that our Bohemian ladies are in nowise remaining behind, going forward with exemplary determination in everything, also in art.</p>
