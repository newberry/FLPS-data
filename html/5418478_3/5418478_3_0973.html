   <p>Bohemian songs reverberated yesterday in the beautiful Hanson Park throughout the entire afternoon. About one hundred Bohemian singers, men and women, members of various Bohemian singing societies, met there for an open-air rehearsal in order to hear how their singing will sound when they will perform next Sunday at the Slavonic Day. The singers assembled in Mr. Rohlíček's garden restaurant on 64th Avenue, and after partaking of refreshments, they sang the four chorals they will present next Sunday under Mr. Karel Coufal's direction.</p>
   <p>....Another rehearsal will be held next Wednesday at the Vojta Náprstek school. The presence of all those who will sing at the Slavonic Day is urgently requested.....</p>
