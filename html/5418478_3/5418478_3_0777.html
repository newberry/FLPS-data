   <p>As we have already announced, the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Frantisek Ludvik's Bohemian Dramatic Society of Chicago), will start its performances in two local halls, the Thalia Theater and the hall of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, 26th Street and Lawndale Avenue, in the next few days.....</p>
   <p>The directors of the Ludvikovo Divadlo have taken great pains to retain a troupe of first-class actors. Many new members have been added to the old stock, some professionals, some amateurs, but all of them are known as excellent performers. A great deal has been accomplished in the matter of the repertoire. In addition to novelties of a lighter character, whose principal mission is to entertain, many plays have been prepared to satisfy the artistic appreciation of our public and help achieve the educational mission of the Bohemian theater. Among the new or newly prepared plays are the following: "Bezvyznamna Zena" (Wife [or women] Without Importance), "Tosca," "Na Cem Zalezi" (The Importance of Being Ernest), "Bratri sv. <span class="page-break">2</span>Bernarda" (St. Bernard's Brothers), "Mr. Woodleight z Floridy" (Mr. Woodleight from Florida), "Cirkusaci" (Circus Folks), "Vesele Zeny Windsorske" (The Merry Wives of Windsor), "Divoska" (A Wild Woman), "Na Zamku Dolanskem" (At the Dolan Castle), "Rozkosna Prihoda" (A Delightful Affair), "Carmen".
