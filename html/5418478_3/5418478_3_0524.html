   <p>p. 1.. As in previous years, so this year also, the summer garden in the Coliseum, generally known as "Coliseum Garden," on Wabash Avenue at 15th Street, is open, and the popular concert-band under the leadership of Mr. W. Krell is giving daily performances there. This band is newly organized and has thirty-five members. The well known Bohemian musician, Jan Kozak, is its agent.</p>
   <p>It is because of his efforts that the band is composed almost wholly of Bohemians. The following named musicians are soloists of the band: Joseph Karlovsky, cornet; Jos. Churan, trombone; B. Vesely, xylophone. The following named Bohemians perform on other instruments: Vac. Lang, Jos. Tlusty, Joseph Markvart, J. Koula, J. Cerny, V. Tuma, J. Vins, M. Masopust, Jos. Dolista, V. Kozak, V. Masacek, A. Brousek, Jos. Kalabza, V. Ocasek, A. Konopasek, Fr. Chapek and J. Sinder.</p>
   <p>Through the endeavors of Mr. Kozak, next week's program will include several Bohemian compositions such as excerpts from the opera "Prodana Nevesta" (Bartered Bride) by Smetana; Dvorak's Slavonic Dances and others.</p>
   <p>The price of admittance to the evening concerts is 25 cents.</p>
