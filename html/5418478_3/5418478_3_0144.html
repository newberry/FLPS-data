   <p>The beautiful floral decorations on the Municipal Pier are the work of Mr. B. Prasil, 3052 South Harding Avenue. He was the first Czech ever to become chief gardener for the Bridewell, and has been holding this position for the past seventeen years. He spent only $350 of $500 appropriated by the city council for the Pier flowers.</p>
