   <p>There was a beautiful four-act drama, "Bojarova Svatba" (Marriage of Bojar), on the repertory of the Divadlo Tyl (Tyl Bohemian Theater) at Sokol Havlicek Tyrs last Sunday. This drama was selected by Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, popular Bohemian actress of Chicago, for her benefit performance. As was expected, the drama was presented before an audience which filled the hall to capacity, and the performance turned out to be truly magnificent.</p>
   <p>It is an undeniable fact that Mrs. Cervenka deserves a good deal of credit for the growth of the Bohemian stage in Chicago. In addition to her good work, she always donates the proceeds of her benefit performances to charity, and even the proceeds of Sunday's performance were earmarked for the same cause. It is therefore not surprising that these generous efforts were recognized by our people last Sunday when Mrs. Cervenka received a tremendous ovation which will not be forgotten by her for a long time to come.</p>

   <p>After the second act, she received so many gifts and floral offerings that the stage resembled a veritable flower garden. In the meantime, members of the ladies' auxiliary of the Pilsen Brewery assembled on the stage, and their spokesman, Mrs. Sistek, addressed the guest of honor with a few words of congratulation. Mrs. Cervenka was so deeply moved that she could hardly talk.</p>
   <p>As to the purely histrionic abilities of the actress, it may be said that she gave one of the most successful demonstrations of her acting in "Bojarova. Svatba". Mrs. Cervenka chose one of the most lovable, but also one of the most difficult, roles--that of the gypsy girl "Sanda;" and although she had to overcome some difficulties, Mrs. Cervenka presented the role with remarkable success.....</p>
