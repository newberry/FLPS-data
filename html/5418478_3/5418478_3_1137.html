   <p>The Czech National Theatre presented "Fedora," a four-act drama by the famous French playwright, Victorien Sardou, last night. The highly emotional subject of the play never fails to exert a strong attraction upon the public. The execution and the staging were really splendid. The latter was in the able hands of Mr. Henry Weidner.</p>
