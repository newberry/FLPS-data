   <p>Last year the Distriktni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Chicagu (District Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of Chicago) adopted for its program for this year the slogan "Vse pro mladez!" (All for our youth!) All of our endeavors and conferences touching upon this problem are to be realized and crystallized at the great church festival, otherwise titled Svatovaclavska Slavnost (Saint Wenceslaus Festival), which is to be held on Wednesday afternoon and evening, September 27, 1922, that is,one day before the feast of Saint Wenceslaus. The festival is to take place in the beautiful garden and hall of Pilsen Park, South Albany Avenue and West 26th Street.</p>
   <p>Certain preparations have already been made at previous meetings of the District Alliance, and the advisory committee of the Alliance, consisting of the clergy of our Bohemian parishes, unanimously approved the program <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>submitted and will fully co-operate. The executive committee....has progressed so far in its work that the actual operations relative to the festival may now be started. In fact it has started already. Last Friday night the executive committee, the labor committees, and the delegates of our youth organizations met in the conference hall of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) to take the necessary steps in launching the work connected with the festival. The idea of a church festival was unanimously agreed upon by those present, and everyone was enthusiastic about it. No one in this group seeks personal profit or glory, and that alone assures us that the festival will be successful. Tickets were mailed to all men's and women's unions and organizations. We anticipate that everybody who has any understanding of this great idea will purchase at least one ticket. The ladies' societies and youth organizations have already signified their desire to manage booths and other attractions. The committees have divided their responsibilities as to work, so that with sufficient comprehension of this task lying before us, and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>full use of the time left to us, until September 27, we may expect the festival to be a success and a surprise to all the Bohemians in Chicago.</p>
