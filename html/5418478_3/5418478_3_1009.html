   <p>The musical production which was held Saturday evening in Sokol Pilsen hall was a genuine public examination of the pupils of the foremost Bohemian conservatory of music which is under the direction of our famous teacher of music, Professor A. V. Cerny. Nevertheless, we call it an artistic entertainment, because in addition to the program presented by the pupils, several enthusiastic artists appeared also. Those attending Saturday's concert had an opportunity to convince themselves that Professor Cerny is really in earnest when he wants to make a musician of someone whom he recognizes as capable.</p>
   <p>At the concert, which drew a remarkably large attendance considering this time of the year, we had an opportunity to listen to beginners as well as trained artists who received certificates, and who, by their performances, really proved that they were entitled to them. In the graduates, we <span class="page-break">2</span>recognize enthusiastic artists, who will spread the good reputation of the Bohemian musical art among other people. In the pupils, even the youngest ones, we saw talents well on the road to achievement. If they remain under the direction of their enthusiastic teacher, they will surely have a successful career in the field of music. Saturday's concert was so interesting that the audience remained till the end, past midnight, listening with great interest.</p>
   <p>The artists, of whom there were many present, were agreed that this was one of the most successful commencement concerts ever given. The particpants in the exercises were showered with flowers, and the praise which they received will surely be an encouragement to them to continue to work zealously, because under the direction of their distinguished teacher, they have open before them a grand career in the musical world.</p>
