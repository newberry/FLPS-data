   <p>The Sdružení Českých Svobodomyslných Škol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) is viewed with undisguised interest by many people. For this reason we note with interest that a theatrical production by the Dĕlnická Dramatická Jednota (Workingmen's Dramatic Association) will be staged on January 15 at two o'clock in the afternoon, in the hall of Sokol Chicago....The subject of the play is particularly suitable and timely for the needs of our schools. It deals with the conflict between the old and new generations, the latter being the victor.....The audience will surely be pleased with the outcome of the play.</p>
   <p>Tickets may be obtained from the secretary of the subcommittee of the Sdružení Českých Svobodomyslných Škol, or from the instructors in the Bohemian Free Thought schools. They may also be obtained at the box office on the day of the play. Our wish is that this play will meet with moral and material success, since the schools deserve such success for their useful work in educating our Bohemian people.</p>
