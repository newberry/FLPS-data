   <p>The well-known contrabass artist, our countryman, Vaclav Jiskra, proved himself to be a great hero and not just an outstanding artist. While gathering lotus in Grass Lake Mr. Jiskra went to the aid of the occupants of another boat that had capsized. He succeeded in rescuing two persons but the third person disappeared beneath the surface of the lake before he could be reached. This is not the first time that Mr. Jiskra risked his life to save somebody.</p>
