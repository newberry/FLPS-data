   <p>It is with justified bitterness that we write this report on the concert of the Pevecky Spolek Bedrich Smetana (Bedrich Smetana Singing Society). Miss Jirina Rudis-Jicinska, offering a most flimsy excuse, simply failed to appear, very much like the public that was conspicuous by its absence--without any excuse whatsoever. Neither the first nor the second should have happened. Our hearts should be full of compassion for our countrymen in Bohemia, where the whole nation is suffering because most of the providers had to leave their families and go to a war they hate so much, while many others are deprived of their daily bread because of the closing of factories, shops, and stores. These facts should always be foremost in our minds, and everything else is of secondary importance. All kinds of "hops" that bring only personal profit to some individual always enjoy a tremendous attendance, but whenever there is a question of doing our sacred duty either toward our needy countrymen here or in the old country, we pretend, in the highly approved fashion of some of our million-dollar institutions, to be deaf and dumb. This was again proved at yesterday's concert. It was another instance which demonstrated our humaneness and our--patriotism.</p>
   <p>Well, Miss Jicinsky simply advised the committee that she was unable to appear because her accompanist had fallen ill. The young lady should have known that for one accompanist she could get five or six of them who would be glad to sit down at the piano at a moment's notice and do as good a job as anybody else in this metropolis. Miss Jicinsky, we are sorry to say, has fallen in the public eye because of her action. But, "there is no use crying over spilt milk," particularly since her absence did not detract from the concert at all. Her place was most ably filled by our young and promising violin virtuoso, Miss Mignonnette Sruta, daughter of the old and popular settler, Mr. Sruta, of 1322 Independence Boulevard. She was accompanied by Miss Rene Nebr.</p>
   <p>The concert opened with a mixed chorus of the Pevecky Sbor Bedrich Smetana singing Pivoda's arrangement of "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home)...followed by a duet...from "Prodana Nevesta" (Bartered Bride)....</p>
   
   <p>Miss Sruta's piece, Mendelsohn's "Violin Concerto," one of the most difficult compositions for that instrument, was the outstanding offering of the evening.....</p>
   <p>Also, Miss Matejicek earned a burst of applause for her rendition of....Bohemian folk songs.....</p>
   <p>The concert was concluded with a choral presentation of both American national anthems, "America" and "The Star-Spangled Banner" (sic).....</p>
