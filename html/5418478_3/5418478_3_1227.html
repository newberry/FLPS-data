   <p>There was a theatrical performance at V. Czech's Hall yesterday. This was a benefit affair for L.D. Vorak, who is a teacher at the Bohemian-American School.</p>
   <p>The play would have been much better acted had there been less dependence upon cues.</p>
   <p>It is also regrettable that so few members of C. S. P. S. (Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society) were present in support of this worthy purpose.</p>
