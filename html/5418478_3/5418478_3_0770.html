   <p>Another Bohemian theater season was opened last Sunday and therefore it may not be out of place to discuss our theatrical situation, which is far from excellent. So far there is nothing that would cause one to be filled with enthusiasm and with a pleasurable expectation of things to come. That is just the reason why we should turn our attention to the conditions prevailing at this time, and to give some consideration to ways and means for necessary improvements. Improvements are imperative not only in the interest of the theaters themselves, but also in the interest of the public. We believe, and our experience proves, that the Bohemian public does not support its theaters as it could and should. That our people can afford theaters is evident from the fact that they frequently go to English language theaters downtown where they pay a dollar or more for their seats. Now we know in advance that this criticism would probably be answered by many of our downtown theatergoers with the remark that they at least saw something for their <span class="page-break">\2</span>money. Of course, there is a great deal of truth in that.</p>
   <p>But these people forget that such talent as is available to the theaters downtown is absolutely out of reach of our theaters. Also, downtown theaters are in much more favorable circumstances. A company playing downtown is backed by a producer with name and money. He hires the company to put on the play which he has purchased, and provides for a spectacular staging, something really attractive to the eye, something that will "draw" in itself. To secure such spectacular staging--especially where operettas are concerned--costs a great deal of money. He can afford this because the play is produced every day, sometimes twice a day throughout the season, and frequently through two seasons. Thus all he has invested in the decorations, costumes, furniture, etc., is soon returned from the receipts, and thereafter all it costs him is the rent, the wages of actors, the cost of the administrative and technical personnel, the orchestra, and advertising. These expenses can easily be met week after week, especially because at least three days a week, Wednesday, Saturdays, and Sundays, he sells many more <span class="page-break">\3</span>tickets than the other four days. But in many cases the more than average attendance is not necessary. A well-selected, reasonably bought, and properly produced play will show a profit for weeks and months even without sellouts three times a week. All it needs is a reasonably good average daily income.</p>
   <p>The conditions in Bohemian theaters are entirely different. Our public, with equally high demands as to quality, pays much less to see a Bohemian play than for an English one downtown. They would not pay the same price and would say that downtown theaters are much better, and offer much more for the admission price. Even if this is true such reasoning leaves the artistic value of the play out of consideration altogether, and, as a rule, the less artistic and literary value a play has, the more magnificent is its staging. Its deficiencies are covered up by "something for the eyes". That, however, costs more than our companies can afford to pay. Among the reasons for this is the fact that our theaters play only on Sundays. There are some thirty-two performances during the year. To find a play which will bear a number <span class="page-break">\4</span>of repetitions is a very rare occurence indeed. If there are repetitions at all they are very few. Let us be optimistic and say that there are three such plays which bear three performances in the season; there will be twenty-three Sundays left for other plays, so that the management must have twenty-six different plays prepared for the thirty-two Sundays. Therefore it would be quite unreasonable to expect that every one of these plays be staged and prepared with such meticulous care as are the plays in theaters downtown. They give one and the same play throughout the whole season, while a Bohemian theater puts on at least twenty different plays in the same period of time, and that costs considerable money.</p>
   <p>The scenery, the lighting effects, and the costumes are expensive. Our theaters frequently spend more on a play than they reasonably should. The rent costs money, so does the music, and the personnel, and there are additional expenses of which the average man has no conception. Knowing all this, the Bohemian theatergoing public should demand less. To demand and expect the same standard of everything in a Bohemian theater as in a theater downtown is both unreasonable and unjust.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>In English language theaters a large personnel is employed, many actors of whom each and everyone must be letter and movement perfect. The play in all its details must be a harmonious whole. That is, it is performed by a group of artists selected and trained for one particular play. Nothing of that kind should be expected in a Bohemian theater. In the first place, the group of performers in a Bohemian theater is not homogeneous. It is composed of both professional and amateur actors, some of whom--perhaps most of whom--are artists, but in each group there are, as a rule, some who are pseudo artists, and are included in the group of performers for the value of their names in the handbill, poster, or program. Among all these, actors and amateurs, artists and pseudo artists, there are both paid performers and those who play for nothing. These latter are the more expensive, because they feel that they are not subject to discipline, without which no decent theater performance can be given. As a rule, they do not find it necessary even to attend the rehearsals, because they feel that they know much more about the whole business than the stage manager, no matter how expert in his line he may be.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>All this must be kept in mind and never left out of consideration. The thing to do, therefore, is to be lenient, benevolent, and not unduly critical. But even so, our public can make requests which our theaters are able to fulfill, at least as far as the repertoire is concerned. The Bohemian theaters should never forget that they are, in the first place, Bohemian theaters, that is, theaters existing for the Bohemian people, and that it is their duty not only to amuse and entertain, but also to uplift, educate, and exert cultural influence. The duty of our theaters, and particularly Bohemian theaters in America, is to make our public acquainted with Bohemian dramatic literature of real value, which is, fortunately and happily, rather plentiful. It includes many classical and modern plays of various forms; it is rich in tragedies, outstanding dramas, beautiful comedies, and plays taken from life; it includes many excellent humorous plays and musical comedies. There is a lot, therefore, to select from. To cultivate this dramatic literature is the foremost duty of our theaters, because only by so doing will they fulfill their mission, the mission to educate. Their duty also includes the producing of modern plays and acquainting the public with the <span class="page-break">\7</span>latest dramatic writings. A theater managed so as to fulfill its duty toward the public would have a continuous attraction for the public, which would then get used to attending regularly, in spite of some of the natural and necessary shortcomings. Granting that the management has a certain amount of good will for our original Bohemian-American plays; the public would also become educated to them if the writing of such plays were encouraged by our theaters.</p>
   <p>Hence the improvement of the conditions in our theaters is not only a responsibility of the public; it is also a responsibility of the theaters themselves. By proceeding along these lines they would certainly meet with the desired success.</p>
