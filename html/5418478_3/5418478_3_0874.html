   <p>A concert given by the pupils of Miss Augusta Duchanek's Academy of Music last night was a complete success. It was held in the hall of the Czecho Slavonic Aid Society, Town of Lake branch, at 48th Street and Honore Avenue. The pupils' orchestra was conducted by Mr. J. V. Soukup. They and the soloists did their best, because they knew that the proceeds from the concert were to go for the benefit of our Czechoslovak volunteers.</p>
   <p>Ex-Alderman Felix B. Janovsky addressed the visitors. He explained the purpose of the concert and the importance of the Liberty bond campaign, urging the audience to respond wholeheartedly to the call of their country. The effect of his patriotic words revealed itself quickly. He was accompanied by several members of the Daughters of America, dressed as Red Cross nurses, who appealed to the visitors with the result that bonds for $2,250 were bought. Our countryman, Mr. Vaclav Rajfanda, then solicited in behalf of the sale of war-savings stamps. He himself subscribed for five hundred dollars' <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>worth.</p>
   <p>It may well be stated that the concert arranged by the Academy yesterday was an overwhelming success.</p>
