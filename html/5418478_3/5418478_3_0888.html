   <p>The Česká Ústřední Jednota Pĕvecká (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies) in a recent meeting decided to give a concert in the spring of this year which will be the biggest affair of this kind yet arranged. It is left to the members of the Union to weigh the importance of this resolution.</p>
   <p>The first rehearsal will take place after a short lull in activities. It is scheduled for Monday, January 21, 8 P. M. in the hall of Sokol Chicago. If the program is to be studied thoroughly, it is imperative that each singer appears right from the start. This will prevent rehearsals from being protracted and will promote smooth progress.</p>
   <p>It is incumbent upon you to prove on Monday the sincerity of your attitude</p>
