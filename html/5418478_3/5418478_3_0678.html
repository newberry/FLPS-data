   <p>The Bohemian Vaudeville theater begins its activity this week. This will also mark the third successful season of its existence, the third season promising to be still more successful than the preceding two. The stage and the building have been redecorated; the stock company is richer by ten more members, some of whom will become permanent fixtures. Among the ladies are: Mrs. Adamek-Trnka, Mrs. Radvanovsky, Mrs. Lhotsky, and Miss Metzl. The new men are: Messrs. Lhotsky (director), Weidner, Sulc, Hildebrandt, Sirmer, and Krivacek. All of these ladies and gentlemen are well-known by our Czech theatergoers, either as former members of the Homan Theater or as actors in the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Ludvik Dramatic Association) where they have played for many years.....In the [above] picture one may also recognize Mr. Louis Brecka who, thanks to his zeal and perseverance, was instrumental in <span class="page-break">2</span>founding this popular and well-liked theater. As an opening performance a one-act play will be staged. This is titled "Nebrouseny demant" (Unpolished Diamond) and contains songs and dances. Besides this number there will be other items on the program such as recitations and songs as well as a four-reel comedy film.....</p>
