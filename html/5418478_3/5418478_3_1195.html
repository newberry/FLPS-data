   <p>The dramatic and singing club, Antonin Dvorak, had great success with the play "Hospodar a Vymenkar" (Farmer and Trader), in the "Theatre California" last night. The place was sold out long before the beginning of the performance; every one of the 900 seats was occupied. The songs of the farm-hands, boys and girls, were acknowledged with hearty applause; the costumes were a feast for the eyes of the audience. The play itself was in the hands of seasoned amateurs who knew the atmosphere and the background for the action from experience and instinct.</p>
