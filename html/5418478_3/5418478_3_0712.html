   <p>Our theater-going people have a sort of prejudice against "local products," and if a new premiere is advertised, then they surely do not regard it as an event which should be given any special attention. This can easily be explained by taking into consideration the experience gained during the past several seasons.</p>
   <p>But those who looked upon the premiere of the Ludvikovci (Frantisek Ludvik Dramatic Association) last Sunday in the same way, and those who go to the theater to spend three hours of their time in laughter--they are the ones who should do penance for it by attending the next performance of the "Ztracena Varta" (Lost Outpost) which, we hope, will surely be given at the Sokol Chicago hall in the near future.</p>

   <p>The main purpose of his first attempt is to amuse the audience, to keep them in laughter during the whole evening, and in this he succeeded. He put into the three acts of this comedy probably as many laughs as are possible.....</p>
