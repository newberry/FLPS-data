   <p>The pupils of Prof. Prosinger recently gave a concert in the Natteson Bldg. which was very successful and for us Bohemians the more significant because of all the pupils the most outstanding performance was that of a young countryman of our Josef Vilim in his violin rendition of Ernests "Elegie."</p>
   <p>His playing showed such fine harmony, such wonderful skill that the audience was enraptured.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vilim is about 17 years old and a brother of the well-known Mrs. Bedlan.</p>
