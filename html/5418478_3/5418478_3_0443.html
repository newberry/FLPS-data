   <p>At Saturday's final rehearsal of Ponchielli's magnificent opera, "La Gioconda," by which Chicago grand opera will inaugurate this year's season, and in which the title role will be sung by the famous Bohemian artist, Emma Destinn, as guest, we had the privilege of learning from Mr. Ottokar Bartik, Miss Destinn's manager, a few things that will be of interest to our readers. We do not hesitate to present them to the Bohemian public because we are certain they will prove pleasant reading, and our people will be proud to know that with this great musical and theatrical institution of Chicago there are connected several of our countrymen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bartik has told us about a number of Bohemians who are members of the orchestra which, in part at least, will function under the baton of another <span class="page-break">2</span>countryman, Mr. Egon Pollak, born in Prague, and a graduate of the conservatory of music in that city. He told us that he is very happy to be again among his own people.....</p>
   <p>But nothing we heard surprised us so much as to learn that the leading dancer connected with the Opera is a young, very young, Bohemian lady who was born--right here, among us, in Bohemian Chicago. Later on we were introduced to her, and thus had the pleasure of meeting Miss Libuse Bartusek.....</p>
   <p>Of course, Miss Bartusek was kind enough to give us a brief interview during which we have become convinced that Bohemian Chicago may justly be proud of a lady of Miss Bartusek's achievements.....</p>
   <p>Miss Bartusek is eighteen years of age, a daughter of our esteemed countryman, Mr. Jan Bartusek of 1801 South Millard Avenue....who has given her a good and exemplary Bohemian education....part of which she received in Prague, where she spent a year or two with her parents.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Miss Bartusek's life as an artiste, though brief, has been most successful....She danced as prima ballerina in Bismarck Garden the past summer, and has organized a dancing group of her own....which performed most successfully in the Auditorium in Denver, Colorado.....</p>
   <p>She played one of the leading parts in the film "Victory of Virtue" produced by the United Photo Plays Company....and more recently performed here in Ziegfeld's Theatre.</p>
