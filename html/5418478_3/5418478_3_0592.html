   <p>Far be it from us to try to create the impression that we are an art publication or an official organ of some art society....but at the same time, we always pay strict attention to art wherever and whenever it is possible. When such an opportunity arises, we like to call our readers' attention to works of interest in the art world. This is especially true when it concerns our Czechoslovak or Bohemian-American art productions. We do it for this reason: We are convinced that by pointing out such events, we may also point to ways of attaining or deriving happiness from life and a desire to live such a life. We do it in cases of musical or any other branches of art, whether they be literary, creative, etc. We do it also because we believe that the prosaic task of making a living requires some respite so that man may gather new energies for his daily struggles. And such respite from <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>daily toil, according to our way of thinking, may be found only in the beauty and the warmth and the purity of art, no matter what branch of art it may be.</p>
   <p>When we are convinced that any of our artists have attained even a moderate amount of success, we always mention their names and will continue to do so, mainly because we are concerned not with our own interests, but with those of the Bohemian-Americans and Czechoslovaks. The joy which we experience when our countrymen meet with success is transmitted to those who read our reports. And it is only natural that in these reports we emphasize our own Bohemians, whether they live here or abroad. At the same time, we do not overlook the efforts of foreign artists and the wider domain of art of other countries.</p>
   <p>Guided by these principles, we consider it our duty to acquaint our readers and the entire Czechoslovak-American population of Chicago with the twenty-sixth <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>annual exhibition by Chicago artists which opened the day before yesterday in the Chicago Art Institute, and which will continue until March 5, 1922, so that our people may avail themselves of the opportunity to view some truly valuable art collections which are deposited in that institute and of which Chicago may justly be proud.....</p>
   <p>Among the art jurors there are two of our local countrymen--our well-known painter, Mr. Rudolf F. Ingerle.....and the sculptor, Mr. Albin Polasek......Since lack of space does not permit us to mention every work of art in this exhibit, we shall call attention to some truly artistic works of our excellent and extremely modest artist, Mr. Albin Polasek, who is the director of the school of sculpture associated with the Art Institute. Mr. Polasek is exhibiting a marble relief representing Miss P. B. Eckhart; also an allegorical piece in terra cotta which is a symbolic work called, "Man Hewing Out His Own Destiny". At this juncture we wish to call the attention of our readers to other works by Mr. Polasek which may be found in other wings of the Art Institute.....</p>

   <p>To enumerate all of the art productions [in the exhibit] would take up a great deal of space. [Translator's note: The editor of Denni Hlasatel reports in some detail and with unstinting praise the works of other American artists here and there, calling attention to some outstanding pieces.]</p>
   <p>We viewed with much pleasure and joy the works of our own countrymen, and we devoted more time to their evaluation. In some of them we recognized a high artistic development. We shall mention them alphabetically: The pieces exhibited by Mr. Josef Froula of 4336 West 22nd Street are "The Indiana Sand Dunes" and "Along the Brook". The wintry mood is well expressed in the latter work. The next contribution of our artistic countrymen is represented by our excellent artist, Rudolf F. Ingerle, of 6851 Ridgeland Avenue. His exhibit consists of five paintings: "Sunset and Sycamore," "A Dewy Morning in the Ozarks," "The Rays of the Setting Sun in the Ozark Mountains," "Moon Lacework," and "Indian Summer". The work of this artist is really worth <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>one's while to see and study. One will find in it many interesting details which, in their totality, make an exceedingly delicate impression; the elaboration itself proves the great ability of the master.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ignac W. Sahula of 1255 South Komensky Avenue, who has his studio in the Fine Arts Building, calls attention to himself by his originality,which is manifested both in the skill of his work and the color composition. The trend of his work is modern. His paintings, "White Eagle Tavern," "An Old Belfry," and "Town Square" are interesting.</p>
   <p>Our countryman, Antonin Sterba, who is a professor in the school of painting associated with the Art Institute, has two paintings on exhibit, and both of them are portraits. One of them represents "George," a Negro servant of his; the other is "A Portrait of an Old Man".</p>
   <p>Mr. T. Cestmir Svoboda is exhibiting only one painting, but it is truly a <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>beautiful one. It is called "Olga" and depicts a certain mood of the model who is, if we are not mistaken, the artist's own wife, seated before the piano. We believe that this is Mr. Svoboda's best work thus far, and he reveals himself as an artist of great promise. Mr. Svoboda's address, as given in the catalogue, is 2145 South Sawyer Avenue.</p>
   <p>The exhibited works of our local Bohemian artists are probably well known to the majority of their friends and votaries. With a few exceptions, all of their masterpieces were on display in the exhibition arranged by the Cesky Umelecky Klub V Chicagu (Bohemian Arts Club of Chicago) at the end of last year. They should be seen again, however, for this exhibition has much to offer to those who possess even a small understanding of serious art.....[Translator's note: The editor advises the readers to visit the Art Institute, gives a brief history of its foundation, mentions the days when the exhibit may be visited, and lists the days on which no admission is charged. He concludes by mentioning the various classes in which art instruction is given.]</p>
