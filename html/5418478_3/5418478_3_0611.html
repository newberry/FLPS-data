   <p>Otakar Valasek, Czech-American artist, has been holding the attention of the Chicago public since October of last year with his cartoons which are published in the Chicago Herald. He conceived the idea only recently of working in a broader sense for the cause of America and Czechoslovak lands as well. His efforts will be specially directed toward the movement for the liberation of our Czechoslovak motherland, which no one should forget, whether he was born in the old country or is only of Czechoslovak descent.</p>
   <p>Mr. Valasek's daily cartoons are characterized by a flow of new ideas, always pro-Ally, and particularly pro-American. Everyone of his cartoons reflects an irresistible longing to see the destruction of all Kaiserism, Prussian militarism, and with it serfdom under Austria; it expresses the craving for victory for the United States and all democratic states which, up to the present time, <span class="page-break">\2</span>have groaned under the yoke of bureaucratic absolutist and tyrannical monarchism.</p>
   <p>In all of his cartoons, Valasek has proved himself to be an enthusiastic admirer of the Allies and a genuine American patriot. He is at the same time a Slav through and through, who has a true understanding for the suffering of the whole Slav race. He would like these peoples liberated from all influences which obstruct their future development and progress towards ultimate self-determination, liberty, and the exercising of free will. It is, therefore, only natural that he is concerned first about the fate of the people from which he came--the Czech people--and about the future existence of that unforgettable, infinitely beloved old motherland of ours.....</p>
   <p>Consequently, Mr. Valasek would like to do something in particular for the old homeland which he has never ceased to adore. He intends to perform a service for her which will put forth, especially before foreign peoples, the cause of his people--the inalienable right of the Czech nation to govern its own life <span class="page-break">\3</span>and liberty when this war comes to an end.</p>
   <p>With the aid of Czechs and other Slavs, he intends to bring to the attention of foreign lands the contention that after all the misery endured by our people, its fate cannot be a matter of indifference to the Allied nations. The future of other Slavs will also have to be considered. When the time for peace negotiations arrives, the Allied nations will act in a human and just way if they give the Czech nation what rightfully belongs to her--liberty and the right of self-determination.</p>
   <p>The renowned Belgian cartoonist, Louis Raemaeker, has rendered a great service to his country in foreign lands, especially in the United States. Valasek plans to do something along the same line for Czech lands--his and our old motherland.</p>
   <p>Valasek has started to work on a series of cartoons which will be published in Czech-American papers first, in order that they may gradually become known to the public and then find their way into the foreign language press, particularly <span class="page-break">\4</span>the American. The latter cannot help but take notice of the drawings depicting the sufferings of the Slavs and primarily the Czechs in Austria-Hungary, where they form a tremendous majority behind which there stand, and will stand, millions of other Slavs in America.</p>
   <p>We rejoice over the enterprise into which Mr. Valasek has ventured with such enthusiasm. We have already had an opportunity to see some of the cartoons and found them brimming with brilliant ideas.</p>
   <p>We would feel gratified if some of our representative patriotic bodies gave the undertaking their support, as for instance, the Czech National Alliance co-operating with the National Alliance of Czech Catholics and the Slovak League--all three of which are American institutions.</p>
