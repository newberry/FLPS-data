   <p>The exposition of the Český Umelĕcký Klub v Chicagu (Bohemian Arts Club of Chicago) was opened last night at the First Czechoslovakian Bazaar and Exposition held in the Pilsen Park pavilion. The evening was set aside for our Bohemian artists and for our Czechoslovakian businessmen of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The section reserved for the Bohemian Arts Club of Chicago Exposition had been transformed through the efforts of our architects into a dignified pavilion of the Muses. Every visitor entering this section is surprised not only by its magnificence, but also by its artistic arrangement. To describe all the individual works exhibited by our painters, sculptors, and architects would take too much time; but we do want to mention the fact that our foremost artists are exhibiting their best works of art. The judges had not accepted a single poor piece of work, and therefore <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>all the eighty-four paintings, drawings, and statues bear evidence of real art which passed the test of severe criticism.</p>
   <p>We list a few of the artists who are participating in this exposition: Mr. Joseph Behenský is exhibiting three paintings and four drawings, all of them true works of art, of which Ríjen (October) and the Severní Rameno Chicagské Reky (North Branch of the Chicago River) awaken the interest of every visitor. Mr. Joseph Froula is exhibiting nine paintings the majority of them being landscapes. Mr. Rudolph F. Ingerle exhibits nineteen magnificent works by which his art and his deep understanding of nature are remarkably portrayed, especially in his exquisite painting, the "Mĕsíční Svit" (Moonlight), which we have admired so much during the past winter at the Chicago Art Institute. Also on exhibit is his"Stříbrne Svítání" (Silver Dawn) which astonished the judges and which we consider one of the best embellishments of this beautiful exposition. <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Also very effective are Mr. R. F. Ingerle's paintings, the "Východ Mĕsíce v Ozarských Horách" (Moonrise in the Ozark Mountains), "Bouře" (Storm), and "Rozbresk Dne" (Daybreak).</p>
   <p>Mr. Albín Polášek, director of the Chicago Art Institute's sculpture school, is exhibiting ten of his works, among them his great and magnificent statue the "Rozsĕvač" (Sower). This masterpiece, loaned by the Chicago Art Institute, dominates the entire exposition as a work of which the Czechoslovak people may be proud. He also exhibits two of his masterpieces, a bust of Mr. William Kašpar and a bust of Mr. W. M. Chase; also a model of "Človĕk Jest Tvurcem Svého Osudu" (Man Is Master of His Own Fate).</p>
   <p>Mr. Čestmír Svoboda is exhibiting his valuable works by which he proves that he is a master of landscape and portrait arts. His portrait of President Thomas G. Masaryk is a true and expressive work of art and should <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>be used as an original for hundreds of thousands of reproductions, because true artistic portraits of President Masaryk are very scarce. Altogether Mr. Svoboda exhibits seventeen of his works.</p>
   <p>Another professor of the Chicago Art Institute who is exhibiting his works of art is Mr. Anton Štĕrba, who specializes primarily in portrait work. The portraits of his own father and mother, well known to many of our countrymen, are very significant. His portrait of Mr. Jaroslav Salaba Vojan will arouse the interest of every visitor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Tománek enriched the exposition by his work, "Dívka v Národním Kroji" (A Girl in National Costume), which aroused the enthusiastic admiration of the visitors.</p>
   <p>Our architects who exhibit their sketches and plans are the following:</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Mr. K. S. Kálal, city architect; Mr. Mrázek, Mr. Randák, and Mr. James B. Dibelka, who exhibits plans of a great new hotel which will be erected by him on the North Side of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The judges of the exhibited works of art were artists of other nationalities who are well known all over the United States. There is no doubt about their competence and impartiality. The following men were selected: Mr. Arvid Nyholm, Mr. Frank V. Dudley, Mr. Carl A. Buehr, Mr. E. Zettler, sculptor; and Mr. E. Reed Jr., architect.</p>
   <p>Prizes were awarded as follows: Landscape painting: Mr. Rudolph F. Ingerle was awarded the first prize for his painting the "Stříbrné Svítání"; portrait painting: Mr. Anton Stĕrba was awarded the first prize for his portrait "Muj Otec" (My Father); sculpture: Mr. Albín Polášek was awarded the first prize for his statue the "Rozsévač".</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Architectural plans and sketches: Mr. K. V. Kalal was awarded the first prize for his sketch the "Nádvoř Kolleje v River Forest" (Campus of the River Forest College).</p>
   <p>Those artists who were awarded the first prizes will be given beautiful medallions.</p>
   <p>Today and tomorrow only, our people will have an opportunity to see this exposition of arts, and therefore whoever has any understanding of the arts should not miss this rare opportunity! Especially those of our countrymen who can afford to decorate their homes with beautiful artistic originals should not miss this opportunity to obtain one of these works of our renowned artists at a really low price.</p>
