   <p>Our art-loving people, who are quite often censured for indifference in supporting our great artistic projects, made it apparent yesterday afternoon that such accusations are not always just. There were so many anxious people who came to see the excellently advertised American premiere of Bedrich Smetana's great work, "Hubicka" (The Kiss), that the spacious auditorium of the Blackstone Theater, was filled to capacity. Everybody was anxious to see the premiere of the opera which, besides the "Prodana Nevesta" (Bartered Bride), occupies the foremost place among the Bohemian operatic compositions. We speak only the truth when we say that the efforts made by the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana (Bedrich Smetana Singing Society of Chicago) to present this jewel of Bedrich Smetana's works in the best possible way, has met with great success. The soloists, without exception were great. Mr. Milo Luka, in the role of "Paloucky," the father, with his rich baritone <span class="page-break">\2</span>voice fascinated the audience, and our local tenor, Mr. Arno M. Hess, as "Lukas," although somehow indisposed in the first act, finished his role in a splendid manner. The charming appearance of Miss Libuse Zdenek, who sang the role of "Barca," and her beautiful soprano voice greatly contributed to the successful and smooth running of the entire performance. The chorus, mostly composed of the members of the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana, also did well, thanks to its conductor, Mr. Stepan A. Ernst, under whose direction the opera was rehearsed and who performed his task in a really remarkable way.</p>
   <p>Honorable mention also should be given to Mr. Antonin Vaverka, who proved himself to be an excellent stage manager.</p>
   <p>The Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana, with its success of yesterday, added another laurel to those already achieved. Besides the "Prodana Nevesta" and "V Studni" (In the Well), another jewel, "Hubicka"! What a trio of honorable and encouraging operatic works!</p>
