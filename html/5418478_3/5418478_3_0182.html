   <p>In spite of the bad, cool weather prevailing yesterday, a considerable number of people attended the outing which the active "Obchodnici Ze 26. Ulice" [26th Street Businessmen] held in Pilsen Park.....</p>
   <p>The association of our businessmen of 26th Street is developing most useful activities, and shows a great deal of energy when it is a question of seeing something done that would be of benefit to our great business street.....</p>
   <p>Our businessmen act according to the slogan "Svuj K Svemu" [Everyone to one's kind], but a free and better translation would be "let us work, pull, live together," and they are getting the best results.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's outing made the contacts between our public and the businessmen of 26th Street still more friendly and intimate.</p>
