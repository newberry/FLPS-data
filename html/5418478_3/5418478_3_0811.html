   <p>The Ceske Divadlo (Bohemian Theater Association) presented the play "Past Na Muze" (Man Trap) in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs yesterday. To our knowledge, it is the first time this play has been presented in Chicago, and therefore it is somewhat of a novelty. It is one of the gay, naughty French comedies, full of comical, piquant scenes, whose plot revolves around matrimonial infidelity. Its authors are Hennequin and Duval.</p>
   <p>.....The Ceske Divadlo presented it in an excellent manner, both the ladies.....and men of the group having shown perhaps even a better understanding and mastery of their parts than is usually the case.....</p>
   <p>The attendance was just fair, not nearly as large as the efforts of the management of the Ceske Divadlo deserve.... Next Sunday, a musical comedy entitled "Divka Pro Vsecko" (A Maid for Everything) will be on the bill.</p>
