   <p>The Chicago Artists Society, composed of painters and sculptors, gained the recognition of Chicago Czechoslovaks, in connection with the annual exposition of painters and sculptors from Chicago and vicinity, which was held in the Chicago Art Institute. They arranged a "Czecho-Slavonic artistic entertainment" which was attended by members and invited guests. The entertainment was held in the club rooms of the Chicago Art Institute, apparently for the reason that some of our Czech-American artists participated in the Art Institute exhibition with some of their remarkable works. About the exhibition and about the Czech artists who participated, we referred some time ago. Today, we shall write only about the program, and we gladly do it because it is in the interest of Czech-American Art, thus in the interest of the uppermost good cause.</p>
   <p>Our countryman, Antonín Šterba, who was a member of the arrangement committee, and also in charge of the musical program, met with success in the discharge of his duties. The Český Dělnický Pěvecký Sbor (Bohemian Workmen's Singing Society), under the direction of Mr. Joseph Houdek, who also is a member of the Chicago Symphonic Orchestra, co-operated and sang the American national hymn, also the Czechoslovak hymn. Then followed a number of our Czechoslovak folk songs. The individual numbers stirred the audience, and were so loudly applauded that the singers were forced to add a few more numbers. Following these numbers on the program was the Dvořakovo Trio, (Dvorak's Trio) played by Messrs. Edward Freund, Louis Černušak and Rudolph Fiala. The duet from the "Prodaná Nevěsta" (Bartered Bride) was sung by Mrs. Louis Topinka and Mr. Joseph Hurt, with the piano accompaniment of Miss Xenie Weicher, which was applauded heartily. A beautiful number on the program was the poem "Legendy" by Mrs. Mabel Štěrba, wife of Mr. Antonín Štěrba, who comprehensively touched upon the Czechoslovakian arts, and who presented it successfully.</p>
   <p>The entertainment was really nice and lively, and aided remarkably in acquainting other nationalities with Czechoslovak vocal and musical arts with which they seemed to be enthused.</p>
