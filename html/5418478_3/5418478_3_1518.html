   <p>Thousands and thousands of people filled 26th Street last night; it was impossible to use the sidewalk and everybody was happy over the excellent success of the Carnival.....</p>
   <p>All Bohemian California, large parts of New Tabor (Marigold), Pilsen, Morton Park, Cicero, and other Bohemian communities had dates on 26th Street in order to participate in the celebration arranged by the Association of 26th Street Businessmen.</p>
   <p>Everybody was amazed when the gigantic parade, splendidly arranged, went by. Close to three hundred vehicles, automobiles, both personal and trucks, and alegorical floats, all richly decorated, made up the parade.....</p>
   <p>Particularly beautiful was the float entered by the Pilsen Brewing Company, depicting the "Old Times", and also a number of floats of the Bohemian Dairy Company; but every other decorated vehicle was also deserving of special <span class="page-break">2</span>mention.....</p>
   <p>Today, the Carnival celebrates "Sokol Day"........</p>
