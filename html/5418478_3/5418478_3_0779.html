   <p>What we are learning about the preparations for the coming theatrical season indicates that there will be important changes. It has just come to our notice that the Ludvikova Divadelni Spolecnost (Frantisek Ludvik's Bohemian Dramatic Society of Chicago), the first permanent Bohemian theater in Chicago, has rented the hall of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on South Lawndale Avenue, where it will play every Sunday for forty weeks. The performances of the Ludvikova Divadelni Spolecnost in the Thalia Hall will be continued as in previous years. In order that the Spolecnost may be in a position to play simultaneously in both places, a considerable enlarge	ment of the personnel will be necessary. The respective negotiations with many professional and amateur actors in and out of Chicago have been going on for some time. Because of the existing conditions in Europe it will be impossible to engage actors from Bohemia for the coming season.</p>
   <p>The present troupe of the Ludvikova Divadelni Spolecnost will probably remain very much as it is, being divided between the two theaters and supplemented by <span class="page-break">2</span>newly hired forces. It has been said that there would be important changes in the existing personnel of the Spolecnost, and that some of its members would accept contracts from the second Bohemian theater. But these are no doubt only rumors, because none of them has been confirmed as yet.</p>
