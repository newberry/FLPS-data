   <p>The first theatrical entertainment to be given by "Sokol Cechie" (Bohemian Gymnasts) proved to be successful as was expected. The entire program was excellently given, if one takes into consideration, that this was the Sokol's first such effort. The comedy of itself was enough to keep the public satisfied.</p>
   <p>With this fine beginning, enthusiasm for the "Sokol Cechie" among the public will no doubt be multiplied many fold.</p>
