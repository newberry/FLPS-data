   <p>Stockholders of the Kaspar State Bank, the oldest Bohemian financial institution in Chicago, have decided to increase the capital of their bank from $200,000 to $400,000. The new stock is to be taken up by the present stockholders, proportionately to the number of shares they now own. Each share is priced at $125, and the bank will have a surplus of $100,000 after the new capital is paid in. The bank at present is paying a five per cent dividend semi-annually, and it is said that this rate will be continued even at the increased capitalization. The increase in capital stock will become effective on July 1.</p>
   <p>The Kaspar State Bank has made a grand success of its business in recent years. On April 1, 1905, Mr. Kaspar's private bank became a State Bank, it had a capital of $200,000, and deposits of $1,146,000. At the time of the last examination of the books of State Banks, which was on June 8, the deposits of the Kaspar State Bank amounted to $4,079,000. These figures are a convincing proof that this well managed financial institution rests upon a firm foundation, and that it is assured of a continued fine future.</p>
