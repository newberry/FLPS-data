   <p>The Concert given yesterday in "Tel. Jed. Sokol" (Gymnastic Society Sokol) Hall was a brilliant success, though it was worthy of a larger audience. It probably is the hard times we are having that causes the small attendance we have had the past year.</p>
   <p>The concert opened with a girl Trio singing "Dobrou Noe" (Goodnight.) Later there were two more trios composed of the Misses Bernhard, Miller, Vrbieka, Kolar, Zajicek and Dusek. Mr. Rajndl rendered two national songs.</p>
   <p>During the repetition of this comedy the entire audience was in a constant uproar so that even the actors who took the animal parts were overcome with laughter. Mr. Pitt, Piskacek, Zajicek and Stastenka played the animal quartet.</p>
   <p>We are hopeful that we shall have the pleasure of again hearing the fine voice of Mr. Rajndl while he is in Chicago.</p>
