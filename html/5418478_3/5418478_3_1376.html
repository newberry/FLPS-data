   <p>Many people came to the Harrison High School yesterday afternoon to witness the joint production of Bohemian free thought school pupils. The school year is almost completed, and our children introduced themselves to our people not only to call attention to the activities and tireless efforts of their teachers, but principally to illustrate the importance of Bohemian free thought schools and the necessity for general aid which should be given by the Bohemian freethinking people. A countless number of times attention has been called to the significance of our schools today, when there is no immigration to strengthen our national activities and when the schools must be recognized as one of the most important factors of our future.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's May festival should encourage interest in our schools, and it is hoped that this purpose will be fully attained. The program was opened by an excellent singer, Miss H. Weiner, who sang the American national anthem, "Star-Spangled Banner," and then "Kde domov muj?" (Where Is My Home?).</p>

   <p>This was followed by an enthusiastic prologue by Miss Vlasta Vavra. The school children's first number on the program was a beautiful fairy tale "Vrisi Jara" (From the Realm of Youth), successfully presented by the pupils of the Vojta Naprstek and the Town of Lake schools.....Our people were provided with wonderful entertainment and enjoyed the progress of our school children.</p>
