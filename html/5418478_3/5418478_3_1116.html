   <p>The Amateur Actors, members of Sokol Havlicek Tyrs, are constantly widening the circle of their friends and patrons and continuing their patriotic and benevolent activities with the same zeal and conscientiousness that characterizes every one of their theatrical performances. They devote their time to and bend their efforts toward the good cause, selecting successful plays and doing their best with increasing enthusiasm. They are becoming aware of the fact that their endeavor is slowly but surely gaining recognition among our people. The proceeds from their performances are always turned over for some humanitarian or patriotic purpose. At one time it may be the soldiers in the United States Army, at another our boys in the recently created Czechoslovak Army, who benefit by the Amateur Actors' activities.</p>
   <p>They are wholeheartedly supported by the Vcelky (Bees), a women's auxiliary recruited from members of the Czech National Alliance. These patriotic women <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>hold sewing parties at which socks, underwear, sweaters, and other useful and much-needed articles are made for Czech soldiers who have enlisted for service in the Allied armies.</p>
   <p>The latest performance by the Amateur Actors was given for the support of the activities of the Bees. A comedy by F. Hlavaty, "Mestska Rada Na Namluvach" (The City Council Goes A-Wooing), was given last night in the auditorium. This play gave ample opportunity to the actors to portray the various characters and to keep the crowd in a hilarious mood throughout the evening.</p>
   <p>The play deals with the mayor and aldermen of a small town who went out "for a good time". Their efforts in this direction were, however, thwarted in many ways, so that they were finally glad to be at home again. Mrs. A. Cervenka in the role of a singer and Mrs. S. Krejci as a student were especially good. Mr. Krejci managed the stage production and Mr. Zelina conducted the music.</p>
