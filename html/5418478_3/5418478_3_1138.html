   <p>It was a great occasion for Mr. Klapka, popular comedian of the "Ludvi Kovci"(Ludvik Theatrical Company), an evening of triumphal success, when Samberk's comedy "Rodinna Vojna" (Family Squabble) was presented. Mr. Klapka, as a comic and a couplet singer, takes the first place on our foremost scene. He again demonstrated this last night in a comedy, sparkling with sterling Samberkian humor, in the portrayal of the everyday life of our people. His role was that of the lackey and as such he kept the audience in a chronic state of tittering, interrupted by outbursts of riotous laughter. His playing is characterized by unusual vivacity combined with genuine artistic ambition.</p>
   <p>The total effect of the performance was excellent, and it was enhanced by the splendid rendering of the music by the orchestra under the direction of Professor Capek.</p>
