   <p>In a special meeting held on December 7, 1921, the stockholders of the Twenty-sixth Street State Bank, located at 26th Street and Springfield Avenue, voted unanimously to increase the Capital from $100,000 to $200,000, and to increase the Surplus from $20,000 to $30,000. The necessary shares of stock were immediately subscribed to by the former stockholders. During the first year of its activities, this bank paid out 6 per cent to its stockholders; in the second year of its life, another 6 per cent dividend was paid, 5 per cent having been added to the surplus, so that the earnings of the stockholders amounted to a full 11 per cent. This year the bank will again pay a 6 per cent dividend and an extra 8 per cent from its surplus. Consequently, the total net earnings of 14 per cent will be paid out. This fact, considering the short period of existence of this bank, is very significant indeed.</p>
