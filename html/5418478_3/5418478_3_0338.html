   <p>Sometime ago we published a report about an invention of a one time St. Paul resident, Mr. Gustav Pozdeny, who at present lives on South Lincoln Street in Chicago. It is a device, which enables one to move, to breath, and to see in any thick smoke or in sewer filled with destructive gases. Today we were informed that Mr. Pozdeny was offered $10,000 for his patent and yesterday afternoon a demonstration was held at 514 South Lincoln Street, where the device proved itself to be very satisfactory.</p>
