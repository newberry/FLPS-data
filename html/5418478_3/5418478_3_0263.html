   <p>Right now is the time when building activities are starting up. Those who do not have a building site yet, are offered a wonderful opportunity to buy lots in a section that is advantageously located near rapid street car transportation, close to a boulevard, and what is most important to be considered in building, the lots are wide. This advantageous subdivision has just been opened by Mr. Karel V. Janovsky, for many years a real estate dealer and notary public, with an office at 1619 West 47th Street. The lots are 30 X 125 feet, and sell from $225 up, on easy payments. The subdivision lies along Western Avenue, Campbell Avenue, 47th Place and 48th Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. K. V. Janovsky also conducts a business in fire insurance, property loans, and notary public matters, and has made many friends during his twenty years' activity.</p>
