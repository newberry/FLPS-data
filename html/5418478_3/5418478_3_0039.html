   <p>With the passing of Mr. William Kaspar, on November 2, 1922, the Czechoslovaks of Chicago lost not only one of their oldest settlers, a typical self-made man, a pioneer of our now well-developed banking system, but, as appeared after his death, also a man possessing a kind heart. By his energy and business acumen Mr. Kaspar was able, during the many years of his activity here, to amass considerable wealth; yet he never forgot that once he was a poor man himself as is sufficiently borne out by acts of charity at the close of his fruitful life. Shortly before his death he expressed a wish that out of his estate, $25,000 be given to charity, entrusting to his children the task of dividing that amount among the various charitable institutions. Mr. Kaspar's wish was respected of course, and below is a list of charitable institutions which benefited by his generous bequest:</p>

   <p>No human hand could erect in granite or marble a better monument than was fashioned by the generous hand of the late Mr. Kaspar himself. His memory <span class="page-break">4</span>will remain vivid even after many years.</p>
   <p>His last will was probated yesterday. From it, it was made clear that he left his widow, Mrs. Pavlina Kaspar, $250,000 and a beautiful residence on West Washington Boulevard. The shares of stock which he owned in both of the banking institutions of which he was the founder; namely, the Kaspar State Bank at Blue Island Avenue and West 19th Street, and the First National Bank on West 22nd Street, Cicero, Illinois, will go to his four children, to wit: The sons, Otto and Eugene W. Kaspar, and the daughters, Mrs. Belle Peschel and Mrs. Mae F. Wiese. The administrator of his estate is the Kaspar State Bank.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Otto Kaspar will continue as president of both above-named financial institutions. He was unanimously elected to this office at the regular board of directors meeting. It is fully expected that Mr. Otto Kaspar will manage the affairs of both these banks with the same energy and <span class="page-break">5</span>business talent which characterized his....father.</p>
   <p>Finally, it is announced that the bequests made by Mr. W. Kaspar will be paid out before Christmas.</p>
