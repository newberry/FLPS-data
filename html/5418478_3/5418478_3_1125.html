   <p>There was a performance by old-time amateurs given under the auspices of the Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slavonic Aid Society) in their hall at 18th and May Streets. "Trebizonda on the Third Floor," a three-act burlesque translated by J. Kuchal from the French original, was given under the direction of Mr. H. Farsky. Stage management was under the supervision of K. Kopecky, and the music was furnished under the direction of J. V. Soukup. The price of admission ranged from twenty-five cents to fifty cents. It was the first performance of this work on our Czech stage, and the evening was a pronounced success. New stage decorations were supplied by Mr. Farsky, who proved to be a skillful painter and an artist of taste.</p>
