   <p>The ladies of the Pilsen Brewing Company, who have had a lion's share in the work done for the bazaar of the Czech National Association, have sent in their report about their activities during the festival; it is obvious from the pages that the amount of work performed by them exceeded all expectations. The tearoom showed a gross return of $1,253, of which a fortune teller Mrs. Riedl, and Mrs. Ruzicka with her daughter, brought in a material part; a ladies' hat donated by Mrs. John A. Cervenka yielded $17. Candy was sold in large quantities. The money thus collected was clear profit, as the ladies had resolved to bear all expenses.</p>
   <p>The admission fee to the tearoom was collected by officers of the National Association. Many business concerns had contributed to the supplies sold in the booths and on the stands. The tearoom was also a recipient of many gifts by dealers. The report contains a list of donors. It is signed by Mrs. Antonia (John A.) Cervenka, president, and Pavla Cifkova, secretary of the association of the ladies of the Pilsen Brewing Company.</p>
