   <p>The Chicago Czech theatrical group founded by Frantisek Ludvik, who had been its director up to the time of his death, is leaving for a tour of the State of Nebraska. "The Dollar Princess", "Maria, the Daughter of the Regiment" and other plays will be presented there. This is the first time in twenty-five years that the troupe will return to Nebraska to revisit the scenes of its former triumphs. The troupe will be augmented by a number of new members, trained singers who will appear in the light operas of the repertoire.</p>
