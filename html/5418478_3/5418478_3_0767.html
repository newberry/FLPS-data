   <p>Mohen's thrilling drama was played yesterday evening at Chicago Sokol Hall by the actors' guild, the proceeds going to the Ceske Narodni Zdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance), and therefore for a very worthy cause.</p>
   <p>The play "Janosik" [a Slovak national hero] was well chosen because of its historical substance. The play shows a tragic period of the Slovak fight for independence.</p>
   <p>There is quite an analogy between Mohen's drama and Jirasek's "Psohlavci" (Dogsheads).</p>
   <p>Mohen has been able to capture in this play the outstanding, poignant feeling of a great Slovak martyr--a daredevil with warm blood in his veins and with an undying aversion to wrong written on his bold expressive face.</p>

   <p>The popular actor Josef Krejci played the title role and made a very pleasing appearance, although it is well known that character parts suit him better than the heroic.</p>
   <p>Mr. Krejci in this play welcomed the chance to show his histrionic abilities in the depiction of the brusque, strong figure of "Janosik," whose heroic character stands out boldly from the framework of the play.</p>
   <p>The other roles seem somewhat unimportant in comparison with "Janosik," but nevertheless they are significant enough to form a finished picture of the interesting proceedings of the whole play.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ladislav Dvorak played the part of Ilcik well. Mr. Weidner played the part of the landowner "Sandor Lipavsky" as artistically as he does every role intrusted to him. To Mr. Sultz was assigned the part of the father of "Janosik," which he played very ably, as he always does.</p>

   <p>Among the other players we must mention Mr. Zima, who played "Vlcek."</p>
   <p>Mr. Suva played the role of "Michacik," a very original figure, and Messrs. Studeny and Kocan appeared as "Krajnoha" and "Harala". Mrs. Krejci made a very good impression as the young Slovak Putnok; of the other players we must mention, Messrs. Boucek and Huml.</p>
   <p>In the difficult part of "Hanca," our popular amateur actress Mrs. Cervenka played like a professional, and all those who know her are aware of the heights to which she can rise in her portrayal [of character].</p>
   <p>The second longest feminine role was played by Mrs. Stoces as "Blazkova".</p>
   <p>The Slovak national dance "Odzemek" was well received; it was danced by two young men, members of the Slovensky Sokol. The Chicago Sokol Drum and Bugle Corps also took part in the play. Mr. Krejci deserves credit for his [skillful] directing.</p>
