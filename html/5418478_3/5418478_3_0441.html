   <p>[Translator's note: Victor Kolar lived in Chicago before he became known as a great orchestra leader.]</p>
   <p>The Musical America prints an interview from the pen of Laszla Swartz, who writes of Victor Kolar, the concertmaster and assistant director of Walter Damrosch's orchestra in New York, as a talented musician who is entering upon a very brilliant career.</p>
   <p>Victor Kolar came to the United States about ten years ago, a poor unknown immigrant, and by diligence and perseverance rose to the heights he now enjoys.</p>
   
   <p>He is so imbued with American traditions that, from them he has drawn inspiration for such compositions as "Hiawatha," "Fairy Tales," and "Americana".</p>
   <p>He is a very modest artist who loves our American institutions, and who a number of times said that the greatest success that can befall an artist is the day when he realizes how little he knows.</p>
   <p>He is now composing his "First Symphony," and has chosen melodies from the Hussite period for his two principal themes.</p>
   <p>This symphony when finished will be played by the New York Symphony Orchestra, under his direction.</p>
