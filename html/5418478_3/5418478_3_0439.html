   <p>Yesterday afternoon we attended a concert given by Mr. Prcal's music school. The audience which attended in large numbers was agreeably surprised at the mature performance of all these students of music.</p>
   <p>All the performers were Mr. Prcal's pupils, and they certainly deserve credit for their fine playing. They are a credit to their teacher.</p>
   <p>Every number played was a confirmation of the good reputation of Mr. Prcal's school. There was playing in concert by the pupils; there were also many soloists.</p>
   <p>We also had the pleasure of listening to two professional musicians not members of Mr. Prcal's class; they were Mr. Justin, a trombonist, and Mr. Zima, a pianist, who played Lack's waltz for the piano. Both artists were excellent and were applauded. The teacher played two piano compositions technically very difficult.</p>

   <p>The pupils of Mr. Prcal's School of Music received a chance to be heard publicly, and the large audience received a musical treat. Taken all together, this concert will long be remembered both by the pupils and by the audience. Applause without stint was given to the young musicians.</p>

Zbetovsky, Jan Cerny, Emil Andrlik, Karel Topinka, Milton Reuter, Bertram Zbetovsky, Josef Chroust, N.
