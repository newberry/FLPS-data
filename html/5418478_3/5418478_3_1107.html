   <p>Last Sunday the weather was not favorable for the theater in general, particularly in places where transportation is poor. In Cicero, also, many had to relinquish the pleasure prepared for them by the amateur actors of the Sokol Karel Jonas. The attendance was smaller than usual, but we hope that the public will be able to do better at the next performance.</p>
   <p>"Jina Krev" (Different Blood), a picture from life, was on the repertoire. Its milieu is the life of a factory hand. Its value as a drama is not high, but there are several effective scenes and passages that made an obvious impression.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jos. Mikulas, a very popular amateur, played the part of the workingman "Hora". The workingman's daughter, "Mary," was portrayed by Mrs. Radvan; and Mr. Hildebrandt, director of the theatrical group, appeared in the role of "Karel Simek," a youthful workman. Mr. Cerny's band supplied the music.</p>
