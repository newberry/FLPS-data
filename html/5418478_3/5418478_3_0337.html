   <p>The Bank of Anthony Kozet, 532 W. 18th Street, yesterday stopped payment and was closed by the sheriff. It has been placed under the directorship of the Security Title &amp; Trust Company.</p>
   <p>The crash was entirely unexpected and created much alarm among depositors, who have had unlimited confidence in Kozet's financial abilities. With small exceptions all depositors are Bohemians. The news spread rapidly and wounded the feelings of the masses who had the savings of their hard-labor deposited with Kozet.</p>
   <p>The accountants of the Security Title &amp; Trust Company stated, but non-officially, that the total assets of the bank are $100,000 and the liabilities about the same amount. More details were not available.</p>
