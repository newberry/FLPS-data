   <p>The Chicago Czech Artists' Club will be represented at an exhibition of samples of Czech art and culture which is going to be held under the auspices of the Czech National Alliance upon the premises of the University of Chicago, beginning next Tuesday. The exhibition of works of graphic art, paintings, etchings, and sculptures will be open for three days with no admission charge.</p>
   <p>Because of the war, it will be possible to show only what is available here. One hundred of the exhibits are being loaned by Dr. J. S. Vojan, president of the Artists' Club; others by Dr. L. Fisher, Vojta Benes, Joseph Tvrzicky, Karela, Svoboda, Froula, and the firm O'Brien. There will be one hundred and forty-four objects of art in all. Though this number represents only a small fraction of Czech art, the bulk being across the ocean and not available, it will nevertheless serve to enlighten the American public about Czech plastic art, of which it has heard and seen woefully little up to the present.</p>
