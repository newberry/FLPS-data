   <p>Czech Chicago can boast of many businessmen who have worked themselves up from a small business and have made remarkable progress because of their acumen and pertinacity. Of this group Mr. Gustav Klima is one of the bestknown and most popular men in our community.</p>
   <p>He was born in Strasice, near Prague, in 1868. After his public school work he enrolled in the Industrial School in Plzen (Pilsen), Bohemia, where he obtained a good technical education. He came to America when he was twenty-one years of age, settled in Chicago, and began to work as a mechanic. He later became a businessman and opened a shop on 22nd Street and Washtenaw Avenue. In 1899 he married Miss Bozena Jankovska, by whom he has several children.</p>

   <p>He founded the Bohemian Plate Glass Insurance Association sixteen years ago, a concern which has been enjoying the confidence of the Czech public in full measure. He also became active in the real-estate business and sold property in the neighborhood of Riverside Drive, 22nd Street and Oak Park Avenue. He transformed this section into a regular residential district for his Czech fellow countrymen. He is a member of many Czech Chicago associations, and now lives at 6743 Riverside Drive, Berwyn. His office is located at 1412 West 19th Street.</p>
