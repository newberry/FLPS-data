   <p>The auditorium of Sokol Chicago was reserved for the many friends of the Odd Fellows Lodge Prague No. 231 who filled the hall yesterday. "Krejčí Lékařem" (The Tailor in the Role of Physician), a burlesque in four acts by Kaiser, was presented as a novelty for our public. It bristles with humor and forces a smile upon the face of even an inveterate sorehead. The acting was almost always excellent. Mr. J. A. Hospodsky played the part of the tailor and also directed the stage.</p>
