   <p>P.1--We are observing with interest and pride the progress of our Bohumir Kryl on his road to fame. We say "our Kryl" because he always was one of ours and always proudly proclaims his allegiance.</p>
   <p>We have reported on the successes of B. Kryl's art some time ago mentioning the artist's determination to form a band of his own. In doing so Kryl strove to become independent of engagements in other bands whose reputation he enhanced by his own art.</p>
   <p>For his own band he has engaged first class artists and so his concerts enjoy the greatest popularity not only with the music loving public but with the professional musicians as well.</p>

   <p>Kryl is building up a reputation as a conductor as high as he has been enjoying as soloist on the cornet. The critics of the English-American papers write enthusiastic articles about him. The Louisville Herald says: "The important fact is the excellent quality of the individual players of his orchestra, they are all genuine artists. There is no doubt that Kryl's is the best band we have ever heard in Louisville." Further on, the critic refers to Kryl's solo playing: "With the golden tone of his instrument Kryl has made a mighty impression upon the innumerable listeners. Not only is his instrument actually made of metal gold, but the tones elicited from it are of purest gold also, more golden even than the instrument itself."</p>
   <p>Kryl's successes have attracted the attention of the Fontaine Ferry Park management which has now entered into negotiations with him to prolong the engagement for another week.</p>

   <p>The Louisville audiences are at his feet. We cannot but reiterate our feelings of joy and pride over his conquests, and over the manner in which he helps to spread the fame of our name.</p>
