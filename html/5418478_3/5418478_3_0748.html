   <p>That delightful play "Praha Je Praha" (There Is Only One Prague) was given by the Ludvik theatrical group in the Thalia Hall last night. It is a well-known dramatic piece, and it is always welcome on our stages, particularly when it is so well played as by the Ludvikovci [popular name for the Ludvik theatrical group]. It sparkles with genuine humor; it describes the experiences and depicts the surprises of a young husband who was transferred from the bustling metropolis into a small country town. The audience evidently enjoyed it immensely. Mr. Stach was new in the role of "Mr. Plaminek" and presented a splendid performance.</p>
