   <p>Baritone Viktor Liška, formerly associated with the Národní Divadlo (National Theater) in Prague, had his Chicago debut in the Libuše Hall last night, but his official introduction into our community of artists was not particularly successful. Mr. Liška's program of the evening was selected, with the exception of one number, with singularly good taste; but in spite of this, the attendance was by far not as large as the debutant himself and his colleagues deserved......</p>
   <p>A somewhat more cheerful atmosphere was created by the appearance of Miss N. Walsh, an excellent soprano.....Our young but highly accomplished pianist, Mr. Štĕpán A. Ernst, presented selections of great technical difficulty.....Miss Maruška Gehringer sang with her accustomed fervor.....Mr. Jiří Hruša, one of our best violinists, surprised his audience with presentations which Jan Kubelík himself is not ashamed to put on his programs.....</p>
   
   <p>As we have already mentioned, the attendance was poor. It consisted mostly of members of our artistic colony and members of singing societies, whose choirmaster is Mr. Liška. Had it not been for their friendly support, Mr. Liška might have had his debut before an empty house. A sad fact indeed!</p>
