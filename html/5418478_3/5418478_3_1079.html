   <p>An original comedy called the Kral Liliputansky (King of Lilliput) was presented last night by the Patronat (Board of trustees) of the Jan Neruda Bohemian Free Thought School at Sokol Havlicek Tyrs Hall. The theatrical performances of this school are very popular with our people, and the hall, as usual, was filled to capacity. The presentation of the play proceeded smoothly and it was a treat to note how well the little ones presented their respective roles and how fluently and beautifully they spoke the Bohemian language. This children's theater is a great school of the Bohemian language for our Bohemian youth, and in this respect, Mr. Frantisek Veverka, under whose direction the performance was given, is the children's conscientious teacher and patient stage manager.</p>
