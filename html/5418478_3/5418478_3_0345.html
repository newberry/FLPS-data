   <p>The Bohemians of Chicago are very mindful to possess their own dwellings and houses and like last year they are building this year almost in series their own buildings and homes.</p>
   <p>The well-known architect, Mr. August Loula, obtained on the 19th of this month, fifteen permits for new buildings, part of them he has already started to build; the others will be started very soon. Mr. Loula supplies us with some interesting data concerning the building activity among the Bohemians in Chicago. He says, "I have built this year 38 new houses of different dimensions at a total cost of $103,700. The majority of our countrymen settled in the neighborhood between Throop street and Ashland avenue on account of cheaper real estate. The houses built there are very attractive brick structures, mostly two-stories with a basement and a comfortable layout. Again it is shown that the Bohemians excel in this regard over all other nationalities. In a majority of cases the loan societies <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>play an important part in this enterprise; however it would be more advantageous if they would stop the opening of new companies, at least in this neighborhood in opposition to the existing ones."</p>
