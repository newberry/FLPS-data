   <p>Last Sunday we visited with pleasure the dramatic school on 18th Street, where the director of this theater, Mr. Fr. Kosak, has gathered thirty pupils, fifteen boys and fifteen young girls, whom he is coaching in declamation, recitation, rhetoric, and dramatic art. He educates them as good amateurs for our Bohemian theater, which will interpret to the Bohemian people the works of Bohemian dramatic authors.</p>
   <p>They will make their first public appearance in a short time to demonstrate the progress they have made by their zealous and diligent studies. By doing this they will enlist themselves in the national service, by cultivating the dramatic art they will educate themselves and help to educate and elevate the entire nation.</p>
