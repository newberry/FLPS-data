   <p>The United Amateur Actors gave a play by Stroupežnický in the hall of Sokol Havlíček-Tyrš last night entitled "Nasi Furianti" (Our Blustering Farmers). It deals with rural life in Bohemia.</p>
   <p>The Amateurs are prompted by sheer good will in giving their time and talent, for the proceeds of each of their performances are devoted to some humanitarian purpose. We deem it fit to report with regret that the attendance was not what it should have been. However, the actors did not allow the audience to notice their disappointment over the comparatively slight response to their honest efforts. The play went along briskly and brought forth all the characteristic traits of Czech country life, which the players know from personal observation. The difference between well-to-do farmers of a small village and some less fortunate neighbors, the "dirt farmers," forms the background of the piece.</p>
