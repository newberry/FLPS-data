   <p>The great success of "Prodana Nevesta" (The Bartered Bride), recently presented by the Bedrich Smetana Singing Society, invites all friends of our drama and song to consider the unfavorable conditions under which our theaters have had to exist for several seasons. The box office suffers as does the artistic quality of our dramas. Because of poor box office receipts, our theaters must abandon many plans which they would so gladly make and carry out under more propitious circumstances. Consequently, their entire repertories are subject to compulsory changes. They are governed by the classic question--which dominated the "Kecal the Matchmaker," an outstanding character in the "Bartered Bride"--How much is in it?</p>
   <p>Yet, not even this question is of importance, for simple reason that our performances are not conducted for profit and, indeed, do not yield any. We <span class="page-break">\2</span>must be satisfied if the receipts meet the expenses, or at least keep the deficit at a bearable figure. The deficit is the stumbling block for all theaters in the World, except for those which draw substantial subventions. This is well known, and has been demonstrated on our Chicago stages any number of times. It may not sound particularly flattering for our theatergoing public. At any rate, these circumstances play an important part in the commercial and artistic reasoning of our professional and amateur troups. Will there be enough left to pay for the hall and the music?</p>
   <p>Suddenly there appeared a singing society which produced the "Bartered Bride," and saw the hall of Sokol Chicago filled to the last seat and remotest corner. It is expected that the performance will be repeated with the same success a third, a fourth, a fifth time. Not even this should appear so astounding, for "Svadlenky" (The Little Dressmaker Girls) and other plays proved to be remarkable hits. The reason for these successes is that all the lovers of Smetana's music were willing to pay the unusual price of two dollars for main floor and best gallery seats. The high prices were necessary because <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the extraordinarily heavy expenses incumbent upon any production of the "Bartered Bride," our most popular national opera. Expenses should, however, be of secondary importance considering the established fact that it was possible to fill the hall at an abnormally high admission price and under the prevailing unfavorable conditions.</p>
   <p>The older generation of our theater-loving public remembers how admission prices of fifteen, twenty-five, and thirty-five cents were charged in those days, and the audience could enjoy dancing after the performance. They were in this way offered a two-fold pleasure. When, in later years, the admission was raised to fifty cents and, at the same time, the bar was removed, and the dance omitted, people began to regard this reform as downright dangerous, for they felt that they were not getting their money's worth.</p>
   <p>Many changes have taken place since those times, and they were a credit to our theaters. Yet, when people thought of having to pay a two-dollar <span class="page-break">\4</span>admission, they began to wonder. Their misgivings proved unfounded for most people attach less importance to the amount paid, than to the question of whether they get their money's worth. When they got it they were satisfied.</p>
   <p>The question of high admissions does not hinge only on the element of satisfaction, but also, materially, on the attraction exerted by certain works upon the public. The "Bartered Bride" certainly does not lack in power of attraction. This was evident when the Ludvikovci theatrical troupe produced it in America for the first time, under the baton of Professor Capek, and also when the work was performed by the Metropolitan Opera Company in the Auditorium Theater. At its first performance, it was sung in Czech. In the Auditorium, however, there were German words to Czech music. Nevertheless, our people paid a still higher admission, and did it joyfully. Our amateur stage cannot, of course, be compared with the Metropolitan Opera but, though our people feel at home when they hear Czech music sung to Czech words, they are not loath to hear it sung in German. In Czech, however, Czech music sounds different, warmer, and <span class="page-break">\5</span>penetrates to the Czech heart.</p>
   <p>To produce an opera is, under our circumstances, no small undertaking. It demands untiring work, and involves serious financial risks. For two dollars our public had everything it could ask for--music, soloists, chorus, and artistic dancing. Morcover, they learned to value the high qualities of an opera overture.</p>
   <p>We have gained an additional experience in seeing that in order to succeed with the play, we did not have to produce it downtown. Halls located in our Czech community answer the purpose very well. The large halls downtown have a more spacious stage, but they have less scenic implements. Our public also feels more at home in our halls. Last but not least, our halls need the financial support of our people.</p>
   <p>In setting off the success of "The Bartered Bride" against that of other works <span class="page-break">\6</span>played in our theaters, it will suffice to point to the fact that there is only one "Bartered Bride". This explains everything. Our theater does not possess another endeavor so close to Czech national sentiment, and which so powerfully attracts not only the music-loving public, but also the large mass of our people, filling a theater to capacity despite high admission prices.</p>
   <p>Our theatrical literature possesses some grandiose works that could rival the success of the "Bartered Bride," for instance, Jirasek's "Jan Zizka". They require elaborate scenic display, and can be produced only by big theatrical combinations. A performance such as this was accomplished by the Czechs of New York. We in Chicago seem to be in a different position. It appears that our public is not very particular in selecting its theatrical repertory to suit these portentous times. It even happens that at Czech patriotic occasions, German burlesques are given, as if we could not get along without them!</p>
