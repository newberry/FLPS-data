   <p>Next month the Czechoslovak legionnaires of Chicago will arrange a Bazár Svobody (Liberty Bazaar), the proceeds of which will be donated to widows and orphans of our fallen legionnaires in Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>Most of the legionnaires are graduates of our junior Sokol classes, exponents of Sokol principles, and most of them are still members of our Sokol units. Therefore we, the Sokols, are morally bound to co-operate with our brother legionnaires in their humanitarian project. We must help them to bring this Bazár Svobody to a most successful end.</p>
   <p>The central district of the American Sokol Union has decided to erect its own booth at the Bazár Svobody. In order to equip and to operate this booth, many gifts will be necessary, and the services of many sister and brother Sokols will be needed. Each Sokol unit should appoint at least one brother or sister to help operate this booth. This has already been done by some of our units. A joint meeting of these brothers and sisters who would be willing to co-operate will be held Monday evening at 8 P. M. at the Sokol Chicago Hall.</p>
   <p>Each unit must be represented! Na zdar! (Success!)</p>
   <p>For the central district of the American Sokol Union:</p>
   <p>Dr. Antonín Mueller, President,</p>
   <p>M. Brichta, Secretary.</p>
