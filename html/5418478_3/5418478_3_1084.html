   <p>Theatrical performances in the English language upon the Bohemian stage is the newest step in our histrionic life. The credit for this new acquisition must be given to the Three Links Dramatic Society, headed by Mrs. Jaroslava Kasalický Holzinger. This body is an association of young and talented Bohemian actors who have appeared before our public several times, presenting English plays.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday, on Christmas Day, the young apprentices in histrionic art presented an English play, "The Real Thing After All". The action of the play is very remarkable, for it deals with the post-bellum period. The play was directed by Mrs. Holzinger, and it must be admitted that it was a surprisingly polished performance. All the actors knew their parts perfectly. We regret that the attendance was not as large as it should have been. The following amateurs appeared in the play: Mrs. Jaroslava Kasalický Holzinger, <span class="page-break">2</span>Miss Zdĕnka Borovička Šulc, Miss Helena Hrych, Mr. Joseph Martin, Miss Emelyne Skala, Mr. Jaroslav Kubát, Miss Otilie Šlechta, Mr. Jaroslav Jahoda, Miss Jiřina Čermák, Mr. Louis Smrž, Mr. Joseph P. Elsnic, Miss Jiřina Drška, Miss Ella Vlk, Mr. Stanislav Bartoň, and two unusually talented girls, Virginia Bambas and Mildred Linhart, who, in spite of their youth, performed their parts in a very charming manner.</p>
   <p>An orchestra under the leadership of Mr. Jan Juřena furnished the music.</p>
