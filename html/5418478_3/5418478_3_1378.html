   <p>Preparations for a Posvícení (an old fashioned, plain people's festival), to be held tomorrow, are in full swing. The committee is taking good care that the young and the old, the thirsty and the sweet-toothed be fully satisfied. We are inviting our associations, and requesting mothers to let their children take part in the parade, which will start from 16th Street and Oak Park Avenue at 12:30 P.M. Boys and girls should, if possible, come in peasant costume.</p>
   <p>We hope that there will not be a single Czech missing, for each unit counts toward the success of the event. The parade is to demonstrate that there are large numbers of Czechs in Oak Park. The feast will be held in the garden of Sokol Oak Park.</p>
