   <p>Last night's success of the Carnival was, if possible, still greater than that of Monday, the inaugural evening of the event. It is the general opinion that the crowds assembling on 26th Street during those two nights have been greater than the attendance at any similar undertaking anywhere or any time in the city. The most gratifying fact, however, is that everybody is well satisfied and there are no complaints; all are finding what they have come to get.</p>
   <p>Tonight, in addition to the usual attractions, there will be a great parade.....</p>
