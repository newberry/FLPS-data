   <p>The excellent comedy "Z Manzelskeho Raje" (From Matrimonial Paradise) was given by the Ludvik theatrical group in the Skola (School) last night. Its author is Fr. Oliva. It has, of course, nothing in common with that matrimonial paradise of which we are getting regular reports from the divorce courts. The play deals with the high price of soap, which we are paying right now--in war time. It was given last year under a different name, "The Charming Soap Salesgirl".</p>
   <p>The father-in-law, Mr. Horlivy, and the son-in-law, Mr. Stach, vied with each other in buying soap from the good-looking girl. Their antics drew volleys of laughter from the audience. Their wives were played by Mrs. Horlivy and Mrs. Kozlansky. Mr. Klapka and Mr. Dvorak were highly amusing. Miss Stetina played the role of the salesgirl.</p>
   <p>The next appearance of the Ludvik theatrical group will take place in Thalia Hall on West 18th Street.</p>
