   <p>Umirovs Concert given in the Sokol hall on Kedzie Ave., in Bohemian California, as expected, met with great success. The vocal numbers which Boza Umirov rendered, to the piano accompaniment of Paul Vyskocil, were liked very much, and most of them had to be repeated. Miss Clara Cermak, played several beautiful compositions on the piano. The large audience applauded both artists vociferously. Both were presented with flowers.</p>
