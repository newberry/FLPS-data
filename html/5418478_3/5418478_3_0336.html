   <p>Jan Klucina, a Bohemian, believes that he has solved the problem of the so-called "airships" which hundreds of others have already attempted.</p>
   <p>He has perfected a flying device which, he asserts, will have motion forward and backward, upward and downward, and will carry a number of passengers. Ten people of medium weight may venture into such an airship. The inventor hopes that the government will buy his device, if it answers the purpose. The airship will be driven with gasoline power at the speed of a wild duck.</p>
   <p>Mr. Klucina maintains that he worked ten years on the building of this airship. This model, which he has in his home, is driven only by a clock spring. Therefore, he believes that by attaching a 48 H.P. motor, he will also increase the speed.</p>
