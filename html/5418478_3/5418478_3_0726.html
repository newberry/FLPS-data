   <p>Fire has destroyed the building in which the Česko-Anglická Škola (The Czech-English School) was located, and with it went one of the oldest historic monuments of Czech-Chicago, if not all Czech-America. It was our oldest house in which clubs and associations used to hold their meetings and entertainments. The hall of the Slovanská Lípa (Slavonic Linden Tree), on De Koven Street, is older, true enough, and a landmark from the times of earlier Czech settlers, but it has outgrown its usefulness and does not serve its original purpose any longer. This hall on De Koven Street dates from a time when it was thought that Czechs would remain on the west side of the Chicago River, along Canal Street. Nobody imagined that the Czechs would push farther and farther west until the old Sokol hall on De Koven Street would stand abandoned. Its companion, the hall of the Tělocvična Jednota Sokol (Gymnastic Union Sokol), on Taylor Street, preceded it, and it would be difficult today to find the spot where it once stood. This hall escaped the great Chicago Fire of 1871, it is true, but many years later it did not escape destruction by fire. The <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>building of the Česko-Slovanská Podporující Společnost (Czecho-Slavonic Aid Society), in which the Czech-English Free Thought school was accommodated, was erected when the need for assembly rooms arose some years later.</p>
   <p>The small Czech settlement on Canal Street contented itself with the use of a small hall on Van Buren Street for some time, but when the settlement grew, it began to feel the need for two halls.</p>
   <p>Similar developments may be recorded for the Czech Pilsen district, whose colony was small, and which in those times seemed to be located as far from the original colony as Cicero is today. This small Pilsen colony was perfectly served by the old Čech's Hall, on 20th Street. There are today hundreds, nay, thousands of Czechs in the Pilsen district, none of whom knows that on 20th and Brown (now Sangamon) Streets once stood a two-story building with a hall where plays were given, where formal dances were arranged, and regular "artistic contests" were held by Sokol and other societies' amateur actors. The stage was so small that it looked overcrowded when a couple of amateurs <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>started to walk about at the same time. Yet, even tragedies were played on that tiny stage. Selections requiring pomp and display were given without even the most primitive stage decorations; the very thought of it would make any stage manager's hair bristle with horror today. Still, everything went off smoothly, because there was nothing better on hand--our tastes were less pretentious and our demands more modest. If anyone desires to learn something about pioneering on the amateur stage, there it was in true form, and it existed under all sorts of circumstances, often of an adverse nature.</p>
   <p>The Pilsen district grew, and if the old hall sufficed for theatrical performances, the demand for more places for meetings and social affairs became stronger, so that by the seventies, there already stood the first building of the Czech-English Free Thought school. It was built of wood, as were all dwellings in the Pilsen district, but it burned in the year of 1878. A new, much larger building, took its place one year later. It was erected by the Patronat (Trustees) and was thought to meet the demands of the community for quite a number of years. The second building was of brick, but contained only <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>two schoolrooms and one hall in which meetings and entertainments were held.</p>
   <p>In 1883, the flaming guest again visited the building, devouring it entirely. A new building rose a year later, this time with a large stage and comfortable rooms. It became the adornment of the Czech community, and it certainly gave a strong stimulus to the development of the district. It became the center of Czech Chicago's life, for in those times the "Czech California" district was not much more than a Czech village. Many important rallies, memorable meetings, brilliant social affairs, and concerts took place under its roof, and our Czech amateur theater went through a golden era. There were performances every Sunday by both professional actors and amateurs. The Narodni Druzstvo (National Troupe), the Kolar players, and the Thalia theater all competed vigorously for artistic laurels. There were not so many artists in those times as there are today, but they played with zest and enthusiasm, and if some people contend that there was more sociability in those times than now, they may not be far from the truth.</p>

   <p>Club and society life was more virile in those times. Members showed more interest in their organizations and attended meetings more regularly, regarding their membership as something more than a mere life insurance policy. Briefly, our social life went through a period of fruition which should soon return, as it is particularly needed in these critical times.</p>
   <p>The growth of the Pilsen district and the expansion of our social life made certain improvements on the building imperative, and the Patronat heeded these demands.</p>
   <p>The general satisfaction with these new conditions made us forget that "fire never forgets". It has come again and has damaged the building, just at a time when the World War is exacting many sacrifices. This, however, cannot distract the Patronat's attention from its aim to construct a new building.</p>
