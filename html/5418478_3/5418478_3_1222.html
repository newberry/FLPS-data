   <p>The director of the play given in "Tel. Jed. Sokol" (Gymnastic Society Sokol) Hall last night could not have in any other manner ingratiated himself so much with our theatre-loving public than by last night's performance of Tyl's drama "Stare Mesto A Mala Strana" ( Old Town and Small Town ) in it the author describes with his own distinctive cleverness the trials and tribulations which befell "Praha" (Praque) and our native land under the governments of invaders and through the internal dissensions among the Bohemian Masters themselves.</p>
   <p>We saw that the many enthusiastic, individual patriotic utterances of love and respect toward our native country and its' glorious history had their influence even among the older American settlers, encouraging their patriotism and their sense of nationality.</p>
   <p>The version of patriotic love and devotion portrayed in the characters of "Eliska" <span class="page-break">\2</span>(Ella) played by Miss A. Koerner, "Jana Z. Wartenberku" (John of Wartenberg) played by Mr. J. Jurka, "Opata Kunrada"(Abbott Kunrad) played by Mr. A. Palda, was delivered with enthusiasm and acknowledged in a like manner by a large audience.</p>
   <p>The parts of "Jakuba" (Jacob) by Mr. J. Benes, "Aufenstein" by Mr. J. Hass, were well liked and there is no doubt that when Mr. Hass becomes accustomed to the stage he will be a fine actor.</p>
   <p>We would be pleased to see them more often as we did last night. In fact the production last night can serve as a standard of comparison of the progress our players have been making year after year. In the name of the public we thank our amateurs for the enjoyment derived through their efforts.</p>
