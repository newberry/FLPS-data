   <p>P.2. Col.1--With a concert in the Bohemian-American Hall and a banquet in Libuse Hall in the evening the Lyra Singing Society, one of the oldest organizations of its kind, celebrated the fortieth anniversary of its existence in a dignified manner. Lyra, as every one interested in Bohemian-American life well knows, has had some sad days in its four decades of life. However, people have appeared who by their activity and generosity have placed the society firmly upon its feet and have brought it to the forefront of national life, so that it may continue to provide enjoyment for us all.</p>
   <p>The sacrifices of these people have been regarded with success, and it was a happy celebration which was held yesterday afternoon and evening. The afternoon was given over to a jubilee concert in the Bohemian-American Hall. The attendance was fairly good. The participants in this concert, comprehending the festive spirit of the occasion, rendered their numbers faultlessly, and Lyra, in this celebration of its fortieth anniversary, once <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>more proved that it occupies first place not only among Bohemian singing societies but among those of all nationalities.</p>
   <p>The afternoon concert began with a mixed chorus under the direction of Mr. Kalas, which rendered the finale of the first act of the operetta "Bells of Corneville," and when the applause subsided, Miss Elsa Nicolini, pianist, played Chopin's Polonaise and proved that she is a virtuoso. Her temperamental playing fascinated the audience, and hearty applause followed.</p>
   <p>However, we need not add that there was no lack of applause and appreciation for both the participants in the concert and the arrangements committee, which was composed of Misses Em. Bilek, Kat. Radous, and Josephine Zarobsky and Messrs. Fr. Mayer, Rud. Srp, and Charles Lukes. These persons deserve most of the credit for the beautifully arranged banquet, which was held in Libuse Hall on Twelfth Street. The singers were delighted with the richness and variety of the feast and at parting exchanged congratulations on the success of their celebration of Lyra's fortieth anniversary.</p>
