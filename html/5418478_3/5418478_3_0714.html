   <p>To the Bohemian people! On September 19 we are opening our theatrical season, and therefore, as in past years, we are taking the liberty of calling the attention of our people to the fact that we are opening and are ready to satisfy all of our obligations, which are sometimes difficult to meet. For twenty-eight years we have worked tirelessly among you, and during that period we, so to speak, became an integral part of the Bohemian community of Chicago. Therefore, to use flowery words would be absolutely useless. The results of the past speak for the future. By its conscientious diligence and its honest efforts, the name of "Ludvikovci" (Ludvik's Bohemian Dramatic Association) gained not only credit but also popularity among the Bohemian people of America. The last successful season is a guarantee of increasing interest for the coming one, especially after our announcement that we are ready to meet the taste and requirements of the present time with a noteworthy repertoire. At great expense the directors <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the Sokol Chicago Hall had the scenery redecorated so that the stage will sparkle with new brilliance, and we will be more successful in our efforts, to present new plays with more accuracy in detail.....</p>
   <p>Firmly hoping that the popularity gained through the long course of time will be renewed this season, I remain respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Frantisek Ludvik, Director.</p>
