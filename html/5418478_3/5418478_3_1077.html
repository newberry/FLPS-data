   <p>The afternoon performance given last Sunday by the Česko-Slovanské Podporující Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) in the hall of the Česko-Slovanske Podporující Spolky was well attended. This proves that our people appreciate the value and efforts of our amateur actors. Fořt's "V Českém Ráji" (In the Bohemian Garden of Eden) was very successful.....The Czech stage here may boast of talented amateurs who are real devotees of the art. The individual roles were carefully studied and played.....</p>
