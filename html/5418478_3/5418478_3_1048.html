   <p>Performances such as all the participants in yesterdays concert by the singers of "Lyra" and "Lads" Clubs were so successful in, will cause a clamor of the public for frequent concerts and Plays of this character.</p>
   <p>Everyone knows that yesterday's concert was the first of this kind in Chicago Bohemia and we must admit that it's performance in all respects surprised not only us, but over came even the many doubtful ones who were among the select audience in an overflowing auditorium.</p>
   <p>The first number of the mixed choir "Vlasti vzdalene" (Far From Home) was so touching and carried out in such a manner as to bring forth thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The women's choir of "Lada" then appeared in a performance of "Pochodu" (Progress) for which they were enthusiastically applauded. Not less was the applause accorded to Mr. E.H. Vavra for his bass solo.</p>

   <p>"Rozmarny musky sbor" (Dissatisfied Men's Club) performed by the club, "Lyra", met with appreciation as do all their efforts.</p>
   <p>The Trio "More Bourlive" (Stormy Sea) sung by Miss L. Prochazka, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Ot. Kubina did honor to all the performers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pitt's tenor solo was received with so much applause that an encore was necessary.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the public will soon again be given the opportunity to enjoy a like performance.</p>
