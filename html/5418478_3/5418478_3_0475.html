   <p>According to reports from Prague newspapers, the famous Prague tenor, Mr. Otokar Marak, has signed a contract with the conductor of the Chicago Opera Company for a ten weeks' engagement beginning the middle of February, 1914.</p>
   <p>We are told by Dr. Jaroslav S. Vojan, president of the Cesky Umelecky Klub (Bohemian Arts Club), that his organization is starting to collect signatures for a petition to the management of the Chicago Opera Company to introduce, during this season, if possible, but certainly in the season of 1914-15, some of the great operas by Smetana and Dvorak. This time seems to be particularly appropriate for such action, for in Mr. Marak Conductor Campanini will have a first-class "Smetana singer". Since he is an Italian, Mr. Campanini may not be especially interested in this matter. But if the management receives a petition with a large number of signatures, plus the support of Mr. Marak's presence in Chicago, the chances are that the Umelecky Klub will succeed.</p>
