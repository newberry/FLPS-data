   <p>After the tremendous success which was achieved during the Sunday performance of the, "Veselá Vdoya" (Merry Widow), the management of the Narodní Divadlo Česko-Americke (National Bohemian-American Theater) decided to repeat this great operetta. It is possible that no other operetta attained such a decided success. This was brought about, in the first place, by the excellent costumes which were furnished by the management at its own expense. The theatrical scenery too, was beautiful. The production was perfect, because it was in the hands of most competent singers. The management hopes that by producing the operetta again, the group will gain the good will of our widest circles.....</p>
   <p>The role of "Hana" was sung by our operatic soprano, Miss Mařenka Havelka; that of "Danilo" by the stage manager, Mr. V. Havelka; Miss Slávka Krejčí, sang the role of "Valencia;" and our famous tenor, Mr. Josef R. Krejčí, sang the role of "Rosillon".....The dances were directed by Miss Slávka Krejčí and performed by the members of the Sokol Havlíček- Tyrš.....Tickets to the next performance may be secured by telephoning Lawndale 0485.....</p>
