   <p>The arrangement committee of the Pate Ceskoslovenske Posviceni (Fifth Czechoslovak Autumn Festival) held its regular meeting on Tuesday, July 27, 1920. At the meeting it was unanimously decided to donate that share of the net proceeds of the Festival to which the Chicago district committee of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America) and its ladies' auxiliary, the Vcelky (Bees), are entitled. That part of the proceeds which was originally earmarked for the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), will be given to the committee for the erection of a new Bohemian school building in Cicero. The second half of the net proceeds to which the Slovak League and its ladies' auxiliary, Priadky (Spinners), are entitled, will be given to seven Slovak schools of Chicago as was announced once before.</p>
   <p>In regard to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, it was resolved to publish the following explanation in the newspapers, so that the Bohemian people may be properly informed about the existing circumstances and can form their own opinions.</p>
   <p>In the month of April, the board of directors of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec sent a communication to the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe. This communication was read and discussed at the plenary meeting held May 5, 1920, according to the minutes of the meeting which were published in our monthly organ, the Poselstvi (Message), No. 8, page 9:</p>
   <p>"A communication from the board of directors of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec of Chicago, requesting monetary aid for this humanitarian institution, was read. Inasmuch as it was a matter local importance, it was decided to notify the board of directors to send the request to the Chicago district committee of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe."</p>
   <p>In the month of May, the board of directors of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec again sent a request to the Chicago district committee of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe, which discussed the matter at the plenary meeting held June 4, 1920. At the meeting it was decided to arrange a public project for the benefit of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec in the near future. The board of directors of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec was notified of this decision by a communication dated June 5. This communication was read at its meeting held in June, and because we did not receive any negative reply, the natural result was that we continued with our preparations for the Pate Ceskoslovenske Posviceni. Inasmuch as our share of the net proceeds had been promised to the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, it never occurred to us that an institution depending upon charity and collecting nickels and dimes at the tag days would refuse a contribution of several hundreds or probably thousands of dollars.</p>
   <p>In the middle of July when our preparations were in full swing, we again notified the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, and we asked for their co-operation. The result was that their board of directors formally announced in Bohemian newspapers that the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec would not participate in this project. We do not wish to criticize the parliamentary procedure through which this decision was arrived at. We only refer to the fact that the board of directors of the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec themselves asked us for a help twice, and that they were properly and sufficiently informed about our project. Hence it follows that if the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec does not need any monetary help now, we should have been notified by the directors before all the posters and admission tickets were printed and before we began to advertise this project in the newspapers. We bring this explanation to our people in order to prevent the spreading of false reports designed to harm our endeavor.</p>
   <p>At the same time we ask all the secretaries of our friendly societies and lodges to whom the admission tickets to the Pate Ceskoslovenske Posviceni were sent to report this matter in the very next meetings of their respective organizations, so that our people are properly informed about the state of affairs and about the above-mentioned change. The proceeds of the Pate Ceskoslovenske Posviceni which had originally been earmarked for the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec, will therefore be donated to the committee for the erection of a new Bohemian school building in Cicero. Several hundreds of Bohemian children who are attending the Bohemian language classes were deprived of the use of the public school building by the Cicero School Board and were all but thrown into the streets. In the life of nations the school is the most important institution, and therefore it is our duty to help the committee for the erection of a new Bohemian school building in Cicero in its effort to provide a new structure for the Bohemian classes where the children of our countrymen would be taught the principles of national consciousness and character development.</p>
   <p>The Pate Ceskoslovenske Posviceni in Chicago will be held in the Pilsen Park pavilion on Sunday afternoon, August 15, 1920, under the auspices of the following organizations: The Chicago district committee of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe and its ladies' auxiliary, the Vcelky, and the first district committee of the Slovak League of America and its ladies' auxiliary, the Priadky. Naturally, all the branches of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe and the Slovak League will participate. The arrangement committee's meetings are held every Tuesday evening at 3734 West 26th Street. Everybody who is interested in this project is cordially invited. We invite all our old and tried workers to come!</p>
   <p>Julie Hrych, Chairman,</p>
   <p>Stanislav Hromadka, Secretary.</p>
