   <p>About twenty thousand Bohemian members of different organizations, on Sunday May 5th, in procession, marched through the city of Chicago to Grant Park in honor of the Bohemian revolutionist and patriot, Thomas G. Masaryk, Professor of the University of Prague, who paid a visit to his countrymen in the city of Chicago after being three years in Russia, where he was exiled by the persecution of the Austrian Government, against whom he led the revolutionary propaganda.</p>
   <p>Prof. Masaryk is a great figure of the Bohemian nation and is one of the greatest educators of Europe. But his wordly fame he attained not by virtue of his knowledge of the educational field, but by his revolutionary struggle which he led against the Austrian Government, which oppresses and insults his nation.</p>
   <p>Prof. Masaryk knows the United States pretty well. He came here in 1878 for an acquaintance with the greatest democracy in the world. He learned much here, and when he returned he was accompanied by a woman from Brooklyn to whom he was married. Mrs. Masaryk from that time became a famous collaborator in the life <span class="page-break">2</span>of the Bohemian people. She came to love the little Bohemian nation, and the Bohemian nation accepted her as its own. At this time she is in Prague where the Austrian government is engaged in unmerciful persecution. Her daughter Dr. Alice Masaryk. spent a long time in prison in Vienna for the crime of being the daughter of Prof. Masaryk.</p>
