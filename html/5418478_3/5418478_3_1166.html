   <p>The "Dollar Princess," an operetta by the well-known Austrian composer, Franz Lehar, was yesterday's contribution of the České Divadlo (Bohemian Theater) to the theatrical season in our California [Bohemian district]. It was a sort of farewell performance for the group of old amateurs; the České Divadlo has made many changes in its personnel....and is rapidly developing into a professional organization.....</p>
   <p>We can offer nothing but praise to all those who contributed to the complete success of the evening.</p>
