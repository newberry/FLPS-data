   <p>The grand lodge of the Jednota Českých Dam (Unity of Bohemian Ladies) presented its annual theatrical performance yesterday. It was held for the Jednota's own building fund, and the play was "Maloměstští Diplomati" (Small Town Diplomats), one of František Štolba's lesser works, but one offering considerable difficulty for mere amateurs.....</p>
   <p>The performance, in spite of the fact that the play is not particularly fitted to our conditions, pleased the enormous audience, and the organizers may be fully satisfied with the night's moral and financial success.....</p>
