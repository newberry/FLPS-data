   <p>The concert for the benefit of the Czech Old People's Home and Orphanage was a complete success. It was given in the Pilsen Brewery Park last night. Our people demonstrated again that their generosity cannot be exhausted in spite of numerous collections to which they are contributing in these times.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank J. Petru, chairman of the agitation committee, addressed the group in a few but touching words. The program was on a high artistic level; our best Chicago Czech artists donated their time and dedicated their talent to the cause of the old and the feeble.....A prologue from the pen of Adalbert J. Havránek was recited by Mrs. Klečka.....</p>
