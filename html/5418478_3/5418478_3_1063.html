   <p>Without any flattery, we must recognize that seventeen year old countryman, Karel Weiss, of 4511 South Wood Street, is gifted with an unusual talent for painting. He is the oldest of five children of Mr. Leopold Weiss, who owns and operates a variety store and barber shop at that address.</p>
   <p>Young Karel has had an unusual liking for painting ever since the age of five, and he has saved some paintings from the period during which he attended public school. Up to this time, he had not yet received any training in the art which merits recognition. Later, after he had graduated from public school, he entered the Art Institute, where he studied for one year. At present, he works in his own atelier, in the home of his father. He is working to complete a scene taken from nature. The young artist especially excels in landscape painting.</p>

   <p>Mr. Weiss has his paintings on exhibition in his father's place of business, some of which are offered for sale. We wish our young countryman much success.</p>
