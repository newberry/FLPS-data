   <p>A new financial institution, the Millard State Bank, began its activity right in the heart of Česká Kalifornie (Bohemian California) today. At the head of this new institution, we are convinced, are men who are very well known in our commercial and national circles. The board of directors consists of Bohemian-Americans who have demonstrated their commercial energy and ability many times.</p>
   <p>The following countrymen are officers of the new bank: Mr. Rudolph A. Čepek, president; Mr. E. J. Kvídera, first vice-president; Mr. J. Friedl, second vice-president; Mr. F. L. Bašta, cashier.</p>
