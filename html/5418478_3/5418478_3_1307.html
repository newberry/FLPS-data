   <p>Upon the urgent call of the bazaar committee, the following Bohemian societies of Chicago sent their contributions to a bazaar which will be held to help provide funds for the erection of a Bohemian school in the Bohemian settlement of Milwaukee, Wisconsin:</p>
   <p>The Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Pilzen (Sokol Pilsen Gymnastic Association), $5; the Svornost Lodge No. 6 of the Bohemian-Slavonic Union, $5; the Lincoln Lodge No. 52 of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies, $2; the Devin Lodge No. 26 of the Bohemian Benevolent Sisterhood, $2; the Vitezstvi Lodge No. 122 of the Unity of Bohemian Ladies, $2; the Sokol Havlicek Tyrs, $5; [follows the names of Bohamian societies from other cities which also contributed to the fund]. Total, $95.08.</p>
   <p>I hereby thank all the above-mentioned societies for their aid. Their names <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will be recorded in the minutes of the bazaar committee so that in the future our youngsters may see for themselves who it was that helped build our school.</p>
   <p>I beg to be excused from sending letters of thanks to individual societies because we want to save on postage. At the conclusion of the bazaar, every society which contributed toward the fund will receive a financial report of the bazaar.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>A. Jecmen, secretary.</p>
