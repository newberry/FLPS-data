   <p>Yesterday's report on the opening of the exhibition by Chicago artists, in the Art Institute, we supplement in the sense,that not two, but three Bohemian artists are represented there. In addition to the sculptor Korbel and the painter Sterba, there is one other Bohemian artist exhibiting there, the painter Rudolf F. Ingerle. He has on exhibition four beautiful landscape paintings (No. 145-148); "Slunecni svit a stin" (Sunlight and Shadow), "Mesicni jas" (Moonlight), "Zima v kraji" (Winter in the Country) and "Letici mracna" (Flying Cloud).</p>
   <p>Especially excellent are "Letici mracna," with the poetic flair of that ever restless rambling wanderer on the nocturnal sky, and "Zima v kraji," <span class="page-break">2</span>a picture full of spirit and moods, with snow-covered houses and snow falling from the heavy sky.</p>
