   <p>Preparations for the production of "Prodaná Nevĕsta" (The Bartered Bride), an opera by Bedrich (Frederick) Smetana, are in full swing. The work, with its beautiful melodies, will be given by the Chicago Czech singing society whose name is "Bedřich Smetana". The date is February 24, 1918; the place, Sokol Chicago auditorium, South Kedzie Avenue near 24th Street.</p>
   <p>There were rehearsals throughout last week in which soloists, chorus, orchestra, and dancers, the latter girls from our Sokol societies, took part.</p>
   <p>For us Czechs, the "Bartered Bride" is infinitely more than mere opera, more than a perfect operatic composition. It is "our own" in the deepest sense of the word. It has grown into the soul of the Czech people. Anyone in whose veins Czech blood surges will feel overcome by an emotion not to be found among non-Czechs upon hearing the melodies from this immortal work.</p>
   <p>Although the "Bartered Bride" may be liked ever so much in foreign lands, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>it can only be loved passionately by us Czechs. Why? Because its music whispers into the remotest recesses of our hearts and moves us so deeply that hot tears spring into our eyes.</p>
   <p>All our Czech sentiment speaks to us through Smetana's music--that Czech consciousness which our nation has been defending against the assaults of enemies for fifteen hundred years. That Czech feeling which we were able to preserve during the dark and sad times after the battle on the Bílá Hora (White Mountain) and keep alive under the ashes of a destruction not comparable even with the present horrors in Belgium and Serbia; that Czech spirit which our patriots roused to new life--all this cannot be described by words. What the heritage of centuries has made part of our souls speaks to us through Smetana's music.</p>
   <p>Six hundred and fifty productions of the "Bartered Bride" in the Czech National Theater in Prague, others in various Czech cities, such as Plzeň (Pilsen) Vinohrady, Brno, and others, as well as in American cities, such as New York, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Cleveland, and Chicago--all these are living proof that the Czech people here and across the ocean hold Smetana dear to their hearts.</p>
   <p>New evidence for this attachment to Smetana's music will be furnished by the production of the Czech singing society Bedřich Smetana.</p>
   <p>One performance will take place on February 24, another on March 3. There are still some tickets available for the first performance. They are obtainable at the following places: Café Slavia; Pelikán's drugstore, 24th Street and Kedzie Avenue; Plaček's place at the home of Sokol Chicago; Honsik's drugstore, Turner Avenue and 26th Street; Dr. Mach, Lawndale Avenue and 26th Street. Tickets for the second performance will be placed on sale later.</p>
