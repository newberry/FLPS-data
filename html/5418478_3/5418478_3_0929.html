Cervenka for a ten-dollar donation for the same cause. The Society also thanks the many patrons who have supported it during the year.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Delnicky Pevecky Sbor requests parents to send their children to the Society's singing school. This school is kept up at quite an expense to the Society in order that Czech song may be preserved in America. Our Society has been able to secure a very good teacher, Mr. Houdek, who will apply his efforts <span class="page-break">\2</span>to the proper teaching of the children.</p>
   <p>The singing-school classes meet every Sunday forenoon. Registration of students is made at the rooms of the manager of the Cesko-Delnicky Pevecky Sbor, V. Hasek, 1721 South Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>Stanley Bilek, secretary</p>
