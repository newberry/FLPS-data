   <p>"Deborah" a drama given at the "Telocvicne Jednota Sokol"(Gymnastic Society Hall) last night was played to the satisfaction of the public. After diligent preparation, all characters were quite capably enacted especially Deborah, Hannah and Joseph. One fault we noticed was when Godfather Mathew came rolling from the church with the other people, he held a pipe in his mouth upon which he puffed like a small railroad engine. Another was when the Surgeon who in spite of his high standing on the stage forgot himself and spoke the English word "Well."</p>
   <p>The attendance could have been justa little better.</p>
