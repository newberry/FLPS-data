   <p>Lovers of Art will surely welcome with pleasure the report that our Bohemian community was once more enriched by an important seat of learning, a Bohemian school of art, which has just been arranged in the Bohemian-American hall at 588 W. 18th St., and in which classes will begin next Saturday. In this school, which is divided into three grades, classes will be held every Saturday, from 9 o'clock in the morning till 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in decorative painting, pen and ink drawing, art lettering and in fact everything in connection with industrial art.</p>
   <p>We recommend this school, which will be managed by Mr. Jaroslav Jirsa, of 809 Ashland Ave., and Ant. Karell, of 1304 So. 43rd Ave., warmly to all countrymen who have drawing or painting talent. Further details may be found in the advertisement.</p>
