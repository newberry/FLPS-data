   <p>The management of the Ludvik theatrical group reverted to an older play "Kriz U Potoka" (The Cross at the Brook) which it presented last night. The play, written by Eliska (Elizabeth) Peskova, deals with country life, and enjoyed great popularity years ago. The public loves to see it, even nowadays when the performance comes up to the standards of the Ludvik group, which represents our foremost scene.</p>
   <p>The Ludvik group was no newcomer in the theater world, and the role of "Eve," played by Mrs. Horliva, and the character of "Ambroz Potocky," played by her husband, who played it again last night, are still vividly before our eyes. All the other parts were also played with much success.</p>
