   <p>Our readers are already aware of the fact that the Carnival Week of our businessmen on 26th Street in Bohemian California will start Monday, October 11. It will be a week of merriment and celebration by which our businessmen want to manifest their pleasure and satisfaction over the removal of the cause of a longfelt annoyance which hampered them considerably in their efforts for business expansion. Finally, 26th Street has been paved in all its length. Our businessmen, however, always give the first thought to their customers; therefore this Carnival also is in reality for them, and the preparations indicate that it will be full of surprises and wonders. It will extend from Albany Avenue to 42nd Avenue, and all along between these two streets there will not be a place without some attraction, entertainment, or surprise. All along there will be special illumination, several bands will play, many artists show their skill, a parade, masquerade, <span class="page-break">\2</span>prizes for the best costumes, and many other features which those whom we have interviewed could not remember at the moment.</p>
   <p>There have been many carnivals all over the city lately, but these carnivals have been arranged exclusively for the improvement of business in the respective sections, and the carnival on 26th Street will therefore be different. We may say that nothing of that kind has yet been seen in sections where our people live. At some carnivals, one per cent or sometimes more of the net income is given to charity, or "tag days" are held,or tickets sold, while at this carnival the whole net income will go for charitable purposes. The Sdruzeni Ceskych Obchodniku Ze 26.Ulice (26th Street Bohemian Businessmen's Association) and its carnival committee have decided to sell no concessions to various profit seekers who would carry the money away from our midst, but to give the whole benefit to our charitable institutions- - -that is, to the <span class="page-break">\3</span>Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association), the Ceska Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage), the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital), and the Sirotcinec Sv. Josefa (St. Joseph Orphanage). There will be no tag day. Nobody will be stopped and annoyed, or asked for donations, because the above-mentioned organizations will have their own booths with wheels of fortune at convenient street corners, and everybody who buys a ticket may select his own favorite charity, and will have a chance to win a seventy-five cent certificate which may be used for purchases in stores whose show windows carry the announcement that the owner supports the carnival. The betting on the wheel of fortune is fun in itself, and the interest will be heightened by novel, unusual arrangements of the booths. The patronizing of these wheels combines entertainment with good deeds, and, in case of good luck, profit, because seventy-five cents will buy a whole lot on 26th Street, especially during the Carnival Week.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>There will be something different every day of the week. Monday will feature athletic and histrionic acts and attractions all along the street. There will be artists diving from high towers into tanks of water, tightrope walkers, acrobats riding bicycles on tightropes, to say nothing about acrobatic clowns and other merry-makers. Some of these men will start performing at one end of the Carnival Street, some at the other, and they take the whole street, stopping at each street corner in between. The troupe of actors will play a scene at every corner, and its program will change every day. Tuesday will be a program similar to the one shown Monday, but there will be a change Wednesday, October 13. Early in the evening, there will be a huge parade composed of marchers recruited from local businessmen and their wholesalers, with automobiles, floats, allegorical vehicles, cars, carriages, and riders. All will be richly decorated, and the committee intimates that it has received the assurance from very many men and organizations that they will participate. The <span class="page-break">\5</span>committee is certain that the parade will be the best ever. It will be led by automobiles carrying the officers of the Businessmen's Association, who will be followed by members of the various carnival committees, and all the rest of the participants. The officers are looking forward to that parade as the first opportunity on which to relax after four weeks of steady hard work.</p>
   <p>Thursday night there will again be various entertainments, and Friday will be a holiday for those who find fun in masquerading. You may call it a "Night in Venice", or "Mardi Gras", it will be fun under any name, unrestrained merriment full of teasing and joking which will not fail to attract huge crowds of people. A number of prizes for the best masks have been donated by the businessmen. Every mask will receive from the committee a ticket with a number, the ticket to be pinned on the front of the dress. The prizes will be awarded according to these numbers by judges who will mingle in the crowd and announce <span class="page-break">\6</span>their decision at a place designated elsewhere in this paper.</p>
   <p>Already many businessmen have started decorating their windows, and have placed in them many bargains which will be sure to attract the attention of our housewives. Bargains during the Carnival Week will be not bargains for advertisement only, but bargains that are for sale in reality. Members of the 26th Street Businessmen's Association assure us that nothing similar in the way of sales has ever been seen in the city. The certificates won at the wheels of fortune have the value of seventy-five cents each, and will be accepted instead of money by all businessmen on the street whose windows indicate that they are members of the Carnival--that is, those who have donated the required amount of money to the Carnival fund--and will be accepted up to November 1.</p>
   <p>Saturday night will be filled with entertainment similar to that planned for Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. It will be the final night of the affair <span class="page-break">\7</span>and is expected to be the most lively one.</p>
   <p>The musical part of the entertainment is in the experienced hands of our noted band leaders, Brousek, Rada, Husa, and Novotny, so there is no doubt whatever that it will be of the very best. Detailed programs for every single day of the Carnival will be published daily in the Denni Hlasatel on the page wholly devoted to matters pertaining to the Carnival.</p>
   <p>Our 26th Street businessmen issue herewith their invitation to our countrymen from any and all parts of Chicago to come to the Carnival and help them to celebrate the fact that from now on they will be able to work on the development of the business on 26th Street--something they have been quite unable to do prior to this time because of the lack of improvement of the street. No tricksters, gamblers, or other sharpers who like to take advantage of the public will be tolerated.</p>
