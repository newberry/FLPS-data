   <p>The tenth anniversary of the Reznicky Delnicky Vzdelavaci Klub (Educational Club of [Bohemian] Meat Market Employees) was celebrated last Sunday at Pilsen Park, 26th Street and Albany Avenue. Prior to the celebration the Club paraded from Mr. Krkavec's restaurant at 19th Street and Blue Island Avenue to Pilsen Park....During its ten years of existence the Club has gained the sympathy of our general public, and it is therefore not surprising that its anniversary celebration enjoyed an immense attendance, especially of our younger generation who never miss such an opportunity.....</p>
