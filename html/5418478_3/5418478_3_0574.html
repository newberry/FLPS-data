   <p>The eminent musician, and countryman of ours, Mr. Koula, who recently arrived in Chicago with the H. M. S. Pinafore Company has sent for his wife and family to join him. Mr. Koula will settle permanently in Chicago and will teach music here.</p>
   <p>His ability leads him to believe that he will be patronized by his countrymen. We also wish him much success.</p>
