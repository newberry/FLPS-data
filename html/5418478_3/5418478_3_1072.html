   <p>A pleasant evening of entertainment awaits those of our countrymen who will attend a recital to be given by the pupils of the Ceska Svobomyslna Skola Jan Neruda (Jan Neruda Bohemian Free Thought School) in the hall of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, Lawndale Avenue between 26th and 27th Streets.</p>
   <p>Two charming and humorous dramatic plays will be given. The costumes and speech of the amateur actors will be characteristic of both the Slovak and Hanak peoples. There will be songs. The plays will portray love for the native villages and its old customs. The little players have been well rehearsed by their teacher, Mr. Frantisek Veverka, in whose honor the theatrical performance is given.</p>
