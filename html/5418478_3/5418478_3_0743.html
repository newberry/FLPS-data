   <p>Our theater-loving public certainly knows how to appreciate the beauty of classical pieces. It demonstrated this again last Sunday at the performance of Shakespeare's drama, "Othello," which was presented by the Ludvik theatrical troupe. The brilliant success of the evening caused the management to arrange for a second performance, which will show anew how much Czechs and Slovaks like to be under the spell of the unrivaled charm of Shakespeare's genius.</p>
   <p>Real actors are needed for this play--genuine artists--and also the proper stage setting is essential. These two requirements are perfectly fulfilled by Ludvik's theater--reason enough to expect a record attendance again.</p>
