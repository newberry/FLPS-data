   <p>The excellent four act comedy, "Palackeho Trida Cis. 27" (Palacky Avenue No 27) from the pen of F. F. Samberk was given in the Sokol Chicago hall under the auspices of the Czech lodges of the O. O. F. O. (Odd Fellows) last night. The Czech Odd Fellows are not only assiduous workers for the national cause, but count a goodly number of talented amateur actors among its members. The popularity of the Czech Odd Fellows lodges as shared by the Czech public was demonstrated by the large attendance at the performance which was directed by J. R. Krejci, with seasoned players, and was an unqualified success.</p>
   <p>The play itself does not need any special recommendation. It is one of the best works of Samberg, the actor playwright. The attraction created by Samberg's plays does not decrease, as all the works are imbued with genuine humor. The play as performed gave every actor an excellent opportunity to display his artistic virtues. The gratitude of the audience manifested itself in generous applause. Mr. J. Jurena's orchestra played pieces of accredited musical quality in academic style.</p>
