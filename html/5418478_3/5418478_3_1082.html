   <p>The people who filled the spacious auditorium of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs Hall to capacity last Wednesday evening were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed an agreeable performance prepared for them by the Dorostovy Klub Vojta Naprstek (Vojta Naprstek Junior Club). This organization of enlightened and patriotic girls and boys is well known to our people, and its reputation is still growing by every new performance. Last Wesnesday, this popular Club introduced itself to its patrons again in a great enchanting comedy with songs and dances. "Mlyn na Zeny" (Mill of Youth) was presented and the result was really brilliant. The production of this comedy is very difficult, but thanks to the clever management of Mr. Frantisek Vlach, a teacher, all those who participated in this comedy succeeded in overcoming all the obstacles. The audience witnessed a performance which is an honor to the arrangers..... The brilliant success of this performance will surely be a great encouragement to the Dotostovy Klub Vojta Naprstek in its future activity.</p>
