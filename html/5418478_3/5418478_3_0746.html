   <p>Last night the Ludvik theatrical troupe played in the Thalia auditorium. "From Step to Step" which is a drama of everyday life [author not mentioned], was presented. Mrs. M. Skalicka appeared again after several years of absence from our foremost Czech-American stage. She played the role of "Floret", a mirthful carefree girl. The main part, "Mary", was played by Mrs. Horlivy, who portrayed well the character of a poor girl suffering from the consequences of a venture into easy life.</p>
   <p>Professor Capek directed the orchestra in its rendition of several interesting numbers, among which was a new composition by Sousa.</p>
