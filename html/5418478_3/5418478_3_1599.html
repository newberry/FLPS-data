   <p>It cannot be denied that in spite of the indifference to everything patriotic, in spite of the decline of national consciousness, which properties are a characteristic portion of a large percentage of our countrymen, there are among our people many such, who spare no effort and are not afraid of any sacrifice, when the question is the development and elevation of our national life. Members of the Patronage of the Ladimir Klacel Bohemian-American school, individually and collectively, surely rank first place among these generous patriots. Whoever is a sincere patriot, provides first of all for the preservation and elevation of national schools, because they are the foundation of everything. If there were no Bohemian schools, our youth would very soon become denationalized. Our youth becomes acquainted with Bohemian books in these schools and does not denationalize so easily. The Patronage of the Ladimir Klacel Bohemian-American school has taken the task of maintaining one of the Bohemian schools of our community and is fulfilling its task zealously.</p>

   <p>A grand exhibition was opened by it in the Ladimir Klacel hall at 19th and Leavitt Streets yesterday, which will last until December 12th and the profits derived there from will accrue to the benefit of the school building and the society's hall.</p>
   <p>The affair was generally successful yesterday, which certainly can be attributed to the zealous activity of the Arrangements Committee. We hope the exhibition will meet with like success during the following days of its existence. It would be to the shame of the public if such was not the case, in view of the work connected with such an exhibition and especially in view of the purpose. We are, so to speak, certain that there will be none among our enlightened countrymen who will fail to visit this exhibition or begrudge the nickel, dedicated to such a good purpose for the benefit of the Bohemian school. Arise there fore and go to the exhibition!</p>
