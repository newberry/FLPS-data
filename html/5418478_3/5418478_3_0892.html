   <p>The Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Czech Workingmen's Singing Society) ranks among the foremost organizations of this kind. This judgment is not based upon bias or on personal associations, but solely upon the merits of efficiency, artistic maturity, and vigorous activity. This last quality is most remarkable, since some of the members of the Workingmen's Singing Society have already passed middle age. There is food for thought in meditating on what a splendid organization could be built up if the Czech public showed more interest. We especially mean the younger element in the Czech community with a flair for singing. Two facts are particularly conspicuous, to wit, that among the already thinning ranks of singers, almost invariably one finds the same faces; and that the circle of friends and visitors of the Society's concerts consists of those who have been patronizing that group's enterprises for years. The Society has nevertheless been able to demonstrate that a genuine love of song surges in its veins, and that the enthusiasm of former, younger years cannot become extinct.</p>
   <p>This was obvious in the concert given by the Workingmen's Singing Society in the Pilsen Park Brewery pavilion yesterday afternoon. A spirit of joyful enterprise dominated singers and audience alike. We noticed that the attendance was not as large as usual, true enough, but this is explained by the fact that there were programs arranged by several other organizations on the same day. There was the public exhibition given by the Sokol Slavsky group, which occupied the interest of our people. The number of singers upon the platform also appeared to us to be smaller than usual.</p>
   <p>We should like to request the visitors to take their seats before the beginning at future concerts, and also, not to bring little children to the performance, which is unpleasantly marred by the youngsters' cries.</p>
   <p>The program itself must be called one of the best we have witnessed during the past few years. Its complete success was due in a large degree to Mr. Joseph Houdek, who is without contradiction, the best conductor who ever wielded a baton over the chorus of the Czech Workingmen's Singing Society. An artist of sterling artistic qualities, he sounds the depths of a composition for beauties ensconced in it and reveals them to the listener in a truly impressive manner.</p>
   <p>For yesterday's concert Mr. Houdek reached out for works which present towering difficulties even to the most accomplished and artistically matured chorus. These obstacles, however, were overcome with ease. The chorus "Dvacet Bilich Sokolu" (Twenty White Sokols), by Vitezslav Novak, left an indelible impression. The singers virtually revelled in the performance of this piece which was being presented to Chicago Czechs for the first time.</p>
   <p>As far as male chorus singing is concerned, one might divide yesterday's concert into three parts. Bedrich Smetana's "Pisen Na Mori" (Song over the Sea) dominated the first part. The second part was taken up by "Orac" (The Tiller), a chorus in a more modern style and of marvelous beauty, by Bedrich Foerster. "Twenty White Sokols", by Novak, was sung in the third section of the program. Its huge dramatic possibilities were brought out with telling effect, although double the number of singers would have been necessary to do it full justice. Vitezslav Novak is the foremost living Czech composer today.</p>
   <p>Several Slovak folksongs, arranged for male chorus by Mr. Houdek, might well be called little pearls. One of them "Ach, Muj Boze, Co Mam Robit?" (Oh My God, What Am I to Do?), gave Mr. Adamir an opportunity to display his ringing baritone voice.</p>
   <p>The ladies' singing society Maj (May) sang four delightful choruses by Vendler. The mighty chorus "Kdoz Jste Bozi Bojovnici! (Onward Ye Soldiers of the Lord!), a battle song of the followers of John Hus, dating back to the fifteenth century, created great patriotic enthusiasm. Dr. Jaroslav Salaba-Vojan gave a survey of Czech history leading to the origin of this chorus, and also elucidated the meaning of some of the other numbers on the program. He continued with a general review of cultural, historical, aesthetic, and musical values in the life of the Czech nation.</p>
   <p>Walter Ferner, American cello virtuoso and member of the Theodore Thomas Symphony Orchestra, played "Phantasy", by Serveis, and "Hungarian Rhapsody", by Popper. The applause accorded to him rivalled any ever heard in the pavilion. He is certainly the best cello player we have heard at any Czech concert up to the present time. Mrs. Sieben played the piano accompaniment.</p>
