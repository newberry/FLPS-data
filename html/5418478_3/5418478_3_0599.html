   <p>The Český Umĕlecký Klub (Bohemian Arts Club), which was founded in January, 1912, will complete ten years of activity this month. It is the first club of its kind among the Bohemians of America that can boast of such an anniversary. Among its active members, the club numbers sixty artists and painters, sculptors, architects, musicians, and literati, as well as playwrights. There are two honorary members on its membership roll--one of them, Count Luetzow, died recently; the other one is the president of the Czechoslovak Republic, Tomáš G. Masaryk. (In the diploma issued to him in the spring of 1916, the club expressed its unalterable faith in Czech independence, and that occurred during the days when such independence was thought by many to be impossible). Besides these men there is a large number of contributing members. During its first decade, the club has arranged four art exhibitions; a small exhibit at the University of Chicago in cooperation with the Českoslovenakĕ Národní Sdružení (Czechoslovak National Alliance); <span class="page-break">2</span>various soirees and concerts to honor the memory of Mikuláš Aleš, to whom the club also sent an honorary gift of money.
