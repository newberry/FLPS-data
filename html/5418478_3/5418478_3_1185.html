   <p>It was expected that yesterday's performance by the dramatic group of Sokol Chicago would turn out to be what it should have been--a Slavic demonstration. By that demonstration the Chicago Bohemians should have proved that they are Slavs and that they can become enthusiastic and inspired for a common Slavic cause, if need be.</p>
   <p>A great deal was expected from the demonstration, but the results were very disappointing. Apparently there are very few Slavs among Chicago Bohemians, because they could not fill more than one half of the hall. This is a sad fact, because it must be taken as an indication of the degree of our national consciousness, our sincerity of feelings, and particularly of our willingness to help.....</p>
   <p>However, notwithstanding this mediocre attendance, the theater was permeated with a peculiar, festive atmosphere which grew in intensity with each act of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the splendidly performed play, "Žertva Na Balkáně" (A Balkan Oblation).</p>
   <p>The program started with a prologue.....</p>
   <p>After the prologue, the song "Šumí Marica" (Marica [River] Roars [Bulgarian national anthem]) was sung and the tableau, "Bulgars before Constantinople," ....was presented. A festive overture composed of national songs was played.....and then came the play itself.....</p>
   <p>Although somewhat antiquated...it ranks above the average in plays of its period.....</p>
   <p>We do not yet know how large a share of the net income of the play will go to the Slavic Red Cross. But we do know that its moral success is great.....</p>
