   <p>In one of our large vaudeville theaters, the Hippodrome, which is housed in the Great Northern building at Dearborn and Quincy Streets, a young countryman of ours, Mr. Alois Ciha, has been appearing since last Monday as a soloist on the xylophone, which he handles with such playfulness and ease that he is obliged to give encore after encore. Mr. Ciha's performances are attended by large audiences, which proves the popularity of the young artist. He is still a young man, but he has already had a number of great successes. Recently he toured almost half of the United States, and everywhere he appeared, he commanded attention and praise.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that Mr. Ciha comes from Chicago, and that his parents live at 1345 South Tripp Avenue. They share his happiness in his great success.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ciha's performances at the Hippodrome will terminate next Sunday evening.</p>
