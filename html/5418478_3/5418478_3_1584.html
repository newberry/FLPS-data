   <p>p. 1. - col. 6.. The Sokol gymnastic societies are actually our national guardians. Wherever the Bohemian people decide to make a permanent settlement they establish a branch of this organization as soon as possible. Then they work together to improve the community and devise methods beneficial to their people. Residents of the community who want moral support and physical vigor join the organization which is open to young and old, male or female. It does a great deal towards physical health of the Bohemians.</p>
   <p>A new branch of this society has just been established in the little suburb of Chicago called Hawthorne (now known as Cicero), and is already active in the progress and development of that section. A celebration in honor of this new branch will take place at Hawthorne. It will be participated in by many of our Chicago branches who promise their help to make it a success. This will be our first branch in that suburb and we are determined to make a good impression.</p>
   <p>The Chicago branches are proud to see their society progress and therefore will do all in their power to aid the new group. The program will consist of <span class="page-break">\2</span>various drills by visiting branches and also by the one just organized. Persons who are interested in this organization are extended a friendly welcome to attend any of these celebrations which are always open to the public.</p>
