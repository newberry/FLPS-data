   <p>p. 1. col. 4.. The Bohemian Children's Club and Nursery of Chicago, will give an old favorite play, "Cinderella." It will be played in the Bohemian language.</p>
   <p>Our children are very active and talented, presenting their plays quite often and always successfully. Whoever has once seen our children (our hope to the stage) act, will always take the opportunity to see them again. It is inspiring to watch their clever and talented acting, especially when the play is given in the Bohemian language.</p>
   <p>All these plays are examples of skill and very interesting. The teachers at the clubs and nursery teach and direct all plays. One must see these plays by our children before one can value the work of the teachers and the students; therefore we invite all who can possibly come to be present.</p>
