   <p>The students of F. J. Kolbaby's violin school introduced themselves to the public for the first time yesterday in their first annual concert.</p>
   <p>Boys and girls of various ages participated in this event. They all played very well, proving that Mr. F. J. Kolbaby is really a good teacher.</p>
   <p>Several adult students also participated in this concert to make it more appealing to the public. They were more advanced violinists who played pieces especially chosen for this occasion. Several of these students were forced to play encores to appease the great outbursts of applause which followed each number. These numbers consisted of solos and various arrangements.</p>
   <p>The best part of the program was the last number, which was played by Mr. F. J. Kolbaby, the teacher, who is a violin virtuoso. He played "Adagio <span class="page-break">2</span>from Berrio," and "Canzonetta from Ambrose," both numbers receiving an enormous ovation.</p>
   <p>In general the concert was a huge success. It proved what can be done under able leadership. Mr. F. J. Kolbaby's violin school is among the best Bohemian violin schools in the City of Chicago. Bohemian people, for the most part, are violin enthusiasts.</p>
