   <p>Mr. August Petrtyl was elected president of the artists' and sculptors' society, known as the Palette and Chisel Club, at the annual meeting held night before last in the Athenaea Building. Today's Chronicle contains a portrait of Mr. Petrtyl, and acclaims him as a well-known local painter and illustrator. Our readers also know and appreciate Mr. Petrtyl's work. Mr. Petrtyl was the illustrator of the "Calender Hlasatel" for 1906, and the illustration on our wall calendar was also made by him.</p>
