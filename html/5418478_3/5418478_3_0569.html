   <p>Last night the Slovak Band made their first public appearance in the hall of the Bohemian-English School and if we wish to be truthful we must admit that they made for themselves many friends and their performance was entirely satisfactory to the public.</p>
   <p>The program was begun with the national song "Kde domov muj"(Where Is My Home?) to which was added the " World March " by V. Resare of Prairie du Chien. The very first number pleased the audience in full and was received with unrestricted applause. The program was made up of the following additional numbers:-</p>

   <p>The band is made up of 25 musicians and the performance yesterday was under the leadership of the well-known composer and band-master J. Koula, Sr. to whom belongs in a large measure the credit for the success of the concert, and for showing what can be accomplished by good will.</p>
   <p>It is time that Chicago was able to have a strong band which does not primarily seek after profits but looks to music as an art.</p>
   <p>Success to the "Slovak" Band, its director,and to its future performances.</p>
