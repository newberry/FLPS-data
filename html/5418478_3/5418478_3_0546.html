   <p>Saturday our music loving public had the rare opportunity to attend a concert given by Mrs. Anny Lhotoko in Thalia hall. Alas, there were many who allowed the opportunity to slip by, consequently only a few attended. However the entire concert was grand. Every number was very interesting, but decidedly best were the numbers, in which we were able to hear Mrs. Lhotko in solo. She sings beautifully, her voice is strong and the fresh and colorful tones give it a special charm. Those who attended were reluctant to depart, for it may be some time before they have another opportunity to hear music so beautifully and sympathetically rendered.</p>
