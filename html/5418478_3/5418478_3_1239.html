   <p>We are still far from having a complete history of Bohemian-Americans; but should some able and unbiased writer ever record such a history, he would have to devote considerable space to a description of the development of the club life of our Bohemian-American branch [of the Czechoslovak people]. That this branch is rapidly growing is a well-known fact; a manifest proof of it is given by [some] of our great benevolent and mutual aid organizations; a still more eloquent proof is found, however, in the reports of the various brotherhoods and sisterhoods of an increased number of members. That most heartening phenomenon is observable, in the first place, in the truly astonishing growth and development of our greatest women's organization, officially known as the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Union).</p>
   <p>Yesterday that great body of women and girls, which by its long and successful career, and by its nationalistic and charitable work undeniably occupies one of the foremost positions in the life of the Czechs of America, reached <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the high-water mark in its membership, when it signed up its twenty-five thousandth member.</p>
   <p>It was to be expected that our ladies would celebrate such a significant event in an appropriately dignified and brilliant manner. After weeks of extensive preparation the actual celebration finally took place yesterday in the spacious hall of the Sokol Chicago, Kedzie Avenue and West 24th Street. The celebration was attended by a great number of members and friends of this, our largest women's organization, and was characterized by a program which was truly representative of the significance of the great event. The program began with the playing of the American national anthem. As soon as the inspiring strains of that hymn began to vibrate, there appeared an electrically lighted sign on the stage bearing the legend "25,000".....</p>
   <p>At the end of the anthem, during the playing of which the audience patriotically rose to its feet, the president of the Grand Lodge of the state of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Illinois, Mrs. Anna Brychta, addressed the assembled members. In a brief but hearty speech she recalled the bitter beginnings of the life of the organization, greeted the assembly, and then introduced Mrs. Karolina Rychlik, one of the original charter members of the Jednota, who came specially from Cleveland, Ohio, to be present at the celebration.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rychlik, who is the only surviving member of the group of women who founded the Jednota, had intended to thank the president for her words of praise and respect, but found it impossible because of the long-lasting and vociferous applause which greeted her appearance on the stage. When at last the storm of applause calmed down, the aged lady delivered her festive address, which was considered the gala number of the program. Mrs. Rychlik proved herself to be an excellent speaker, and it was a pleasure to listen to her address, which follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear guests and sisters! With a certain feeling of national pride but likewise of gratitude, springing from a knowledge of a patriotic duty done, I <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>take this opportunity to address you on the occasion when the Jednota Ceskych Dam, the strongest women's organization of our nation, has reached the unheard-of number of twenty-five thousand members. It was ever the love of their native land, coupled with the desire to improve the lot of that people, that gave us our origin, that surround the entire being and consciousness of the Czech immigrants. That this is so was demonstrated chiefly by the most famous Czech immigrant and teacher of the nations' Jan Amos Komensky (John Amos Comenius). That master spirit, imbued with a prophetic vision during Bohemia's greatest debacle, predicted a victory for his beloved Czech nation attended by a new glory yet to come. That prophecy has been fulfilled due to the effort of the greatest living [Bohemian]--Professor Masaryk, the efforts of the Czech legions, and the strong support given [to the cause of liberation] by America; and last but certainly not least, by the ample support given [that cause] by our sisterhood.</p>
   <p>"One could have spoken with an equally prophetic spirit about the future of our Jednota at the time of its birth. Yes, we had a prophetic vision when <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>we stood around the cradle of our glorious organization. Fifty-two years ago we planted a seedling of a tree from the tree of Bohemia between the Atlantic and the Pacific--in the city of Cleveland. That seedling sprouted, grew, increased in growth, became mighty in its growth, flourished and blossomed out in the red and white blossoms of Bohemia; it bore fruit and soon the songbirds inhabited its branches and built nests among them. We prophesied to the women of Czech origin that some day that tree would afford a shade within which they might rest pleasantly. O yes, it was all a dream, but a very live one, for it turned out to be real: The seedling actually grew, and mighty was its growth. It was the tree of the Jednota with its great wealth and its 145 strong branches, and what is more, with its 25,000 members, each member a lush green twig on that mighty tree. And what do the red and white blossoms of that tree symbolize? They are our national gifts, the patriotic names of the [145] branches, and, what is still more important, they represent the patriotic feelings of our Czech sisters. And the fruits borne by that tree? They are our benevolent acts in sickness and in death, and the shade of that tree affords protection to the unfortunate <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>sisters who become widows, or to the orphaned children of the sisters. The tree finally bears the slogan of the Jednota: 'Enlightenment gave birth to woman's freedom'.</p>
   <p>"And now a question crosses my mind and clamors for an answer: What were the causes of, and the conditions for, the successful growth of that gorgeous tree? Who was the gardener; who was its cultivator and protector? It was, first of all, the healthy trait of Czech human nature, which was ever characterized by its humaneness, its morality, and its desire for enlightenment. The second cause of the development of the tree of the Jednota was the free and fertile soil of the United States of America, a soil into which the healthy Czech seedling was glad to sink its roots. Finally the third cause of the successful growth of the tree of the Jednota was its conscientious nurses, the industrious women and gardeners, all of them women who were imbued with the spirit of Czechdom which, in its last analysis, is the spirit of sincerity, of truth culminating in sisterly love and in Free Thought. These women gardeners and nurses not only pruned away the sterile and dry shoots that <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>[occasionally] developed, but they were also able to rid the tree of all undesirable cankerworms; they cleared away the weeds which sought to grow alongside, and they aptly controlled the intrusive insects which might endanger the life of the tree by their parasitism. It was often a difficult and an unpleasant task. Let us hope that such tasks will not ever have to be performed again. Darkness and ignorance was, is, and will be the real reason for so much misery in this world, and, according to our own constitution, it is only the enlightened, freethinking woman who may have a place in our organization. Let the shining light of the Jednota cast its salutary, inspiriting beams first upon our own membership, and then upon our whole nation; let it enlighten us and our paths, so that we may soon be rid of our internal enemies and parasites. At the beginning of my speech I touched upon the greatness of our Comenius; it is now my desire to finish the speech by mentioning him again. That mental giant, when exiled in a foreign land, blessed his Czech people and, amongst other words, said the following: 'Live thou, O nation sanctified, and do not die. Let thy manhood increase constantly. Have faith and hope; yea, be assured that after the storms and <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>hurricanes have passed, the control of thy things shall return to thee.' And lo and behold! His bold prophecy came true after three hundred years, during the World War. As he thus called to his own folk so do I now call to the [members of the Jednota]: Live thou o beloved union; do not die but flourish and become mighty for the good of all Bohemian-Americans, and for the glory of the homeland, the old and the new. And let thy womanhood increase constantly."</p>
   <p>When this inspired address had been rewarded by a renewed burst of applause, and when Mr. Jurena's orchestra had displayed its musical abilities anew, there followed the presentation of an allegorical tableau representing the foundation and growth of the Jednota. It was preceded by a short and appropriate poem which was recited by Miss Olga Skaloud, who is one of the younger set of promising organizational powers which the Jednota harbors among its membership. Both the poem and the tableau were well rewarded by applause, which was meant for both the actual participants and for the [special] committee which arranged the scene of the festival. Then followed the <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>presentation of a diploma granted by the Grand Lodge of the State of New York to the Grand Lodge of the State of Illinois. The diploma was granted because of the very deserving organizational and other work done by the Illinois Grand Lodge for the welfare of the entire Jednota. It was handed over to Mrs. A. Brychta as the president of the Illinois Grand Lodge by Mrs. Anna Stolf, the retiring secretary of that lodge, and was accompanied by an appropriate speech by the retiring secretary. This ceremony was followed by the reading of a congratulatory message sent by the Ceska Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Benevolent Sisterhood) and expressed verbally [again] by Mrs. Marie Liska, the president of the [central] Grand Lodge of the sisterhood. This tense moment commanded the attention of the assemblage and was loudly acclaimed. The next item on the program was another allegorical tableau representing the numerical strength of the Jednota in the State of Illinois. It was as artistically arranged as its predecessor. When finally awards were presented to individual lodges for their publicity work...the program ended, and the entire assembly rose to sing the hymn "Hej Slovane!" (Hi, Slavs!) after which it was time to go home.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Taken as a whole, the success of the festival was great, and it will, no doubt, serve as a further inspiration to the members of Jednota. Especially deserving of mention were the stage decorations, consisting of flags belonging to the various lodges whose members attended the celebration. The effect these flags made was really grand and speaks well for the good taste of the festival committee. The orchestra, too, ought to be lauded for its faultless playing of the various operatic and concert pieces. Due to an unfortunate circumstance a congratulatory telegram sent to the Jednota by one of our foremost local countrymen, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, reached the hands of the festival committee too late to be read before the assemblage. It was received with gratitude, nevertheless, and a mention shall be made of it upon occasion.</p>
