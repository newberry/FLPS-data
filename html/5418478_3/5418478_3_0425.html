   <p>Mr. Joseph Houdek, leader of the Czech Workingmen's Chorus and the Central Singing Society, received a letter from Professor H. Pratt Judson, president of the University of Chicago, which reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Mr. Houdek: The uplifting singing by the United Singers of Dvořák's 'The American Flag' was enthusiastically appreciated by the audience assembled at Leon Mandel Hall on the occasion of Czech Day, November 14, 1917. It is, therefore, hardly necessary for me to express the feeling of appreciation and gratitude of the University of Chicago and its friends. It is a personal pleasure to thank you for the impressive artistic rendering of Dvořák's moving music. Please convey to your organization the heartfelt thanks of the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>"Harry Pratt Judson."</p>

   <p>A similar acknowledgment was sent to the Sokol organizations whose members, male and female, contributed so signally to the success of Czech Day by their exhibitions of the Sokol system of body culture. Mr. Jarka KoŠař, leader and teacher of the Sokols, was the recipient of the letter.</p>
