   <p>The State League of Building and Loan Associations in the State of Illinois held its forty-first convention in Quincy, Illinois, on October 13 and 14.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian building and loan associations, about 110 of them, were represented by the following Bohemian delegates:</p>
   <p>Messrs: Frank J. Petru, Konrad Ricker, Adolph Macal, V. F. Saller, Joseph Kohout, James J. Melich, George W. Kralovec, Anton Vanek, W. Beck, Karel Krabec, W. K. Pflaum, J. P. Krivanek, F. J. Mancl, F. Gallistel, B. J. Wach, James A. Calek, and J. L. Voborsky.</p>
   <p>The delegation boarded the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad train Tuesday evening at 10:30. All the delegates traveled together in one coach which <span class="page-break">\2</span>Mr. Frank J. Petru acquired for the convenience of all, and therefore there was no scarcity of entertainment during the trip. Before we realized the fact, we had arrived at our destination, at seven o'clock in the morning. After the usual procedure of securing accommodations at the Hotel Newcomb, every one was anxious for a breakfast to satisfy his hunger.</p>
   <p>Prior to the convention, a meeting of the executive committee of the State League was held, at which the preparatory work for the convention was done.</p>
   <p>About two hundred delegates from various parts of this state were present, and of course most of them came from Chicago. We who have participated in these conventions for a number of years have met the same old delegates, who come from year to year. It sometimes happens that here and there a delegate forever departs from our midst, but his place is taken by someone else who is just as sincerely interested in the building and loan associations as was his predecessor.</p>
   <p>On October 13 at the stroke of ten in the morning, the convention was called to <span class="page-break">\3</span>order by the president of the State League, Mr. O. M. Owings of Mattoon, Illinois....</p>
   <p>From the annual report of the secretary, Mr. M. E. Vasena, it is apparent that there are 886 building and loan associations in the State of Illinois...In Chicago there are 128 Bohemian building and loan associations with a membership of 45,000....</p>
   <p>Another speech worthy of mention was presented by Mr. James A. Calek, delegate of the Alliance of Bohemian Building and Loan Associations of Chicago, who spoke upon the theme, "The Advertisement of Building and Loan Associations". Mr. Calek first mentioned why the building and loan associations should advertise, where to advertise, and how to advertise. In the first part of his speech he stated that advertising has several purposes--that is, to educate and inform, to encourage thrift and the placing of savings in good securities, etc. Beside this, it should acquaint the people with the real purpose of building and loan associations. The main centers of advertisements are the newspapers, and these should be considered the hub of all advertising, because <span class="page-break">\4</span>they are read by a great number of people. Through the newspapers, the building and loan associations can get in touch with people, respective readers of this or that newspaper. Newspaper advertising undoubtedly is a most inexpensive and effective method. One advertisement in a newspaper is read by perhaps one hundred thousand people, a system which is much cheaper than sending the same advertisement to one hundred thousand people individually.</p>
   <p>Another kind of advertising is the use of various posters and stickers, which should be displayed in business places, offices, street cars, or public places; circulars and pamphlets should be distributed to homes in various neighborhoods, etc. No matter what method is employed, each has its own influence and effect. But inasmuch as the building and loan associations encourage thrift, teaching thrift and the deposit of savings, they should also see that each expenditure is economical and that it has a certain effect upon the public.</p>
   <p>Further he mentioned the educational propaganda undertaken by the Alliance of Bohemian Building and Loan Associations of Chicago. Several years ago the Alliance published a pamphlet explaining the purpose and activity of building <span class="page-break">\5</span>and loan associations. It also publishes its own official journal, the purpose of which is to educate directors and officers. Just recently a special course of lectures concerning only the conduct of building and loan associations has been started. Further, Mr. Calek advocated that contact with various large industrial enterprises be established, particularly with executive officers, urging them to see that leaders of various departments encouraged their workingmen to deposit their savings in dependable institutions, especially to become members of building and loan associations, and to deposit their savings there because it is most dependable. He mentioned a few examples where this had been achieved. His views and proposals were received with splendid applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Calek then stated that at the present time the Alliance of Bohemian Building and Loan Associations is taking into consideration the necessity of merging the smaller building and loan associations with large associations, for the reason that the small associations do not prosper, do not grow, and only exist to the detriment of some other association. The unification may be accomplished in a very simple manner. When members of those associations agree <span class="page-break">\6</span>upon the unification and it is accomplished, then the amount of money paid upon the shares of the incoming association is transferred to the other association according to the maturity of this or that series and the matter is taken care of. If there happen to be one, two, or three weeks' difference, then this can easily be adjusted by paying one, two, or three weeks longer or by not paying at all for this period, as the case may be, so that the difference can be adjusted. This, too, was the opinion of the representative of the state auditor when he was asked about this matter.....</p>
   <p>During the session, a laudatory remark was made about the Bohemian associations, and they were proclaimed to be an example for other associations in the State of Illinois.....</p>
