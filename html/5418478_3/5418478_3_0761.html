   <p>In the latter half of next month, a new play will be presented in Chicago by the Ludvik Dramatic Company from the pen of R. J. Psenka under the title of "Svatecni Diplomate" (The Holiday Diplomats) or "Bila-Cevena Versus Cerno-Zluta" (White Red Versus Black Yellow.)</p>
   <p>As is evident from the head-lines the play is motivated from Czech-American environment, and also from the present stirring times of our world conflict and repercussions affecting the Czech nation, where the American Czechs strive with all their might to help their people and to make Czechy a better and a happier place to live.</p>
   <p>The author informs us that the play is very serious in intent, and its very patriotic leanings will make the play a good vehicle for the endeavors of our many patriotic societies among the Czechs in America.</p>

   <p>This play depicts the strivings of the American Czechs to help their brothers in Europe during the great war.</p>
   <p>Although the scenes of the play take place in Chicago, Paris and in Washington, D.C., the play is so arranged that our amateur dramatic societies will have no difficulty with its presentation, and that it will be a source of enrichment for the repertoire of many societies with a play of histrionic worth.</p>
   <p>The staging of this play will be awaited by our theater well-wishers with a natural interest and eagerness.</p>
   <p>The author is announcing that he will have a certain number of copies of his play ready by the first part of March, for a few amateur dramatic companies, who may care to avail themselves of securing copies during this season. All inquiries will be answered by the author, at 1817 Millard Avenue, Chicago.</p>
