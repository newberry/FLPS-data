   <p>The Ludvikovo Divadlo (The Frank Ludvik Dramatic Association) begins its thirtieth season on Sunday, September 17. A comedy novelty, which attained success on the Prague stage, will have its premiere on that day. It is really a musical comedy, and, as its name, "Vlastencove z Boudy" (Patriots from a Shack), indicates, it will be chock-full of good humor and comical situations leading to many guffaws of laughter....The management of the Divadlo, which is just beginning its thirtieth season in America, is well equipped both as regards personnel and repertory, and also has uncommonly good stage settings. It will therefore uphold the good name and fine reputation which this theater has always enjoyed, and which has been an important cultural product of the American branch of our Bohemian nation. The management is fully aware of the importance of its cultural and national mission, and by its dramatic work adds to the recognition of the cultural efforts of our nationality. That management endeavors to keep the work of the permanent Divadlo at a high level but adjusted to present conditions. It must be said that our permanent <span class="page-break">\2</span>Bohemian stage is looked upon with appreciation by other foreign-language groups, some of which, though much stronger numerically than we are, do not possess an institution of this kind.....</p>
