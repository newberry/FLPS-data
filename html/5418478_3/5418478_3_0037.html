   <p>Proof of the growth and development of any community is the establishment of banking institutions within it. Therefore, the recent organization of a new Czech banking institution in Berwyn, Illinois, furnishes such proof. It is quite an event for our community. The Czechoslovak banking system has won for itself undoubted prestige, for wherever a Czech settlement is founded, there also, sooner or later, a Czech bank is established. This is the result of the thrift and effort of our people.</p>
   <p>The Berwyn community is one of our most promising Czech settlements; and here a new Czech bank will open its doors next Saturday. Its name will be the Berwyn Trust and Savings Bank. Among the board of directors are the following: Messrs. Louis Stastny, J. A. Vasumpaur, M.D., and John Krivanek.</p>

   <p>These names are a guarantee that every one of our countrymen will be honestly and efficiently served by this new bank, and we hope that this new Czechoslovak enterprise will find favor with all of our public. The bank is located on Oak Park Avenue, near the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad.</p>
