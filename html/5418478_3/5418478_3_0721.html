   <p>Twenty-five years ago a question frequently debated among us was, "Is it possible to establish a theater where professional actors could present to our public those things which, as a matter of course, are lacking in an amateur theater? Today, after one quarter of a century, this question has become obsolete. It has given way to the problem of how to maintain our stage in Chicago in the future.</p>
   <p>Our first permanent Czech stage here had to overcome many obstacles before it was set upon a firm foundation. If there were no war, no one of us would have to worry about the future. The war, however, has altered conditions in our national endeavor, and consequently, in our theatrical affairs as well. When the Ludvik theatrical troupe came here from Bohemia twenty-five years ago, our amateur stage had reached a high point of prosperity. Performances were given frequently, in various halls. There were many members in amateur associations. They ventured to produce pieces which our amateurs would consider too difficult today. We did not have any "dramatic artists" in those days. No one, at the same time, spoke of amateur actors as "amateur artists," but the playing was rather good and the attendance ample.</p>
   <p>This factor--the good attendance--fomented the idea among our people that Czech Chicago had matured into the phase where a permanent professional theater was desirable. Experience proved that this reasoning was correct. The transition from the amateur to the professional stage was not easily accomplished, true enough. Though our public was enthusisastic about the grade of perfection exhibited by the actors, and the attendance assumed almost gigantic proportions, things changed after the Chicago World's Fair. Hard times visited our community. Little wonder that our theater was hit first! Besides, more halls were being built, and more amateur associations sprang up. The attendance in the professional theater began to lag. There were grave misgivings about the future.</p>
   <p>Those who have been following the vicissitudes of the Ludvik troupe know what struggles it had to go through before it was recognized as a permanent national institution, and before it could grow strong enough in American soil to see its existence secured. If our theater was able to survive the storms and come out unscathed, the credit is due to the persistence with which Frank Ludvik and each individual member fought back the repeated onslaughts. The actors were pioneers, and as such had to shoulder the brunt of the battle, just as any other new institution. Many a tale of bitter disappointments could be narrated by old-timers of the Ludvikovci, the first professional Czech actors' combination in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Times changed for the better, and it became evident that there was room enough not only for one or two, but even for three professional Czech stages in Chicago. This is not an impossibility, considering the large Czech population here. Three halls, each filled once a week, should be easy to support. In normal times, and with a steady increase in immigration, it should be considered as a matter of course. It has often been branded as ridiculous to believe that Chicago, with the largest Czech community in America and the third largest Czech city in the world, could not support three performances a week. The city of Pilsen (Plzen in Bohemia) has its daily performance on a high artistic level. The reason for our situation is to be found in the similarity between the conditions prevailing in our Czech theatrical world and our Czech associations, clubs, etc. Our young people, brought up and educated in America, stray from our organizations so that, barring some praiseworthy exceptions, it is the less Americanized part of our community to which our organizations have to turn for new members. They are those who do not shun our Czech theaters. This is a sad state of affairs, but it is not incomprehensible.</p>
   <p>These established facts did not attract too much attention before the War broke out, because losses caused by the straying of our Czech-American youth were made good by new immigrants who could, naturally, feel at home only in Czech organizations, entertainments, and in our theaters. For the past four years, no Czech immigrants have arrived here to fill the depleted ranks in our national life. The consequences of this are being felt now, and they will become more serious if no favorable change occurs.</p>
   
   <p>This would lead us to believe that the war influences our theaters unfavorably. But reports from Europe contradict this conclusion. The National Theater in Prague can point to record attendances surpassing those before the outbreak of the War. Paris and London theaters are also prosperous, while the very opposite is true of our Chicago Czech stages.</p>
   <p>Here, it seems to us, we are facing a situation similar to the one twenty-five years ago. We asked ourselves at that time whether it was possible to maintain one Czech theater here. Now we are asking whether three stages can be supported. This is a very serious question, as evidenced by the results of the past season and a few preceding it. We hope that this will change and that our public will feel more strongly attracted to the Czech theater. This should also furnish food for thought for our theatrical circles now enjoying their seasonal vacation.</p>
