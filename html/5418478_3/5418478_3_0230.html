   <p>It is about a month since the officers of the "Karluv Tyn" Building and Loan Association, which has its offices at 4958 South Winchester Avenue, had their attention called to various irregularities brought about by the Association's notary. They were cautioned by the state examiner Mr. Rudolph Mulac during an examination of the Association's books. The irregularities were mostly concerned with new loans amounting to $11,000 and some renewals of old loans.</p>
   <p>During the year 1910, a total of six new loans amounting to $11,000 were made.</p>
   <p>None of these loans had the proper papers made out nor were the loans guaranteed because the "Trust Deeds" were not recorded. There was a possibility that some of the properties upon which the loans were made might be sold and the Association would not have any right to collect the loaned money.</p>
   <p>In two cases the "Warranty Deeds" were not recorded, so that the original owners of the property were free to do whatever they wished, whereby the present <span class="page-break">2</span>owners and the Building and Loan Association stood to lose everything they put into the property.</p>
   <p>Also, the insurance on the property upon which the Association had made loans was not assigned to the Association, and here again the Association could have lost a considerable amount of money. As has been said already Mr. Mulac, during the examination of the Association's books, took note of the threatened danger and summoned Mr. J.F. Bambas, a real estate dealer and notary public, to inquire into everything and so far as possible put everything in order. This he did with the consent of the Association and its notary and to their satisfaction he completed his task yesterday. There is no further need to have any fear, and neither the Association nor the depositors will lose anything, because the expenses incurred in this transaction by Mr. Bambas will be paid by the Association's notary.</p>
