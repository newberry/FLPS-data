   <p>The list of successes and glories of the violin king Franz Ondricek was augmented by yesterday's concert in Falcon Pilsen Hall.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's Bohemian concert of Franz Ondricek was frequented not only by prominent Bohemians from Chicago, but from other distant Bohemian centers.</p>
   <p>We noticed among others the prominent physician, Mr. Scvera from Cedar Rapids, Carl Proharka from Peoria, Ill. Norbert Voit from St. Louis, and many others. All Bohemian communities were richly represented. Before 8 P. M. all seats were sold out at high prices. The hall was filled with the elite of Bohemian society in Chicago. The program was mostly of choicest national pieces interpreted by Franz Ondricek. Also on the program were Mrs. Anna Hlavacek -Ondricek, soprano; trio for piano, violin and cello played by Messrs. Holub, Capak and Karas, and A. Ernst, baritone.</p>
   <p>Endless bravos and encores showed the enthusiastic approval of the audience.- The concert was followed by a banquet for the invited guests.</p>
