   <p>As in previous years, there is being held, this year, at the exhibition building, an exhibition of creative and artistic works, and with great pleasure we note, that in the art section, we come upon the work of a Bohemian Artist, a work acknowledged by critics, with unusual praise. The picture exhibited is the work of our well-known painter, Mrs. Koupal-Lusk, and depicts an old-maid seated on a chair. In her hand she holds a book, the pages of which almost all have been read, the old maid is coming to the end of the book---and is reflecting.</p>
   <p>Looking upward, it seems as though she had been reading from the book of her life, thinking over the experiences of the past. The painting is very appropriately titled, The Beginning of the Last Chapter."</p>
   <p>The coloring of the painting is perfect, the subject well chosen and artistically executed, so that we can only congratulate our artist for her work.</p>
