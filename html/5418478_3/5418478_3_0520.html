   <p>p. 1. The Mc Vicker Theatre seemed insufficient to accommodate the multitude which flocked to attend the concert of Jan Kubelik yesterday afternoon. Long before 3 p. m., the hour set for the beginning, the place was completely sold out, and packed with a crowd surcharged with anticipation; the stage was jammed with extra seats so that the artist himself found scant freedom of movement. A considerable contingent was added to the audience by the arrival of the Czech fellow countrymen of the artist who came to revel in the enchanting tones lured from his rare Italian violin and to rejoice over his triumphs.</p>
   <p>The compositions chosen were of the highest plane of artistic discrimination. The artist could not, true enough, restrict himself to the pieces announced in print, for so overwhelming was the reception given each rendition that many encores had to follow.</p>
   
   <p>Mlle. Roy, pianist, who is touring with Kubelik as assisting artiste participated in the honors showered upon Kubelik; she owes a debt to Mr. Frohman, who as Kubelik's manager has given her an excellent opportunity to make her art known to the general public.</p>
   <p>The program contained such names as Chopin, Schumann, Spohr, Tchajkovski, Fibich, Paganini, Saint-Saens and Wieniawski. It is the peculiarity of Kubelik's art that impresses the musical epicure, the initiated connoisseur and at the same time never fails in its effect upon the untutored masses.</p>
   <p>The composition by Fibich "Poetic Moods," evoked emotional response; native Americans joined the numerous Czech listeners in enthusiastic applause. The splendid performance closed with the presentation of gorgeous floral offerings for the artist.</p>
   
   <p>Kubelik will be heard again in the matinee arranged for Saturday afternoon in Orchestra Hall. We are informed that Kubelik is not to appear in the special concert for his countrymen during this tour as he is bound by contract to Mr. Frohman.</p>
   <p>Critics of the American language papers manifest great admiration for Kubelik. After the first of the concerts given by him W. L. Hubbard of the Chicago Tribune wrote an article most flattering to the artist. This critic is known to analyze artistic accomplishments with the sober mien of the trained musician, who abandons himself only rarely to boundless enthusiasm. Of Kubelik he writes today: "After Kubelik had finished his last encore the audience appeared to have reached the high point of rapture. He certainly possesses the power that penetrates the very heart, and he is one of the few whose success is assured, no matter when and where they play."</p>
   
   <p>Equal, and even more unrestrained praise is accorded to the artist in other newspapers. What we Czechs feel during a Kubelik concert cannot of course, be depicted. Kubelik's countrymen will always be the first to gather at his concerts, even if there came ten in succession, and the oftener and longer they listen the more fascinated they will grow. It is the effect of Czech music upon Czech hearts.</p>
