   <p>Yesterday's performance of the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Frantisek Ludvik's Bohemian Dramatic Society of Chicago) was a keen disappointment not only to the members of the troupe, who had expected that last night would contribute a nice amount to our patriotic funds, but to everyone who had thought that yesterday's performance would demonstrate the patriotism of our theater-going public. It was just the opposite. Instead of a full house, the Thalia Hall oozed emptiness. No doubt it was the smallest audience of this season.</p>
   <p>This year has been a very poor one for our theaters in general, and one would not be so surprised by the failure of last night if it were not for the fact that the performance was given for a patriotic purpose and a full house should therefore have been expected.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Tvrzicky-Kramer made a short address to the audience after the second act. He talked with enthusiasm about the importance of the theater and the patriotism of the theater-going public--which, alas, was mostly absent that night--and thanked at least those who had come for their presence....</p>
