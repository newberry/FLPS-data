   <p>(The Cross By The Brook) given last night was enjoyed by an overflowing attendance of a select part of our public. The play presents a charming picture of country-life, and the participants were accorded a hearty acknowledgement for their efforts. Especially "Evicka" (Eva) as played by Mrs. M. Vaskova, and"Stepan Potockych " (Stephan Potocky) as played by Mr. Koerner, who were accorded the highest laurels of the evening.</p>
   <p>Through we have not seen Mrs. Marie Vaskova play in recent years we were able to recognize in her characterizations the same dynamic force as of yore. Mr. J. Benes played the part of "Ambroz" with utmost perfection, and Miss Papik playing the part of "Marian" was also very much liked. Mr. E. Hasse was very original in his portrayal of the "Landlord." Miss A, Jurkova was excellent in her characterization of the "Miller's Daughter." The various other characters were a great help in rounding out <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a fine performance. The decorations were beautiful. Since this is the last performance under the direction of Mr. James Kostner, it is hoped that under the new director the Bohemian Theatre may be equally successful.</p>
