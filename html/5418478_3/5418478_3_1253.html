   <p>Those who enjoy a good old-fashioned type of entertainment will be pleased to hear that the Klub Ceskoslovenskych Spojencu (Czechoslovak Allies Club) has been busy preparing an old Czech harvest festival. The festival will be held in the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies') Hall, West 18th and South May Streets, tomorrow night at 8 P.M. Many of our countrymen who will attend this festival will come in national peasant costumes, and the committee has already prepared some special prizes to be awarded for the most typical peasant costume, (both male and female.)</p>
   <p>In brief, it will be a true old Czech entertainment characterized by its hearty good humor and lack of restraint. There will be fun from beginning to end. The music will be furnished by Mr. Konvalinka's orchestra. Admission is 50 cents per person.</p>
