   <p>A new State Bank, which will be an all-Czech enterprise, will be open for business in Česká Kalifornia (Bohemian California, a district on the west side) after January 1, 1912. The new bank will be a merger of the banking houses of Mr. F. G. Hajiček and Messrs. Salát, Polák and Kopecky. Until such time as the new bank begins to operate, the present institutions will continue to do business independently. The location for the new bank has not yet been decided upon, but all indications are that a new building will be erected which will provide all modern banking conveniences.</p>
   <p>The State Auditor, J. S. McCullough, already has issued the necessary permit for the organization of the new bank. The State Bank will not actually be a new enterprise, which would increase competition in that field, but merely a merger of two old banks.</p>
