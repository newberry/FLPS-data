   <p>At last an accord has been reached. It has been agreed that the Posvicenska Slavnost (Country-wake Festival) will be arranged under the auspices of the Bohemian Free Thought teachers, and that all the sincere patrons of the schools and the Bohemian people in general be asked to put their shoulders to the wheel and help to make the success of this Festival possible. By this action also all the disputes will be settled. This agreement has met with the approval of the Bohemian people and a new harmonious activity can be seen everywhere.....</p>
   <p>The only things which are yet needed to make the success of the Posvicenska Slavnost possible, are favorable weather conditions and the attendance of our countrymen in great numbers.</p>
