   <p>This Young and zealous Club has had several opportunities to appear before our wider public, and its dramatic performances are always well attended. Its rehearsals and stage technique lead to exemplary theatrical productions. The Club at present is rehearsing "Diblik, Sotek Z Hor" (Little Devil or the Mountain Goblin) which is to be given tomorrow in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), 18th and May Streets. We hope that the attendance will be large enough to warrant the zeal of the members of the Club. Particularly should our young people attend this performance which begins sharply at 8 P. M.....The proceeds will go to the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools).</p>
