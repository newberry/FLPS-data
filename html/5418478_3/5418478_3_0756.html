   <p>Last night the Ludvík Theatrical Company appeared for the last time, but one, in this season. "Noc Na Karlštejně" (A Night On the Karštejn) was selected for the occasion. This comedy, by the foremost Czech poet Jaroslav Vrchlický, has always been one of the best drawing cards; it is one of the best works of our great poet and playwright; it has always been treated with special reverence by the Ludvík group, not only as to detail in characterization, but in the staging as well. The performance was an unqualified success. The best in the cast were Mr. Horlivyaý as "King Karl IV," and Mrs. Horlivý as the queen. The other roles were entrusted to actors, mostly new in their parts, some of whom performed their roles in an excellent manner. Special mention is due Professor Capek, who arranged for music that furnished a genuine Czech background.</p>
