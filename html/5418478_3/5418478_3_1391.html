   <p>...To the Czechoslovaks two days have been allotted for special activities and display at the War Fair which is to be held from September 2 to September 15 on the Lake Front. We shall have to prepare properly for those two days. Czechoslovaks must appear in impressive numbers at that event. Aside from sheer curiosity, consciousness of the portentous times in which we live should be the guiding spirit. Great issues depend upon our showing, and we must not miss this opportunity.....</p>
   <p>The War Fair is not designed as a money-making proposition--its purpose is to exhibit samples, to demonstrate to the people with what means a war is carried on, and how to wrest victory from the enemy.</p>
   <p>Admission to this fair is fifty cents. Tickets may, however, be bought for twenty-five cents now, before the fair is opened. Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chairman of the Ceska Uradovna (Czech Bureau), was notified by Mr. F. Streyckman that tickets are being bought with eagerness. One German club bought a thousand dollars worth. The Swedish societies have signed up for 25,000 tickets. The Czechoslovaks, it is estimated, will buy 50,000 tickets. We do not doubt that the actual purchases will reach this figure.....</p>
