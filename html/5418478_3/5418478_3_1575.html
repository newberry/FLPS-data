   <p>p.1.--With very favorable weather last Sunday, the Grand Lodge of C.S.P.S. (Cesko-Slovansky-Podporujici-Spolek) Czecho-Slovak-Benevolent Association, held its annual picnic in the beautiful Palos Park Grove. The arrangements committee in fact could not select a better grove. The grove is surrounded by a thick forest, heavily laden with foliage of leaves. The grove is situated on a hill, thus showing a beautiful view. We are very sorry to mention the attendance was not to our expectation; this refers especially to the members of the Grand Lodge. The managing committee estimated about five thousand but instead there were approximately twelve hundred according to the gate receipts. Of these twelve hundred there were but five hundred members of the association.</p>

   <p>It was taken into consideration that there were many other picnics held last Sunday by other organizations, but more members were expected to attend this annual picnic.</p>
   <p>It is not up to us to find excuses why the members failed to attend, but we do say the committee did over-estimate. The young folks were happily enjoying themselves in the dance pavilion. The orchestra leader was Mr. Brousek. The music played pleased the dancers so well, they applauded for an enchore each time, and each time they were accomodated. Near the pavilion was a restaurant, where not only sandwiches were served, but full meals also, and at very reasonable prices. Another nearby stand offered games of chance with many beautiful prizes for the lucky winners. The bowling alleys were well patronized and so was the shooting gallery; they both brought in large sums of money. The bar was well occupied all day, and this too was very profitable, and Mr. Pecha was on hand selling tickets in exchange for beer, wine, whisky and soda.</p>

   <p>This picnic was conducted in an orderly way. All those present conducted themselves in such a polite, respectable manner, that there was no need of the two policemen detailed to this picnic. These policemen were gone most of the time. They came back later in the day and, finding that everything was peaceful, made the remark that the Bohemians certainly were a peaceful lot. This is creditable to the Bohemians, always polite, conducting themselves like ladies and gentlemen.</p>
   <p>This picnic was a success in spite of the small attendance because those present were good spenders. Even though the committee erred in its estimation, it is to be congratulated for its efforts to make this picnic a success. Those who served on the committee were: Messrs. John Pecha, as chairman of the committee, Joseph Smejkal, Otto Rychtarik, Dr. J. Wedeles, V. Dobias, V. Bouchek, J. Novak, and J. Hladovec. Everyone went home happy and satisfied, having enjoyed a good time.</p>
