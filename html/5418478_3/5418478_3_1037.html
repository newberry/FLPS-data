   <p>p. 1, col. 3.. Yesterday belonged to our popular and, well known to our Bohemian public, Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society, which held a festive meeting, in its quarters for its deserving active members and particularly for the ladies division "Hlahol" and "Maj," in celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of its organization.</p>
   <p>This festive meeting was brought to order by the chairman, Mr. Jos. Rands, who welcomed all of the participants with a few sincere words, at the same time pointing our the significance of the occasion, following which the men's chorus sang "Cesky Lev." Miss Julia Vokoun recited with great success B. Bittner's poem about the fifteen years' existence of the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society.</p>
   <p>The old ranger and co-founder, Mr. Joseph Hrusa, gave a minute sketch of the history, activities and financial standing of the society, after which the members of the women's branches "Hlahol" and "Maj" rendered the delightful song "Na Nebi Mesic s Hvezdami" (The Moon and Stars in Heaven); this number <span class="page-break">2</span>was generously applauded.</p>
   <p>Prof. J. J. Kral's festive speech was really the pearl of the celebration. He took for his theme "The spirit of national songs" and in his humor laden speech, quoted texts and melodies of individual Bohemian songs, first he referred to what our national Bohemian songs mean to us Bohemians, those songs, which were the only solace of the Bohemian people when they found themselves in subjugation; in them is pictured the life of the whole Bohemian nation and this national gem of ours, this priceless possession was fostered in this foreign land by our Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society for the past fifteen years.</p>
   <p>This society is deserving of recognition for the work it has done. This society was the first to found a singing school for children. This school under the direction of the successful choir-master, Mr. Kalas, continues to grow to this day. It is hardly necessary to enter into detail about the activities of the society, for the Bohemian public is sufficiently informed that the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society, from the date of its organization has always stood at the forefront of the national life of Chicago Bohemians, appeared and took part willingly on every occassion free of charge, even if at times it received for its generosity and effort only ingratitude. In spite of many hardships and deficiencies, which the society had to overcome in the beginning, its ranks are <span class="page-break">3</span>growing constantly, and there remains nothing for us except to wish the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society well in their further meritorious activities.</p>
