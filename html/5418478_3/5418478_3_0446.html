   <p>Mr. Vaclav E. Medek, a graduate of the Prague Conservatory of Music, introduced himself to our public in a most advantageous manner in an independent concert held in the hall of Sokol Chicago yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Medek, some five years ago, before his departure to Prague, said good-by to us in a concert arranged by his teacher; Professor [Joseph] Vilim, in the hall of Sokol Pilsen, he seemed to give great promise for the future, and that he more than kept such promise, he demonstrated last Saturday.....</p>
   <p>His first number was Wieniawski's "Romance", ....followed by Dvorak's "Mazurka" and Bach's "Ciaconna"....but the true fire of his individuality appeared to greatest advantage in Czajkowski's long "Concerto in D major, Opus 35".....</p>
   <p>Fibich's "Basen" (Poem) in Kubelik's brilliant arrangement, and Dvorak's "Humoresque" concluded the concert.....</p>

   <p>Miss Xenie Wechert, our promising piano virtuoso, appeared with Mr. Medek, both as a soloist and as his accompanist.....She played Chopin, Liszt, Dvorak, Smetana, and Saint-Saens with equal understanding and perfection.....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Topinka, the popular singer, delighted the audience with the "Cavatina" from Gounod's "Queen of Sheba."</p>
   <p>The attendance exceeded all expectations.....</p>
