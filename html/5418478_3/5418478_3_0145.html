   <p>The development of Czech business in Chicago did not take place at an early date in our history. There were not many of our pioneers who could have taken the risk of trading on a large scale. The first Czechs who ventured into business could tell stories of sleepless nights and worry. Many small department stores failed. No department stores were in the hands of Czechs until the year 1889, when Mr. John J. Svoboda founded one. It is still in existence and is flourishing, and may be designated as the first of its kind operated by a Czech in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Svoboda was born in Chvaletice, near Protivin, Bohemia, fifty-four years ago. When he was still of school age, the entire family left the old country and came to the United States. At that time emigration from Czech lands was in full vogue; everybody wanted to try America "for good luck". They had visions <span class="page-break">\2</span>of better living conditions, for they were getting disgusted with the way things were being done in the motherland. We find the family settled in Chicago in 1868 the terminal point of their long journey.</p>
   <p>After having become acquainted with the advantages of the community, they sent young John to Walsh School, which was at that time situated at the corner of West 20th and South Johnson Streets. The boy studied the English language diligently and made excellent progress in other subjects, so that after graduation his father sent him to Foster School to further his education. He was also sent to St. Vaclav (St. Venzeslas) School, to keep in contact with the Czech language. For a time John attended the St. Franciscus School, then on West Twelfth Street and Newberry Avenue, to learn German.</p>
   <p>A business school, which suited the boy's early and distinct inclinations, finished his educational program.</p>

   <p>He then found employment in the John Langerman dry goods store on Archer Avenue, and then worked at Klein Brothers on South Halsted and West 20th Streets. He opened his own store in 1889 under the name "Svoboda's Bargain House," on 1255 West 22nd Street. His sound business principles assured him of success from the start.</p>
   <p>In the year 1904 he was already in a position to build his own establishment on 1327-29 West 22nd Street, where he reopened a larger store under the name "Grand Leader". It is still in existence and still prospering.</p>
   <p>Mr. Svoboda has been married since 1898 and lives with his family in Oak Park. Although he grew up in America, he nevertheless remained a Czech; a fact which he displays at every opportunity. There is not a single Czech national or humanitarian enterprise to which he would not extend his aid. He is a charter member of what was once the Plzenski Mladenci [Pilsen Bachelors' Club]; of Sokol Chicago; the Ceska Beseda [Czech Club]; and others. Mr. Svoboda is not only a good Czech, but also a sincere and ardent American patriot.</p>
