   <p>The exhibition of the Gymnastic Unit of Sokol Progress (Telocvičná Jednota Sokol Pokrok), held in a hall on 47th Street and Winchester Avenue, in Town of Lake, will end today.</p>
   <p>As customary--that the ends call for music--the close of the program will be the climax of the exhibition's splendid success.</p>
   <p>Today the exhibition will open at two o'clock in the afternoon. A great number of people are expected to attend, partly to enjoy the program and partly to show their friendship toward this energetic Sokol group. Today's program is exceptionally attractive.</p>
   <p>Lhotak's band will once more demonstrate that it is one of the best.</p>
