   <p>A mass meeting of the Borivoj Building and Loan Association, held yesterday afternoon, disposed of a number of weighty resolutions, which should prove very salutary for the future welfare of the organization.</p>
   <p>This meeting was called primarily for the purpose of the airing of the very regrettable "Musil" affair, which created such an upheaval, and which threatened to undermine the confidence our people always have placed in our organization. The second reason for the call was to have the membership decide what is to be done about our Auditorium building, which is becoming a heavy burden, and which was, to say the least, a very unwise purchase.</p>
   <p>These two matters of business proved to be subjects of utmost importance to the very large gathering of members of Borivoj.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The action of this meeting finally resulted in a decision to elect a new board of directors in place of the old one which has so long controlled the organization, and which was responsible for the "Musil" defraud.</p>
   <p>As was not expected, the meeting was a very stormy one, and soon resulted in angry arguments among the members.</p>
   <p>Mr. Evzen Frvdl, the chairman, was the first to speak; he told the members that they need have no fears for their organization, because, as he said, it was progressing wonderfully.</p>
   <p>The organization membership numbers over 1,000; the loans on property total $327,270; loans on account to members amount to $51,336; unpaid deposits total $23,496; and the total assets are $540,496. The number of shares owned by members is between 14,000 and 15,000.</p>
   <p>The organization, therefore, rests upon a very sound basis, and is one of the strongest.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>After this introduction, Mr. Frydl spoke of the matter which is of such interest and importance, but which is also a very painful experience--the way business has been transacted up to date.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frydl brought out a collection of charges against the former directors, and also against those who are still holding office (excepting those who just lately were elected to office); these last are guided by a sincere desire to bring better business methods to the offices they now hold.</p>
   <p>The older outgoing directors were blamed by the speaker for not having a broad enough outlook, and for direct neglect of duties.</p>
   <p>The speaker pointed out that the directors took over the building and paid an enormous price for it, in order to collect moneys due from the defunct Bazaar which did business in the Auditorium building, and that they absolved the directors of the Bazaar of all financial responsibilities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>He pointed out that, by this move, the organization was considerably hurt, and that the decision of the directors was inimical to the best interests of the organization.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frydl went on to say that $117,000 was paid for the Auditorium with all equipment, and the building now does not bring a cent of profit; on the contrary the building is a white elephant; we are unable to secure tenants, even when they are offered free rent for long terms. And when a buyer presented himself, a short time ago, and offered $85,000 for the building, the sale did not go through because of the neglect of some of the old directors who failed to grasp that fine offer.</p>
   <p>The old directors were further blamed by the speaker for not having instituted legal proceedings against the bonding company which posted a $2,000 indemnity for Mr. Musil; if the action had been taken immediately after the fraud occured, the bonding company would have been forced to pay; but with the tardy action of the directors, the matter was concealed from the rank and file of the members; today all that money is lost.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The directors were guilty of an unauthorized move, the chairman said, when they granted Mr. Falta a loan of $1,000 on a plain promissory note, although the bylaws state that every loan must be secured by property, and that through these irregularities $500 more had been lost by a similar loan to Mr. Smaha, who later went into bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>And again, went on the chairman, $1,204 was lost--money which Mr. Malezan should have paid the organization; but he also went into bankruptcy and was therefor freed from further responsibility. Not one of these loans was secured by property.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frydl said that all these discrepancies cannot be charged to Mr. Musil alone; others must have had their fingers in the pie.</p>
   <p>Mr. Musil could not have borrowed on the deposit books of members without the knowledge of the auditing committee; the holders of these deposit books, if members of the auditing committee, were remiss in their duty. And the shady <span class="page-break">\6</span>transactions of some of these officials were fully clarified, not only by Mr. Frydl, but also by Mr. Vesely.</p>
   <p>The last-named gentleman related that the auditing committee did not count the loans on property and on deposit books, and that actually 113 deposit books were missing at the time of the audit. This mismanagement was not accounted for until the election of some of the new officials. These new officials began to expose the inefficiency of the old officials, but had a very difficult task to perform, because they were in the minority, and the old regime made it difficult for the new officials to function properly. Nevertheless, at last the better element among the officials gained the ascendancy and started a thorough house cleaning.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frydl asked Attorney Halik to take up the case of the bogus checks drawn by Mr. Musil, an ex-official of the Borivoj Building and Loan Association. Mr. Halik tried to collect the amounts the checks represented. The banks agreed to pay very small sums in each instance, and the offer was refused.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Mr. Halik was ordered to institute suit to recover the full amounts of the checks which amount to $2,700.</p>
   <p>.....There were certain members present at the meeting who claimed that all that is transpiring is just a matter of personal enmity. Among them was Mr. F. C. Layer, who left the meeting in anger. Nevertheless Mr. Frydl and Mr. Vesely assured the members that all that they are interested in is in righting the sins of the past, and to eradicate all that which is connected with the old regime and the "Musil" rule, so that the organization may regain the confidence it requires. But no harmonious action can take place while the old directors still function, and while the new officials will not get the co-operation needed for the betterment of the organization.</p>
   <p>The debate became more spirited as the meeting proceeded, and personalities were exchanged which did not fall pleasantly upon one's ear.</p>
   <p>Finally, after about four hours of debate, a motion was carried unanimously <span class="page-break">\8</span>that the books be audited by a professional auditor.</p>
   <p>Since there cannot be any co-operation between the old and new officials, it was finally agreed to elect a new board of directors as soon as the auditor finishes his work.</p>
   <p>It is expected that the recently chosen directors who tried to better conditions will be returned to office; but the reverse is expected in the case of the inefficient old ones, whom we expect to be out of office soon.</p>
   <p>The motion to sell the Auditorium which housed the unlucky Bazaar was passed unanimously and with great acclaim.</p>
   <p>Today we know that the purchase of the Auditorium was a poor business venture and that Borivoj will never accomplish anything until it sells the building, and so the officers were ordered to sell as soon as possible under the most favorable conditions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>If we correctly judge yesterday's proceedings, the Building and Loan Association adopted a radical change which will benefit all those whom it concerns.</p>
