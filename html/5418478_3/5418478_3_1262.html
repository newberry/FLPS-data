   <p>Delegates who have accepted the responsibility of acting as members of the festival committee at the forthcoming "Staroceske Posviceni" (Old Czech Country Festival), which is being arranged by the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools), are urgently requested to come to a meeting today (September 8) at 8 P.M. The Meeting is to be held in the Vojta Naprstek School. Your presence at this meeting is required! Only ten more days remain before the Old Czech Festival will take place, and there is still much work to be done. At this meeting committees will be augmented by new workers, and work will be assigned to every committee member.....Therefore let every one who promised to work for the good of our schools be in his place on Friday.</p>
