   <p>The last word in this season of Chicago's Czech theatrical activities was reserved for Mr. Jindrich (Henry) Weidner. It was an occasion of particular significance in that the artist celebrated the twentieth anniversary of his first appearance as an actor, and the fifth year as director of the Sokol Chicago Theatre. These two jubilees, each of which has a deep meaning for the welfare of our theatre, caused the public to participate in throngs which filled the auditorium of the Sokol Chicago to its capacity. The many friends and admirers of his art paid a fine tribute to Mr. Weidner's popularity. They manifested their sentiments in peals of applause and also by a deluge of useful gifts.</p>
   <p>"Monte Cristo," Alexander Dumas' renowned novel, adapted for the stage, was given last night. It is a most suitable vehicle for Mr. Weidner's histrionic skill. The main part which is very difficult, took on mighty proportions in the artist's hands. The cast of the play is large. It required the assistance of almost all of our actors. The Sokol Chicago Theatre [known also under the name Czech National Theatre] thus concluded this year's season.</p>
