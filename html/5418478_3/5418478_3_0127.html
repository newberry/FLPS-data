   <p>Every Czech-American should be proud of the Hibner Oil Company. Why? Because every employee of the company was born either in Czechoslovakia, or is of Czech parentage. This prosperous concern is an example of Czech enterprise. It shows what can be accomplished by definiteness of purpose and persistence.</p>
   <p>In the year 1895 the Hibner Oil Company had a capital of $140.50, an old horse, and a still older wagon. The company's salesman also was old and feeble. Today five large trucks and seven wagons distribute for the company all over Chicago, Cicero, and Oak Park. Mr. M. J. Votava, president, is an acknowledged expert in the oil business.</p>
