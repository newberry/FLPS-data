   <p>The Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (The Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society) has decided to celebrate its twenty-fiftth year of existence with a popular concert. It will be held on April 16, 1916, in the auditorium of Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Hall) on Ashland Avenue, near 18th Street, and there will be a small charge for admission. They will, in that way, please not only their music loving friends but also the whole Bohemian public.</p>
   <p>At this concert the pupils, of our singing school, in conjunction with the ladies' auxiliary, will sing "Maj" (May).</p>
   <p>At this concert gay and lively songs will be sung, because it is admitted that humor is the best antidote in crucial times which Bohemian Chicago now is experiencing.</p>
   <p>That the concert will be a great success from a moral standpoint may be <span class="page-break">\2</span>affirmed by simply mentioning the society's conductor, Mr. J. Houdek.</p>
