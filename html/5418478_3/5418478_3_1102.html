   <p>The amateur actors of the dramatic section of Sokol Karel Jonas in Cicero, Illinois, made a lucky strike in selecting "The Countess from Podskali" for their performance last Sunday. This is a play which interests the public by offering historical, sentimental, and humorous scenes. It never fails to please, no matter how often it appears on our stages. It deals with everyday life in an atmosphere which is indigenous to Podskali, a suburb of Prague, and does not, therefore, lack picturesque and droll characters.</p>
   <p>All of the characters were very skillfully portrayed by the Cicero players under the direction of Mr. Hildebrandt. The stage management was also perfect. Mr. Cerny conducted the incidental music.</p>
