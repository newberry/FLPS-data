   <p>After the brilliant success of the first performance of Shakespeare's immortal work, "Othello," the drama was given a second time last night. Not even the inclement weather could detain the multitude of playgoers from paying homage to dramatic art.</p>
   <p>The Ludvík theatrical group is intent upon giving a Shakespearean play every so often. The rendition last night was excellent. Mr. Horlivý was "Othello;" Mr. Stach played "Iago;" Mrs. Horlivý, "Desdemona;" Mrs. Splavec, "Emilia;" Mr. Dvořák, "Cassio;" and Mr. Klapka, "Rodrigo". Everyone in the cast contributed a fair share to the success of the evening.</p>
