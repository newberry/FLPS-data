   <p>Mr. F. J. Lhotský, a popular actor, appeared in his own play in the auditorium of Sokol Chicago last night. On this occasion, which was for his benefit, "Vzhuru Do Francie" (On to France!) was presented. The play has a sub-title, "For Freedom and Equality of the Nation". Its atmosphere is taken from the life of the Czech people. It is interspersed with songs and is, as the name indicates, a product of the present times. It strongly resembles the English play, "Between Two Foes," but it is adapted for our situation by a clever stroke of the pen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lhotský knew how to make use of scenic effects that naturally must find their place in a patriotic play. The piece, though it requires a large cast, should be kept on the repertory longer than other dramatic experiments, just on the basis of its point of view.</p>
   <p>The attendance was large.</p>
