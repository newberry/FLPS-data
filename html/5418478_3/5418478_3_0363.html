   <p>It was Sunday, October 25, at 2 P. M. when the main entrance of the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) was opened to a large crowd of visitors who were eager to inspect the results of ten months' work of the young inmates of the institution.</p>
   <p>The crowd was unexpectedly large--larger, in fact, than the premises of the exhibition could accomodate--and there were many non-Bohemians.....</p>
   <p>That the exhibition was a complete success may be gathered from the fact that $475.63 was taken in for the exhibits sold to admirers during the day, in addition to which $261.15 was received subsequently, making a total of $653.28. The raw material necessary for the exhibits cost $124.99, hence the net profit for the exhibition amounted to $528.29.</p>
