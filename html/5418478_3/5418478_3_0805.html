   <p>....All seats for the performance of "Strakonicky Dudak" (Bagpiper of Strakonice) to be given at the twentieth anniversary of Ludvikovo Divadlo (Bohemian Dramatic Association) at the Garrick Theater at 2 P. M. next Sunday are already sold out, and there are many more friends and admirers of the Ludvikovo Divadlo than could be accommodated in the Garrick Theater. In order to satisfy all those who were unable to secure tickets for the afternoon performance, the management of Ludvikovo Divadlo has agreed to repeat the play on Sunday night in Thalia Hall....</p>
