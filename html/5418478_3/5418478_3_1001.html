   <p>The Reverend Vaclav Vanek has taken up the idea of arranging popular concerts from time to time, at low prices. The proceeds would be used to pay the salaries of hired musicians, and whatever surplus that might remain would be donated to some noble cause.</p>
   <p>The first of such concerts was given yesterday in the Bohemian Home on Central Park Avenue. The concert was under the direction of Prof. Joseph Vilim, well known in musical circles, and consisted of five numbers of a selected program:</p>
   <p>Sonata for piano and violin, opus 30.....Grieg</p>
   <p>Mark Vilím and Joseph Vilím</p>
   <p>Trio......Mendelssohn</p>
   <p>Mark Vilím, Joseph Vilím, and Miss Zdenka Cerny.</p>
   
   <p>Concert Mazurka, violin solo..............................Musina Professor Joseph Vilím</p>
   <p>Violoncello solo.............................................Metzdorf Miss Zděnka Černý, assisted by a trio</p>
   <p>Slavonic Dances.............................................Dvořák</p>
   <p>Intermezzo...................................................Cibuka Mark Vilím, Joseph Vilím, and Miss Zděnka Černí</p>
   <p>The program was played faultlessly, and the artists were rewarded with a storm of applause for their artistic accomplishment. Prof. Jaroslav J. Zmrhal spoke on the significance of Thanksgiving Day and his masterful speech was received with appreciation by all. The attendance at the concert was very fair. The occasional scheduling of such low-priced concerts, which offer the public an opportunity to attend, is a good idea and its acceptance would bring much good.</p>
