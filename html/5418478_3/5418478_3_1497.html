   <p>Chicago has spoken. Chicago has spoken most emphatically, more emphatically and decidedly than it was expected to speak. It has spoken for autonomy and personal liberty.</p>
   <p>That much Chicago said yesterday by the immense parade which, in its character of demonstration, was only too clear and definite an answer not only to people who break their pledges and obligations, but also to those reactionaries who have dared to attack our metropolis in which the liberal element has always prevailed, who have dared to attack its freedom and have imposed on it, through a conniving mayor, one of the series of blue laws--the closing of saloons on Sundays--by which they would like to deprive Chicago of every vestige of personal liberty.....</p>
   
   <p>Chicago has made the preparations for its reply to Mayor Thompson with utmost thoroughness. Its reply took the form of an impressive parade organized upon the initiative of the United Civic Societies of Chicago. It was timed just right, and executed not as a protest against law enforcement but as a demand for autonomy and personal liberty. Many obstacles were being put in the way of preparation for the parade, obstacles conceived from and directed by a number of interests, by which not only individuals but whole organizations were being attacked. Attacks were directed not only against Anton J. Cermak, Judge Olson, and others, but also against as strong an organization as the United Civic Societies of Chicago. It is perhaps just these attacks and the fact that they were being so largely discussed in the daily press that gave the preparations for the parade such great publicity, and contributed to its success. The United Civic Societies took advantage of this circumstance and have done a splendid piece of work in the interest of autonomy and personal liberty. But the Societies and their executive committee do not propose to stop here and take a rest. The work will go on, their aims will be followed up with enhanced energy, pressure will be brought to bear in certain places, in order to secure autonomy for Chicago and personal liberty for its citizens, personal liberty which is being restricted to some extent now, and which will be restricted more and more and disappear completely if they should fail in making an energetic stand against its foes. The time must never come when personal liberty will be nothing but a sweet memory!</p>
   <p>That such a time never shall come was demonstrated yesterday by a gathering of people such as Chicago has never seen before. It was a fortunate day for the liberals; even the weather was in their favor. The streets were unusually busy from early morning. Here a nicely decorated automobile, there a beautiful float, yonder an allegorical carriage drawn by a team of heavily caparisoned horses, or again a truck carrying a load of prospective marchers to their destination. There was an uncommon stir all over, a rush, and toward the noon hour, a regular, bee-like swarming of people around the meeting places of various divisions of the parade. This was so not only in our parts of the city, in Pilsen, but also on the North Side, Northwest Side, and South Side in the neighborhood of Town of Lake. We are particularly interested in our Pilsen and California. Members of various Sokol organizations started assembling close to our street, around West 18th Street and Ashland Avenue, right after the noon hour. The majority of "Blue" Sokols (members of the Narodni Jednota Sokolska--National Sokol Unity) were in uniforms, while the "Red" Sokols (members of the Zupa Fuegnertyrs [Sokol unit called by that name] wearing a uniform consisting of a red shirt, tan jacket and breeches) were mostly in civilian clothes. The Cesko-Americka Sin (Bohemian-American Hall) was the meeting place of all participating Bohemian Catholic organizations. From Blue Island Avenue to West 16th Street was the meeting place of individual local clubs, while the members of our benevolent organizations and their main bodies, as far as these have their seat in Chicago, assembled in the neighborhood of the Patronatni Sin (Patronage Hall) at West 18th and May Streets. Almost every larger organization brought its own band, to whose music it marched in the parade. The Bohemian participation in the affair made a very good impression. That all delegations would be very large was noticeable even at their meeting places. This applies to Pilsen and also to Bohemian California, particularly to the gatherings in front of the building of Sokol Chicago on Kedzie Avenue and West 26th Street. Our women and girls were also strongly represented in the parade, not only the young ones but also many in advanced years, unafraid of the tiresome marching. Most of the older ones were, of course, in automobiles and other vehicles, but we should hate to be fined a penny for every one who walked.....</p>
   <p>The Bohemian section of the parade marched along Blue Island Avenue to Halsted Street where it joined the part coming from the South, these two marching together to Randolph and Market Streets from where the whole parade started marching at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>At the head of the parade marched a strong detachment of mounted police followed by a festive automobile decorated with green foliage and fresh flowers, and behind that came the executive committee of the United Civic Societies, led by President Landau, as marshal general, and Marshals Anton J. Cermak, John A. Cervenka, L. Neumann, and others. These were followed by a large band and the parade proper which consisted of five divisions. To the cheerful tunes of the bands, twelve abreast, the march went on Randolph Street to Michigan Avenue and along that to Harrison Street. From there the executive committee returned to the platform erected by permission of the Park Commission in Grant Park, and reviewed the parade. The streets through which the parade marched were literally lined with spectators, so it may be said without exaggeration that all Chicago participated in the demonstration. Those who did not march, at least watched, but all were there. The parade was greeted by the spectators all along the way, and special ovations were the share of Mr. Cermak and, particularly in front of the platform, of Mr. Cervenka.....</p>
   <p>As to the parade itself, its first division was composed mostly of German organizations, and, naturally, was the most numerous. There were not only Turner (gymnastic) societies, but also singing societies, benevolent organizations, and various clubs. There were a number of floats, and the marchers carried numerous standards with appropriate inscriptions, all referring to the central idea of the manifestation, autonomy and personal liberty. If Mister Mayor [sic] could have read some of them, he would not have felt particularly elated, because they were aimed right at him. Many of them were quite witty and caused general merriment.</p>
   <p>After the German division came the division from the Northwest Side, nationally mixed. Also Bohemians were represented in it.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian division was led, as mentioned before, by the committee and, in front of the platform, was greeted with a stormy "Na Zdar!" (To Success!). The marchers replied with the same greeting and raised a sea of small American flags. Perhaps all Bohemian bands, as many as there are in Chicago, marched in this division.....There were a number of standards, a number of alligorical carriages and floats, of which the one of the 26th Street businessmen's association was particularly effective.....Too bad the Bohemian division became separated into two parts.....</p>
   <p>At the head of the Southwest-Side division marched former Alderman Felix B. Janovsky.....Of interest was also the head of the Polish section. There, businessmen in flawless evening attire, with silk hats and white ties, led their countrymen.....There was so much to see everywhere, and nobody could see it all. All we shall say is that the parade marched for fully three hours, and that between it and the other side of Michigan Avenue passed a steady procession of automobiles and other carriages. It almost seemed as though there were more people in the carriages than in the parade. However, the parade was something Chicago has never seen before, and this is the opinion of many absolutely disinterested and experienced men.</p>
   <p>It should be noted that, in addition to Mr. Cermak and Mr. Cervenka, also Congressman Adolph J. Sabath participated in the parade, as well as all Bohemian aldermen, and many prominent Bohemians who are working either in the County Building or the City Hall. Apparently, these last could not be intimidated by friends of the Mayor who were heard to say that they will have identified all those who were in yesterday's parade, and who made various other threats. On the platform there were a number of officials who had supported the Mayor directly and had been his great admirers.</p>
   <p>The English-language newspapers, some of which had secured government counters with their special counting machines, put the number of those who were in the parade to 69,480. These papers were antagonistic to the parade, and so it may be presumed that their figure would more likely be too low than too high, which would make Mr. Cermak's prediction that there would be 75,000 people in the parade quite correct. This figure gets its proper significance when compared to the participation of the "prosperity parade" organized by Mayor Thompson and his lieutenants, and the "dry parade" held a few weeks ago to celebrate the issue of the decree closing saloons on Sundays, and Mayor Thompson's heroism. Yesterday's parade was at least six times the size of the prosperity parade, and more than eight times as large as the march of the drys, into which children of all Sunday schools had been commandeered.</p>
   <p>It is expected that a demand will be voiced in today's meeting of the Municipal Council to investigate the question of who authorized the City Prosecutor to make the threat that all participants in the demonstration would be black-listed at the City Hall. It is also possible that this matter will become an object of deliberation for the Grand Jury who would issue an indictment for conspiracy in case sufficient evidence should be presented.</p>
   <p>As stated before, Chicago has never before seen a demonstration as large as the one yesterday, nor were any of the previously held parades as dignified and orderly. The discipline of the friends of personal liberty is the best and most convincing refutation of implied insults hurled around in advance by some gentlemen from the City Hall, both orally and through the press.</p>
   <p>As announced by Mr. Anton J. Cermak yesterday, a demand for the "black list" and an explanation of the purpose of its existence will be presented in today's meeting of the aldermen. Also an investigation into the activities of City Prosecutor Francis is expected.</p>
   
   <p>The police, who no doubt had strict orders to proceed most rigorously whenever there was an opportunity to intervene, were unable to report any disturbance. Also the spectators, of whom there were eight hundred thousand present, behaved in an exemplary manner. There was no casualty, no accident.</p>
   <p>Because of the outstanding success of the demonstration, Governor Dunn will be requested to include in the program of the special session of the Legislature which is to be called, a revision of the Sunday-closing law, this revision to provide for autonomy in the cities in this respect, and for the submission of this question to a popular vote throughout the State.</p>
   <p>According to the estimate of the officers of the United Civic Societies and other unbiased observers, there were one hundred thousand people in the parade. The number of participating vehicles, automobiles, trucks, and others was 6,855. Figuring ten people per vehicle, although some of them carried up to thirty, we get the figure of 68,550 for the vehicles. There were 33,000 pedestrians marching, so the total tops 100,000. While the Germans formed the majority in the first two divisions of the parade, the third was mostly Italian, the fourth was almost exclusively Bohemian and Polish. It was at least 20,000 strong. This division made the best impression and was enthusiastically greeted. All marchers were fresh as daisies , stepped livelily and vigorously to the sound of the music, and none of them showed any signs that he might be worse for the glass of beer or wine he likes to take. Also the standards in the Bohemian division were very appropriate.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the United Civic Societies, Mr. Cermak, had this to say about the parade: "The main purpose of this almost indescribably beautiful and magnificent demonstration of liberty and order-loving men and women citizens has been achieved. Its purpose was, in the first place, to prove beyond possible doubt that the United Civic Societies exists in reality, not only on paper, and that it is not an organization which shuns the light and is composed exclusively of saloonkeepers, brewers, and liquor dealers, as the reactionaries and baiters like to proclaim. There is no doubt that this parade, with slogans that may be designated as classical, has made a deep impression upon the aldermen, the congressmen, and the Governor. It may have made no impression upon 'Big Bill'. But he also will now admit that the United Societies is not just a 'club,' as he said a few days ago."</p>
   <p>Here is what Mr. John A. Cervenka had to say: "If nothing else, the parade proved, beyond any possibility of doubt, that the United Civic Societies is a strong and order-loving body. Its executive committee had expressed the desire that no sign, no slogan be directed against the person of the Mayor, and that no shouting against him be heard. Their desire was fully observed. What other organization could maintain such discipline in as large a crowd as assembled in the parade? Some of our adversaries have sarcastically misnamed us, 'Excited Societies for Local Misgovernment'. Now they will have to admit that we are 'Excited Societies against Local Misgovernment.'"</p>
   <p>Mr. Landau president of the United Societies, has said: "It was an extraordinary demonstration, the most magnificent popular manifestation ever seen in this country. It is impossible to doubt that it has made a powerful impression upon city and State officials, and upon the whole public. Of course we all had expected that the parade would be a huge success. But nobody could have anticipated, even granting as excellent weather as we had yesterday, that in addition to the marchers there would assemble hundreds of thousands of spectators, all of them good and order-loving citizens, who greeted the marchers with joy and enthusiasm. It was a truly great day for the United Societies and for the whole city of Chicago."</p>
   <p>Asked what he thought of the parade, Mayor Thompson said: "I have nothing to say. I was out of town, driving around in the country and did not see it. I have been told on the telephone that some 30,000 to 40,000 people marched. Good-by!"</p>
