   <p>The reception and banquet which were arranged in honor of the returning participants of the Czechoslovak-American commercial expedition to Czechoslovakia turned out to be a success in every respect. The credit for this goes mainly to our....ladies who, seizing upon the task assigned to them, performed miracles of efficiency, so much so that every guest could be more than satisfied by the results of their work. The following ladies served on the committee: Mrs. Snabl, chairman, Mrs. Zahrobsky, Mrs. Rychtarik, Mrs. Turek, Mrs. Sistek, Mrs. Lehky, Mrs. Nikodem, Mrs. Novy, Mrs. Muzik, Mrs. M. Snabl, Mrs. Hak, and Mrs. Hnatek. Mr. Jan A. Cervenka was the master of ceremonies for the evening and acquitted himself of the task imposed upon him with his usual tact and eloquence. The president of the Ceskoslovensko-Americka Obchodni Komora (Czechoslovak-American Chamber of Commerce), Mr. Karel V. Janovsky, stated in his address of welcome that plans for this evening had been laid long before the expedition <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>left on its mission to Czechoslovakia; that even then various members of the Komora were busy with the program, and that, therefore, results from such carefully made preparations were to be expected. He explained the purpose of both the work of the Komora and of this evening of entertainment. He then introduced the master of ceremonies who, thanking those present for their attendance, expressed his hope that all of them would remain friends of the Komora. Immediately thereupon he introduced Dr. Jaroslav Smetanka, the Czechoslovak consul general, who pictured the progress made by our republic, the rise in the valuta of its currency, which rise greatly aided the banking system of Czechoslovakia, making its name well known throughout Europe, at the same time, however, damaging the industries. It devolves, therefore upon the proper factors to remove this difficulty. Back in 1920 we started a collection to aid the destitute and indigent people of Czechoslovakia, to relieve suffering and want; the problem today is not the giving of alms but the creation of markets, and in this sense the Komora promises the aid needed. The general public must aid the Komora financially and support it in its work.</p>

   <p>The next number on the program was a soprano solo by Miss Lukes, who sang an aria from G. Puccini's opera "Madame Butterfly". The Reverend Vaclav Vanek, secretary of the expedition, gave a summary of his experiences in the old homeland and the impressions which he gained there. The very sympathetic priest, Reverend Frantisek Bozenek, on this occasion inscribed his name on the hearts of his countrymen. The Reverend Bozenek is known to be a patriot of the first water and an enthusiastic worker in the nationalist cause. During the days of our revolutionary activity he stood at the forefront of our nationalist endeavors, making great sacrifices for our national cause. The Reverend Bozenek was a member of the Bohemian Catholic expedition to Czechoslovakia. He declared himself proud to be afforded an opportunity to speak to so numerous and intelligent an audience, and then gave his summary of experiences and happenings of the second expedition made by the Chicago Czechs this year.....He recalled the day on which nine years ago he left the town of Kromeriz, Czechoslovakia, the town in which he had pursued his studies; he rejoiced at seeing that the town had become Czech instead of German, the latter nationality having been much in evidence at the time of his <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>leaving nine years ago. His address was full of wit and truth and was most sympathetically received.....</p>
   <p>Mrs. Snabl, of Domazlice [Czechoslovakia], sang an aria from Antonin Dvorak's opera "Rusalka" (The Nymph), accompanied on the piano by her son Josef. Her singing was so loudly acclaimed that she had to give an encore.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. A. Sokol, a delegate of the Komora, then gave an account of the reception given us by the Prague Chamber of Commerce, stating how willing the merchants of Czechoslovakia are to learn whatever our commercial experience can add to their own fund of knowledge, and thus to avoid certain errors. He then gave some statistics on the fairs which opened in Czechoslovakia this summer, and which indicated commercial progress and development.</p>
   <p>The former U. S. ambassador to the Balkans, the Hon. Karel J. Vopicka, addressed the guests, saying how happy he was to see our homeland liberated, and how proud <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>we may be to have had our origins in that country. He then gave some of his experiences in the Balkans. His address was followed by a violin solo played by Mr. Jiri Hrusa.....</p>
   <p>Our brothers the Slovaks were represented by Mr. Jan Matlocha, president of the local branch of the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League), who, speaking in their behalf, portrayed the [present] conditions in Slovakia. He told of a new furniture factory which was started by our Slovak brothers with a capital of 20 million [Czechoslovak] crowns. There are 250 men employed in that factory, supervised mostly by American Slovaks. With the exception of their not being satisfied with the way the government offices do their work, the people of Slovakia are pleased with the present state of affairs.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav newspaper publisher, Mr. John R. Palandech [of Chicago], was then introduced to the guests. He claimed that he has always been a friend of the Czechs, that he wishes them all manner of success and that he is happy to know about their progress.</p>

   <p>The lawyer, Karel Vesely, speaker for the expedition, pointed out the nature and kind of advice which he dealt out to our countrymen in the old homeland, chiefly admonishing them to get rid of their old officious manner of doing things and their use of Austrian red tape.</p>
   <p>The master of ceremonies then asked the guests to honor the memory of the deceased Mrs. J. Dusek, the wife of the treasurer of the expedition. As is known, the lady's demise occurred while she visited her old homeland. The guests rose to their feet.</p>
   <p>The members of the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Frank Ludvik Dramatic Association) gave a humorous sketch.....The president, Mr. Janovsky, then rose and thanked everyone for his presence this evening, and bade the guests amuse themselves freely. In a few moments the younger set was "tripping the light fantastic" while the older folk sat around the tables or indulged in "the cups that cheer".</p>
   <p>Nor were our charitable institutions overlooked on this occasion. A "flower <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>waltz" netted us the sum of $90, which was equally divided between the Utulna a Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage) and the Sirotcinec Svateho Josefa v Lisle (Saint Joseph's [Bohemian Catholic] Orphanage at Lisle, Illinois).</p>
