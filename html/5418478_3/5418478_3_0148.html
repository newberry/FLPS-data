   <p>The bankruptcies of three firms in our Czech-Chicago community will result in an endless chain of court sessions and litigations. The firms "did business" under the name of "notary public" or "private banker;" accepted money from their hard-working and thrifty fellow countrymen; paraded as "counselors" in the investment business; and diverted the funds intrusted to them into channels for their own private interest. The men are: Joseph Tuma, Robert L. Pitte, and Joseph A. Cerny; the latter, now missing, represents the latest acquisition to the roster of our bankrupt "bankers".....The backbone of their activities was shady transactions and false pretenses.....</p>
   <p>"Who will be next?"</p>
