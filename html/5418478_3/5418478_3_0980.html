   <p>Herewith a call is being issued to all countrymen who love singing and have an understanding of its choral form, and particularly to those of them who are not yet members of some choral society.....</p>
   <p>The call is being issued with the idea of forming an active, enthusiastic body which would be in a position to perform in a perfect way the beautiful choral works of Bohemian composers and acquaint our Bohemian public and the American public in general with them. The choral singing does not depend upon compositions written some thirty or forty years ago. The present Bohemian composers are also keeping in step with world progress in this field.</p>
   <p>But modern compositions require thorough study and practice.....There are 150,000 of us in Chicago, and we should be able to organize a chorus similar to those of Bohemian and Moravian teachers who carried away the first prize at the recent contest in Paris.....Only men and women who agree to practice and attend rehearsals at least once a week will be accepted.....</p>
   <p>Those who are interested should contact Dr. Leopold Wedeles at 2446 South Sawyer Avenue, or Mr. Karel Kratochvil at 1839 South Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>Česká Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota (Central Bohemian Singing Society).</p>
