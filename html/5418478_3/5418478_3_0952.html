   <p>The Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana (Singing Society Bedrich Smetana) has appeared twice before the public within a comparatively short period of time. Each time its performance has been unusually significant. First it showed its ability in the successful performance of Blodek's opera, "V Studni" (In the Well), in the Sokol Chicago Hall on December 3, 1913, and now it has earned new and greater laurels by its masterful presentation of Dr. C. Loewe's oratorio, "John Huss". The oratorio, "John Huss," is a monumental composition which, even though it was not composed by a Bohemian, is a dignified expression of piety in honor of the memory of our martyr from Constance, who, from a little cottage in the south of Bohemia, went through his martyrdom to the Pantheon of world history, and about whom a poet's inspired pen wrote that "above the handful of his ashes he sees even the stars' reflection in the Rhine shiver in modesty".</p>
   <p>In beautiful Orchestra Hall on Michigan Avenue, from whose platform many of the most famous artists have thrilled aristocratic audiences, and which has been frequently the scene of the brilliant successes of Fate's favored children who have progressed step by step to glory on the road of the divine arts--in the same Orchestra Hall Bohemian singing sounded the stirring prelude to the innumerable rites and celebrations which will commemorate the quincentenary anniversary of the burning at the stake of John Huss throughout the civilized world, but particularly throughout Bohemian America. It cannot be denied that July 6, 1915 offers the Bohemians in America an excellent opportunity to pay a debt of honor which they owe, especially under the present abnormal conditions, to the old country. The quincentenary anniversary of John Huss' death will certainly not be observed there as had been planned. Since it is impossible to commemorate properly the greatest son of Bohemia on his own native soil, in that cultural retreat between Snezka [the highest mountain in the Riesengebirge] and the pensive Cerchov [the highest mountain in the Bohemian Forest], which was the home of the great reformer and the scene of his noble work, it is up to us who live under more fortunate circumstances, in freer surroundings and out of the reach of persecution by the Austrian government, to do so here.</p>
   <p>The opening to these celebrations was yesterday's performance by a group of our singers, which we are completely justified in calling a very successful performance in every respect.</p>
   <p>The Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana had to select the oratorio "John Huss," even though it was not composed by a Bohemian, because there is not a single large and significant choral work in the whole Bohemian musical literature that refers to the tragic death of John Huss. What could not be found at home was found in the German musical world.....The music is by Dr. C. Loewe and the libretto, by Dr. August Zeun. The Bohemian translation was prepared by Dr. V. J. Dvorak, and the English translation, for programs, by Mr. Frantisek Zajicek. Both are very satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Loewe's profound and beautiful oratorio was sung for the first time in America yesterday, and considering the fact that it was produced by amateurs, its first appearance was excellent.</p>
   <p>The orchestral accompaniment left nothing to be desired; numbers of the [Chicago] Symphony Orchestra, reinforced by a number of our own most accomplished musicians were the performers.</p>
   <p>The public interest in the affair was demonstrated by the huge attendance. The Pevecka Spolecnost sang to a full house.....Half of the net profit goes to one of the most worthy of our institutions, our Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage).</p>
   <p>The oratorio, which required a great deal of practicing and rehearsing, will be produced once more. This, no doubt, will be on the occasion of the main celebration of John Huss' anniversary, which will be arranged by a committee representing all of our Free-Thought associations, in the Auditorium on July 6.</p>
