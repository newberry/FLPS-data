   <p>The brotherhood of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) is hereby advised to attend the Staroceske Posviceni (Old Czech Country Festival) next Sunday, September 17. This festival was arranged for the benefit of our [Bohemian] Free Thought schools. It is our moral duty to attend this festival in the greatest possible numbers, and thus to aid the work of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol v Chicagu (Chicago Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools), and to make possible the continuance of the upbringing of our Bohemian children in the Czech tongue and in the spirit of Free Thought.</p>
   <p>We ask you, therefore, to come in large numbers, proving thereby that you are true Bohemians and Freethinkers. Au revoir, Cespesaci! [Translator's note: The term'Cespesak', plural 'Cespesaci', is of local coinage. It is composed <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the four initial letters C S P S (Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky), and signifies simply a member of that association.]</p>
   <p>Otto Pergler, president;</p>
   <p>Josef H. Filip, secretary.</p>
