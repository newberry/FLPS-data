   <p>Our Bohemian stage has already experienced a long line of various premieres--more or less successful, but mostly less successful; and yesterday, at the Sokol Chicago Hall, we had an opportunity to acquaint ourselves with a first attempt to compose a Bohemian-American operetta. We intentionally say "attempt" because we knew that nobody expected that he would see an operetta which would meet the requirements of this kind of musical composition. But even this simple attempt deserves consideration, and we should appreciate the good will of the composer and of the Ludvikovci (Frantisek Ludvik Bohemian Dramatic Association of Chicago), which presented the novelty. The operetta--which it would be more fitting to call a burlesque--has for its title "Nasi Hosi pod Hvezdnatym Praporem" (Our Boys under the Star-Spangled Banner), and was written by Mrs. Barbora Musil-Novotny, well-known Bohemian violin virtuoso of Chicago. She selected the World War as a plot for her work which, however, does not furnish the most promising background for a theatrical. It is a well-known fact that, after the close of the World War, none of the war plays endured very long upon the stage, and that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>even the war movies vanished very quickly, which, probably, was for the reason that we still regard the war at too close range and without due perspective.</p>
   <p>The plot of the operetta, in its first and final act, is laid in America. The second act is staged in France, and deals with several students who, in their patriotic zeal, enlisted under the Star-Spangled Banner. In this same act girls appear who, to prove their patriotism, join the Red Cross. There is much humor mixed in with the general plot, and there are comical figures whose purpose is to keep the audience laughing constantly. The play contains a great many choruses, duets, quartets, and solos, mostly naive and not always original, but pleasing to the ear. Some of them, especially, reveal the undoubted talent of the composer. The execution of the play was careful and smooth. The three main comic roles were in the hands of Mr. R. Suva, Mrs. Otilie Splavec, and Mr. Milos Bezdek, who during the first and the final act did not permit the audience to stop laughing. The quartet of student volunteers consisted of Messrs. B. Jonas, T. Wagner, F. Brejla, and Pelc; playing opposite them as lady ambulance drivers of the Red Cross, were Mesdames Marie Ludvik, Kristina Horlivy, and the Misses <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Ludvik and Fris, whose playing and singing were unusually successful. Mr. Frant Horlivy, in his role of "Wilden", gave proof of good playing, and in the last act even the little Olinka Bezdek pleased the audience with her fine appearance. The theatregoers received this novelty with much satisfaction, as was made evident by their frequent applause.</p>
