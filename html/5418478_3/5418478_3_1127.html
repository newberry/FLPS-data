   <p>The Dramaticky Krouzek (Dramatic Circle) was formed recently by enthusiastic amateurs who wish to help the national cause by their talent. The hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, Lawndale Avenue near 26th Street, has been selected for the scene of their activity. The Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs has long been accredited as a nationally conscious group, and the amateur actors will perform under its immediate sponsorship.</p>
   <p>The Dramatic Circle will pursue humanitarian and patriotic aims. First thought is given to the Czech soldiers who were wounded on the French and the Russian fronts. The proceeds of the performances are to go to those men. This will be accomplished with the aid of the Beseda (club) J. V. Fric, a patriotic group which has won the praise and gratitude of the Czech public for having taken excellent care of Czech prisoners.</p>
   <p>The first play to be given is F. F. Samberk's "Karel Havlicek-Borovsky".</p>

   <p>The best amateur talent available in the Chicago Czech community has been procured for the enterprise. Mr. Albert Cada, president of the "California" district of the Czech National Alliance will take charge of the accounting and disposal of routine business.</p>
