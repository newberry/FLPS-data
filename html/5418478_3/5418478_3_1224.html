   <p>The farce "Zmatek nad Zmatek" (Error upon Error) was performed in the hall of "Telocviene Jednota Sokol" (Gymnastic Society Sokol.) The acting was carried out in such a manner as to indicate that our actors need more time to familiarize themselves with comedy.</p>
   <p>The performance seemed to incline throughout to the tragic. It became monotonous and somewhat gloomy in spots.</p>
   <p>Even at that, the play was quite humorous and brought forth considerable laughter from an enthusiastic public.</p>
