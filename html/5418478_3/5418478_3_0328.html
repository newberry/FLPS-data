   <p>P.2 - Countrymen Messrs. J.G.Prochaska and Viktor Malezan were given to understand yesterday through Lawyer R.W.Yotze of the Patent office in Washington, that a patent was being allowed on their invention of a dentist's clamp. When the above named countrymen completed their invention in April of this year, they requested the well known dentist, Dr. J.B.Bilek, to test the invention and he announced that it was the most practical and one of the finest dental instruments he ever had in his hands. A certain Cleveland firm offered Messrs. Prochaska and Malezan a considerable amount of money for the use of the patent, however, both countrymen know well, that they can gain more by the sale of the patent, therefore, they did not accept the offer.</p>
