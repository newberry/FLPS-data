   <p>Brothers! On Sunday, August 20, 1922, there will be a Narodni Pout (National Pilgrimage) in the Pilsen Park pavilion. We have promised to turn out on this occasion in full parade regalia. Since it is a national festival it is our festival, and it is, consequently, the duty of every member, who is a good Czechoslovak, to attend....Our post will meet in front of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs promptly at 12:30 P.M., and the parade will start promptly at 1 P.M. and proceed to Pilsen Park. Come one, come all, thereby proving that you are able to appreciate this national effort--the fruits of which will benefit all the Chicago Czechoslovaks. Remember that when we went to war we were always on time in order not to miss the trains. Let us not "miss the train" next Sunday.</p>
   <p>With fraternal best wishes from the Post of Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago, Illinois,</p>
   <p>Albert Houska, secretary;</p>
   <p>3222 West 23rd Street,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
