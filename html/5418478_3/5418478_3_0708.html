   <p>A theatrical performance entitled "Láska A Lidé" (Love and People) was presented by the Česká Činohra (Bohemian Dramatic Association) last Wednesday evening in the Sokol Chicago hall. The association deserves a great deal of recognition, for the proceeds of the performance will be donated to Hoover's relief fund, and therefore will be used for the benefit of suffering children in Czechoslovakia. This noble cause deserved a large attendance, and had it not been for unfavorable weather conditions, the spacious hall would surely have been filled. But, in spite of this unfavorable circumstance, many people came to the Sokol Chicago hall, and every one who came enjoyed himself.</p>
   <p>The theatrical production which the association selected has been favorably accepted everywhere it has been produced, and even upon our stage it met with success. Credit for that should go first to the excellent stage management, because only talented actors were chosen. The major roles were divided among the following: Mrs. Slávka Svoboda, whose acting was really excellent;</p>

   <p>Mr. Antonín Vaverka, recognized artist and stage manager; Messrs. Antonín Svoboda, Antonín Wagner, Huml, Turek, Vorel, Prchal, and Mmes. Novák, Kotrbatý, Hudec, Huml, Milena Brychta, Vlasta Brychta, and others. The ensemble was very good, the play was charming, but the absence of an orchestra was felt by the audience. This feature was probably omitted to cut down expenses in order that the proceeds might be greater.</p>
