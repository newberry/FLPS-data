   <p>The Management of the Cesko-Americke Narodni Divadlo (Bohemian-American National Theater) produced for the second time the famous operetta "Dratenicek" (Tinker), by Franz Lehar.</p>
   <p>The operetta was produced on the stage of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. Its success was only a repetition of the fine reception accorded to it when it was first produced. The splendid songs, the artistically handled cast, and the faultless execution of the whole were proof positive of the high artistic ability and standards of our Lawndale theater organization, though the third act of the operetta was not as good in its dramatic quality as the preceding two.....The audience was very well pleased with the acting of Mr. and Mrs. Havelka, and Mr. and Mrs. Krejci, and gave vent to its praise by an unstinting applause.....</p>
   <p>The management is going to produce Karel Capek's sensational play "R. U. R." <span class="page-break">2</span>next Sunday afternoon. Extensive preparations have been going on for some time, and we may expect therefore that Capek's play is going to be placed among the outstanding productions of the season.</p>
