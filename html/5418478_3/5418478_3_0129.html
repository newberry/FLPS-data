   <p>The directors of the Kašpar State Bank decided in their last meeting to make their institution a member of the Federal Reserve System. In doing so, they are complying with the wish of President Wilson, as expressed in one of his last speeches.</p>
   <p>Membership in the Federal Reserve System also provides a higher guarantee for the depositors, because of the rigid supervision by the Federal bank authorities. The Kašpar State Bank is also under the supervision of the Chicago Clearing House. All of this makes it a perfectly safe depository for money and other assets.</p>
