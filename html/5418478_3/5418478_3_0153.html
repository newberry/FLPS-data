   <p>An agreement has been reached between Jos. A. Cerny, notary public, and his clients, who felt uneasy about their deposits intrusted to him. Their apprehensions may well be understood when one recalls the bankruptcy of the firm Robert L. Pitte and Son.</p>
   <p>In a meeting held in the hall of Sokol Chicago last night, Mr. Cerny explained to his clients, fifty in number, how he happened to plunge into temporary difficulties. His liabilities amount to $25,740.50, which are covered by real estate which, if sold advantageously, together with other securities, should yield $33,310.03. A committee composed of five Czech lawyers was formed which pledged itself to hold the assets until Banker Fr. G. Hajicek, who was named trustee by the committee, finds an opportunity to realize a reasonable amount of money by their sale.</p>

   <p>Mr. Černý, in frankly revealing the condition of his business, evidently acted like a real man.</p>
