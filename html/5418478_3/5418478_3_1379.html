   <p>Last evening was one of the greatest in importance in all Czechoslovak history. The hour in which the Czechoslovaks were acknowledged as an ally by the United States will be written forever in the annals of our subjugated nation. This meant the death knell for that most anomalous monster, the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy. Czechoslovaks will be entitled to sit in the peace conference and claim what the nation has been seeking for more than three centuries--Czechoslovak independence. The proclamation of independence for our homeland issued by the mightiest people in the world--the American people--filled us with joy and exceeding pride. This event is naturally bound to be commemorated by all Czechoslovaks in a truly magnificent style; the first preparations began last night.</p>

   <p>Representatives of the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America, and the Slovak League, met in the offices of the Czech National Alliance, 26th Street and Millard Avenue. The scene of the Czechoslovak public manifestation will be the site where the War Exposition is being held at Grant Park. The date has been set for September 14, which has been named "Czechoslovak and Yugoslav Day". Arrangements are being made so that on that day, which is a Saturday, and one most convenient for everybody, all Czechoslovak organizations and outstanding individuals will be present both afternoon and evening. They are expected to come not only from Chicago but all surrounding settlements, also.</p>
   <p>Two committees, one an arrangements and one on publicity, were formed. On the former, Professor Jar. Zmrhal, Vojta Benes, and Sindelar will represent the Czechs; the Reverend Father Vanyscak the Catholics, and Ondrej (Andrew) Sustek the Slovaks. An appeal will be directed to all Czechs and Slovaks to <span class="page-break">\3</span>take part in the march to Grant Park. Details on the place of rallying, and the time, will be announced later.</p>
   <p>Representatives of the Czechoslovak Government and of the Czechoslovak Army--Colonel Hurban and others--will address the crowds at the Exposition. The Czech National Alliance and the Slovak League are going to urge all the people in our settlements in the United States to meet and celebrate either on Sept. 14 or 15.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee further decided to hold a "peoples' banquet" in one of the largest halls in Chicago, in which all three organizations, the Czech, Czech-Catholics, and Slovak, will participate, and at which the head of the Czechoslovak Government, Professor T. G. Masaryk, will speak. This banquet will be sponsored by the State Council of Defense, and the American Security League. Invitations will be issued to federal, state, county, and city officals, and also to consuls of the Allied governments. A splendid program will be offered on this occasion.</p>

   <p>Officers of our Czechoslovak organizations have been requested to meet in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs next Friday evening for a discussion of the best means to make the parade on Sept. 14 a truly representative one.</p>
   <p>Last night's meeting was adjourned at 9:30, and the members left for the offices of the Military Committee, 26th Street between Ridgeway and Hamlin Avenues, from where thirty-five new recruits of the Czechoslovak Army were being accompanied on their way to the railroad station. We shall report on this farewell later. The representatives of the Czech National Alliance returned to continue the meeting. Their deliberations will surely result in arrangements which will make our appearance in Grant Park a memorable event.</p>
