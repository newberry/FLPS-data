   <p>The Pĕvecký Sbor Bedřich Smetana (Singing Society Bedřich Smetana) decided in its recent meeting to prepare for the performance of the great oratorio, "Jan Huss," by Johann Loewe in a Bohemian translation by Dr. V. Dvořák.</p>
   <p>Since this monumental composition requires long study and many rehearsals, and because the time for the commemoration of the five-hundredth anniversary of John Huss is getting closer and closer, the Society decided to postpone indefinitely the study and performance of "Prodaná Nevesta" (Bartered Bride) and start on the oratorio without any delay. The entire Bohemian public will no doubt appreciate this effort of the Pĕvecký Sbor Bedřich Smetana in preparing the famous oratorio for the 1915 John Huss celebrations....</p>
