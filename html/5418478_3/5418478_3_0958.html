   <p>A large and distinguished audience assembled yesterday afternoon in the Pilsen Sokol hall in order to hear our violin virtuoso, Miss Mignonette Schruta, in a concert which, as far as its artistic merit is concerned, was among the finest musical events of this season. The debutante, in spite of her youth, is maturing into one of the finest and most accomplished artists among us.....She is not only a talented performer, but also a composer of great promise.</p>
   <p>The program opened with Vieuxtemps' great violin concerto in D Minor. Miss Schruta has found an ideal interpreter of her songs in Miss Ella Kovar. Shorter violin selections, such as Borowski's "Adoration," Schubert's "Bee," and Weiding's "Venetian Serenade," as well as her own "Idyl," and Volpe's brilliant and extremely difficult "Mazurka" were played with perfect technique and deep musical understanding.....</p>
   <p>Miss Kovar then sang a group of songs, and in conclusion, Miss Schruta played a <span class="page-break">2</span>Bach "Prelude," Kreisler's sparkling "Caprice" and Wieniawski's "Polonaise".</p>
