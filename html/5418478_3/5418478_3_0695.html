   <p>For some weeks past our theatrical circles have been preparing and discussing the foundation of a new permanent theater in the Czech Pilsen district. Many of our people have voiced their approval of this idea. Thus encouraged, the leaders in these negotiations have speeded up matters, and now things are so far advanced that an official announcement of the foundation of a new theater in Pilsen may be made.</p>
   <p>Czech Pilsen will have, again after a number of years, a permanent Czech theater. The company will be known under the name of "Ceska Cinohra" (Czech Comedy), and its performances will be given in the hall of the Ceskoslovenske Podporujici Spolky (Czechoslovak Benevolent Association ) at May and 18th Streets.</p>
   <p>The first performance of this new dramatic body will take place next September 18. Its repertoire is composed exclusively of plays of value and merit, such <span class="page-break">2</span>as find favor with our public.</p>
   <p>Detailed information concerning this new cultural development in our Chicago colony will be published in the near future.</p>
