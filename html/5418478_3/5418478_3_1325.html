   <p>The executive committee of the Americká Obec Sokolská (American Sokol Union) in its meeting held October 25, 1920, unanimously decided to follow the Prague example in organizing the Všesokolský Slet (Mass Sokol Festival and Exhibition) which will be held in Chicago next year. Therefore the Chicago Slet will be conducted in a manner similar to the Prague Slets, and consequently it will be a miniature of those great national holidays celebrated in our old homeland.</p>
   <p>Also approved was the proclamation to Czechoslovak-American Sokols as proposed by Brother Vladimir Struppl. According to this proclamation, various units of the central district of the Americká Obec Sokolska will be asked to <span class="page-break">\2</span>select prospective members for the Slet committee, which will be officially appointed in the latter part of November. I should like to take this opportunity to request members of each unit of the central district to consider twice before sending in a list of selected brothers who would be willing to co-operate upon this great task. They are confronted with a great responsibility, because upon their selection depends the success or failure of the Slet.</p>
   <p>The work in connection with the Slet is not delightful, and it is not easy. Only brothers who are really willing to work not only in weekly meetings, but also all of the time; who have in mind only the success of the whole; who are positive that they can discharge their functions honorably; brothers who are indefatigable and steady should accept the invitation of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>executive committee and join the circle of those who are ready to work. If such workers are selected and sent to us, then I am not afraid of anything; then I shall be convinced that the next Slet will meet with a success which will be a sweet reward for those who have worked to make it successful.</p>
   <p>But the best and most disciplined committee would be of no use if there were no workers in Sokol halls, in units, and districts. These bodies are the foundations of all the success because, besides proper administration, a proper technical leadership must be displayed. Therefore all the Bohemians of America are urged to put their shoulders to the wheel.</p>
   <p>Do not think for a moment that there is plenty of time. On the contrary, it is high time to begin the preparatory work in our Sokol halls at once.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>A solid foundation can be given to this project by unwavering attendance at gym classes in our Sokol halls, by unparalleled discipline, and by obeying the instructors' commands. Only in an organization where order and discipline prevails is there a possibility of reaching the goal. Do not miss a single gym class, and prepare yourselves for the national holidays. Show the world that the Sokols will never betray the principles of the Sokol movement, that they will always work for the benefit of all, until the highest aim is reached.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, I make the following appeal to all the Czechoslovak people of America: Support this great Olympiad of ours with all your might; follow the example of your brothers in Czechoslovakia who, in spite of much worse circumstances, were so successful in financing the Prague Slet that no Government or City of Prague subventions were needed. During the World War you were the vanguard of our national causes--may you be the protectors of <span class="page-break">\5</span>this Slet which will signify a further milestone in the history of the Czechoslovak people of America!</p>
   <p>Vladimír Struppl.</p>
