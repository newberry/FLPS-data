   <p>Besides "Pražské Švadlenky" (Little Seamstresses of Prague), the play given most frequently by Ludvík's troupe is "Bordinkáři" (The Boarders). There are, therefore, few theatergoers among us who are not familiar with it. It was presented again last night. The audience was on time, though the "daylight-saving time" caused some confusion. The attendance was very good. Mrs. Splavec played the role of "Mrs. Hadršinec," and Mr. Skalický appeared as "Václav Kásparek". The performance went off smoothly in the true Ludvik players' style.</p>
