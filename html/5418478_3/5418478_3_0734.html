   <p>Today is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the arrival in America of the first Czech theatrical troupe; which was headed by František Ludvík, director. When, in the year 1892, the Czech settlements in America learned that the enterprising Ludvík intended to make a tour with his actors and present plays in the Czech language, there were many here who shook their heads and prophesied failure. In spite of this, the director began to work untiringly to strengthen the financial end of his venture and finally succeeded in winning the confidence of some influential and well-to-do Czech Americans, who supplied the money so necessary to carry out the plan. A finance committee was formed by Joseph Fučík, Joseph Jurka, August Geringer, and several others, who guaranteed the trip for twenty-three persons from Bohemia to America and placed eight hundred dollars at Mr. Ludvík's disposal with which he was to defray preliminary expenses. It was stipulated that when the troup began to play, it would also start paying back the traveling expenses and the advanced loan.</p>
   
   <p>On March 8 the ship "America" sailed from Bremen with "the first Czech theatrical company" aboard, to bring them to these transatlantic shores. On March 20 the actors landed in New York, where they were met by Mr. J. Jurka, manager and Mr. A. Erst. Many New York Czechs also welcomed them at the same hour, offering them free quarters in private homes.</p>
   <p>On March 26 the troupe played in the Central Opera House, presenting "Gazdina Roba" (Gazda's Robe), the first work from the pen of Gabriela Preis. This short season ended on April 6, when the players started on their way to Chicago, with stops at Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Detroit.</p>
   <p>The first performance in Chicago by the Ludvík troupe was given in the Haymarket Theater. This took place near the end of April. "Královna Barbora" (Queen Barbara) was the name of the play. On the same day, in the evening, "The Eleventh Commandment" was given by the same troupe, this time in the hall of the Česko-Slovanská Podporuj íc í Společnost (Czecho-Slav Aid Society) on 18th Street, in the heart of our Czech Pilsen district. This is the same building from which the main financial support for the Ludv ík troupe came, and where the idea of a permanent Czech theater in Chicago was realized. The Ludvik company showed its gratitude on every occasion toward the house that extended hospitality to the immigrant troupe twenty-five years ago and so helped Czech dramatic art to take root in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Ludv íkovci are known by this name all over Czech America today. They will commemorate the arrival in America of their unforgettable director, the late F. Ludv ík, on April 7 and close this year's season on the same date. The jubilee performance will take place in the Bohemian Benevolent Societies' hall, the spot where, twenty-five years ago, Czech words spoken by professional actors resounded from the stage for the first time in Chicago. "Naši Furianti" (Our Sports) by Stroupeznicky will be presented today.</p>
   <p>Every good thing has to go "through the mill" sometimes, and so, our theater also had its ups and downs, grievous moments, disappointments, and privation. Self-denial was necessary to clear the road for dramatic art. There are innumerable examples of handicaps and obstacles: One stage working to spite another, irresponsible theatrical producers, grumblers in their own ranks, and malcontents. They often broke their teeth in the fight with obstinate professional actors. In the midst of these combats which threatened the existence of our Czech theater, a handful of legitimate, honest actors thought not only of their own material welfare, but also of representing the Czech people in a dignified manner in the new homeland.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, those who have held out so bravely during that period of painful memories, who have worked persistently and for the welfare of the community, can now view with gratification the twenty-fifth year of their artistic activity. This historic fact will be chronicled in a memorial booklet which is being prepared by Director Ludvík, Jr. May the Czech theater stride through the next quarter of a century, headed toward a rebirth!</p>
