   <p>The performance given by the pupils of the Czech Conservatory of Music in the Lawndale Masonic Temple, on Millard Avenue last afternoon was a triumph for the pupils and teachers alike. Mr. Eduard Vlaciha, piano virtuoso, is director of the institute, and Mr. Vaclav [Venceslas] E. Medek is head of the violin department; both have a high standing among artists of this city. They are assisted by other artists: the Misses Libuse [Libby] Zdenek, Anna Dvorak, Libby Bartusek, and Mr. Joseph A. Krivanek.</p>
   <p>Two dance numbers added to the variety of the vocal and instrumental program: Miss Milada Krametbauer danced "Minuet" by Ludwig Van Beethoven, and Miss Mildred Triner presented the "Valse" from the ballet "Sylvia" by Delibes. These students are promising young artists of whom our Chicago Czech community may justly be proud.</p>
   
   <p>The musical part of the program consisted of classical and popular pieces and was executed with artistic skill and taste.</p>
