   <p>The demand for tickets for the second performance of Bedrich Smetana's 'Prodana Nevesta' (Bartered Bride) was so great that it compelled the management to produce it for the third time. The [second] performance will begin sharply at 2:30 P.M. today in the Sokol Chicago and while the first Chicago performance was given at the Studebaker, this afternoon performance will be really its first entree into the Czech community. Thus the most typically Bohemian opera will be enacted on a real Bohemian stage here.....</p>
   <p>As at its premiere at the Studebaker so this time also every single ticket has been sold in advance and at the box office; one may say that a week before the opera was to be given not a seat was left unsold. Never before in the history of the stage of the Czechs of Chicago was there such a demand for tickets. Alone Mr. Honsik, one of the best-known advance sales agents, whose pharmacy is located in the midst of the neighborhood, claimed that he could easily have sold 1000 more tickets had there been any <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>seats for them. The situation was similar in all other places where theater tickets are sold for our Czech stage.</p>
   <p>Even after it was announced that no more tickets remain, demands for them were coming in from those countrymen who were not quick enough to secure tickets on time. The management was constantly besieged with requests to give at least one more repeat performance and, if possible, to make it accessible to the poorer classes of our population by the introduction of reduced rates. This made a problem for the management, for the expenses of producing an opera nowadays, even with the strictest possible economy, are great. The orchestra alone, consisting of first-class professionals, costs more than the production of say - a whole operetta.</p>
   <p>In spite of these [economic] problems the management acceded to the demands of the public by its decision to give a third performance of the 'Bride'; this time irrevocably the last. The admission prices will be considerably less and the performance will again be given in the Sokol Chicago, the date set for this <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>last performance being April 11, 1923 at 8 P.M. sharp. The prices for the entire orchestra floor will be $1.50 per person with the exception of a few seats in the front which will be $2.00. The gallery seats will be $1.50, $1.00 and 75 cents. The advance sale for this final performance begins today and tickets may be obtained at the box office of the Sokol Chicago as well as in Mr. Honsik's pharmacy and Mr. Placek's restaurant.</p>
   <p>Surely those of our countrymen who missed their opportunity twice to secure tickets, will not delay this time, for by so doing they would deprive themselves of a rare aesthetic feast which will be accorded by the conscientious collaboration of the Pevecka Spolecnost Bedrich Smetana ([Bohemian Choral Society Bedrich Smetana) with the Spolecnost Cesko-Americkeho Narodniho Divadla (Bohemian-American National Dramatic Association).</p>
