   <p>The theatrical performance given yesterday by the capable dramatic Club, "Thalia", in the hall of the "Ces. Angl. Svob. Skola", (Bohemian-English Liberal School), was not so well attended as was expected, nevertheless, in view of the unfavorable weather it was satisfactory and for those who came there was certainly arranged a nice enjoyable evening.</p>
   <p>The drama, "Three Musketeers", is new on the local stage, based on Historical facts and boundless ecclesiastical intrigues in the court of Louis XIII. The scenes protrayed are artistic and truthful and the entire play so well arranged as to compel the spectator to wait for the finish to see how it ends.</p>
   <p>The leading roles were in the hands of some of our older proven actors and were well acted. The Three Musketeers (Jos. Jurka, F. Taraba, and E. Benes) D'Artagnan, the novice (Vac Lenoch), Richelieu (Mr. Adamek), Willers (Mr. Mayer, Anna (Miss Kucera), Constance (Miss Bedlanova) and Lady Winters (Mrs. O. Tradovaska) are all deserving of praise for their work.</p>
