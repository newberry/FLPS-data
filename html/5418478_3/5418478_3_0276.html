   <p>It seems that the Czechs, not only in Bohemia, but all over the world, have become aware of the fact that to achieve a full national development it will not suffice if we abandon ourselves to mere patriotic sighing and dreaming, but that we should direct all our energies towards an uplift in the field of economic activities. This is an item essential for our national life, more important than raving about the past glory of our forefathers, their great deeds, their heroism. As a result of having become conscious of this truth the nation is bestirring itself into manifold enterprises and is making remarkable progress in the distribution of its products in the world's markets, making at the same time their own country independent of foreign manufacture and commerce.</p>
   <p>The Czechs in foreign lands, especially in America, are beginning to stand economically on their own feet.</p>
