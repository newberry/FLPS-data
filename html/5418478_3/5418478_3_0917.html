   <p>Among our many large and small civic societies and associations, which serve a great variety of purposes, there is one--or rather one group--which is considered a public and national institution, whereas there is another group which, although equal in every respect to the first, has not yet succeeded in gaining the popularity and recognition to which it is just as fully entitled as the first group, and which has thus far remained a kind of wallflower in Bohemian-American public life.</p>
   <p>The first group, the Sokols, has already taken deep root, and by the recent merger of two of its largest units it has certainly gained new strength. There can be no doubt that it will continue to grow.</p>
   <p>Of the somewhat younger second group, the Ceska Pevecka Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies), hardly anybody can claim that it is growing and prospering as it should, although it, too, has a sound and firmly established foundation.</p>
   <p>If we consider somewhat closer the ends which these two groups serve, we find that these ends are practically identical. The Sokol motto, "A sound mind in a healthy body," is a fitting counterpart to the singers' motto, "By song to the heart, by the heart to the country". The Sokol drill disciplines the muscles and sharpens the mind which song rehearsals refresh. And where the proper kind of musical material is used, these rehearsals develop a cultured mind and lead to a greater appreciation of all the beauty that our great composers have put into their compositions. And only that nation stands on the pinnacle of progress which is not only physically strong, but which also excels in spiritual maturity and in a highly developed taste that can appreciate the delights derived from a judicious contemplation of the work of particularly talented individuals. Thus we see that both the Sokol and the singers are imbued with the same idea and the same aim, even if the method of one differs essentially from the method of the other.</p>
   <p>Why, then, do our people always show greater interest in a Sokol drill hall than in a song rehearsal? The reasons, although psychological in character, are several, but we propose to discuss only the three which seem to be the principal ones.</p>
   <p>In a gymnasium, a Sokol unit is divided into several squads according to the ability and expertness of the members. Each squad is independent of the others and has its own program. After a member of a squad has reached a certain degree of expertness, and his squad's drill no longer causes him any difficulties, he may be "promoted" any time into the next higher squad. This system stimulates his ambition and spurs him on to new and better performances, particularly when he keeps in mind the Sokol slogan, "Ahead!"</p>
   
   <p>Conditions are entirely different in singing societies. Here, there is no division of members according to ability; the grouping of the singers is determined solely by the range of voice, and this is the first stumbling block. The arrival of a new member with an insufficient musical education means temporary stagnation, if not actual retrogression, for several rehearsals or singing lessons, and where such incidents occur regularly every month, there is small wonder that the society does not progress as rapidly as it should and could, and that the older, trained singers display an ennui and an indifference by which the society is bound to suffer still more. These cases are typical, and the only exception is a society in which a great majority of its members have been active for many years, and where an occasional newcomer cannot affect the quality of its singing. There, as a rule, it is left to the newcomer to adapt himself and to try to reach the level of the others.</p>
   <p>It is always the duty of a new member to size up the situation and bring to it the proper understanding; he must never interpret the seeming indifference of the other members as a personal affront. Otherwise, a prejudice and a revulsion against singing and everything connected with it are bound to result. All this goes to prove that the difficulty in properly dividing their members is the first obstacle to the progress of our singing societies.</p>
   <p>The second reason for the greater popularity of the Sokol is, beyond question, its picturesque uniform. When a lad in his red shirt swings his jacket over one shoulder, his cap with the boldly protruding falcon feather resting at a dashing angle on his head--why, that is the time when the unique, true Bohemian hot blood starts surging through his veins. No wonder that he catches every eye! Nor does this admiration escape him: he feels a certain intoxication, and a new determination, a new zest for action, takes hold of him.</p>
   
   <p>True enough, among other national groups uniforms or uniformity of dress for members of singing societies is customary. But any attempt to introduce this custom among Bohemian singers would be absolutely useless and impossible for several reasons, of which I shall mention just one: anything of this kind would be considered "snobbery" by our people: it would never be regarded as an attempt to introduce something aesthetic and pleasing. At present, because of the lack of uniformity in dress, our societies frequently present something of a "sight" during public performances. Everybody can use his own imagination in describing the first impression they make on the audience. However, in extenuation of our singers, who are preponderantly recruited from among workingmen, it should here be mentioned that a certain conductor did not even deem it necessary to appear in a black suit when he conducted his chorus on the occasion of a seminational holiday before a hall filled overflowing.</p>
   <p>The third reason for the lack of real popularity of our singing societies is the comparative rarity of their public appearances, a result of the two reasons already discussed. It takes a much shorter time to prepare to perfection a program of Sokol drills for a public performance than to study a few songs to a degree compatible with the reputation of a progressive society, because it is impossible to rehearse simultaneously in several groups, as the Sokols can do.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, a part of the odium lies indisputably on the shoulders of those singers who do not recognize the necessity of many rehearsals for a good performance. But theirs is not the only fault. An even greater responsibility rests upon our lodges, our national and cultural associations, and other organizations because they do not offer the singing societies frequent enough occasion for performing in public. All they need do is to ask the singers to perform when they hold their social gatherings, meetings, banquets, and other festivities. There would be a twofold benefit: The program of these events would be more colorful and more interesting, and the quality of the singing would gradually improve--to say nothing of the fact that public interest in such a good and beautiful activity as singing would be heightened, something it unquestionably deserves. And I am sure that none of our societies would refuse such a request.</p>
