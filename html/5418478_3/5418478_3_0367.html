   <p>The Bohemian national songs and dances "for piano", part two, appeared in the bookstores, and were published by August Geringer, arranged by the musicteacher J. Kpula. The arrangement of this second part is as beautiful as the first part.</p>
   <p>The price is 50Â¢, which is very reasonable, taking into consideration the circumstances, which must be overcome by this kind of Bohemian publication. There are eight popular national songs, each one with accompaniment.-</p>
   <p>Every Bohemian household possessing a Bohemian heart, and piano, or organ, will not omit the opportunity to acquire this songbook. Our music-teachers should recommend this beautiful edition to their pupils for home exercise and amusement.</p>
