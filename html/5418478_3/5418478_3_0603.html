   <p>Another link in the chain which binds Chicago and Czechoslovakia are the mural decorations by the celebrated Bohemian artist, Alphonse Mucha, which will be presented to the city of Prague by Charles R. Crane of Chicago and the artist. These are now being shown on the balcony about the grand stairway of the Art Institute.</p>
   <p>Those who have been thrilled by the spirit of the new Czechoslovakia new see in the paintings of Mucha some of the high spots in its glorious past; stirring events, fully as dramatic as those through which they have just lived.</p>
   <p>The panels shown at the Art Institute are five of a series of twenty which will be presented to Prague. Mucha has been working on these since 1911. Six others have been completed, but these are not shown.</p>
