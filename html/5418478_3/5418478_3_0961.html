   <p>We have written in the last few days that we expect a rare treat in the presentation of Dvořák's immortal "Stabat Mater" a more ambitious attempt than has previously been made among us.</p>
   <p>We were not disappointed in the least. On the contrary, we are afraid that we will not be able to find the words with which to express our appreciation of the time, the work, and the patience, which the members of the Česká Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies) have devoted to the study and performance of an outstanding work which is today considered one of the most difficult modern oratorios.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's concert of the Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota, at which Dvořák's "Stabat Mater" was the high point, was performed in such a manner as to give <span class="page-break">\2</span>credit to and withstand the criticisms of a "Rudolfinum", [a famed concert hall of Prague known for concerts of the very first order] or any other great music or concert hall in Bohemia, where the criterion by which an artistic performance is measured is more severe than here in America, and especially in Bohemian America.</p>
   <p>After the long years of musical barrenness yesterday's concert was refreshing. We do not exaggerate in the least when we say that yesterday "Stabat Mater" was produced in such a way as to give us--for the first time in fifty years--an incentive to find ourselves, an urge to do more.</p>
   <p>And we can do more, if we want to. We have the material, the strength, and the ability to function properly. All that is needed to put them in operation is a measure of recognition of our accomplishments by the general public. If the public would show a greater interest in artistic activities, a more abundant life than that we have lived heretofore would develop.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Yesterday we found ourselves and showed more clearly than ever before that if we cared, we could do wonders. It seems that we need a man who would give us the impulse to work without regard to obstacles in our path.</p>
   <p>Our Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota, inspired by the enthusiasm of its conductor, Professor J. Malý, seems to have acquired new youth in yesterday's accomplishment. Professor Malý is a man who is not afraid of difficulties he will be sure to meet in the study and preparation of such a daring composition as the oratorio "Stabat Mater".</p>
   <p>The oratorio was preceded by a regular concert program of three selections for men's voices. Two of these have been heard here before: Smetana's "Veno" (Dedication), and Tovacovsky's "Vlasti" (To The Fatherland). The singing of these two numbers did not rise above the average.</p>
   <p>A new number was the composition by J. B. Foerster, "Polni Cestou" (By a Path through the Field). The men's chorus sang it very delicately and with <span class="page-break">\4</span>the proper nuances, depicting a funereal procession singing and marching sadly through the fields.</p>
   <p>After a short interval, "Stabat Mater" was presented.</p>
   <p>About this work we have often written. In its ten long parts this oratorio expresses in song the pain of a mother whose son was crucified. It was begun very beautifully with a quartet and mixed chorus. The chorus did full justice to the fine gradation of this part which was sung with admirable understanding.</p>
   <p>The second part of the oratorio is a quartet of outstanding beauty. The third part is technically very difficult and highly melodious. The fourth part was characterized by a solo which was most beautifully rendered and which was accompanied by a mixed chorus. The fifth part reminds of a Handel fugue, but it has a purely Bohemian character. The sixth part was less effective because its solos were sung by a weaker voice which could not compete with the volume of sound of a male chorus.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>But to compensate for this deficiency, the seventh part was sung beautifully, and the mixed chorus covered itself with glory. The ninth part lagged a little, but the tenth made up for that. Its alto solo is considered one of the most beautiful parts of the oratorio. It is the most melodious one of the whole composition. The whole chorus and the soloist were especially successful in rendering the central phrase of the theme. The more rapid tempo in "Amen" seemed a little confusing for the singers but soon the chorus caught the beat to perfection and finished with a grandeur which did full justice to the text.</p>
   <p>The oratorio was rendered by a chorus of two hundred voices, a quartet consisting of Mrs. L. Topinka (soprano), Miss Ella Kolář (alto), Mr. Josef Hurt (tenor), Mr. G. Holmquist, an orchestra of twenty-one musicians, and a piano and organ which were used for accompaniment.</p>
   <p>In her solo parts and in the quartet Miss Ella Kolář captured the attention of the audience by her strong clear voice of a caliber we usually associate <span class="page-break">\6</span>with professionals. It is interesting to note that Miss Ella Kolář is a recent graduate of the Český Dělnický Pěvecký Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society). Its members can be justly proud of their accomplished pupil.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Louise Topinka was her usual fine self and displayed her art to the fullest extent.</p>
   <p>Mr. G. Holmquist possesses a voice which is both strong and sympathetic, and of a very wide range.</p>
   <p>Mr. Josef Hurt's tenor voice and his bearing are very pleasant. Unfortunately his voice was completely drowned out by that of Mr. Holmquist.</p>
   <p>Mr. Malý conducted the oratorio in an excellent manner. It was evident that he had given much time to its study, a fact which speaks well for him.</p>
   <p>The members of the orchestra were selected by our great virtuoso Mr. Frantisek Hladky, and the conductor, Mr. Malý, had them under full control.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The attendance was fairly large, considering the weather. But it should have been much larger, because so much depended on the attendance from the financial point of view. The expenses of this performance will be covered, and they were quite considerable, but no profit is expected, which is a pity.</p>
   <p>The public should have shown a greater desire for co-operation with the management by a large attendance, and the same applies to our Bohemian societies. Many times our public and our societies support an undertaking which brings them neither material nor moral return. We know also that our societies frequently ask the Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota for help in filling programs at their entertainments, and they are never refused. The indifference toward yesterday's concert indicates that the Ustredi Pevecka Jednota should be more careful in choosing its patrons.</p>
   <p>Of all the Bohemian societies, the only one which acted in the proper spirit was Sokol Slávsky. They came without being summoned. And of such societies, there should be many more.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Had the Ústřední Pĕvecká Jednota met with the financial success that we had hoped for, we should have been inclined to plead with its membership to repeat "Stabat Mater"--if it is at all possible--for the benefit of those who are less favored with worldly goods and who, we are sure, would be extremely grateful for an opportunity to hear this composition.</p>
