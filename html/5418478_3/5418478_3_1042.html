   <p>The Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society has been active among us for fifteen years. It saved and added penny to penny, dollar to dollar, for fifteen years, until it finally accumulated enough money to acquire its own home. Today it is quartered there. The desire which was prevalent among its members from the very beginning of its organization has been satisfied.</p>
   <p>The society inaugurated activities in its new home yesterday. That it was somewhat of a holiday for its members is not surprising, for every one felt a sort of holiday spirit. There was also another reason for this--the society was at the same time strengthened by the induction of about forty members of the Hlahol Society into membership in the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society. The induction was performed by the president, Mr. F. Hruby, who then made a report on the acquisition of the building at 804 Ashland Avenue, which was formerly <span class="page-break">2</span>the headquarters of the Pilsen Bicylists. He announced at the same time that according to the Society's resolution, the male members of the Hlahol Society will become members of the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society, whereas the women members will form a separate branch which will continue to beer the name of Hlahol, coming within the scope of the Societys' jurisdiction although having its own internal government. After the induction ceremonies had been completed. Messrs. Vanek, Kalas, and Hruska spoke a few sincere words in behalf of the Society, and an unrestrained holiday entertainment ensued, for which the new headquarters offer abundant opportunity.</p>
   <p>Although the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society has its own headquarters now, it has not yet reached its goal, for it still needs a suitable place for its singing and violin school. At first the Society had intended to have the building altered, but since it realized that this would cost too much, it is working on a new idea--to build a new school building on its property, where there is a large and suitable space. In that way their property would increase <span class="page-break">3</span>considerably in value, whereas money put into alterations would, in this respect, be in no way profitable. This is a good idea which will no doubt be carried out soon. The building is to have a spacious hall upstairs, where rehearsals will be held. On the first and second floors are club rooms arranged for the comfort and amusement of members.</p>
   <p>The Workingmen's Singing Society was organized August 14, 1890, and began to sing in January, 1891, with eighteen members. Mr. Simonek was its first instructor. The Society now has 165 members, of whom 35 are active. Mr. Kalas is the present instructor. The Society maintains a singing school of four grades, the graduates of which are admitted to the Maj Club, which is composed of young candidates for membership. The Society also maintains a violin school in which Messrs. Halamicek and Pribyl teach four days a week. The activity of the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society is such that every member may be proud that he belongs to an organization preoccupied with activities so beneficial.</p>
