   <p>The exhibition of etchings by the Czech artist, T. F. Simon, at Mr. Roullier's, in the Fine Arts Building in Chicago, on which we reported early in December has closed after having achieved and unusual success. The rows of exhibits grew thinner by leaps and bounds; on the tenth day of the exhibition two-thirds of the etchings had been sold and now decorate American salons. Mr. Roullier proclaimed to us, with joyful satisfaction, that he had not had such success with any other artist. Simons works will often travel to America in the future.</p>

   <p>The Bohemian-American artist, Mario J. Korbel, is now working on a monument for the family Beranek; it will be finished before Decoration Day, when it will be duly admired at the Bohemian National cemetery. It is to be in the shape of a statue over life-size, symbolizing mourning. Another work by Korbel arrived for the Ansonia hotel - a bust of Emmy Destinn. It has evoked much admiration among art lovers, and enthusiasm in the artist herself.</p>
