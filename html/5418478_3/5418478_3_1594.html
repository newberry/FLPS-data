   <p>A special train of the Wabash Railroad carried our Sokols to the world's fair city, St. Louis, yesterday. The train left the depot at Polk and Dearborn streets at 11:00 o'clock last night. In addition to the travelers, many of their friends and acquaintances came to the depot to see them off. The Sokols were leaving in gay spirit, which was not to be wondered at, for they were going to see the wonders exposition and add to the extraordinary brilliance of Bohemian Day at the fair, and gain new laurels in the Sokol competitions.</p>
   <p>Another special train will leave Thursday evening carrying our singers to St. Louis. There is still time to join this expedition; and anyone wishing to do so should make application to the secretary of the committee Mr. St. Halik.</p>
