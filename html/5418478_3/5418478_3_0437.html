   <p>The efforts exerted to raise chamber music to a higher level have passed the trial stage, and today there is no difficulty in getting an audience for this type of music.</p>
   <p>The best proofs of this are the concerts arranged at Stiles Hall on Millard Avenue and 22nd Street. The second concert of the season was held there yesterday, and, like the first, had an attendance which filled every seat in the hall with an audience appreciative of artistic creations.</p>
