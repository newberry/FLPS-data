   <p>Our Czechoslovak playgoers, who, every Sunday, attend in such large numbers the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Frantisek Ludvik Bohemian Dramatic Association), have little cause to complain that the repertory of that theater is lacking in variety. A week ago they had an opportunity to see the superbly staged fantastic play by Capek, the "R. U. R.," and on the following Sunday they were highly entertained by the charming operetta "'Andulcina prvni laska" (Annie's First Love), which to us is also a novelty. It is a fine operetta, in many ways differing from the commonplace Viennese genre; it is pleasing by its effective songs, its sweet melodies, and its irrepressible humor. Thanks to all this the audience retains its gay mood throughout the play. The plot itself is, of course, rather simple, as is usually the case in operettas of this kind. The heroine, Andulka Koudelka, who, in the first act and on the occasion of some festival, is chosen as queen of the festival, falls in love with the Baron Horsky, who, incidentally, happens to be a married man. The disenchantment follows in the second act, and in the third the audience is surprised by Andulka's <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>wedding to Karel Holecek, a lad whom she had jilted in a previous scene. The role of Andulka and that of her father Karel are the star parts in the play and were also the best portrayed. They were fully satisfactory, to say the least, both as regards acting and singing, something which cannot be said about some of the other roles in this operetta. Miss Zdenek, who sang the role of Andulka, was once again in her own element. She had an opportunity to show her musical ability, and her song numbers were the chief attraction of the evening.....Mr. Bezdek, playing the role of Andulka's father, portrayed the humorous personality of a country dad so well that this role may be considered one of his best.....Very successful, too, was the chorus of children which formed a part of the second act; the little songsters were so well received that they had to give an encore.....Thanks to the managerial ability of Mrs. B. Ludvik, the course of the operetta was brisk; the stagecraft, too, was exemplary.....</p>
   <p>The Cicero Stage</p>
   <p>Our Cicero playgoers had an opportunity last Sunday to enjoy a most interesting <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>theatrical tidbit, by attending the brothers Mrstik's gorgeous play "Marysa" (Maisie), produced on the stage of the Sokol Karel Jonas. The popularity of this play has not decreased since its premiere. Of course it is a difficult vehicle for amateurs, requiring very close attention to the characters of the play, and a most thorough rehearsing of the dialect peculiarities. The amateur players of the dramatic department of the Sokol, however acquitted themselves well. Thanks to an able stage management every possible care was exercised to overcome the above difficulties and every one of the amateur actors proved that he took his role seriously. Mrs Marie Smiricky played the title role.....</p>
   <p>.....To make the production of "Marysa" as realistic as possible, the stage management secured the services of the well-known Slovacky Vzdelavaci Klub (Slovak Culture Club), the members of which co-operated by dancing several Slovak folk dances at the proper time. [Translator's note: The play itself deals with Slovakia and its folk life.] There can be no doubt that the peasant lads and lasses, who appeared on the stage dressed in their Slovak folk costumes, pleased the audience greatly, since every one of the folk dances brought <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>renewed salvos of applause. Mr. J. Cerny's orchestra also deserves mention. The house was sold out and our amateurs may rest assured that they delighted the audience.</p>
