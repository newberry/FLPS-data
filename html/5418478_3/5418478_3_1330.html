   <p>The executive committee of the Americka Obec Sokolska (American Sokol Union), in its past meeting, decided to arrange a Vsesokolsky Slet (Mass Sokol Festival) in Chicago in 1921. It will be a review of the ranks of the Czechoslovak-American Sokols--a review of their growth and a review of accomplishments of the Czechoslovak nation of America in the cultural fields. Therefore we must work diligently, right from the beginning, in order to make the Vsesokolsky Slet a success and prove that even we in America can honorably pass the test, and that we can boldly take our place beside the Czechoslovak Sokols in our old homeland.</p>
   <p>There will be greater festivals than any ever seen before in Chicago, because the Vsesokolsky Slet will be held in connection with the celebration of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>unification of all Sokols of the entire world into one inseparable unit. We shall show the world that even we are a universal element which must be taken into consideration, that we are able to appreciate the might of a single united organization. Those will be historic days which we shall live through in the presence of the representatives of the whole world, in the presence of our dearest brothers from beyond the ocean, from our old home-land. They will surely be glad to repay our visit to the Vsesokolsky Slet held in Prague this year, and we will prove to them that even we, the youngest branch of the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze (Czechoslovak Sokol Union of Prague), are a creative unit which has the ability to survive. We will open our hearts to them just as they opened theirs to us at the time of our visit to our old homeland. In work we shall unite and in work we shall stand fast and inseparable in in spite of snares and difficulties.</p>
   <p>Such a program should be our aim and therefore we must not hesitate, but start upon the preparatory work instantly. Of first importance is the organization of the Sletovy Vybor (Slet Committee). It surely will be <span class="page-break">\3</span>to our advantage if we follow the beautiful example of the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska v Praze and organize everything according to their experience. As a member of the administration and foreign committee of the past Vseso-kolsky Slet, I propose that the Prague example be followed.</p>
   <p>The work should proceed as follows: The Americka Obec Sokolska should appeal to all the Chicago units to nominate prospective members for the Sletovy Vybor. The individual units should pick out tried and conscientious workers and recommend them directly to the Americka Obec Sokolska. This organization then, after careful consideration, should select and appoint these brothers to the Sletovy Vybor, which then would be established. The executive committee of the Americka Obec Sokolska should be fully represented in this committee. The Sletovy Vybor then should elect its officers, consisting of the chairman, two vice-chairmen, probably two secretaries, and the recording secretary. At the first meeting of the Sletovy Vybor, the chairmen of various committees should be appointed. These should be appointed in such a manner that the chairman of the Sletovy Vybor would be chairman of the foreign committee, <span class="page-break">\4</span>the secretary would be chairman of the administration committee, and all the other members of the Vybor would be chairmen of various committees according to their knowledge and their abilities. These chairmen then should appoint those brothers who are really willing to help and to participate in these activities as members of their respective committees. The membership of various committees would depend upon the existing circumstances.</p>
   <p>Besides the Sletovy Vybor, the following committees are to be appointed: Finance committee, technical committee, business committee, administration committee, foreign committee, transportation committee, lodging committee, arrangements committee, and building committee. The first three mentioned committees must be appointed immediately and must start the preliminary work at once. Besides these above-mentioned committees, a Slet office, under the management of the secretary of the Vybor, should be established and provided with sufficient help. The secretary should take care of the correspondence and fulfill the wishes and wants of individual committees.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>He must be informed about everything, and therefore he is a regular member of the Sletovy Vybor.</p>
   <p>The administration committee is the real center of activities as far as administration and organization work is concerned. It is the duty of every committee to consult this committee for advice upon all matters.</p>
   <p>Besides the plenary Sletovy Vybor, the chairmen of various committees hold their own meetings and are authorized, in case of necessity, to pass upon various matters.</p>
   <p>If the work is so divided, only success can be the result. A proof of this was the Vsesokolsky Slet held in Prague this year. Nowhere was there the slightest mark of hindrance; really astonishing accuracy was apparent everywhere. Each committee worked hand in hand with other committees just like clockwork. It was an organization tried by many years of experience which brilliantly withstood the test. Therefore, in the interest of the <span class="page-break">\6</span>whole project, I ask that this be used as an example.</p>
   <p>With this Vsesokolsky Slet we intend to invigorate our Sokol organization; we intend to avert the slow process of decay in our units. We firmly believe that the Vsesokolsky Slet in Chicago in the year 1921 will be a great success; we believe that the interest and enthusiasm of a majority of our honest and enthusiastic members of the Sokol organizations of America will be greatly strengthened.</p>
   <p>The Sletovy Vybor must be supported by all means, not only by Czechoslovak-American Sokols, but also by every Czechoslovak. The Czechoslovak people of America must take into consideration the enormous significance of this Vsesokolsky Slet for the Czechoslovak nation.</p>
   <p>I hope that what I have said is not in vain, that the Bohemian and Slovak heart, which proved to be so generous during the period of the greatest distress and misery of our brothers beyond the ocean, even now will prove <span class="page-break">\7</span>and show the world that it fully comprehends its standing in the Czechoslovak nation--to be its vanguard. Therefore, all of us, without exception, should begin to work for the benefit of the Vsesokolsky Slet in Chicago in the year 1921!</p>
