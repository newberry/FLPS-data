   <p>Our businessmen contributed very generously to our popular festival, the Posviceni, which did not draw the expected crowds on account of bad weather. As a result of this, large quantities of the goods donated have been left unsold. In order to dispose of them for the benefit of our patriotic cause, the arrangements committee invites our public to a celebration which is to be an aftermath of the festival. It is to be held on Sunday, September 8, in the Pilsen Brewery Park. This affair will no doubt be much better attended, and the weather is expected to be much better.</p>
   <p>Goods promised by some of our businessmen were not called for on account of the bad weather. The donors are requested to hold them over for the festival next Sunday. Our ladies are asked to leave word at the committee's office, 3639 West 26th Street, whether they would like to donate some bakery goods for the second festival.</p>
