   <p>It was fifty years ago yesterday that a great Bohemian and Slav, and a great man whose name is inseparable from the history of the rebirth of the Bohemian nation, breathed out his noble soul in Prague. It was Jindrich Fuegner, the founder of the Sokol and the first commander of the Sokol Prazsky (Prague Sokol), whose lofty ideals, later on more deeply elaborated by Dr. Miroslav Tyrs, have become the heirloom of not only the Bohemian nation, but of the whole of Slavdom.</p>
   <p>This sad anniversary was commemorated by the educational committee of the Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs (Sokol unit called Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs) by a concert and entertainment held in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on Lawndale Avenue yesterday.</p>
   <p>The educational committee has done everything in its power to give our public an opportunity to pay homage to one of the greatest figures of our modern history, and it is not their fault if its intentions have not found any degree of co-operation by the public and if even the membership of the Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs has failed to make a decent showing and to fill, at least to a somewhat satisfactory degree, the festive hall.</p>
   <p>The principal point of the program was a lecture about Fuegner delivered by Brother Joza Dittert.....</p>
   <p>There was a rich program of musical selections, both instrumental and vocal, and a number of drill presentations performed by members of the Sokol Slavsky and Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, as well as a tableau entitled "At Fuegner's Tombstone....."</p>
