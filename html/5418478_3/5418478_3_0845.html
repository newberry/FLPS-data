   <p>A highly meritorious performance of Smetana's great comic opera was given by the Bedrich Smetana Singing Society of Chicago at the Studebaker Theatre Sunday afternoon, March 18. Members, supported by a few professionals accomplished wonders.</p>
   <p>The audience, including musical critics of Chicago daily papers, could not speak highly enough of the production.</p>
   <p>The Smetana singers have given the "Bartered Bride" on many previous occasions.</p>
   <p>This year the society was especially fortunate in securing Mrs. M. Havelkova to fill the principal part. She made an ideal Marenka; she has the voice, the good looks and considerable experience on the stage. She alone made the production worth seeing.</p>
   <p>The Russian Opera had just closed a four weeks' engagement in Chicago and naturally comparisons were suggested.</p>

   <p>The consensus of opinion among musicians present was that the "Bartered Bride," as given by the Smetana Singing Society, was fully equal to the best that the Russians produced.</p>
   <p>As the opera was given on Sunday afternoon, when there are a dozen musical events in the loop, the critics saw only a part of the performance. So their reviews are not extended, but they are full of praise. It is a pity, though, that nearly the entire audience was composed of Chicago Czechs. The society had large expenses and did not want to run the chance of unsold seats. So all the tickets were sold out three weeks ahead to the Bohemian lovers of the opera and the general American music loving public had no chance to see the "Bartered Bride," with the exception of the few who were invited by their Bohemian friends.</p>
