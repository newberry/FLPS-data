   <p>Today the gates of our historical Pilsen Park will be opened to a project whose foremost purpose is to lend aid to those crippled and sick warriors who fought for Czechoslovak independence, and to widows and orphans of our fallen legionnaires. Czechoslovak-America is expected to help. During the war, and in the period following, the Czechoslovaks in America gave a great deal, but this was almost nothing in proportion to their might and wealth. In order to get more, the golden key to the Bohemian-American pocketbooks must be found.</p>
   <p>Today, the key is in the hands of our legionnaires.</p>
   <p>At the time when the gates of Pilsen Park are opened, a stream of gold, silver, and currency will also start to flow; and each drop of this merry <span class="page-break">\2</span>stream is designated to fill some hungry belly, to clothe some ragged person, to kindle a fire in some cold fireplace, to wipe away tears from some weary face, to enliven hope and faith in many a despondent bosom. Anyone who would hesitate to enrich this beneficent stream would really not be worthy of the name of Bohemian, Slovak, or of man.</p>
   <p>Our American Czechoslovak legionnaires, with the help of many hundreds of our willing countrymen, initiated this project. But the creators of the Baz치r-Svobody (Liberty Bazaar) did not for a moment depend upon the assumption that only a simple call to our countrymen to fulfill their duties would be sufficient and that the Baz치r-Svobody would successfully accomplish what is expected of it for the benefit of those who suffer. They initiated a project of such a nature that, in itself, without any appeal, it is a great attraction for thousands and thousands of our countrymen, and which will be a meeting place for all the Czechoslovak people of Chicago and vicinity during the next five days.</p>
   <p>Never in the history of our Pilsen Park have there been so many attractions <span class="page-break">\3</span>and entertainments as there are in the present bazaar. Surely it might be said that all the previous projects combined have not had so many actual attractions of such unusual style as there are in the legionnaires' bazaar.</p>
   <p>Below we present to our readers a total list of attractions which everybody will be able to see at the bazaar. It is a long list and includes many things which nobody but legionnaires could acquire. It means that anybody who is going to see this bazaar and who will spend a couple of dollars or quarters there, whether it be for his education or his entertainment, will do more for himself than for the cause for which this bazaar is arranged.</p>
   <p>Look at the list of things to see at the Baz치r Svobody:</p>
   <p>A war exhibition: Thousands of souvenirs from battlefields--guns, grenades, gas masks war necessities, various souvenirs made by soldiers, etc.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Battle tanks: Moving forts which turned many a severe combat to the advantage of the Allies.</p>
   <p>Reflectors: Apparatus used to throw light beams to a great distance, and which in modern warfare is indispensable.</p>
   <p>A soldiers' camp: Replica made of tents which were loaned by the United States Army.</p>
   <p>A field kitchen: Here every visitor can really taste a soldiers' ration.</p>
   <p>An army band: It will play in the park and lead the parade.</p>
   <p>A dance hall: This is for legionnaires and nonlegioncaires.</p>
   <p>A registration place where every Czechoslovak of Chicago may register and pay the national tax.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>A popularity contest among our Chicago Czechoslovak politicians.</p>
   <p>War films which so far have not been shown in Chicago. They will show life in our legions in motion pictures.</p>
   <p>Foyer du soldat, a place where our legionnaires and their guests will be entertained.</p>
   <p>Restaurant and tea room with a rich bill of fare and an adequate supply of good drinks.</p>
   <p>Booths: Various booths will be managed by the following organizations: The Czechoslovak Aid Committee, the Central District of America Sokol Union, the Legionnaires, the Bohemian-American Red Cross, the Master Butchers' Association, the Priadky, and the Slovak Educational Club.</p>
   <p>A great parade is being arranged for Sunday afternoon. A contest of Slavonic <span class="page-break">\6</span>singing societies will be held at the bazaar on Sunday afternoon.</p>
   <p>This is only a general, brief outline of the bazaar's attractions. Who then, after seeing this long list of attractions, could doubt that the bazzar will be a chain of brilliant successes during its five days? Who will dispute the fact that every visitor will find this a place where he will enjoy himself and from which he will carry away unfading memories?</p>
   <p>Therefore "Vzhuru do baz치ru!" (Let us go to the bazaar!) today or any other day before Sunday!</p>
