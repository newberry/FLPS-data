   <p>p.2--Yesterday's benefit performance for Mr. J. Javorsky in the Lido Theater was one of the most successful of those which have appeared on this stage this season. Mr. J. Javorsky himself took part in it.</p>
   <p>The play, of which the plot was fascinating and interesting, was made even more effective by the wonderful acting. It was perfectly rendered even to the smallest detail.</p>
   <p>The large audiences in the Lido Theater have proved that the public recognizes the high quality of performance of these artists.</p>
   <p>The management intends to maintain the high standard which it has set in order to insure large attendance at all future presentations at the Lido Theater.</p>
