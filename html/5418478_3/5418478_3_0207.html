   <p>The Sdruzeni Ceskych Sluzebnych Devcat (Bohemian Maid Servants' Association), which was recently organized in Dvorak Park on May and 20th Streets, exercises a most beneficial influence over its members. The maids meet every Sunday afternoon in the spacious hall of the Dvorak Park field house for fellowship, recreation, and entertainment after a week of hard work. It is especially gratifying that our spirited girls from Moravia have joined the Sdruzeni, and it is a pleasure to see them mingling and enjoying themselves among the maids from Bohemia. Here is an example of true sisterly love. The Park administration is doing everything in its power to make the meetings both entertaining and beneficial and hopes that all Bohemian and Moravian maids within reach of Dvorak Park will be attending these meetings. There are no dues, no collections--an afternoon of wholesome fun without any expense. Last Sunday there was a program of songs--old Bohemian lyrics, patriotic and sentimental songs--by the Sdruzeni's singing society. It was <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>followed by a very successful recitation of the poem "Kral, Ktery Nad Prahou Plakal" (A King Who Wept over Prague) and a comical dialogue, "Domaci Lekar" (Home "Doctor"). Next Sunday the girls will hear Lev Zelenka-Lerando's travelogue on London and England.</p>
