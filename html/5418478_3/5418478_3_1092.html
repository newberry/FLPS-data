   <p>"Slunovrat," with the sub-title "A Contest between Two Women," was given for the first time by the amateur actors in the hall of Sokol Havlíček-Tyrš last night. Albert J. Havránek, a Chicago Czech news writer, is the author. "We regret to state that it was not accorded the quality of performance which it deserves. Aside from sporadic efforts, the playing was superficial." The work is called "a comedy" by the author, although it ends in tragedy and fathoms love of life in its profound depth.</p>
   <p>The performance was a disappointment for the author and also for the audience, which filled the hall to demonstrate its love for Czech plays. This piece is a genuine product of Czech-American dramatic art, and, if performed accordingly, would hold its own on any legitimate stage.</p>
   <p>The performance was given for the benefit of Mr. Švejnar, who selected a part <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which corresponds with his ability, and not one in which other actors can show themselves to better advantage.....</p>
