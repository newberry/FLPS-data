   <p>The Czech theatrical troupe called Ludvikovci [named after the veteran actor, Frantisek Ludvik, who was its first director] was favored with an extraordinarily large audience when it gave the drama "Vojnarka," by Jirasek, in the Thalia theater last night. Large audiences are rare among us nowadays because of the many obligations imposed by the War. However, the announcement that the proceeds of the performance will benefit Mrs. Otilie Splavec, a well-known and excellent artist, attracted throngs of admirers of her art.</p>
   <p>"Vojnarka" is one of the best of Jirasek's works, and yet it is reduced to the grade of a Cinderella in the flood of plays of German origin on our scene. This fact alone gave yesterday's performance a festive glamour, which was augmented by a truly brilliant display of the histrionic abilities of the actors.</p>
