   <p>The Czechoslovak people of Chicago will meet tomorrow afternoon in Pilsen Park, located on West 26th Street and Albany Avenue, to rejoice and to amuse themselves in a true Bohemian country fashion. The occasion will be a real Narodni Pout (National Pilgrimage), which was organized to help to facilitate the purchase of an athletic field for the Sokols. Everybody who attends this festival will re-live and re-experience all the joys of Czech pilgrimages, such as he always looked forward to in his youth. At this Pout he will see all those objects and situations which entertained him so much on similar occasions, such as gingerbread booths, harmonica players, pretzel venders, a circus, and all those usual attractions which one meets at a pilgrimage. It goes without saying that there will be a Czech village band, etc.</p>
