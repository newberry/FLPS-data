   <p>A joint meeting of the singing section of Sokol Chicago and the Dalibor Singing Society was held in the hall of Sokol Chicago on Kedzie Avenue, last Tuesday. At this meeting it was decided to unite these two societies into one organization under the name Pevecky Odbor Sokol Chicago (Singing Section of Sokol Chicago). Many members of Dalibor failed to attend the meeting. They are hereby notified of the change and are requested to attend the meeting on next Tuesday, in the Sokol Chicago Hall. By this unification, the singing section of Sokol Chicago has become one of the most powerful singing organizations, and our only hope is that with its new vocal material it will continue to progress successfully toward its goal, to the honor of Bohemian singers.</p>
