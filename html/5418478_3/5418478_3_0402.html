   <p>Miss Ella Kolar, about whom we have had occasion to report in previous issues of the Denni Hlasatel, and who is well known among our Czech theatergoers, gave an outstanding performance in a concert arranged by Mr. A. V. Cerny and held in the Carter H. Harrison High School. On this occasion Miss Kolar took part in Anton Dvorak's famous "Stabat Mater". She studied voice in....Italy, and made her first American debut in Boston on April 21, 1922. After her successes abroad, it can easily be seen that her triumphant reception in Boston was well deserved.</p>
   <p>In Italy her audiences called her "a newly risen star," and on April 21, Boston itself agreed with that dictum. Our Chicago countrywoman sang in the Boston Symphony Hall accompanied by the Italian Symphony Orchestra under <span class="page-break">\2</span>the baton of Signor Raffaele Martino. Her piano accompaniment was played by Signor Arturo Casiglia. The concert was attended by the famed Boston "blue bloods," headed by the mayor....and voices everywhere predicted that she was a new Mary Garden..... The Boston papers, such as The Boston Globe and The Boston Herald, were quite effusive in their praise of our countrywoman....and we report this with great pleasure since she is our Chicago product. Her father, Mr. Antonin Kolar, resides at 6003 Roosevelt Road, Cicero, Illinois.....</p>
