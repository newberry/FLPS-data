   <p>It is about three weeks since we printed a report about Mr. Karel F. Weiss, the seventeen-year-old son of our well-known countryman Mr. K. Weiss of 4511 So. Wood Street. Today it is with pleasure we report that the English press also appreciates the talented young artist. The Chicago Daily Journal writes the following:</p>
   <p>"Young Weiss, though only seventeen years old, has made remarkable progress in painting and his paintings "Sunset" and "The Milkmaid" are deserving of special recognition. He started his journey in art as a child with a pencil. His work did not pass unnoticed and his father, upon the advice of his many friends, sent the boy to the Art Institute for one year where he learned, as he himself realizes, only how to handle water colors. The young artist occupies himself especially with landscape painting and has a considerable number of landscape paintings for sale. In addition to his painting he assists his father in his barber shop."</p>
