   <p>The Sdružení Ochotníci (Associated Amateur Actors), who give regular performances in the hall of Sokol Havlíček-Tyrš, are wont to furnish new proof of their zeal with every new appearance. Their laudable efforts converge upon one aim, i. e., to provide performances at reasonable prices, and at the same time to give the public an opportunity to aid a deserving, patriotic cause by buying tickets.</p>
   <p>The Amateurs made another step in this direction last night. Unfortunately, it was not appreciated by our fellow citizens as far as attendance is concerned. The audience was small--far below expectations--though a really entertaining piece was on the bill, namely, Nestroy's burlesque, "The Evil Spirit--Lumpacius Vagabundus."</p>
   <p>The proceeds from the evening were destined to go for the Czechoslovak Army.</p>
   
   <p>The slight attendance did not dampen the spirit of the actors. They gave their best, and the result was correspondingly gratifying. The public showed ample evidence of having a good time. The three journeymen--one a carpenter, one a tailor, and one a shoemaker--who were the centers of attention, were played by Mmes. Antonie Červenka, Slăvka Krejčí, and Anna Stočes respectively. The ladies not only acted very well, but ex-temporizing frequently, interpolated jokes in true style, as anyone who knows their former achievements in this field will easily believe.</p>
   <p>They were, however, not the only ones in the foreground. Others in the cast also took full advantage of the manifold traits and tints with which the author colored a number of other characters in the play.</p>
   <p>Mr. Krejčí takes the lion's share for the success of the evening, for his was the directing mind. [Translator's note: There follows a long list of individuals who were responsible for the success of the play.]</p>
