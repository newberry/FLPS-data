   <p>It is a general rule, that the nation which has agricultural lands, manufacturing and commercial enterprises can make claims to a vital existence in the present, and for the future. Without these, though powerful numerically, persistent and tenacious, a nation or perhaps only a part of a nation is, and always will be, a plaything in the whirlpool of a stormy existence. Everyone must arrive at this conclusion after careful consideration. Germans in their snobbishness always boast that they are the civilizers of the Czech people.</p>
   <p>Actually, to this day, mining, smelting, manufacturing and chiefly the wholesale business of Bohemia for the greater part is in the hands of Germans, and Jews claiming to be Germans. This condition applies as well to local Bohemians and their enterprises, in all respects.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Take real-estate as a measure and according to it's value, to figure the justification for existance of local Bohemians, would require the services of an expert and he would need several weeks time, yes indeed, if not months. It is necessary therefore to arrive at some figure through superficial appraisal. It is understood that we must necessarily add to the value of the real estate, the value of the buildings located on it. So that there may be no error in the estimate, it becomes necessary to enter and deduct existing debts against the buildings. If we proceed to an actual superficial appraisal, the probable value of the property belonging to Bohemians, particularly those of Pilsen and California, can be set at approximately three million dollars. If the mortgage indebtedness is equal to a full one-third, then the property of local Bohemians can be appraised at two million dollars.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>This valuation is hardly excessive. The property along the main streets of both quarters is occupied by buildings worth from $10,000 to $30,000 or even $40,000.</p>
   <p>To be sure, local Bohemians may be congratulated for all this development, from practically nothing, in the course of the past twenty-five years. This is evidence of enterprise and perseverance.</p>
   <p>When attention is turned to Bohemian enterprise in industry and business, our countrymen do not remain behind in any respect. They have adjusted themselves to the American method of life; they have adopted American enterprise.</p>
   <p>In the first instance, it is necessary to state that recently a company was organized for the purpose of mining gold in central Mexico.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The company, which is composed of well to do Bohemians, put $300,000 into the enterprise, for the purchase of the necessary drilling and excavating machinery and is working with all it's power to achieve the desired results as quickly as possible. Perhaps they will not be denied this success.</p>
   <p>Several days ago Hlasatel published a report regarding about the organization of an all-Bohemian company for the production of Zinc. This company is now operating and will in a short time open mines in the State of Illinois, not far from Chicago.</p>
   <p>Thus can Bohemian enterprise in mining and smelting be noted, in two instances.</p>
   <p>Among the larger concerns, owned solely by Bohemian shareholders, the Pilsen Lumber Company should be given first place.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>When we consider the manufacturing industry, we should mention four or more factories for the manufacture of doors, frames, windows and shutters. These factories are all operating successfully and the workmen, like the owners, are all Bohemians.</p>
   <p>Much of their prosperity and success is due to the uninterrupted building construction. Orders in most cases being placed with Bohemian firms. This is a praiseworthy standpoint and deserves recognition.</p>
   <p>Stone-cutting is performed in several shops, where building stone is manufactured or prepared. While we are referring to the stone-cutting industry, we should call attention to sculpturing shops, in which, gorgeously beautiful monuments of great artistic value are made. There are two such shops to be found here, one at each cemetary. Both are working busily.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The manufacturing branch of industry is further represented by a shop for the manufacture of cornices and gables for buildings.</p>
   <p>Contemporaneously noted should be a factory for the production of iron girders.</p>
   <p>In addition to the factories mentioned, note should be made of Bohemian factories for the production of sash and mouldings. There are several of these owned by Bohemians and they have been in successful operation for several years. Some of them have passed from the original owners into the possession of joint-companies.</p>
   <p>There is also a factory for the artistic embossing and bending of wood used in decorating buildings and in the manufacture of furniture.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The third brewery had hardly been completed before a company was organized to build a fourth. This time more attention will be given to its construction. It will be more ornate, and more spacious, figuring on a brilliant future.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to do other than praise these enterprises.</p>
   <p>Effervescent soda-water is manufactured in three factories, and the production barely keeps up with the demand. A fourth factory is being built. It is apparent that our country men drink other beverages besides liquor and beer.</p>
   <p>Cigar-makers also belong among the manufacturers, although the shops of Bohemian cigar-makers are not operated on such a large scale. Nevertheless they do manufacture and should be included in the list.</p>
   <p>There are two or three shops in which slippers are manufactured.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>There are many custom tailors who devote themselves exclusively to the manufacture of mens clothing. The same applies to the ladies custom tailors. However they all operate on a small scale and employ only a small, number of people.</p>
   <p>In manufacturing we have quite a satisfactory representation, which will continue to grow, because new enterprises are being founded continually. Confidence in industry is settled.</p>
   <p>To be sure, the capital invested in Bohemian industry is not large. Everything is undertaken on a small scale, but that suffices because every enterprising- judicious- industrialist endeavors to enlarge and develop his business.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Into the artistic branch of industry, it is necessary to place the shops of photographers. There are many of these and they are all kept busily at work.</p>
   <p>Having exhausted the list of industrial enterprises we now proceed to summorize business.</p>
   <p>As in industry, so in business, large individual capital is not represented. However it is possible to list many businesses with considerable capital.</p>
   <p>In the forefront of all business a Bohemian bank is found, around which all financial transactions revolve. Great success has been achieved by the well known Bohemian bank, which was organized a few years ago and since then managed to the satisfaction of it's constantly increasing number of customers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Several smaller financial institutions also exist. However there are no large transactions undertaken by them.</p>
   <p>A large group of real-estate dealers are active and successful. During the last few years this business has proven to be exceptionally lucrative, and many of these dealers have become wealthy in a short period of time.</p>
   <p>Among those businesses enterprises in which larger amounts of money has been invested can be mentioned the woolen-goods establishments. In addition to the smaller houses are several large establishments carrying woolen goods, two of which are in "Pilsen" and one in California.</p>
   <p>Following the woolen-goods business and in certain instances equal to it insofar as invested capital is concerned are the mens clothing houses. Indeed it seems as if one house was endeavoring to surpass the other and so it becomes possible to list several large clothing-houses.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>Next in importance may be placed the millinery shops, to satisfy the capricious tastes of our ladies, even if a new style were introduced every day. Large and small shops and stores are to be found in Pilsen and California in uncounted numbers.</p>
   <p>Thus the outfitting of the ladies as well as the men is well provided for.</p>
   <p>Bohemian business is duly represented in this field and enjoys a progressive and successful development.</p>
   <p>In dealing with big business it is necessary to mention large coal yards. Several companies with considerable capital have been organized in the past to operate coal-yards. Some of these companies are composed of only a few members. There ranks were increased a short time ago by the organization of a stock-company.</p>
   <p>Bakeries must also be added to the list. Several of these are considered as wholesalers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>There are also a large number of furniture stores and wholesale houses. The furniture stores are combined with the stove business and require much larger quarters.</p>
   <p>The uninterupted growth in these lines is indicative of their continued success.</p>
   <p>Several Bohemian musical instrument stores do a good business. This is not surprising because the Bohemian people are known as music lovers and consequently there is a good demand for musical instruments of all kinds.</p>
   <p>A still greater growth is enjoyed by Bohemian jewelry stores, which are especially profitable, many of which do a large business.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>Perhaps some branch of business has been overlooked but not intentionally, for this article is intended to serve all branches of endeavor.</p>
   <p>With special pride the growth of Bohemian drug stores is mentioned.</p>
   <p>No longer is it necessary for anyone to seek aid in a foreign store, because in every neighborhood inhabited by Bohemians, a Bohemian pharmacy exists and Bohemian doctor's are recognized in their field. In their ranks are to be found opticians and surgeons whose skill is taken for granted. Some of them have discovered exceptional curatives.</p>
   <p>Bohemian butchers achieve great success and many of them have amassed considerable wealth in the course of time.</p>
   <p>Less fortunate are the grocers, but their business standing is satisfactory.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>These statements prove that the local Bohemian branch understands stands full well the mission of the nation making actual claims for existence.</p>
   <p>The wealth of the nation is the strongest guarantee of its future. Everybody can not become wealthy but desire, as evidenced by enterprise in business and industry, is a guarantee of good will; and when good will is accompanied by patience then success must be attained.</p>
   <p>Work in this sense is ennobling and elevating.</p>
   <p>Therefore if everyone dedicates himself to a meritorious line of work, with patience and determination, success shoud award his efforts.</p>
