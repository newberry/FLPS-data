   <p>The Ludvikovo Divadlo (Ludvik's Bohemian Dramatic Society of Chicago) enjoyed a rather festive evening yesterday, if one may judge from the applause with which the public rewarded the excellent performance of the actors.....The management presented the popular drama, "Help to the Russians," by Fort. The play had been fully adapted to present conditions, thus making it a timely novelty. No doubt it will fill the house to capacity for many evenings, as long as the present war lasts.....</p>
