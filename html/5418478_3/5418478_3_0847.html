   <p>Now that summer vacations are over, the Pevecky Vzdelavaci Sbor "Karel Bendl" (Karel Bendl Singing and Cultural Society) resumed its regular weekly rehearsals. The first one of these took place on September 27. All future weekly meetings of the Society will be held on Wednesdays at 8 P.M. in the Vojta Naprstek School on Homan Avenue, near West 26th Street.</p>
   <p>We believe that all members, men and women, will greet this piece of news with enthusiasm and will not miss their first rehearsal of the season. Bring your friends with you, so that our society might grow and thus discharge its mission within the Bohemian-American society.</p>
   <p>Every song-loving countryman who wishes to make his or her Wednesdays the days of rest from daily activity, and who likes to amuse himself or herself by singing, is heartily welcome to our midst. You may join the Society any Wednesday <span class="page-break">2</span>at the above-named school.</p>
