   <p>Those who attended the play given last Sunday in the Sokol Karel Jonas of Cicero, Illinois, had no cause to feel disappointed. The dramatic department of the Sokol prepared a really worth-while entertainment by producing Karel Piskor's comedy, "Prozatimni manzelstvi" (Temporary Marriage) The stage was managed by Mr. Smiricky, and the amateur actors proved that they studied and rehearsed their roles well. There was a full measure of good comedy attested to by repeated storms of applause.....The stagecraft, too, was excellent, and the music played between the acts satisfactory. The dramatic department is now studying the French play, "Madam X," which will be given near Christmas.</p>
