   <p>"Španĕlská Muška" (The Blister Beetle), a comedy by F. Arnold and E. Beach, arranged for the Czech scene by J. Nevole, was presented in the auditorium of Sokol Chicago last night. Members of the Chicago Czech Odd Fellows' lodges were the performers, under the direction of Mr. Jos. R. Krejčí.</p>
   <p>The actors made a great hit, although the play itself is not new to our audiences. It is one of the scores of standard comedies that appear on all stages,with commonplace humor dispensed in a multitude of variations, and complications of an old vintage, and with a plot which deals with amorous blunders committed by elderly gentlemen and fathers of families.</p>
