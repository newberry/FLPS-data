   <p>The Dramatic Club "Tyl" enacted in V. Czech's Hall last Sunday with great success "Flieglovo cino-hru Mila" (Fliegl's play "Sweetheart".)</p>
   <p>The actors carried their respective roles through with ability. The play was well attended as it was a benefit performance for our unfortunate countryman, Mr. J. Lisky. The public left the hall very much pleased with the way the play was carried through.</p>
