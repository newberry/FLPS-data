   <p>p.1.-- The Czecho-Slovak-American Hall was filled to capacity last Sunday, Apr. 28, 1907, the day of the exercises given by Sokol Slavsky. The large hall was filled immediately in the afternoon by a very interested audience, which came to watch the performance of physical feats by girls, boys and adult Sokols.</p>
   <p>Many difficult exercises were performed by the more advanced Sokols, while the boys and girls gave their contribution by presenting many drills and exercises on various gymnastic equipment.</p>
   <p>Sokol Slavsky always has a large and interested audience at their gymnastic exercises, but last Sunday, the public was even more eager to witness their exhibition.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This was due to the fact that these very exercises were to be performed by this group of Sokols representing Chicago at the Sokol Meet at Prague, Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>It also proved the wide interest the Bohemian people have in the Sokol organization.</p>
