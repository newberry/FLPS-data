   <p>We have not been disappointed in our expectations, for our women were among the first to begin zealous activities to help make our bazaar a complete success.</p>
   <p>The combined women's aid societies have secured a place for their tent, and we are convinced that they will keep it supplied with beautiful and useful gifts as they always do. We extend our wholehearted thanks to them. Their action proves that they do not mind trifling differences among their organizations, but have joined us to march toward the common goal. Hurrah for the women's tent!</p>
   <p>The TÃ¡bor Supply Company has donated a beautiful little dressing table, valued at twenty dollars. The association of Czech butchers has announced that it will take part in bazaar activities and will work vigorously for its success. We well remember how much their organizations contributed to the <span class="page-break">2</span>success of the bazaar held last year in the Pilsen Brewery Park pavilion.</p>
