   <p>We are informed that Mr. Joseph Vilim, a noted Bohemian musician, concert-master and composer, has been appointed by the Chicago University as conductor of the University Orchestra. It is a new proof that the Bohemian music and the Bohemian musicians are always acknowledged today in spheres where the demands and the criticism are unusually severe.</p>
   <p>There are many countrymen among the members of the orchestra. In his new position as an orchestra conductor, Mr. Vilim will be able to acquaint the university students and the best of the English-American public coming in contact with the students, with the jewels of Bohemian music.</p>
   <p>As far as we know Mr. Vilim, we are sure he will use this opportunity successfully.</p>
