   <p>The fourth and last concert of chamber music of this season, a series, so happily instigated by the Spolek Pro Povzneseni Komorni Hudby (Society for the Promotion of Chamber Music), took place in Stile's Hall, Millard Avenue and 22nd Street, yesterday afternoon. The principal composition on the program was the "Piano Quintet in E Flat Major" by Schumann.....Another outstanding selection was the "Concerto for Flute in D Major" by Blodek.....</p>
   <p>A most interesting innovation was the exotic grouping of instruments selected for Rossini's Overture to "William Tell". It consisted of a full quintet, [sic] a flute, five violoncellos, and a piano duet.....The program could not have been ended more suitably than by this beautiful composition.....</p>
   <p>...The attendance was very satisfactory and the audience was highly pleased <span class="page-break">2</span>with the performance. It seems rather a pity that the Spolek has found it impossible to add a few concerts to this really successful series of four. But we left the hall trusting that such fine concerts as we have had this season will become a regular feature of our musical life.....</p>
