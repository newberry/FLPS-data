   <p>Gentlemen: Today, we are holding our annual meeting and it is our duty to present to you a brief report on all the work accomplished in the course of this year. I have prepared this report and I am presenting it to you for your consideration. In accomplishing this task I have been compelled to divide it into several sections.</p>
   <p>Administrative Work</p>
   <p>At the beginning of this year, there were 108 building and loan associations listed as members of this League. During the year the following associations applied for membership and joined the League: The Telegraphers' Building and Loan Association, the Austin Building and Loan Association, the Komenský building and Loan Association, the Allport Building and Loan Association, and <span class="page-break">2</span>the Columbian Building and Loan Association; altogether five associations. The following associations withdrew: The Daisy Building and Loan Association, the Vlastenec Building and Loan Association, the Cesko-Delnicky Building and Loan Association, and the Golden Security Building and Loan Association; altogether four associations. Today, there are 109 building and loan associations united in the Bohemian League. It is worth while remarking that there are about twenty-five Bohemian building and loan associations which are not members of our League. The organization committee, appointed last year, either did not execute its duties properly or circumstances made it impossible for the committee to develop its activities to such a degree that the desired result could be achieved. Be that as it may, there are still twenty-five building and loan associations which are not members of our League and yet profit from our work.</p>
   <p>That this League is a useful organization has been proved many times. Even the Alliance of Building and Loan Associations of Illinois points to the Ceske Sdruzeni Vypomocnych Spolku v Chicagu as an example, and is urging other <span class="page-break">3</span>nationalities to establish similar leagues in their districts. The state auditor will sanction every new league and also urges every building and loan association to become a member of the State Alliance, because it is a wellknown fact that the more powerful the organization is the more effective will be its work for the benefit of building and loan associations.</p>
   <p>State Legislative Work</p>
   <p>Painstaking attention was given to the activity of the constitutional convention, at the time it was in session, so that nothing might find its way into our constitution which would be harmful, not only to building and loan associations, but also to the general public. The State Legislature will convene in the first part of January of next year, and it is expected that many bills approved by the constitutional convention will be recommended for adoption. Therefore, all our efforts must be concentrated in this direction; we shall examine every bill and be on guard against those which would be harmful to us. It is possible, especially, that an income tax and a new tax system may <span class="page-break">4</span>be introduced. Therefore, as citizens and taxpayers we must be on guard. Inasmuch as initiative and referendum are to be introduced in our state, we shall be able to offer resistance and defeat any harmful bill.</p>
   <p>National Legislative Work</p>
   <p>No bills harmful to us were introduced in the Congress of the United States this year; on the contrary, a bill authorizing the establishment of the so-called Federal Home Building Association was introduced. These federal associations, established in various districts of the United States, would act as a sort of clearing house for building and loan associations. I have reported on this subject several times already and, therefore, I shall not write about this matter at length.</p>
   <p>Just recently, the Collector of Internal Revenue has been sending out questionnaires to every association and organization of any kind with the request that they be filled out. Building and loan associations in the United States are <span class="page-break">5</span>lawfully exempt from paying the income tax, but inasmuch as the Collector of Internal Revenue does not know which association or organization is a building and loan association and which is not, the questionnaires are sent to everyone in order to ascertain which associations or organizations are subject to the income tax. I immediately got in touch with the secretary of the State Alliance and both of us agreed that something should be done about this matter. We decided that an affidavit answering the purpose of every association should be prepared and sent to the Collector for his approval. This has been accomplished and the affidavit was approved. The secretary is now sending a copy of it to every association which is a member of the State Alliance and to members of our League. As soon as the affidavit is received it should be filled out, sworn to before a notary public and sent to the Collector of Internal Revenue. Nothing else has to be done. This gives you an idea of the effectiveness of the work of such organizations as the State Alliance, the National League, and this League in similar cases.</p>
   <p>General Work</p>
   <p>At the beginning of this year, a series of lectures was arranged by this <span class="page-break">6</span>League for the benefit of officers of building and loan associations. Messrs. Janda, Churan, Brabec, Mancl and Mr. Hildreth of Freeport, Illinois, gave lectures upon subjects which are necessary for us to know. These lectures were also published in our organ, and I am sure that much has been accomplished to our benefit and that the officers, especially the secretaries, have learned a great deal. It would be a good thing if these lectures were published as a book in order that they might be preserved for the future. The American Building Association News reported favorably on these lectures, and called them unique examples of this type of lecture in the United States. The Bohemian building and loan associations can easily stand the cost of the publication, because these corporations have over sixteen million dollars in resources, and such a small expenditure would surely bring a good result in drives for new members, and could also be used as a wonderful means of agitation in the future.</p>
   <p>Salaries of Officers</p>
   <p>This matter probably will be discussed in today's meeting. Some time ago <span class="page-break">7</span>a committee was appointed to work out a table of salaries of secretaries and other officers, by which building and loan associations could guide themselves in the future. Inasmuch as I do not know whether the committee met or accomplished anything, I myself have tried to work out a table of salaries which I hereby present. The table stipulates the salaries of secretaries, presidents, treasurers and members of various committees. For the salary of a secretary I have used four tenths of one per cent of the total resources as a basis. For the salary of an assistant secretary or member of a committee I have used one half of one tenth of one per cent of the total weekly deposits as a basis. For the salary of a treasurer I have used one tenth of one per cent of the total weekly deposits as a guide; for the salary of a president, member of an auditing committee or of an appraisal committee I have stipulated amounts according to my own judgment. It is to be noted that all the salaries combined would not exceed one half of one per cent of the total expenditure, which surely is thrifty and also just. Form your own opinion and discuss this matter. It would be worth while because it has been one of those burning <span class="page-break">8</span>questions which thus far have not been justly solved. I also must point out that building and loan associations of other nationalities use similar forms when salaries of officers are stipulated; only the percentage used by them as a basis is much higher than mine.</p>
   <p>Unification of Associations</p>
   <p>This matter has already been discussed in one of our meetings, but the decision was postponed until proper information was received. Mr. Čálek brought this matter up in the past meeting of the State League. He asked the person representing the state auditor, who was present, for his opinion. This representative expressed the belief that unification could easily be accomplished and that no special formalities are required, excepting the ratification by members of this or that association. All that is necessary to be done is to place the incoming members in those series which show approximately the same value and either pay up the difference of one, two, or three weeks, or suspend payment for a like period, in order to equalize the values of the <span class="page-break">9</span>series; thus the unification is accomplished. The association could then take over the cash, securities and other property and carry on.</p>
   <p>Own Your Home Exposition</p>
   <p>In Chicago at the Coliseum, on March 26, 1921, an exposition for the purpose of encouraging home building, will be opened to the public. Many models of new homes, plans, building material and modern home equipment, etc., will be exhibited. At this exposition the building and loan associations will have their own booth where various circulars and pamphlets will be distributed in order to inform the public about the significance of building and loan associations. Here a wonderful opportunity is given to us to call the attention of American people to Bohemian building and loan associations. The Bohemian building and loan associations can furnish their pamphlets and reports, in fact everything leading to the advertisement of building and loan associations. It is expected that thousands and thousands of people will visit this exposition and we will have a wonderful opportunity to advertise our Bohemian building and loan associations which are known as the most properous building and <span class="page-break">10</span>loan associations in Chicago. The necessary expense in connection with this project will be covered by voluntary contributions from our associations. After you receive such a request for contributions, appropriate a suitable amount and then exhibit anything which in your opinion is suitable.</p>
   <p>Public Press</p>
   <p>I would recommend now as I have in the past that our gratitude be extended to our four Bohemian newspapers, the Denní Hlasatel, Národ, Svornost, and Spravedlnost, for their kind publication of all reports dealing with our building and loan associations. These newspapers always did publish all press releases submitted to them. Therefore I urge you always to reward these newspapers whenever any kind of advertisement is needed.</p>
   <p>In Memoriam</p>
   <p>In the course of this year two members in good standing, Mr. Joseph Babka <span class="page-break">11</span>and Mr. Joseph Svojse, passed away forever from our circle. Both of these men were conscientious representatives of this organization, and they always worked willingly for the general welfare. All honor to their memory!</p>
   <p>I have now said everything which you should know and which would be worthy of your attention.</p>
   <p>Wishing you great success, I remain.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Josef L. Voborsky, secretary.</p>
