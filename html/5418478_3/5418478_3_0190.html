   <p>The annual convention of the League of Building and Loan Associations of the State of Illinois was held in Springfield, October 23 and 24.....</p>
   <p>The Bohemian building and loan associations sent twenty-three delegates [their names and the associations they represented are listed in the article], including Mr. Jos. L. Voborský of the Výpomocný Spolek Bořivoj (Bořivoj Building and Loan Association), who had been requested by the officers of the League to present a speech at the convention on whatever topic would be interesting, informative, and beneficial to the delegates. He selected the subject, "Bohemian Building and Loan Associations and Their Influence on Home Building". His first aim was to acquaint the non-Bohemian delegates with some of the statistical data concerning Bohemian building and loan <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>associations in Chicago, and to give them a true picture of the thrift of the good Bohemian people. In this, according to the audience, he succeeded. A full translation of the pertinent parts of his speech follows:</p>
   <p>"The origin of Bohemian building and loan associations dates back to the seventies when our countrymen started settling in Chicago in large numbers. The first settlers organized an association to which its members paid certain dues, and the money thus collected was loaned out for home building. This association, however, was short-lived, disbanding in 1871 after the great Chicago Fire. For several years thereafter, the Bohemians had no building and loan association of their own; but in 1880 two or three of them were organized, and since these prospered, other organizations followed, so that there are 104 of them in Chicago now. This means that the Bohemians have a greater number of building and loan associations than any other national group in the city. Also, the total membership in these associations is greater than that of any other group. All these associations are in an excellent condition at the present time, doing profitable business.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"As a rule, the Bohemians are very thrifty. The principal purpose of their saving is to build a home and lay a foundation for a better future for themselves and their children, to whom they endeavor to give a good education. In all this, most of them succeed. Many of our countrymen are well-to-do, have a good social position, and it may be justly claimed that the credit for their success is due only to their building and loan associations. The characteristic features of the present older generation are being inherited by the younger one. The children follow in the footsteps of their parents, and this applies also to the appreciation of the building and loan associations.</p>
   <p>"Bohemian building and loan associations have always been and are now a great factor in home building and in the promotion of family life. A Bohemian man first strives to own a home, then to beautify it, then to build another home which can be leased, thus adding to the family prosperity. Almost without exception, he starts on this road to success by turning to a Bohemian building and loan association. He is careful to pay all installments regularly until the loan is paid.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"Our building and loan associations not only help in building the future of their members, but they also help in building and beautifying the entire great City of Chicago. Large districts, both residential and business, were built with money advanced by building and loan associations. Those of you who attended last year's convention and were entertained by Bohemian building and loan associations had an excellent opportunity to see those beautiful residences, those prosperous business establishments that fill Chicago's Bohemian districts. They would not be there if it were not for our building and loan associations. I can tell you that four out of every five owners of such property have been or are members of one or another Bohemian building and loan association, and they would be proud to say so, should you ask them. They would add that they probably could not have arrived at their present degree of prosperity were it not for their membership in one of the building and loan associations.</p>
   <p>"The Bohemian building and loan associations also deserve considerable credit for their work in another line of endeavor. They urge their members, <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>especially those who have recently come to this country, to perform all their duties of citizenship, to take out naturalization papers, to take an interest in public affairs, and to pay attention to the quality of men whom they select for public offices.</p>
   <p>"As to the methods of conducting business, you no doubt know that the Bohemian building and loan associations are based on a serial plan, that the series start every three months, and that shares can be subscribed for every three months. As a rule, there are three ways of paying for shares. In class one, the payment is 25 cents a week; in class two 12 1/2 cents a week; in class three, a payment of a lump sum of $70. is made.</p>
   <p>"Our method of collecting the dues was thoroughly discussed before this audience some years ago, and I shall not go into this matter again. Bohemian building and loan associations, on the average, earn 7 per cent, so that a $100 share which is being paid for at 25 cents a week is paid up in 6 1/4 years; one which is paid for at the rate of 12 1/2 cents matures in 11 1/4 <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>years; and one for which $70 was paid matures in 6 1/4 years.</p>
   <p>"To some of you it may seem strange that Bohemian building and loan associations should have such large earnings. One reason is that no Bohemian building and loan association pays rent. All of them hold their meetings on the premises of some restaurant or café, in a room completely separated from the café proper, and for the use of this, there is absolutely no charge. Some of you may deem this arrangement impractical. That is not the case. In fact, in some instances, the holding of meetings on premises of that kind is responsible for the rapid growth of an association, and the idea that it would induce the members to greater spending is erroneous.</p>
   <p>"In order to make the payment of dues more convenient to their members, some of the larger Bohemian building and loan associations maintain branches in various parts of the city. The dues are being collected regularly by some of the officers and turned over to the main place of business the day after they are collected. This method proves to be very effective, and its convenience seems to be attracting new members who may not feel like joining under different circumstances.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>"Another reason for these large earnings is the very low running expenses of our associations. Some of them pay extremely small wages to their officers. In many cases the secretary receives around $5 a week, the largest associations paying not more than $20. Other officers, such as assistant secretaries or directors, receive from 15 cents to $1 for each meeting. Our directors work for the love of a good cause by which they, too, are benefited, and they feel happy to have the confidence of the membership.</p>
   <p>"Since their beginning, Bohemian building and loan associations have paid out to their members in the neighborhood of $20,000,000. The cumulative assets of all Bohemian building and loan associations are about $13,000,000, and the real estate mortgaged as collateral for loans is valued at $40,000,000. Their membership is estimated at 25,000, but in all probability it is larger.</p>
   <p>"The assets of individual Bohemian building and loan associations differ considerably. For example, the Borivoj Building and Loan Association, which I have the honor of representing at this convention, has, according to the <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>latest report of the treasurer, assets over $618,000; many associations have from $100,000 to $400,000. Most of them charge 6 per cent interest, and the League of Bohemian Building and Loan Associations is endeavoring to have this rate accepted as standard for all its members. No associations charge either premiums or commissions.</p>
   <p>"The antagonism prevailing in some parts of the city among non-Bohemian banks and building and loan associations does not exist among the Bohemians. Chicago Bohemians have four state banks and one national bank, all of which cooperate closely with the associations. The officers of these banks are, in many cases, also officers of the associations, and all associations deposit their money in these banks.</p>
   <p>"In closing, permit me to thank you...."</p>
   <p>Mr. Adolf Macal, secretary of the League of Bohemian Building and Loan <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>Associations, submitted a report, of which the following may be of general interest: The League was founded in December, 1907, and it has eighty-five members at the present time. Its officers are: Rudolf Mulac, president; John L. Novák, vice-president; Adolf Macal, secretary; Frank G. Hájíček, treasurer. Its executive committee consists of Anton Vanĕk, Frank J. Mencl, Konrád Ricker, Joseph C. Pisha, and Frank Hrubý.</p>
   <p>The League submitted a memorandum consisting of seven proposals for the consideration of the convention, all pertaining to the organization and administration of building and loan associations, with particular regard to the size of the community. The memorandum was accepted by the convention, and the various proposals were referred to the respective committees for study and recommendation.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The remainder of the article is devoted to the general business of the convention, the description of the Bohemian delegation's sight-seeing tour through Springfield, and its return to Chicago.]</p>
