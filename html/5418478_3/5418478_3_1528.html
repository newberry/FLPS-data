   <p>The Bohemian colony in Town of Lake has proved beyond doubt its maturity and selflessness. The collection undertaken there upon the initiative of the Ceskonarodni Sokol Pokrok (Bohemian National Sokol unit Pokrok [Progress]), which organization itself donated $300, may well serve as an example to the more prosperous of our colonies, particularly the one in Bohemian California, and the business section of the Pilsen district.</p>
   <p>The following is a list of contributions for which we offer public thanks to kind donors and to the workers, to whom is due a great deal of credit for the success of the collection and the bazaar.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: A paragraph, giving the names of twelve women and six men who conducted the solicitation, is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The initiative for the collection came from the Sokol Pokrok, which itself <span class="page-break">2</span>donated $300. [Translator's note: A full column of names and donations ranging from $100, $50, $25, etc., down to 10 cents, is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Gifts for the bazaar: [Translator's note: A column six inches long, giving names of persons who donated various objects to be sold at the bazaar, such as a violin, nut-cracker set, ham, cigars, table cover, a suit, painted dish, knitted bed cover, charged water, wood, carpenter work, etc., is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The gross proceeds of the bazaar amounted to $355.47, which, after the expenses of $89.88 had been deducted, netted $265.59. The collection itself brought $1,385.77. Handed over to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance): $1,651.36.</p>
