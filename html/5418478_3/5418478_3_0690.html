   <p>The very popular play, "Bordynkari" (Borders), written by Skaloud, and portraying the life of Chicago Bohemians, was produced for the eighteenth time, and the reason for its continued popularity is manifest. The hall of the Ludvikovo Divadlo hired from the Sokol Chicago was filled to capacity on this occasion. As we had countless opportunities to mention the excellence of this production, we shall only add that Mr. Horlivy's stage managing was faultless and that the audience voiced its approval both by laughter and by applause. Mrs. Ludvik appeared again in the main role of the landlady. The role of "Kasparek" was this time played by Mr. Suva and all the other members of the Ludvikovo Divadlo were in demand.....</p>
