   <p>"Why shouldn't we rejoice"--the chorus in the "Bartered Bride" occurs to us--yes, how much would we rejoice if only we could hear the opera, the gem of Smetana's works, in Chicago! We expected to hear Emmy Destinn in the role of "Marenka," our own Destinn, the famous artist, admired throughout the musical world, the loyal Bohemian! And now we learn that the performance of the opera in Chicago is not only not assured but very uncertain indeed. A source close to the management informs us that the "Bartered Bride" is not included in the repertoire scheduled for Chicago; strange news indeed when one thinks of the laurels which Destinn has won and the praise showered upon Bohemian art on the occasion of the recent performance of Smetana's masterpiece in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York! The sad tidings of the absence of the opera from the proposed program had the effect of a chilly blast upon every Bohemian of our community. Be it understood that we have employed every means, pulled every wire, to see the opera given here. We wrote to Mr. Dippel, the director, picturing the disappointment and the wounded feelings of the Chicago Bohemians <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>who have been awaiting that performance for a long time. We even offered to guarantee to Mr. Dippel a whole series of sold-out houses, convinced that there will not be one among the 120,000 Bohemians settled in Chicago who would not grasp the opportunity to hear this opera, especially with an artist of Destinn's renown.</p>
   <p>It is incumbent upon us to bring such pressure upon the management as to overcome its resistance. Let us swamp Mr. Dippel with a flood of letters, personal and collective, to achieve our end. Shall we be deprived of this delight? We cannot allow this to happen; if it does, we shall be humiliated and at the same time suffer an irreparable loss.</p>
   <p>Let us therefore begin all over again--and step a little lively! Let us all pull together with all our might. Not once but ten times and always shall the house be thronged with Bohemians. From this day on let our slogan be:</p>
   <p>"The 'Bartered Bride' must be performed in Chicago!"</p>
