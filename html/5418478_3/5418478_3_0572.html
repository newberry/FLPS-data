   <p>The singing societies are, of all our national societies, probably the foremost defenders and upholders of our nationalism in this strange land. Their only purpose and function is the maintenance of the Bohemian Song in its original form so dear to the Bohemian soul, so sweet and cheerful in jolly or troubled times. Their fruits have access to the hearts of all. They are for young and old, for rich and poor, entertaining and encouraging. It is admitted that the singing societies in America are great benefactors to our nationalism, their efforts should be supported by all in the larger communities.</p>
   <p>We have a Bohemian singing club in practically every large city such as New York, Cleveland, Milwaukee, St. Louis and Chicago and everyone of them is to be heard one or more times each year. It is joyful and praiseworthy. We should be more than pleased with the awakening of Bohemian singing in Chicago of late, of such great activity among the lodges that it is impossible to even compare the feeble efforts of the past few years.</p>

   <p>The greatest credit for this awakening is due to the choirmaster, Mr. Jan Geringer, who devotes two evenings each week to teaching of singing, free of charge. He is not only capable but ardently active in the teaching and is the director of the singing club "Lyre."</p>
