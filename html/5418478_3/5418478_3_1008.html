   <p>A musical recital was given last night in the Pilsen Sokol hall by the pupils of Miss Marie Bartos' School of Music. Although the success was not so great materially, it was eclipsed by the moral success. The concert was distinguished by a remarkable program, which provided enjoyment even for musical artists. The performance of all numbers was remarkable.</p>
   <p>Among the pupils who took part in the concert were: Misses Agnes Sach, Annie Kudrna, Elsie Baumayer, Rose Kudrna, Boh. Peitsch, and Emily Fitzak. The success which the pupils of Miss Bartos achieved, will serve her in the future as the best recommendation.</p>
