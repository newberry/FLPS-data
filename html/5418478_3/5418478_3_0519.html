   <p>p. 1, col. 1 - Among our Bohemian American musicians Mr. Bohumil Kryl met with the American public. Being the world's best known cornetist, he is deserving of his renown. Mr. Kryl directed his band of 50 musicians at the opening of Forest Park. It is expected that a great number of Mr. Kryl's friends will pay their respects to him by coming out to see and hear him and his band. Mr. Kryl's engagement at Forest Park will be a short one, therefore we urge those who can come not to miss these musical treats.</p>
   <p>Forest Park can be reached by way of the west side metropolitan elevated railway or by west bound street cars at a five cent fare.</p>
