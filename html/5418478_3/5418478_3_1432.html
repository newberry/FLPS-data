   <p>Czech grocerymen announce that they intend to open a tent at the bazaar which will be held under the auspices of the Czech National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics. The grocers have already named a committee which has begun the preliminary work. We appreciate their patriotic endeavor and are convinced that none of the Czech people in Chicago will lag in their support. We remember how much they contributed to the splendid success of the first bazaar, and their resolute decision should serve as an example to all other organizations.</p>
   <p>The first contribution for the bazaar was a gift of $20 from the well-known Czech-American artist, A. Petrtyl, who also designed the poster for the bazaar. This poster, which will soon be printed and distributed, shows two young Czechoslovak soldiers who have fought their way to "Mother Bohemia" where they broke the shackles that had chained her to wretched Austria <span class="page-break">2</span>since 1620. The picture symbolizes the significance of our Czechoslovak Army, and by its artistic execution assures for itself a place of honor in the gallery of Czech-American art. We acknowledge with gratitude the remarkable gift from our artist, hoping that others will soon follow the example of this patriotic deed.</p>
   <p>The plenary meeting of representatives of various organizations that will participate in the bazaar will be held in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, March 4, at 8 P. M. It is imperative that all delegates of the organizations that are to participate in the bazaar make their appearance.</p>
   <p>The headquarters of the bazaar of the Czech National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics requests all those who are willing to do their part in contributing to the success of the bazaar to report at the offices, 3242 West 26th Street. Assistance is needed at present <span class="page-break">3</span>in addressing letters which must be mailed as soon as possible.</p>
