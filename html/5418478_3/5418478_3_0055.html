The speakers, far from wishing <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to flatter him, simply mentioned this fact and, to show appreciation for his efforts, some visible token of it was needed. The board of directors, acting in accordance with the above, presented the aged gentleman with a platinum watch chain and pen knife. Mr. Kaspar, who may be considered one of the youngest and most active workers in the bank, was visibly touched, and thanked the board for its gift. The meeting ended in very good humor and with the knowledge that this Bohemian enterprise will continue to grow, thanks to the support given it by the Czechoslovak people in particular......</p>
