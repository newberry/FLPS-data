   <p>Male and female members of the Club Zobak (Beak) gave a performance last night in which they were supported by some of the best actors from the "Czech California" district. The entertainment was given for the benefit of the Sokol Chicago building, where the event took place.</p>
   <p>"Deti Vltavy" (Children of the Moldau), a picture of Czech life by Joseph Svab, popular humorist, and Jos. Wanderer, well-known cabaret singer, both of Prague, Bohemia, was on the program.</p>
   <p>The acting was not extraordinary, and so it is understandable that the "Children of the Moldau" showed certain defects. Nevertheless, the piece has sound humor as well as scenes which touch the more tender side of emotional life.....Among the players there were several who are well-known from the stage, such as Mr. Rausar, Mr. Placek, Mrs. Frydl, Mrs. Slavka Svoboda, and Mr. and Mrs. Suva.</p>
