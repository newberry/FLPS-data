   <p>Six successful plays were given by the Bohemians yesterday. In the Sokol Hall was produced a very difficult play, "Rewisor" (The Comptroller), played to the complete enjoyment of the audience. The dramatic society Kolar (Cyclist) played "Svedove Na Morave" (The Swedes in Moravia), with great success. Those that played the major roles were without reproach. In the hall of the Bohemian-American Sokol was played the drama "Katovo Posledni Dilo" (Hangman's Last Deed). The citizens on the West Side had a wonderful entertainment arranged by the All-Bohemian Youth. We expressed here our opinion generally, a more detailed explanation would demand too much space.</p>
