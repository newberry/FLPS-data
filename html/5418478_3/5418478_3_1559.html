   <p>Throughout the week, the members and friends of Sokol Havlíček-Tyrš will have one thought in mind: How to work for the success of the great exhibition put on by the Sokol in its building on Lawndale Avenue.....</p>
   <p>The exhibition is open every night from seven o'clock and will end Saturday, December 7, with a magnificent ball. During the exhibition, a most entertaining program of music, songs, and humorous selections is being presented to the visitors. Many valuable objects, suitable for Christmas gifts, are offered for sale there.</p>
   <p>Admission is free, with the exception of Saturday night, when twenty-five cents is being charged for a single visitor and fifty cents for a couple.</p>
