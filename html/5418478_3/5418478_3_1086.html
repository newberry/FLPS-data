   <p>The customary annual theatrical performance of the alliance of the Bohemian lodges of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, held last Sunday at the Sokol Chicago Hall, was successful in every respect. A large audience watched the performance and was kept in an enthusiastic and humorous mood by members of the Three Link Dramatic Society, who, in Stolba's comedy "Ach ta laska!" (Oh, That Love!), presented their first large-scale performance in the Bohemian language. Mrs. Holzinger, who rehearsed and directed this charming comedy, induced all those who participated to follow the example of the American stage and play without a prompter, which is interesting news to the Bohemian stage.....</p>
   <p>The absence of a prompter in no way affected the production, and considering the fact that all those who participated are either American-born or have been in this country since childhood, the performance was very remarkable.</p>
   
   <p>This fact should be acknowledged by our people by continued support of the Bohemian performances of the Three Links Dramatic Society in future.</p>
