   <p>Recently we published a report regarding the contest of the Slavonic singing societies, in which the Cesko-Americky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian-American Workingmen's Singing Society) won the first prize. The second prize was awarded to the Serbian Singing Society, and the third prize was given to the Spojeny Slovansky Sokol Spevokol (United Slavonic Sokol Singing Circle).</p>
   <p>This latter made the statement that it did not expect the prize, and that all credit for this success was due to their very active teacher, Rudolph Bubenicek, who lifted them to their present height of accomplishment in a very short time.</p>
