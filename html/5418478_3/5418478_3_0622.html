   <p>Skolni Rada (The School Board), as we previously said, had allowed $4,500 for the decorative work on the auditorium and vestibule of the Harrison Technical High School which, as is well known, is attended mostly by pupils of Bohemian descent.</p>
   <p>For that reason we would have been very happy if the work had been allotted to one of our Bohemian artists, so that it could have always remained as a remembrance of Bohemian art, and a lasting proof of the contention that this branch of Bohemians cannot and must not be considered inferior to any other nation living in America, not even excluding the Americans.</p>
   <p>This work for the Harrison Technical High School should have remained more <span class="page-break">\2</span>than an eloquent proof of the maturity of the Bohemians in the United States, it was to denote the maturity of the Bohemian people in the United States, and it was also to show the intellectual and artistic ripening taking place in music and art, to which we had called attention many times.</p>
   <p>Since Mr. Farsky did not work alone on his work of art, he did not receive the assignment for the work, but his design will be used in another part of the school building.</p>
