   <p>The Bohemian theater under the direction of Mr. Fr. Ludvik has existed among us for the past ten years, and the merits it has gained are appreciated by all our countrymen. Therefore it is expected that the jubilee celebration, which will be held tomorrow night in Thalia Hall, will have a large attendance, giving undeniable proof of recognition of this whole theatrical association.</p>
   <p>At tomorrow's jubilee performance memorial souvenirs will be distributed, which are provided with beautiful photographs.</p>
