   <p>The Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies) held its convention Saturday night at the Bobisud Hall on Kedzie Avenue, next door to Sokol Chicago. This convention of our central and most important organization of Bohemian singing societies in America was opened at 9 P. M. by its president, Mr. Antonin Vanek. He welcomed all delegates and press representatives, requesting the latter to give the convention all the publicity it deserves, bearing in mind that the purpose of the convention is not only the transaction of business, but also the promotion of acquaintance and friendship between individual societies and their members.....</p>
   <p>At the convention the following societies were represented by their delegates: Lyra; Damsky Odbor Peveckeho Sboru Karel Marx (Ladies' Association of the Singing Society Karel Marx); Karel Bendl; Pevecky Odbor Vzdelavaciho Sboru Stvrti <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Wardy (Singing Society of the Fourth Ward Educational Association); Pevecky Odbor Sokola Chicago Dalibor (Singing Society of Sokol Chicago, Dalibor); Karel Marx; Cesko-Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian-American Workingmen's Singing Society); and Lumir. Each society was represented by three to five delegates.....</p>
   <p>After the presentation of credentials, the convention elected Antonin Vanek as its chairman, and Dr. Leopold Wedeles secretary,....who read the Jednota's detailed report for the past year, of which we are publishing only the more important parts. The Jednota held regular monthly meetings, in addition to two special meetings. It sent a cable to the Pevecky Sbor Prazskych Ucitelu (Prague Teachers' Singing Society), congratulating them on their victory in the International Singing Contest held in Paris. The Jednota gave a concert in the Coliseum, the net profit of which, although rather large, was presented to the Jednota by the participating societies.....Two members of the Jednota were charged with the duty of raising funds for the upkeep of a model <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>chorus. The Jednota received a protest from the Damsky Odbor Peveckeho Sboru Lyra (Ladies' Association of the Singing Society Lyra) against the proposal to send only men to the convention of Slavonic singing societies which will be held in 1915 in Prague. Mr. K. Kratochvil proposed to send both men and women singers who would perform an opera, or at least some parts of an opera. The committee on arrangements purchased music from Bohemia for 140 crowns.....</p>
   <p>According to the report of the treasurer, Mr. Ficek, the Jednota's income for the year was $804.82; expenses, $494.01; balance in the treasury, $310.81.....</p>
   <p>The Jednota's archivist, Mr. Kratochvil, reported that there is music now available upon request for any member society for 134 choruses, of which 45 are mixed choruses, 32 for women's voices, and 57 for men's voices.....</p>
   <p>The report of the committee on arrangements disclosed the regrettable fact that so far all attempts to form a model chorus have met with failure.....The committee had raised forty dollars for the purchase of new music and had decided <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to acquire all newly published choral music which has appeared since January 1, 1913, and will appear in the future.</p>
   <p>The incoming correspondence was read, most of it consisting of letters of greetings. The Cesko-Delnicky Pevecky Sbor calls attention to the singing school which it is conducting, not in order to receive material support, but to ask the Jednota to stir up the interest of the general public, because up to this time the running of the school has required financial sacrifices on the part of the Sbor.</p>
   <p>For the coming year, the following men were unanimously elected: Mr. S. Vanek, president; Dr. Leopold Wedeles, vice-president; Mr. Jaroslav Kosar, secretary; Mr. J. Krupar, treasurer; Mr. K. Kratochvil, archivist. All these form the executive committee which has the right to appoint other committees that may be necessary or desirable.....</p>
   <p>The convention committee presented its report together with the following three important proposals: The appointment of a competent, strict and <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>impartial critic; the selection of a correspondent to one of the musical journals appearing in Prague; the solution of the question of capable conductors.</p>
   <p>The first proposal provoked a lively and interesting discussion, during which the complaint was heard that our newspapers in their reports summarily praise every recital, no matter how poor it may be. This custom is detrimental to the principal interests of the Jednota, and such reports are more than worthless. A report, in order to be of some value, should point out impartially both the good and poor features of the performance. Only such criticism can be considered helpful and can result in general progress and improvement in the quality of our singing.....The matter was referred to the executive committee which will get in touch with our newspapers and try to bring about the desired change. The second proposal was also referred to the executive committee, while the third was considered a problem to be taken care of individually by the societies themselves.</p>
   <p>Mr. R. J. Psenka then suggested that the Jednota participate in the Olympic <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Games which will take place in Chicago in the near future. It was decided to approach Mr. McCormick in this matter. Mr. Kosar suggested that the Jednota accompany the expedition to the 1915 Sokolsky Slet (Sokol Festival) in Prague. A substantial number of members would travel with the expedition at least to Cleveland, and possibly to New York, giving recitals in these cities. Both suggestions were referred to the executive committee and the committee on arrangements for study and action.....</p>
