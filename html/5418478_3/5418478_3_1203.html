   <p>The Ludvik Theatrical Association opened its fifteenth season by Jos. Stolba's "Jeji System" (Her System) last Sunday. The Bohemin audience assembled in Thalia Hall showed that it intends to support future performances, that it has retained its predilection for dramtic art, which, especially in our new homeland, should be a school for us Czechs and a place of sociable recreation and intellectual delight. Diverse human traits are represented upon the stage,the good ones and the bad; it may, therefore, be called "The Theatre of the World."</p>
   <p>Every lover of the art eagerly anticipates the opportunity to visit the theatre. Not only may he enjoy a laugh if the performance is good but he will always carry away a bit of instruction, while the gestures and words of the actor may linger in his memory for his lifetime. The theatre is a necessary item in human life, and for some a downright indispensable one. The public fills the house, and then it is up to the actor to prove his value.</p>

   <p>The good actor, the artist, reigns over the audience. Our Theatrical Association has been active among us Czechs for fourteen years a long span of time. The public manifested its esteem for the actors, and many of those who support them today have been, during the fourteen years, educated by them.</p>
   <p>For the fifteenth time the Association assures the Bohemin public of its earnest intention to keep the Czech Muse of the drama upon a pedestal, the highest possible.</p>
   <p>The public and the actors will take this proclamation to their hearts, and we hope the Bohemin people of Chicago will give the efforts of the actors their enthusiastic support.</p>
   <p>The play, "Her System" chosen for the opening, was written by Stolba in the year of 1905, and represents one of his most recent works.</p>
   <p>Stolba is known to theatrical circles as a dramatist of remarkable genuineness and individuality.</p>

   <p>The study of his characters means a hard nut to crack for every actor; his figures are full of healthy humor; we meet them all in his "Her System." But there is no caricature in the plays; an actor given to exaggeration and extemporizing is amiss.</p>
