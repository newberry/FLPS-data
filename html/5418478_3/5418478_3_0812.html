   <p>Up until this theatrical season, the idea was prevalent that under the present conditions, an operetta was impossible to present on our Bohemian stage. This year, however, we were convinced that with a strong will, even the greatest obstacles can be overcome.</p>
   <p>Prior to this, our singing societies occasionally produced an operetta, but our theatrical organizations did extremely little in this respect. Many years ago, the Ludvíkovo Divadlo (František Ludvík's Bohemian Dramatic Society) successfully produced the "Bartered Bride". But very little has been done since.</p>
   <p>This year, an unexpected change has come, and within a short time, we have seen several operettas, a fact which proves that even an operetta can be put <span class="page-break">\2</span>on the repertoire of our theaters from time to time, and that our companies can be relied upon to produce it without discredit.</p>
   <p>The success of the "Krásná Helena" (Beautiful Helena) clearly indicates what our professional companies can do, and the same has been proved by our amateur groups. Therefore, it is to be hoped that the successful attempts this year will not be the last.</p>
