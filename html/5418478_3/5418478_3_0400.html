   <p>As we have already informed our readers, a grand concert is to be given on November 26, in the Sokol Chicago Hall. The artist is to be....Jaroslav Kocian. It is unnecessary to inform our art-loving people to be sure to secure their tickets well in advance, for the name of this outstanding countryman of ours is a sufficient guarantee that the hall will be sold out to the last seat. [Here follows a biographical sketch of the violinist with several lines of highly complimentary remarks about his status as a musician.]</p>
   <p>You surely do not want to miss the opportunity to hear our great countryman play. Will we stay at home? We do not think so. We are certain that <span class="page-break">2</span>the Sokol Chicago hall is large enough to accommodate all of us. Therefore hurry and get your tickets, while they are still available.</p>
