   <p>We had a rare guest at the Narodni Pout (National Pilgrimage) at Pilsen Park yesterday. It was United States Senator Medill McCormick, who came especially and by a special train from Washington, D. C. to spend some time among our countrymen. At the Union Station he was met by a committee consisting of the following: Messrs. Stepina, Frank G. Hajicek, Karel V. Janovsky, Kohout, Pelikan, Sikyta, secretary to the postmaster, the postmaster, Mr. Lueder, and United States Marshal Levy.</p>
   <p>The committee brought the honored guest to Pilsen Park, where he was greeted by the managing committee of the Pout, and by festive music, and was presented with a bouquet of flowers. Because Congress is unusually busy at the present time dealing with some very important legislation, the Senator could not remain with us very long. He looked over the Pout, delivered a brief speech, and returned to the depot. By 6 P. M. he was already on his way back to Washington.</p>
