   <p>The auditorium of the Sokol Chicago presented a much more pleasant aspect last night than a week ago when, due to a blizzard, the actors played before an almost empty house.</p>
   <p>Last night's performance was for the benefit of Mr. Rudolph Suva and his wife, Mrs. Kamila Suva, who are, without contradiction, two of the best-liked members of our "Czech California" stage. The house was sold out. This and the numerous gifts bestowed upon the artist pair proved their popularity.</p>
   <p>A frolicsome burlesque, Duru's "Mr. Darimon's Two Weddings," translated by J. Horn, was on the program. Upon our Czech stage it was introduced under the name "Nevĕsta V Almaře" (The Bride in the Clothes Closet). The light humor abounding in the piece was perfectly sufficient to create a merry atmosphere which was interspersed by frequent outbursts of laughter. The play is very easy</p>
