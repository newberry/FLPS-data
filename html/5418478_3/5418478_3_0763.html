   <p>Among the members of the theatrical world, there is a long-standing custom that a beneficiary chooses a more or less showy play for his so-called honor evening, comforming to his histrionic ability; but Mr. Krejci no doubt had in mind the entertainment of his audience as a first consideration, and disregarded the rule usually followed by other actors. He chose a four-act comedy for his benefit performance, dealing with life in Chicago, written by Mr. M. Hageman, and translated by Mr. J. Huml.</p>
   <p>This play was performed in our downtown theaters under the title "A Crazy Idea". Yesterday it was played with the title "Cerna Mary" (Black Mary).</p>
   <p>The stage setting was arranged by Mr. Krejci, who also had charge of the stage production.</p>
   <p>The play begins with the story of a young medic, Tom Blane, who takes <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>advantage of the absence from the city of his uncle James Stone, to rent his uncle's residence to transients.</p>
   <p>Uncle James Stone's residence changes immediately into a sort of boarding house, and the scene of the most comical little episodes; and just when these entanglements reach their greatest height, the uncle unexpectedly returns, and here a most humorous finale is enacted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gageman's play is a very amusing farce, whose purpose primarily is the entainment of the theater patron.</p>
   <p>The audience received the play very graciously. A no small part in the popularity of the play is due to the fact that the translator did not stint in using a number of Americanisms, which, on the Czech-American stage, have an irrepressibly catching effect.</p>

   <p>To the credit of the players it must be said that the play went across very smoothly; with direct scoring in the so-called situation scenes.</p>
   <p>In this play, Mr. Krejci as the easy-going student of medicine, and Mrs. Kamila Suva as Black Mary, a servant in Stone's household, were the most outstanding.</p>
   <p>Mr. Krejci, in the principal role, did very well, which of course was expected of him. We must say of Mrs. Suva that she did justice to her part, and was applauded, as one may well expect. All the other roles were presented smoothly. These were: Mr. Suva (James Stone), Mr. Zaruba (Beatrice, his wife), Miss L. Ditter (Eve Stone), Jindrich Weidner (nervous composer Gustav Puders), Ladislav Dvorak (Julius Smith), Mrs. Slavka Krejci (the opera singer Lillian Tussel), Bedrich Sulc (the flitting banker from Kokomo), Mrs. Stoces (the banker's wife Catherine), Mrs. Svoboda (the daughter, Augusta), and finally Mr. Svoboda, who played the lover's role of Neil Browning.</p>

   <p>The smaller parts were played by the following actors and actresses: Mr. Roucek, Mrs. Huml, Mr. Huml, Mr. Davidek, Mrs. Zeniska, Mrs. Baer and Mr. Socha.</p>
   <p>The play was enlivened by a number of songs, besides that, in the second act, Mrs. Krejci presented a sample of terpsichorean art, which brought great applause.</p>
