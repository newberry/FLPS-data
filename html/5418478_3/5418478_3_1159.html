   <p>Yesterday evening the footlights shone for the last time this season on the stage of Sokol Chicago. After seven months of hard work in the services of Thalia our amateur actors of Sokol Chicago are going to take a much-needed rest.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's adieus were spoken in the terms of a beautiful historical story, "Lucerna" (The Lantern), from the pen of our "Bohemian Sienkiewicz," Alois Jirasek, that genial writer who has delved into Bohemian history for the most beautiful pearls of contemporary Bohemian literature.</p>
   <p>The action of the play is set in the feudal period, in which were trained the scolding hirelings of great estates. And among the masses of a down-trodden people were found characters comparable to granite, who, at the risk of their lives, demanded of the ruling classes their rights and privileges.</p>
   <p>Such a character is the obstinate miller, Libor, in Jirásek's play. Libor, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>conscious of his freedom, refuses to take part in the reception of her ladyship, the princess, who just then happens to visit her estate and clashes with the proud miller.</p>
   <p>The heroic role of the miller, Libor, was played by one of our leading amateurs, Mr. Josef Mikulas. He played the exacting part with professional skill.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Slávka Svoboda, as the princess, played her part so well that she immediately drew to herself the hearts of the audience. Majestic in appearance, democratic in deportment, exemplifying a rare combination of traits for those feudal times, Mrs. Svoboda drew much applause through her wonderful impersonation, of the princess.</p>
   <p>The third outstanding part in this historical play was that of the school teacher, Zajicek, a typical representative of the educated proletariat. This role was faultlessly performed by Mr. Weidner.</p>

   <p>The other roles, a considerable number, were typical of the period represented.</p>
   <p>The costuming and scenery were appropriate to the period represented, and the play was a studied, well-rounded presentation, impressing favorably all who came to be amused and instructed in Bohemian history. It was very easy to assimilate.</p>
