   <p>The Kalas Vocal Quartet is on its way to Philadelphia, Pa., to fill an engagement with the Victor Talking Machine Company. It was organized by Mr. Kalas, the well-known chorus leader after an offer had been made to him by the above mentioned world famous music firm. The individual singers belong to the best circles our musical community has to offer. They are: Fr. Mayer, first tenor; J. Kalas, second tenor; Vlad. Reindl, first basso and Vacl. Jelinek, second basso.</p>
   <p>They studied diligently under the leadership of Mr. Kalas, and they certainly will be well qualified to represent Czech songs for four voices which is to be their main task. This quartet, after having fulfilled its contract with the eastern firm, intends to hold regular rehearsals, and will be available for musical assistance at our public or private entertainments, and also at occasions of a serious nature, <span class="page-break">\2</span>as funerals or solemn celebrations.</p>
   <p>Detailed information will be given to managers or arrangements committees by Jan Kalas, 1809 South Central Park Avenue.</p>
