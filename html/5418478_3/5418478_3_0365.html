   <p>Commencement exercises were held yesterday afternoon by the graduates of the Academy of Fine Arts on Michigan Avenue and Adams Street. Among the graduates was Miss Marie Tuma, daughter of Mr. Longin Tuma, the manager of the Bohemian National Cemetery. Prof. Wats Folwell, of the University of Minnesota, addressed the graduates. Miss Tuma completed with success in three years the course in decorative drawing. This young lady is a deaf-mute. She has learned to speak, but the deafness has not been cured. Despite her affliction, Miss Tuma is a talented young lady, and she will be a source of great joy to her parents. We wish the young lady all the success in her artistic life's journey.</p>
