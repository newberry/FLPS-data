   <p>Those who bear the name "Josef" or "Josefina" will be able to celebrate their name day this year [on St. Joseph's day] by attending a theatrical performance for which the Ludvikovo Divadlo (Ludvik's Dramatic Association) is steadily and industriously rehearsing. The play to be given is "Pepincina Prvni Laska" (Josephine's First Love), picturing phases of Prague Life. It is an excellent satire portraying the relationship between a landlord and his janitor. The play has musical interludes and is excellent in its staging and setting.</p>
   <p>We advise everybody to secure tickets as early as possible by telephoning the office of the Ludvikovo Divadlo, Canal 7102.</p>
