   <p>p. 1, Col. 2 -- Yesterday evening the children of the Bohemian School of Vojta Naptstek presented two theatrical plays. The children and the patrons of this school are very active and ambitious.</p>
   <p>The children played their parts happily, courageously and with such sincerity as only the children can express. Roles for these plays were assigned to those most capable to perform them, therefore the plays were very well presented and entirely successful.</p>
   <p>The first performance was a comedy, in which both girl and boy students participated. This was not a very difficult play, but it was very comical and interesting. Some of the young actors played their roles in an original manner. They took these roles rather seriously, which made it amusing.</p>
   <p>The entire cast of the second play consisted of girls, who presented a simple children play very nicely. The audience which was laughing and shouting <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>during the first performance suddenly became very quiet and attentive because of the wonderful picture that these girls portrayed upon the stage. They were dressed in attractive and colorful costumes, adapted to their roles, which gave the stage a magnificent appearance. Music played during the greater part of the play, forming a pleasant background to the entire program which was enjoyed immensely by the large audience.</p>
   <p>The children were taught these plays and directed by Mr. Hladek, who is a teacher of the fourth grade at the Bohemian school. Mr. Brousek's orchestra furnished the music, and other adults assisted in the arrangement of the program.</p>
