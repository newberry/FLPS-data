   <p>Yesterday our music loving public had the rare opportunity of hearing our cornet king Mr. Bohumir Kryl, who appeared in a concert given at the Pilsen Sokol hall, Ashland Ave., and 18th St. The name of Mr. Kryl is well known, therefore it is not surprising that the spacious hall was filled. Yesterday's program deserves the greatest credit. There was not a single visitor who did not leave enthused and satisfied to the utmost.</p>
   <p>It was really a pleasant evening and everyone regretted that it did not last longer. Time passed too quickly as a result of variety of the program, which was made up of selected numbers. It is to be regretted that we have so few occasions of this kind.</p>
