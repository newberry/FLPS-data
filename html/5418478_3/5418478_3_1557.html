   <p>The Patronát Česko-Slovanské Americké Síně (Trustees of the Bohemian-Slavonic American Hall) is having its annual exhibition this week. As usual, this fine event takes place in the Patronát's own building at 1436-40 West 18th Street. It has all the excellent features this year to which we have become accustomed, as well as all of its former exhibitions. The bazaar will surprise everybody by the great number of valuable and practical objects that are on sale, all of which are very suitable for Christmas presents.....</p>
   <p>The admission fee is ten cents per person.</p>
