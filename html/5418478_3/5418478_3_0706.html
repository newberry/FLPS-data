   <p>It is always of great importance to Mrs. Otilie Splavec to surprise her many admirers with a dramatic work of merit at her benefit performances, and that is undoubtedly the reason why Shakespeare's "Kupec Benátský" (Merchant of Venice) was presented last night. At the present time, very few of Shakespeare's plays are being presented upon our stage, inasmuch as these plays are difficult for a modern actor and require concentrated study, which is usually given them only by actors who devote themselves solely to Shakespeare's works.</p>
   <p>But, in spite of all these obstacles, it was apparent last night that much care and study was devoted to the production, and therefore, the result surprised us in many ways. Mrs. Splavec played the role of "Portia," and put into it a full measure of her art and histrionic honesty, with which she studies all of her roles. Although the character of "Portia" does not afford Mrs. Splavec the opportunity to display all of her unusual talents, nevertheless <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>she created a personality which will be remembered for a long time to come by those who were present.</p>
   <p>The people who filled the spacious auditorium of the Sokol Chicago hall greeted Mrs. Splavec with a roar of applause, and numerous flower offerings and other gifts gave a proof of her popularity.....</p>
