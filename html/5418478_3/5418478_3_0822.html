   <p>P.1--Very few dramatic artists are permitted to celebrate a jubilee, fifty years of histrionic activity, and still boast of such bodily and spiritual strength, as Mr. Frantisek Ludvik, the director of the first permanent Bohemian Theatre in America. There is not one Bohemian in Chicago who does not know Mr. Ludvik, and surely there is no countryman of ours, who having had the pleasure of knowing him intimately, does not like him and has not become his sincere friend. For these reasons, it can be expected, that Mr. Ludvik's jubilee will be a holiday, not only for his artistic retinue, but for the entire Bohemian public. The Ludvik Theatrical Company will give a jubilee performance on Sunday February 6th in the Garrick Theatre. There, the jubilant will be rendered homage by his associates for his fifty years on the thorny path of histrionic art, and by the public, who recognize the merits of Mr. Ludvik as an artist, a Bohemian, and a man.</p>
