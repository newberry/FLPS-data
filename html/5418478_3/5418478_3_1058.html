   <p>As we have mentioned briefly before, the amateur-photographer members of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni are organizing a gala night which will be held sometime next month and at which the distribution of prizes of a photographic contest will take place. It will be the first night of its kind in Bohemian America, and the prizes awarded will be well worth preserving by all their winners.</p>
   <p>There will be an entertaining program arranged for the evening, and the whole affair will be a social event of the first order, perhaps the red-letter day of our social season.....</p>
   <p>Following are the rules of the contest. All our photographers should clip them out and save.....</p>
