   <p>A recital was given last night in the hall of Pilsen Sokol by the pupils of Mr. and Mrs. Machek. We can say without exaggeration that the Machek's should be proud of their pupils. They all endeavored to their utmost, and some of the accomplishments aroused marked attention and stormy applause.</p>
   <p>Among those participating in the recital were: John Gregor, Charles Jiran, Rudolph Fiala, Josephine Kryl, Edward Baxa, Minnie Polacek, John Klecka, Otto Wiedersberg, Libby Novak, Albie Kambersky, Joseph Roda and Helen Weiner. The accompaniment was by Mrs. B. Lestina-Machek. The young musicians proved that, under the supervision of a good teacher, remarkable talents can be developed.</p>
   <p>The attendance was quite satisfactory, despite the almost unbearable heat of the day. Each of the participants received a bouquet of flowers, some of them received two.</p>
