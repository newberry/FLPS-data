   <p>Yesterday afternoon a most interesting event took place in the clubrooms of the Second Presbyterian Church on Michigan Avenue at 20th Street, one of the oldest Chicago churches, founded in 1843. The committee on immigration for the "World in Chicago" exhibition, which will be open in the Coliseum and in the Auditorium this month and at which all nations of the world will be represented, held a Slavonic Festival in the Presbyterian Church. Russia, Bohemia, and Serbia were represented. The committee had invited three Slavs, each to speak about his own nation. Consul Viktor Čičkin spoke for Russia, Professor J. J. Zmrhal for Bohemia, and the editor of a Chicago Serbian newspaper, Mr. Paladic, for Serbia.</p>
   <p>The Festival was presided over by chairman of the committee on immigration, Miss Smith. First a Russian chorus of forty trained men's and women's voices sang three beautiful Russian chorals; then the Russian consul spoke. He talked about the great family of Slavonic nations, and about Russia's history <span class="page-break">2</span>and her sympathies for the whole Slavonic world. He stressed problems of common interest to all Slavs; and in discussing the recent struggle of Slavonic nations in the Balkan Peninsula, he gave high praise to the valor of the Bulgarians, Serbs, and Montenegrins.</p>
   <p>His speech, rewarded by stormy applause, was followed by three selections presented by the members of the Pěvecký Sbor Parku A. Dvořák (A. Dvořák Park Singing Society). Under the direction of Mr. Liška, they sang "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home); "Matička" (My Little Mother), a well-known folk song; and "Hej Slované!" (Ho, All You Slavs!), a national anthem stressing Pan-Slavonic fellowship. The zitherists of the Singing Society rendered two beautiful compositions, one by Cibulka and one by Bernhard, which evidently charmed the audience.</p>
   <p>Professor Zmrhal spoke about the great struggles of Bohemians for religious liberty and reform. He talked about their love of the arts and sciences; <span class="page-break">3</span>their yearning for political freedom and independence; and about the progress of the Bohemian community in Chicago. Finally he mentioned that in the year 1915, all Bohemians will commemorate the five hundredth anniversary of Jan Hus's martyrdom. Professor Zmrhal urged the Americans who were present to try to meet that year in Prague and encourage the Bohemians in their fight for independence.</p>
   <p>Thereafter, Mr. Paladič spoke about the Serbs and their recent warfare in the Balkans. He mentioned the fact that the Russian consul in Chicago is also the local consul of Montenegro; that the Montenegrins consider Russia a nation of their own brothers; and that it was principally on Russia's advice that they finally surrendered the Fort of Drinopol [Adrianopolis].</p>
   <p>Reverend Shaw thanked the speakers for their efforts and the audience for their presence, and then invited everyone to partake of refreshments in the club dining room.</p>

   <p>The meeting was well attended--in fact there was not room enough to accommodate all those who had come. The audience, consisting mainly of prominent Americans, was left with a keen desire to learn more about the Slavonic people of Chicago. The front of the hall was suitably decorated with a Russian, a Bohemian, and a Serbian flag, and a small American flag graced the center.</p>
