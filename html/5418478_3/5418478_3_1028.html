   <p>p. 12--The First Bohemian-American Bando--Concertina Club has been active among us for many years. The concerts and the activity of this club are well known and appreciated by the public, so there is no need to make any lengthy, elaborate announcement of its concert which will be given tonight at the Pilsen Sokol Hall.</p>
   <p>A special program was arranged for this concert that will be even better than those given previously.</p>
   <p>We know that everybody will take this opportunity to hear the wonderful music which this concertina club produces.</p>
