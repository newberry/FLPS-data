   <p>Recently one of the Chicago Bohemians had an opportunity to visit the Mount Wilson Observatory in California. After being shown about the place and taken through all of the secret compartments in the topmost framework, he discovered a plate with the inscription, "Erected by Wensel Morava, Chicago, Ill." Upon inquiry, it was found that Mr. Morava, a Czech, is one of the leading iron structural engineers and contractors of the Middle West and that he has successfully engaged in this line for a great many years, having built many large steel structures in Chicago and other cities.</p>
