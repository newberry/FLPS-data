   <p>P.1--The popularity which has been gained by St. John of Nepomuk Court No. 457 of the Catholic Foresters during the ten years of its existence was demonstrated in a most significant manner on Saturday at its jubilee celebration held in Liberty Hall, Union Avenue and Thirtieth Street. All the space in the hall was filled by a merry, enthusiastic public, whose gayety steadily increased.</p>
   <p>The committee on arrangements deserves praise and recognition, for it did not forget anything which might add to the success of the affair. All those who attended were in the fullest measure satisfied, and the circle of the friends of St. John's Court was considerably enlarged by this celebration.</p>
