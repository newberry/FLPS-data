   <p>Last night a tale, adapted from the English version and given a background of music and dancing, was presented before Chicago Czechs in the C. S. P. S. (Czech benevolent society) Hall, on 18th Street. Miss Mary E. Zeman, in revising and staging the story, intended it as a gift to our young people. Members of the club Jaro (Springtime), and pupils of the Matice (Czech School), on Yeaton Street, made up the cast of the delightful play, which went across the footlights under the name "Zakleta Princezna" (The Enchanted Princess). As it was rendered cleverly and smoothly, it filled the large audience with genuine pleasure.</p>
