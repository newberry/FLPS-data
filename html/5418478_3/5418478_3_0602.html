   <p>According to the decision of the last legislature, statues of two of our distinguished governors will be erected on the grounds surrounding the State capitol building in Springfield, Illinois. One of them is Richard Yates, who was the governor of our State at the time of the Civil War, and the other is M. Palmer.</p>
   <p>The State Department of Public Works, which had been authorized to award the contracts, selected the famous Bohemian artist of Chicago, Mr. Albin Polášek, to create a bronze statue of Governor Yates. The contract to create Palmer's statue was awarded to Mr. Leonard Crunnell, also a Chicago sculptor. The State legislature appropriated the sum of $35,000 for the erection of each of these statues.</p>
