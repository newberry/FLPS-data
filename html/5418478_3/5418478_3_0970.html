   <p>At last, and after a long, long time, our thirst for real art, real music, and song has been quenched. In fact we felt transported, as if by magic, to somewhere in the old country, to Prague, to Rudolfinum [a famous concert hall in Prague].</p>
   <p>This illusion was created by yesterday's concert of the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society), which was held in the Sokol Plzen hall....It was the Society's regular annual winter performance, and we are happy to say that in quality it was the best we have witnessed in the past ten years.....</p>
