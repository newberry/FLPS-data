   <p>Friends of amateur theatricals were given real pleasure by the dramatic group of Sokol Karel Jonas of Cicero, Illinois, last Sunday. Moser's comedy "Mrzout," known to American playgoers as "The Hypochondriac", was on the bill, and pleased the audience in spite of its clumsiness, for it was well acted. Alois Hildebrandt was the directing spirit and did honor to his reputation as an untiring worker in this field.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Radvanovska and Mr. Hildebrandt played the main parts, and Mr. Cerny, with his orchestra, supplied the incidental music.</p>
   <p>The attendance was rather small, which is to be regretted, in view of the sincere efforts of the amateurs.</p>
