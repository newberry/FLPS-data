   <p>While on its world tour the Bohemian Quartette, making its last American appearance at Thalia Hall, is enjoying the hospitality of Mr. [Josef] Triner, the well-known manufacturer of bitter wine. Mr. Triner is a true friend of Bohemian art and artists. Recently he bought and paid a neat sum for several paintings by Farske. In this respect, there is hardly another wealthy Bohemian who can compare with Mr. Triner.</p>
