   <p>Those times have long since passed when Bohemians, immigrants in this land, were in all respects, which touched upon industry or business, dependent upon other nationalities. Today we occupy a leading position in so far as industry and business are concerned. Our business establishments are comparable to the largest in the city; many of our countrymen are owners of factories and businesses, in which is manufactured everything that we formerly had to buy from manufacturers and businesses of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>One of the most important branches of industry, which is controlled by our country men, is without doubt the business of brewing. There are at present two breweries under the control of Bohemians and it will not be long before a third brewery will be added, of which only yesterday the corner stone was laid.</p>
   <p>Surely, there is not one Bohemian, who would not welcome with joy the report about our great expansion in all branches of industry, and for that reason, it is certain that everyone wishes the best of luck for this new undertaking, in which Bohemian capital has been invested, and which promises to be a genuine Bohemian undertaking.</p>
   <p>At the instigation of Mr. Roman Sedlacek, several Bohemian tavern keepers met on the 12 of June, 1903, to discuss the formation of a stock company to operate a brewery. The following were present at that meeting: Josef Hanzlik, a brewer; Josef Smejkal, a lawyer; Roman Sedlacek, Rud. Rubringer, Josef Kolar, Jan Cervanka, Tom Lackovic, Stef. Popovic, Josef Oborny, and Frant. Cerveny, tavern keepers.</p>
   <p>Temporary officers were elected as follows: Messrs. Jan Cervenka, chairman and Roman Sedlacek, secretary.</p>
   <p>On the 28th of August of that year, five and 4/10 acres of land, on 26th Street between Whipple and Troy Streets, were purchased. Then a meeting of all Chicago Bohemian tavern keepers was called and at this meeting, which took place on the 3rd of September, the plan for organizing a stock-company was explained to those present. Because thirty of those present pledged $1000 each, the proposed enterprise became an accomplished fact.</p>
   <p>The company was incorporated on the 2nd of October 1930, with a capital of $100,000, under the name Pilsen Brewing Company of Chicago.</p>
   <p>A sketch of the building plans was prepared by the architects Messrs. Ant. Charvat and Ad. Lonka. Mr. Lonka was awarded the plans and Mr. Fr. Layer, contractor, was entrusted with construction Actual construction started November 16, 1903. The company is composed of seventy five shareholders. After the reading of this data, Mr. Cervenka addressed a few words to those present, urging them to remain steadfast on the course and always work in harmony.and unison.</p>
   <p>In the awarding of the various contracts preference was given wherever possible to Bohemians.</p>
