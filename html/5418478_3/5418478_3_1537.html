   <p>A public rehearsal of our part of the program of the coming festival to be arranged by the West Park Commission next Saturday was held yesterday in Dvorak Park. The outcome of the rehearsal gives us reason to believe that the Bohemian performance will in every respect be successful and really excellent. The public interest in the festival was manifested by the large crowds which came to witness the rehearsal. Never before, perhaps, had the Park been so well filled as last night. More than a thousand people came to see the comely girls and stalwart young men dressed in the Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak national costumes in which they will dance the Beseda [national square dance] before the multitudes that will gather in Garfield Park next Saturday. The festival has two parts, one of which will take place in the afternoon, and the other at night.....</p>
   <p>The afternoon program will begin at two o'clock; the evening program at eight. <span class="page-break">2</span>All performers must be in Garfield Park fifteen minutes before the beginning of the program. Those from Dvorak Park will meet in the Park before noon and will board special streetcars at 1:30.....</p>
   <p>The festival gives promise of great interest. It will be conducted on the golf course just south of the Garfield Park pavilion.</p>
