   <p>It was just fifty years ago this year that the singing society Lyra was founded in Bohemian Chicago, just an insignificant community at that time. On December 14 of this year, it will be exactly thirty years since the foundation for the Český Dělnický Pěvecký Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society), a society destined by Fate to reach deeply into the cultural life of Bohemians not only in Chicago, but also all over the United States, was laid down. Just recently, both of these bodies were merged into one, and their mutual anniversary was celebrated in a most appropriate manner yesterday. Instead of an obligatory banquet, the united singers arranged an anniversary concert and invited Mr. Otakar Marřák to appear as solist. He is an opera star of our golden temple of arts, situated upon the banks of the Vltava (Moldau River); he is the same Mařák who, after an artistic career of twenty years, still occupies <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a foremost position in the Bohemian world of songsters.</p>
   <p>There are twenty-five hundred seats in the spacious auditorium of the Carter H. Harrison Technical High School, but most of the seats were occupied by grateful listeners who were longing for an artistic treat of musical beauty. The concert was truly a success, and we must say that nobody was disappointed in his expectations. The spacious auditorium resounded with tumultuous applause following each chorus or solo number, and there were moments when the enthusiastic audience responded with spontaneous demonstrations. The lion's share of the applause, of course, went to Mr. Mařák; but a good share of the credit also went to the singers themselves and, last but not least, to the conductor, Mr. Josef Houdek, whom we must rank as one of our foremost conductors today.</p>
   <p>But there was another man who reaped deserved laurels yesterday. He was the Slovak virtuoso, Mr. Vladimír Šaško, our prominent pianist, who performed the difficult task of accompanist. Both he and the conductor received recognition from Mr. Mařák himself when, amidst roaring applause he shook hands with them.</p>

   <p>The program was opened with a presentation by the male chorus of Javurek's rapturous choral, "Na Moravu" (To Moravia), which was followed by Foerster's no less effective composition, "Oráč" (Plowman).....</p>
   <p>The "Slavnostni Sbor" (Festival Choral), composed by the late conductor of the Lyra and also of the Český D#x011B;lnický P#x011B;vecký Sbor, Mr. Jan Kalaš, was the last number on the program.....</p>
   <p>Honor to our celebrants; honor to their conductor, Mr. Josef Houdek! Mr. Houdek has proved to be a real master of the baton, and we are sure that under the leadership of this great but modest artist, our singers will go on to even greater accomplishments.</p>
