   <p>Merry funeral rites will be performed over our theater season today, and hereafter we shall be certain that the seats that have been filling our permanent theaters will have a deserved rest for the next three or four months. We talk about seats because these are always numerically much more plentiful than the audience, and they have been the ones to remain loyal to the theater throughout the season. That a statement of this kind cannot be made in regard to the public, can be easily proved by those who are theatergoers, and by those who are not, but who have at least sufficient interest to read, no matter how cursorily, the theatrical columns in our newspapers. It was a very rare occasion on which they could read that a house was sold out, and we cannot recall any single performance when people had to be turned away without admission tickets. Such an occurrence, formerly rather frequent, would be recorded as a rare piece of news in these days. But all we could read about the audiences was that they were "numerous," or at least "decently numerous," and everybody knows that "decently numerous" is a diplomatic form of describing something that may be just the opposite. Now this may be said about all our theaters, even if one of them may have been a bit more fortunate than the others, and it may be taken for granted that this "decency" was one of the principal reasons for the premature and regrettable death of this year's season. The only performances which have done their duty were the "benefits" [arranged for the benefit of one actor particularly good or popular, or a couple of actors, such as husband and wife], but what such an "honor night" has meant for an actor who wanted to make sure of a full house may be explained by any one of them who had to walk around for a full week, calling on friends who could help him in drumming together a capacity audience.</p>
   <p>This "benefit" habit had been brought here from the old country even before our first troupe arrived in Chicago, but it has never been more "in style" than now, when a person does not necessarily need to be an actor in order to claim the right to a "benefit," but it is sufficient that he has started learning the histrionic alphabet. This year's season was particularly rich in such "benefits". But it would be an error to think that the "benefits" are a concomitant of poor seasons. Even in the old times of our glorious amateur theatricals, there had to be some. But in the early years, such "benefits" were given only for directors of special merit who had been doing their work almost free of charge, or to an amateur who had been visited by an unusual misfortune or a run of bad luck, and needed help. And these "benefits" were rare occurrences of which there might not have been more in twenty-five years than are given now in one single season. It is only in these most recent years that our criterion of whether or not a "benefit" is justified has become so very elastic that our public is being asked to "dig" for two or three "benefits" a week, and that the people cannot hide their surprise over the multitude of "actors of merit" entitled to a "benefit".</p>
   <p>But even this overdoing of a good thing has been of some advantage. It has helped to make good audiences, and good audiences are, unfortunately, an indispensable part of the theatrical arts. You may be inclined to counter with some beautiful speech about real, lofty art being far above material interests, but the fact remains that the box office is so inseparably connected with the stage that real art is frequently required to make important concessions in the interest of the box office. There may be the most excellent performances of the most valuable dramatic works on the stage, but if they are not backed up by the box office, you know what must happen: either a lowering of the artistic level of the repertoire, or bankruptcy. You know what has happened to Chicago's Grand Opera, in spite of large subscriptions, and what has happened to many another large theatrical enterprise. And that is much more likely to happen to a small theater whose existence depends on a box office which is never rich. You may remember that even in the golden days of Chicago amateur theatricals, adverse conditions have occasionally appeared, and that, just as now, something had to be put on that would "pull," and the directors stooped even to the cheapest sensational plays in order to satisfy the insatiable treasury. The fact is that there are very few of us now who would care to foot a bill for a deficit for pure love of art, and if there were such a person, how long could he keep it up?</p>
   <p>It seems, however, that even the famous box-office plays have disappointed this year. Of course, we are far from trying to imply that the season was a complete flop all over, but it was not good by any means, and it could hardly have been worse without endangering the existence of our theaters. Just let us recall last Sunday, when a play was given for the benefit of our most important national undertaking an equivalent to which we shall not again have an opportunity to embark upon in our lives. We shall see that apparently there is absolutely nothing that will fill a house these days except a house-to-house peddling of tickets. If anything could be expected to fill a theater to overcrowding and to cause the reporters to say next day that the public had to be turned away, it certainly would be such an occasion as the one we had last night. But the reports said something quite different--the house made a frigid impression instead of an inspiring one, and not even the jokes of old Mrs. Machacek were able to make the handful of the public present forget the fatal emptiness.</p>
   
   <p>An occurrence of that kind is too eloquent to need amplification, and it is bound to convince everybody that there is perhaps nothing else in the world that would attract a large audience but a silly comedian like Charlie Chaplin, who is now a fetish of young and old in our nickelodeons. To look for the reasons for the failure of this season would be very difficult and hardly serve a good purpose. Many people say that it is due to hard times, unemployment, bad business, and they are no doubt right. Others say that it is mostly due to the European war just as they say of everything else for which we cannot find a sufficient explanation, and that is the most comfortable way of disposing of untoward matters. We may also say--though we do not believe it--that everybody is required to make constant contributions to the political movement, to the Bohemian war relief funds, to prisoners of war in Serbia, and that there are no half-dollars left in the pocketbook with which to buy a theater ticket. There are some people who maintain that the nickel shows are ruining all dramatic arts, and there is a great deal of truth in this, too. The nickel show business, which was being laughed at some years ago, has developed into an enormous industry, and the film trust bids well to become more powerful than the steel trust or the oil trust. The nickel shows have become splendid palaces, and the foremost actors appear in the silent photoplays for salaries as high as the earnings of the world's greatest artists, and higher. The settings of such photoplays cost many times the amounts paid for the most spectacular stage plays. No wonder that nickel shows are continually crowded and constitute the most dangerous competition to the legitimate stage.</p>
   <p>But let us not be deceived into thinking that bad times, the war, and the nickel shows are felt by our theaters only. Others have the same troubles. Just recently a German theater had to close because nobody could be found who would open a sufficiently large pocketbook to make up its deficits. And the Germans are always first to boast about their culture, their art. In our own case it is somewhat better; there is still a part of our public that does not forget the "school of life", as we like to call the theater, that recognizes the importance of the theater, and which--well, let's continue this in September.</p>
