   <p>We Czecho-Slavaks of Chicago, having in our midst good musicians and leaders, can verily say that, in so far as music is concerned, we need not step aside for the musicians of any other nationality. We have many Bohemian musicians in Chicago, who adhere to music with a whole-souled enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>When Jan Balatka, in his time settled in Chicago, rather when he twined his considerations toward Chicago, there was here at that time the "Slovanska Lipa" (Slovak Basswood) he wanted to help the musicians of this organization call the attention of the Chicago music world to them. Balatka became a master and as such is recognized in all musical centers in spite of the fact that of the Bohemian "Jan" was made a German "Hans".</p>
   <p>The long neglect of music of the Bohemians by really good musicians was finally ended by the organization of a fine band and in a little more than a half year the accomplishments are surprising. Twenty-eight Bohemian musicians formed an organization known as the Slovak Band and in musical circles of all nationalities have earned themselves favorable recognition <span class="page-break">2</span>either as individuals or as an organization. Under the leadership of J. Koula, they have progressed in a short period of time so far that they have already given three concerts. The Slovak Band appeared before the public in the Bohemian English Liberal School where it was received cordially by an overflowing attendance of citizenry. We believe it would be proper for all local musicians to join the band and thereby strengthen it as much as possible.</p>
   <p>The Concert given last Sunday by the Slovak Band can be considered on a par with the performance of "Mudra's Band" from Cleveland last summer. The program consisted of twelve numbers among which were the following: Tannhaeuser, by Wagner, followed by an Overture, by Suppe, a violin solo played by J. Kostka. Selections from Les Huguenots; Oberon--overture by Weber. The excellent clarinetist, J. Koula, Jr., chose the Carnival of Venice as his solo number.</p>
   <p>Echoes from Home by Lanna was played as a duet by Mr. F. Tryner and Mr. V. Klocem.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Koula's Bohemian quartet brought the audience to an enthusiastic applause and praise. The same can be said of the rendition of the Overture to "William Tell."</p>
   <p>The closing three numbers, Selections from "The Bohemian Girl," "The Waltz of the Recruiting Officers" and a "Gallop" were likewise received with enthusiasm and had to be repeated.</p>
   <p>Deserving mention is made of the youthful Flutist, Kaunovsky, he promises to become a great musician.</p>
   <p>If the Slovak Band in this last concert did not achieve material success, it was doubly successful from an artistic viewpoint.</p>
