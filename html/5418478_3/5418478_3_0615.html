   <p>An exposition is being held at the Art Institute on Michigan Boulevard which is made up largely of works of former students of the Institute. Some of these alumni are now teachers where they once were students. The exposition is large and comprises every branch of the plastic and graphic arts. It occupies several salons in the eastern wing of the second floor. There are sections devoted to painting, sculpture, handwork, drawing, sketches, interior decorations, etc.</p>
   <p>The exposition has been made possible through the efforts of the exhibiting artists. Yet there are some companies and individuals who accommodated the enterprise by loaning works of art from their private collections. The exposition has been supplied with art from all over the world, so that it opens a wide horizon in an artistic and cosmopolitan sense.</p>

   <p>Our readers will surely be eager to learn that this exhibit, which is attracting the widest and closest attention of the American intelligentsia, contains works of Czech artists from here and the old homeland. All these works represent high standards of artistic quality.</p>
   <p>Mr. Albin Polasek [professor at the Art Institute], well known to the American art-loving public, is exhibiting three plaques, "Girl from the Roman Campagna," "Figure for a Fountain," and "The Sower," all of which have been commented on by the press in most flattering terms. A bust, "F. D. Millet," also by Polasek, is creating the liveliest interest. Similar bronze castings on display are by Mario Korbel, Czech artist, who is living in New York City at the present time.</p>
   <p>Anton Sterba, portraitist [also on the staff of the Art Institute], 1549 57th Street, Chicago, is represented by two paintings. "Melting Snow" is the caption of a painting exhibited by Joseph Froula, a Czech-Chicago landscape painter, 501 North Dearborn Street. "Providence Town Street," one of the exhibits, is the work of the Chicago painter Vaclav Vytlacil, 2232 South Clifton <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Park Avenue. It touches any Czech patriot's heart, because the artist's first name, "Vaclav," is used in its genuine Czech form and is not translated or changed. Mr. Vytlacil did not even permit an allowance on the accent, but insisted upon the dash over the letter "A" to serve as a guide for correct pronunciation. Mr. Geo. W. Mally, 2257 Argyle Avenue, Chicago, is represented by an etching showing the bridge on 22nd Street.</p>
   <p>A stroll through the exhibition and its atmosphere is mental recreation. No one should miss this display which is open to the public from January 8 to February 7.</p>
   <p>Our fellow countryman, Professor Polasek, is a member of the artists' jury.</p>
