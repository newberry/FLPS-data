   <p>p. 2. col. 4. We have many real artists among us. If our Bohemian violinists, pianists, and other artists were more conscious of their skill and value in their respective fields, as artists of other nations are, they would gain the respect of the highest artists' circles in America.</p>
   <p>Our artists do not know how to advertise their skill. They are satisfied if they please their community, their pupils and the Bohemian public. There are many who could be famous if they showed their accomplishments to the world. Among them is our piano virtuoso, Mr. V. Sasko, who plays at many Bohemian concerts. He prefers to play at concerts which benefit the Bohemian benevolent enterprises, which is indeed to his credit.</p>
   <p>Mr. V. Sasko studied piano abroad and is now recognized as a piano virtuoso. At present he teaches piano among the Bohemian people in Chicago, and is recommended to anyone desirous of learning to play the piano. He teaches advanced students as well as beginners.</p>
