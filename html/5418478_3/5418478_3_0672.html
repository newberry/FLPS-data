   <p>Rehearsals and preparations are in full swing for the production of a splendid and costly operetta--"Indicka Bajadera" (Hindu Bayadere) by the Croatian author Albini. This excellent work would have been presented more often to our Chicago countrymen during the last theater season had there been time to finish the rehearsals and make certain improvements and innovations which will characterize the work when it is again staged on October 1, 1922, by the Narodni Divadlo (National Theater) in the hall of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. The management took particular pains to make the production of this operetta better than ever before.</p>
   <p>The title role will again be played by our popular soprano, Mrs Marenka Havelka. The role of Fripov will be played by Mr. Krejci; the dancer, Colette, by Mrs. Slavka Krejci; the invincible trio of vagabonds by Messrs. Svoboda, Vrzal, and Havelka; and the aging Hindu beauty will be played by Mrs. Stritecky. The motif of the play is romantic, interspersed with humorous incidents and ballet scenes such as the "snake dance". The stage management is in the hands of Mr. Havelka; the music will be handled by Mr. V. Fiser's orchestra.</p>
