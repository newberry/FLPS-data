   <p>Mr. Bohumil Petzl, teacher of music, died Saturday morning on Blue Island Avenue and Leavitt Street. There were very few countrymen with whom Mr. Petzl came in contact who were not his friends. This was due to his sincere, modest character. He was a good-hearted man, and beloved by his pupils. Today, however, he is no more. We found him in the county morgue, without friends, forsaken. Our hearts would not permit us to allow this good man to be buried in Potter's Field at County expense. For that reason, we asked Mr. Kostecka, of the firm of Cermak and Kostecka, to make arrangements to bury him in our National Cemetery. This they did, and the body was removed to their establishment, from which place the funeral will be held on Wednesday morning. It is desired that all former pupils of the deceased attend the funeral of their former teacher.</p>
   
   <p>Generous as always, Mr. Rud. Rubringer promised that his band would escort the body of the old musician to his last resting place. All donations will be gladly received and acknowledged in the daily news papers for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the funeral. Money may be sent to the persons listed: James J. Novotny, 1421 west Eighteenth Street; John Vitous, Eighteenth and Throop Streets; James Medek, 3721 West 22nd St.</p>
