   <p>One of the finest summer festivals of our Bohemian colony was held yesterday, the day of the annual outing of the Spolek Starych Ceskych Osadniku (Bohemian Old Settlers' Club) in Pilsen Park on 26th Street and Albany Avenue.</p>
   <p>Before ten o'clock in the morning, the preparations were all finished, and the arriving guests were receiving their welcome at the Park gates; the welcoming continued until late at night.....</p>
   <p>The attendance was enormous.</p>
   <p>Our old settlers, their age notwithstanding, never forget good causes deserving of support; hence they refuse to swell their own treasury by money flowing in on such occasions as the one yesterday, but always donate the profit to some worthy institution. Yesterday's income went to the Cesko-Americka Nemocnice (Bohemian-American Hospital).....</p>
