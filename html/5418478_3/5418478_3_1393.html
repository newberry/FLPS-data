   <p>Old settlers whose services to the Czech community in Chicago have been invaluable, like to remember former times when they had to work hard and untirelingly, not only to found an existence for themselves, but also to prepare and insure a better future for those who came after them to the land of liberty, to continue the work which they had begun. All of Czech Chicago gladly joins with them in their reminiscences, which are revived in annual gatherings, at which congenial conversation and pleasant, plain entertainment are offered.</p>
   <p>One such gathering took place yesterday, celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Czech Old Settlers' Association. This gave the picnic a special luster, and made it one of the most successful in years. It was held in the Pilsen Brewery Park, the usual place for these affairs. Innumerable Czech settlers are members of the Association, including many who left town years ago. Even young people belong, thus symbolizing the future, while the older people form <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the background, representing the past and the present. These annual celebrations reflect the peaceful, harmonious, sociable life in the settlement, as the old settlers knew it.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, yesterday's picnic reflected the grave import of the present time. A patriotic air pervaded the festival. Aged men and women frankly expressed the wish that "the man with the scythe" might wait for awhile, until the war ended with a victory for the United States, so that the old people could rejoice in the liberation of the world, and, last but not least, in the rescue of Czechoslovakian territory from subjugation.</p>
   <p>The festive picnic opened, as always, at 11 A. M., and soon groups of people, most of whom were members of the Association, were seen in lively conversation, for many had not met for a whole year. There was a parade with a markedly patriotic aspect. It was led by John Sokol, head of the Scouts. He wore a mask, and was dressed as "Uncle Sam". Girls from the Red Cross marched, followed by members of the Association.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>A new flag was raised over the park pavilion, after which "Uncle Sam" recited the oath of allegiance in English. It was repeated by the audience in the Czech language. This was a solemn moment.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anton Pregler enthusiastically outlined the activities of the Association. "My esteemed fellow citizens, fellow members of the Czech Old Settlers' Association," he began. "I wish to say only a few sincere words to you....We are celebrating the memory of July 14, 1898, when our Association was founded.....Conforming with our statutes, the Association is managed by a directorate of six men and six women.....</p>
   <p>"Sixteen men have addressed former gatherings at various times, usually after the main ceremonies were over. Among those speakers were Charles Vopicka, V. Kaspar, Robert Pitte, Judge J. Z. Uhlir, J. Kostner, Joseph Cermak, and Judge Kickham Scanlan of the County Court. Mrs. Marie Steiskal, who was a member of the directorate twenty years ago, and Mrs. Margaret Stuchlik, also spoke on various occasions.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"At each picnic a gold medal was given to the oldest settlers. The first gold medal was awarded to Mrs. Marie Pecha, who was at that time a ward of the Institute for the Blind, 19th Street and Douglas Park Avenue (sic). She came to America in 1853. Mr. John Haisman, one of the recipients of the medal, came to this country in 1848.</p>
   <p>"Charity has been the guiding spirit of the Association. The members have not paid any dues during the entire twenty years, yet over 5,000 membership emblems have been given away, various expenses have been paid, and annual picnics have been arranged with free admission. Over 10,000 albums have been given away. About $3,000 was contributed to the maintenance of various charitable institutions, such as the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphan Asylum, the institute at Lisle, Illinois, and the Catholic Orphanage, where an extra room, a memorial to the Association, is maintained for sick children. The Association sent 500 crowns for the sufferers from the flood in Bohemia in 1902. That money was distributed by Mr. F. Korbel. The Association donated $500 to the Czech Hospital in Chicago, and $50 to the immigrant home at Baltimore, Ohio. The Matice <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Vyssiho Vzdelani (Central Organization for Higher Education), and the American Red Cross have also received contributions. The Association became a member of the Red Cross under the special sponsorship of President Wilson. Our Association has contributed on many other occasions, and can well be proud of its record. As chairman of the board of directors, I wish to thank everybody for their co-operation.....Let us remember the members who have died....." Mr. Pregler closed with a wish that the silver jubliee of the Association might be celebrated.</p>
   <p>Mr. Otto Fuerst Followed. During and after his address, there were tears in the eyes of almost everybody present. His words went to the hearts of the old people; they were the very echo of their innermost desires.</p>
   <p>These moments of emotion did not however, last very long because the majority of the picnickers gradually congregated about the kitchen, and at the spots where delicious drinks were being served.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The dance of the oldest couple was an important feature. Mr. Joseph Sramek, 83, and Mrs. Therese Doskocil, 81, in spite of their age, gave an excellent account of themselves because they pranced about with youthful vigor, and chatted gaily. They were each presented with a large mug designed in true Bohemian style.</p>
   <p>One cannot imagine a Czech Old Settlers' picnic without some funny entertainment being offered at it. There was plenty of fun at this one. The main attraction was the appearance upon the floor of a strange man whom everyone would have guessed to be at least one hundred years old. He hopped about as if he were a boy, and danced with seventy-two-year-old Mrs. Catharine Nemrava until she was breathless. Other dancers, and those looking on, soon began to express doubt about the man's real age. Though unmasked and revealed as Mr. Belohlavek, Jr., he still stuck to his "old age," and continued to romp about as a "centenarian," until the picnic closed at 11 P. M.</p>
