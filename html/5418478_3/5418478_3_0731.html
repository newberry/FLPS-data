   <p>After a five weeks' pause, a normal atmosphere again prevailed in the Sokol Chicago auditorium last night. The transition from operatic successes to burlesque was effected by Mrs. Slavka Svoboda, who appeared in her own benefit performance. We must admit that the evening was a real tribute to her. Mrs. Svoboda's name is well regarded in our community. Years devoted to activities, true artistic conscientiousness, and, last but not least, undeniable talent have been linked with her name. All of these elements contribute to Mrs. Svoboda's great popularity, which is best shown in her regular annual benefits. They invariably signify a crowded house, flowers, a warm atmosphere, and ardent applause.</p>
   <p>Precisely the same impression was conveyed to us last night when Mrs. Svoboda appeared in "Baby Mine," a burlesque by Margaret May, translated into Czech by R. Kautsky, who calls it "Rozpustila Kitty" (Naughty Kitty). The piece has three <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>acts and abounds in charming mischief. It was once the hit of all our American stages. It was introduced by a short scene from the skillful pen of the well-known Chicago Czech news writer, Albert J. Havranek.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Svoboda played the title role, "Kitty Harden," wife of a manufacturer. Kitty was endowed with a temperament which seemed to have been made to order to fit Mrs. Svoboda's own. She achieved a complete success, and the audience never tired of regaling her with stormy acclaim. Mr. Svoboda played "Jimmy Jinks," whose character he had evidently fully understood. Mr. Jindrich Weidner, director of the troupe, as "Hardy," the manufacturer, gave, as always an excellent portrayal of his histrionic skill. All other minor parts were well handled.</p>
   <p>Dances performed by our popular misses, Milada Krametbauer and Vlasta Kybic, contributed much to the success of the evening. The two ladies attracted widespread attention recently in the performances of Smetana's opera, "The Bartered Bride".</p>
