   <p>Our censor of morals, Major Funkhouser, second deputy [superintendent] of the Chicago Police and a man of notoriety, recently remembered the statue, "The Sower". This sculpture, which stands in front of the Chicago Art Institute, is a work of Albin Polasek, head of the department of sculpture at the Institute. Mr. Funkhouser has never in his life seen any other sower but one dressed in overalls, and therefore, because of lack of something better to do, he gave orders to put overalls on that statue on Michigan Boulevard.</p>
   <p>With Billy Sunday and other fanatics slinging their reformatory mud all over the city now, it is not surprising that the directors of the Art Institute satisfied Funkhouser's demand in part. "The Sower" was not supplied with overalls; he was, instead, removed to the inside of the building, so that Major Funkhouser will not feel compelled to look at a "sower in the altogether", and thus he can keep his thoughts beyond temptation.</p>
