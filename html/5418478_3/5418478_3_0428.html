   <p>Mr. John Masacek of 2521 South Ridgeway Avenue received the glad tidings that his son Edward is meeting with success in New York. Mr. Edward Masacek recruited a military band some time ago. Although he is only twenty-one years of age, he was promoted to the rank of assistant leader of the band of the 38th Infantry regiment. Only recently the New York Tribune gave him considerable publicity by praising the musical ability which he displayed in a concert recently. He never conceals his Czech ancestry and proudly calls himself a Czech musician.</p>
   <p>He received his first instruction in cornet playing from Mr. Karlovsky, the well-known Chicago Czech virtuoso. He was also a student in the Czech language classes at Carter Harrison High School.</p>
