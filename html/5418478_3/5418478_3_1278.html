   <p>The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) has decided to have a joint Narodni Pout (National Pilgrimage) on August 20, with the Zupa Stredni (Central District [of the American Sokol Union]). The start of this pilgrimage will be at 12:30 P.M. sharp in front of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. It was further decided that all members taking part in the parade are to be dressed in the Sokol uniform. All of the national and charitable organizations will take part in the parade and the Pilgrimage. Let us not make any promises but let us attend this pilgrimage instead, and attend in full numbers. In this manner we shall not only hasten the purchase of our own athletic field, which we now so sadly lack, but also we shall show the public that a promise made by a Sokol, his punctuality, and his honor are to be depended on.</p>
