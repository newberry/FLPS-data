   <p>A performance, the proceeds of which will be used to pay off mortgages on the building of the Sokol Havlíček-Tyrš, was given last night by the dramatic section of that Sokol group. "Ženská Vojna" (A Women's War), a comedy by Klicpera, was well played before a well-filled house. The production was under the direction of the female Sokol members.</p>
   <p>The comedy presents a glimpse into a world in which women wear pants and men wear petticoats. It is full of unexpected turns.</p>
