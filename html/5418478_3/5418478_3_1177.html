   <p>An important meeting of Bohemian amateur actors was held last night in the hall of the Slovanská Lípa (Slavonic Linden Tree) [a Sokol unit]. It was called to prepare for the observance of the fiftieth anniversary of Bohemian amateur theatricals in Chicago. It will be one of the most significant events in the life of Chicago's Bohemian community, and our amateurs are getting ready to arrange for as dignified a celebration as the occasion demands. The interest which our older settlers have in this matter was proved by the participation in the meeting of many a veteran of the Bohemian stage....and by numerous letters from those who could not be present but offered their co-operation. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Jos. Lang.....In order to provide sufficient time to get in touch with all those who were active in amateur theatricals in the early years, the celebration was deferred until March. A detailed program for the evening will be worked out during the coming week....An attempt will be made to present to the public those who laid the foundation of Bohemian amateur theatricals <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in Chicago. The next meeting of the organizers will be held next Friday....</p>
