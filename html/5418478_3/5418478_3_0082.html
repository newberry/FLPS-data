   <p>A friendly meeting of Czechoslovak bankers of Chicago and representatives of Czechoslovak press was held in Hotel Morrison last night. On this occasion, many remarkable ideas were expressed as to how these financial and journalistic institutions could work hand in hand in the interest of our people. At this meeting, it was stated that every one of the Czechoslovak banks in Chicago is absolutely reliable, that the banks do everything in their power to encourage building activities in our settlements, that by offering a financial aid to ambitious individuals, the banks offer them an opportunity to prove their worth in commercial and industrial fields, and that they generously support our national and charitable institutions.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that because of the ideas expressed in the meeting, a plan will be worked out according to which better co-operation between Czechoslovak banks and Czechoslovak newspapers of Chicago will be secured. This will lead to mutual benefit and furtherance of the interests of our Czechoslovakian people of Chicago.</p>
