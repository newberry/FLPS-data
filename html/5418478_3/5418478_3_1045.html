   <p>The Bohemian Club of Grand Crossing is progressing satisfactorily. The purpose of this club is to speak, by means of music, to the youth of this small Bohemian community, at the Crossing, and save them or our nationality. This noble work is meeting with successful results. The pupils of the singing school attend classes cheerfully and are making fine progress.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Club meets on the 1st and 3rd Sundays of each month at the club hall, 7755 Cottage Grove Avenue. The singing classes are also held there.</p>
