   <p>The "Palette Club" of women artists, in conjunction with the "Chicago Society of Artists", has arranged an exhibition at the Art Institute which is to last two weeks and which was opened yesterday with a large attendance.</p>
   <p>To the formation of the Palette Club, to which recognized women artists belong, impulse was given several years ago, by our eminent artist, Mrs. M.K. Lusk, and to her honor it was then known as the "Bohemian Club." Later, however, when Mrs. Lusk, withdrew from activity, the name was changed to "Palette."</p>
   <p>There are on exhibition, several paintings by Mr. Jos. Klira. In the section devoted to women's works, Mrs. Lusk has eight successful paintings on exhibition.</p>
   <p>All in all, the exhibition is very successful thus far. At yesterday's opening, many art loving Bohemians were present, and to meet with our countrymen at such affairs always affords us great pleasure.</p>
