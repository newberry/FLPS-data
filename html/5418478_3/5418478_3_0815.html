   <p>Yesterday, the Ludvik Dramatic Company ended their theatrical season for this year in order to rest a few weeks after working diligently for one year. For the benefit of the beloved comedian, Mr. Alois Klapka, a six-act farce "Mistr Bedrnik A Jeho Chasa," (Mister Bedrnik and his crowd) was performed as the outstanding play of the season. The benificiary distinguished himself in the role of "Bobes," and was rewarded with several floral pieces by his friends. Mr. Weidner also was distinguished in the role of the clerk "Spagat." Mr. Splavca as "Bedrnik," and Mr. Lescinsky as "Skrob," were also excellent. The entire play, as is usual with the Ludvik Company, was remarkably well performed.</p>
   <p>The house was filled to capacity, and the public showed in the best manner possible that it knows how to appreciate the many years of active work done by Mr. Klapka on the theatrical stage of Bohemian Chicago.</p>
