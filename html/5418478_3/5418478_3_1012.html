   <p>The concert given yesterday by Brousek's military band, held in the Pilsen Park pavilion, met with all around success. Mr. Brousek's band is justly famous, and aside from that, it performed for the benefit of the Vojta Naprstek school, therefore, it was not strange that the public filled the pavilion.</p>
   <p>The band is composed of about thirty-five excellent musicians, and it is only natural that the performance of the band was received with thunderous applause, and the musicians were forced to render encore after encore.</p>
   <p>The concert was a complete success from both a moral and financial viewpoint, so that quite a neat sum of money will accrue for the benefit of the school. After the concert, a lively, hearty dancing entertainment took place.</p>
