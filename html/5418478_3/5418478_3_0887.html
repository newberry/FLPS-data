   <p>In its last annual meeting, the Česká Vstřední Pevecká Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies) decided to give a large-scale concert this spring. The size of the accompanying orchestra will be the subject of a discussion at the next rehearsal to be held February 17 at 7 P. M. in Mr. Hacha's hall, 26th Street and Springfield Avenue. The rehearsal will be the last one before the concert and will be open to any singers who have not attended previous meetings.</p>
   <p>If the concert is to be a representative one, it is necessary that every singer appear. It has been a long time since we made an appearance before the public.</p>
