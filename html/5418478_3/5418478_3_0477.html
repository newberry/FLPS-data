   <p>True Bohemian music was presented at yesterday's concert of the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society), which took place in the hall of Sokol Chicago.....</p>
   <p>Yesterday's concert may justly be called a model for any Bohemian musical event, and therefore it is not necessary to talk about its moral success. We hope that this excellent result will act as a stimulus for all of our other singing societies.</p>
   <p>The attendance was fair, although by right, such an occasion such as yesterday's concert should fill the hall to the very last seat because it is not very often that our music-loving public can hear and enjoy an afternoon of real "Bohemian stuff" presented in the real "Prague way".....</p>
