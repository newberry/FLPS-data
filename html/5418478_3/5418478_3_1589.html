   <p>p.1--First of all it must be admitted that the first day of the bazaar decidedly did not achieve the result which we expected, and which its purpose deserved. The bazaar, or as we have grown used to calling it, the exhibition, surpasses all our expectations in it's arrangements. In that respect, therefore, we were not disappointed. The public, however, on this first day behaved like a step-mother to the enterprise. The afternoon attendance was so small that it almost cast a chill over the affair. In the evening more of a crowd was present, although there might have been and should have been at least three times as many.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the attendance to-day will be larger,--that crowds of our compatriots will flock to the bazaar to contribute their share to so beneficent an object. This evening will be a festive occasion for the C.S.R.D. (Czecho-Slovak Knights and Ladies), the C.S.B.P.J. (Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Brotherhood Society), and the R.D.C. (Knights and Ladies of Honor).</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>There is no doubt that the members of these patriotic and benevolent societies will come to the bazaar in large numbers.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee decided yesterday that no set admission should be charged, such as twenty-five cents, but that this matter should be left to the generosity of the public. As a result every one is welcome, and it will depend on the generosity of the visitor whether or not he shall make a voluntary contribution to the home and the orphanage.</p>
   <p>Of course it is understood that the committee reserves the right to refuse admittance to any one who apparently has come only to cause a disturbance. Patrons of this character are always to be found when admission is free and are unwelcome guests. Children also will be admitted only if accompanied by parents or guardians.</p>
   <p>The bazaar is indeed remarkably well arranged and vastly different from any bazaar or exhibition which has hitherto been held. A booth is placed just inside the entrance, in which a charming young woman dressed in gypsy costume reads the visitors' palms. She does remarkably well and reads every <span class="page-break">\3</span>one's character correctly. True, it requires no great effort for her to make such a deduction as, "Sir or madam, you have a good heart and do not like to see forsaken old people or orphans about you." It is quite certain that all who attend the bazaar have good hearts.</p>
   <p>To the right of the entrance an office has been set up. A large book is to be found there, and the guests register their names and the amounts which they are willing to contribute annually to the support of the home. When we looked through the register we found the following citizens listed: A.J. Sabath, $25; Anton Charvat, $5; Jan Pech, $5; and Adolf Pesat, $5. We hope, however, that when the bazaar has ended, the book will be filled with such entries.</p>
   <p>There is also a wine-room set up in the hall, where Korbel's excellent wine is sold, and there is a typical Bohemian inn, which, however, will be open for the first time to-night. Two wheels of fortune are in almost perpetual motion. It seems that the chief source of revenue will be the game machines, which Mr. Adolf Pesat with extraordinary generosity has lent to the bazaar.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It is a pleasure to attend the bazaar. The service everywhere is excellent, and the visitor is pleasantly surprised to meet fresh, pretty girls dressed in the Bohemian national costumes graciously offering articles for sale.</p>
   <p>Exceptionally artistic programs have been printed for the bazaar, really souvenirs, and we must admit that they are beautifully designed. We have also discovered some original literary work in them, but we will reserve that for another article. In conclusion, it is impossible to deny that the bazaar is really something unusual and for that reason should attract visitors without the aid of recommendations.</p>
   <p>This evening's program will be especially attractive, for several comic acts will be shown. Many new, beautiful, and useful things have been added to the prizes at the wheels of fortune. Let our motto for the next five days be, "Home and Orphanage Bazaar"!</p>
