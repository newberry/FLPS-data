   <p>Complaints of our second generation, claiming that our young boys and girls have no opportunity to prove their histrionic abilities and talents on the Bohemian stages, were heard quite often. This circumstance probably aided considerably toward the organization of a society of fifty members under the name of "The Three Links Dramatic Society," composed of the youngest members of the Praha Lodge of the I.O.O.F. and Libuse Lodge of the Rebeccas. This society intends to present in the hall of Sokol Chicago a series of dramatic plays in the English language as often as the time necessary to study and learn the play will permit.</p>
   <p>This new organization is assured of the support of the members of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodges, and also the members of the Masonic lodges and the Eastern Stars. Due to the fact that many of our younger and older countrymen are attending the English theatrical <span class="page-break">2</span>productions--frequently to listen and hear the correct English--there is a possibility that this enterprise will be an outstanding success. Mrs. Holzinger, a dramatic artist, whose experience in rehearsals and arrangement of theatrical performances is well known, was elected as director.</p>
   <p>The officials of the Three Links Dramatic Society are: Jos. Macek Jr., president; Helen Hanzel, vice-president; Bozena Kasalicky, secretary; Louis Horak, treasurer; James Barton, business manager; Vaclav Hnatek, publicity agent; A. Barton, electro-technician; and Joseph Smrz and F. Valis, property administrators.</p>
   <p>The first performance will be held in Chicago the latter part of February, or the first part of March, at the latest. It is to be a musical comedy called "A Couple of Millions." It was produced with great success in New York.</p>
