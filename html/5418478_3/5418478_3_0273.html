   <p>p. 1, col. 3.. In Mr. Hovorka's hall, a number of directors of Cream City Park held a meeting yesterday evening; they reached a decision as to future plans of this Bohemian enterprise. They deposited the amount of $3,000 to meet all demands and claims against Cream City Park.</p>
   <p>No doubt by the end of this week all will be settled and by the latter part of next week it is expected that the amusement park will be re-opened to the public. This announcement will later be published through the medium of this newspaper. Mr. Otto Ring, an attorney representing the Cream City Park Amusement Association, will call a special meeting of the board of directors tonight, to discuss the closing of the contracts for the concessionaires, and another $3,000 will be ready to meet other bills against Cream City Park. As soon as the contracts are closed with the deposits, the amusement park will be ready to do business again.</p>
