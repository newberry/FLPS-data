   <p>....The management of our first and foremost theater, Ludvikovcí (Ludvik's Dramatic Association) zealously watches all the developments of Czech dramatic literature in the old country, and recently was able to obtain a novelty for the Bohemian-American stage.....This is a serious play called "Ondráš a Juráš" (Andrew and George), which takes us back to our rich but unfortunately sad history. The Slovak national hero, Ondráš, by his self-sacrifice, gives proof of the honest character of our folk. After finishing his studies, he secures a position as an official in the service of the prince, but when, later, he discovers how badly the serfs are treated, he quits his comfortable post and becomes a champion of the oppressed and a holy terror to the oppressors.</p>
   <p>The management of the theater has not spared any expense to make this play a first-class production.....The historical phase of the play deals with the year 1715, and the management of the theater will see to it that all the historical features of that period are preserved, The management is very careful to select such plays as would answer the popular tastes of our people, but together with that they give an educational and a moral basis to the further development of the Czech stage in America.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that our public will attend the production of this play on Sunday in the hall of Sokol Chicago and pay tribute to this excellent historical work. Stage direction will be under the supervision of Mrs. B. Ludvik. The appropriate musical accompaniment will be under the direction of Mr. J. Juřena.</p>
