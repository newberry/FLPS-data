   <p>Two Polish boys were in court for beating up a Jewish storekeeper on Halsted Street. The judge, after hearing the defendants and the witnesses, freed the boys and warned the storekeeper not to force the people into his store against their will. The boys' defense was that they were insulted by the overanxious storekeeper when they refused to enter his store in spite of his solicitation and strong arm methods.</p>
