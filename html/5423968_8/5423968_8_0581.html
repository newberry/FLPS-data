   <p>Many very beautiful, Polish songs were born in the hearts of our ancestors in times of national revival, many of which were sprinkled with numerous bloody sacrifices in fights for freedom, some fearful and some serene, but all reveal and preserve the national spirit. It is our solemn duty to see to it that our traditional songs do not cease to resound, still less to vanish from our midst. Of the thousands of songs, rich in words and sentiment, few are really known by our folks. Therefore, when we turn to our song books, we turn page after page, in futile effort to find some song, some melody. We seem to treat our traditional and ancestral songs like stepmothers do their step-children.</p>

Not only should they teach youth to love the better known songs of their forefathers, but also to revive and restore those songs and melodies that seem to be dying out. School teachers and leaders of choirs, should take an interest in the preservation and cultivation of legacy of our heroism, those dear and soul enrapturing songs of our. Authors and editors of song books as well as composers, are heartily urged to assist in this endeavor.</p>
