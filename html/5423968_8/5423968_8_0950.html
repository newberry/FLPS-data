   <p>Thirty-seven years have passed since the Polish National Alliance was organized in Philadelphia, the "City of brotherly love". Today it is the largest and wealthiest Polish political and fraternal organization, not only here in America, but in the entire world.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance arose not as a result of caprice, nor for the material profit of its organizers, but from an ardent love of Poland, from the desire to work for that martyred land, and from the pure desire that our younger generation, born and raised here in America, be imbued with the Polish spirit, so that it may not be obliterated by foreign influences.</p>
   
   <p>The idea of organizing the Alliance was advanced by Agaton Giller, able Pole and good patriot. His idea was taken up by such patriots as Julius Andrzej Kowicz, Julian Lipinski, John Blachowski, Julian Szajnert, and John Popielinski. (The last two have lived to see the results of their fruitful effort today).</p>
   <p>The task of these five pioneers was a difficult and thankless one, for in their time, the Alliance did not have even the membership of one medium-sized group, but their faith in the future and then self-sacrifice surmounted all difficulties. When it was organized, the Alliance passed through storms of opposition and struggled against great odds at every step, for ill-willed people, or people who failed to comprehend the ideals from which the organization arose, provided stumbling blocks to its development and endeavored to harm it on every possible occasion. Almost the entire clergy of the time was united in its opposition to the Alliance, but the worthy, noble national ideal prevailed. We approached our brethren with a kind word, we kindled their patriotism, and by pointing out their duties to their homeland and to the Polish element in America tactfully and patiently, we overcame all difficulties; storms raged around us, thunderbolts of condemnation were hurled against the Alliance, but nevertheless, we triumphed, and today we move boldly and surely toward the goal set for us by the original organizers and pioneers of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Thirty-seven years ago there were no paid officers in the Alliance; no one sought sinecures in it, for often individuals had to give money out of their own pockets to help keep the organization upon its feet and to shield it from destruction. And so, today, we look with pity and contempt upon the career-hunters who have come here but recently, who do not understand the spirit of the organization, and who have not done anything for it, but who still have pretensiens to recognition. In their opinion, the old pioneers of Alliance work are some sort of antediluvian mammons who deserve nothing from the organization, because of the arrival of new blood to replace the "old simpletons".</p>
   
   <p>We joyfully welcome new strength, for after all we are not immortal, and some one must hold high the Alliance standard after we are gone--the national standard, which must go forward; but the new-comers must be worthy of the organizers of the Alliance. Away with career-hunters and charlatans who would like to make of the Alliance a milch cow for their own benefit!</p>
   <p>We have traveled the thorny path, we have fought opposition, and we have placed the Alliance upon a level from which it may shine as a beacon light for the Polish element here and for our homeland--and today we must maintain it is its full glory and power. We have nurtured the Alliance with our heart's blood, with our love for a pure ideal, our self-sacrifice and our labor. Let us not cease in this noble work that is so beneficial to our nation, but let us go ever forward and onward. We have triumphed over the clergy that once struggled against us; we shall triumph also over the Socialist Internationale that is struggling against us today, for the national ideal which the Alliance has proclaimed in the past, and continues now to proclaim, is greater than all other ideals. This, certainly, is comprehensible to every member of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>The thirty-seven years of the intensified labor for the Polish people which the Polish National Alliance has undertaken is but a drop of water in the ocean of eternity, but how fruitful in results it has been upon this foreign soil, where from all sides a sea of foreign influences seeks to engulf us. No other Polish organization in America can show such positive action. Let us look over the circular issued to the Alliance groups by Secretary-general J. S. Zawilinski on the occasion of the thirty-seventh anniversary of the Polish National Alliance. He writes:</p>
   <p>"....The aims set forth by the organizers of the Polish National Alliance in its first constitution are as follows:</p>
   
   <p>"1. Placing a foundation under institutions for the material and moral benefit of the Polish element in the United States, with the aid of a reserve fund that will be under the permanent, unqualified administration of the Alliance. Classed as such institutions will be Polish "Homes," schools, educational institutions such as reading rooms, libraries, asylums, and Polish trade schools.</p>
   <p>"2. Guardianship of the Polish element in America.</p>
   <p>"3. Political stabilization of the Polish element as citizens of the United States through proper organization and through an Alliance newspaper printed in the Polish language as well as through opening relations with the American press for the protection of our interests.</p>
   <p>"4. Fraternal aid to members of Alliance groups, based upon benefits to the family of the deceased member, from a fund established for this purpose by the convention.</p>
   
   <p>"5. Celebration of historical anniversary dates with appropriate exercises and propagation of a sense of national [Polish] honor."</p>
   <p>These are beautiful and noble watchwords with which, certainly, all Alliance members have agreed in the past, and agree with today.</p>
   <p>Numerically, the Polish National Alliance is great, for it has a membership of more than 126,000, making it the largest Polish organization in the world. The present wealth of the Alliance, in its reserve fund, amounts to $3,614,826.50. Death benefits totalling $7,262,026.66 have been paid, $957,695.29 has been spent for educational purposes, and up to the present time, more than $170,000 has been sent to Europe for war relief. As to its idealogical activity and its activity in nationalistic and social fields, one has but to glance through the pages of the history of the Polish National Alliance to be convinced that our organization, having its aims clearly set forth, has gone forward with confident step.</p>
   
   <p>Daily, it has fulfilled its duties according to the ability of its leaders and members.</p>
   <p>Thus, the Polish National Alliance, realizing that one of its aims is to bend its every effort toward achieving the independence of Poland, has ever and always worked to awaken patriotism amongst the Poles in America and to guide that patriotism along the proper paths. In pursuance of these efforts, the Alliance has always been active in arranging national manifestations and commemorative exercises. It has lent its hand to commemorating the services of the great heroes, Kosciusko and Pulaski, by having monuments erected to them in the cities of Washington, Chicago, Milwaukee, and other places. It has also acted, and is continuing to do what it can, is the cause of Poland and in matters concerning our element here in this country.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance has always supported Polish schools, and often Polish churches too, helping greatly in the development of the Polish seminary in Detroit. Through its educational department, it has assisted and continues to assist Polish students in gaining education that will qualify them for higher positions by offering scholarships to American universities. In its own academy at Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, it educates Polish youth, offering university preparatory courses as well as commercial and industrial training.</p>
   <p>Further, the Polish National Alliance acts as guardian over the Polish element, the fraternal aid department carrying aid to countrymen in need.</p>
   <p>During the present critical times, the Alliance constitutes a force that does much, and with which even the enemies [of Poland] reckon.</p>
   <p>Such has been the course of action of the Polish National Alliance during the thirty-seven years of its existence. It will be even more active when more of our brethren have enrolled in its ranks. Let us build the Alliance, then. Let us give it the greatest possible strength, and we shall be able to do great deeds for which God and our country will one day reward us.</p>
   <p>To action then, Alliance brethren, and show by deeds, not words, that you are worthy of the organization of which you are members! Its name will one day be looked upon with pride in the history of our nation.</p>
