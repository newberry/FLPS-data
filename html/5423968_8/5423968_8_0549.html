   <p>It is very pleasant to hear our native tongue, therefore we always attend gatherings where we hope to hear a few words of its sweet melody. But alas! many times we are greatly disappointed and why? Is it because its melodious sounds are crippled by our tongues, or is it because we wish to show that we can speak broken English? Or is it, finally, because we wish to forget what we were in the old country and what we wish to become here? We judge that only a man with a dark past wishes to obliterate the back pages of his life.</p>
   <p>All Poles are only newcomers here, the English language is necessary here outside of the home, therefore, our children attend public schools in order to learn as much English as is necessary for making a living.</p>
   <p>This does not prevent the parents from teaching their children the Polish language, correcting them whenever they speak it improperly and also encouraging them to speak it correctly.</p>
   
   <p>Our young generation here speaks the Polish language so badly that some times we have to listen very carefully in order to understand what they are talking about.</p>
   <p>What is the cause of our negligence? We have the freedom of the action here. Not only are we allowed to express our thoughts here, but we are free to express them in the Polish language, for which Polish children are being persecuted in Poland under Russian and German occupation by their teachers, for which many fathers have been imprisoned or deprived of government positions and rights, and finally, for which many of our young men were forced to leave their mother country and emigrate to America with no hope of seeing their native land again.</p>
   <p>On the way here they dreamed fantastic dreams, how they would spread wings in a free land, how they would teach other exiles how to love Poland and despise all that is evil and foreign to us. And what a disappointment! All that is sacred and inviolable in the hearts of individuals, that which Prussian prisons and Cossak's knouts could not remove when we came here is torn out by brutal hands. Whose hands?</p>
   
   <p>By the hands of countrymen. Yes, our countrymen ridicule the newcomer for attending church, our countrymen persuade them to use alcohol, praise tobacco and degrade the Polish language by substituting foreign words. If the newcomers resist, then they are out of luck for all will avoid them and refuse them help.</p>
   <p>It is high time to remedy this evil for if this continues we shall lose all our national characteristics. We shall lose our language and respect for the family. Already, today, we can see that we have not succeeded in getting respect from other nations.</p>
   <p>They have the worst opinion about us because we do not demand our rights. We do not respect ourselves and cannot expect any respect from others.</p>
