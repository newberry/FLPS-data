   <p>At exactly 3:15 P. M., on Thursday, March 25, 1915, the chairman of the trial board of the Polish National Alliance, Mr. J. Karpanty, opened hearings in the case of the Polish National Alliance vs. Mr. S. Dangel. The chairman read the charges as presented in the case.</p>
   <p>The same judges presided at the trial of Mr. Dangel who heard the case of Mr. Mermel. The newspaper reporters were also the same as in the previous case, except that the reporter for the Dziennik Zwiazkowy was Mr. H. Setmajer. The hall of the trial was filled to capacity with spectators.</p>
   <p>The defendant appeared accompanied by his legal adviser, Attorney Niedzwiecki, of Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. N. Zlotnicki, in behalf of the prosecution, presented his charges against the defendant. Mr. Zlotnicki made this reservation, however, that he was prosecuting not in his own behalf but in the name of the Central Administration of the Polish National Alliance. He <span class="page-break">\2</span>made this reservation because the former defendant, Mr. Mermel, after the morning session of his trial, had sworn out a warrant for Mr. Slotnicki's arrest, seeking revenge. Consequently, Mr. Zlotnicki announced his willingness to decline to serve in the capacity of prosecutor in this case and stated that he should prefer to have some other director of the Polish National Alliance undertake that task.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the trial read the indictment, which was as follows:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Stanley Dangel, throughout the entire period of his residence in the United States, has devoted his life exclusively to scolding persons in his publications, to making insinuations against those who have refused to be intimidated, and to the destruction of honorable and worthy enterprises to which admission has been denied him. Through his harmful activities the accused has gained such universal popularity for himself that the Polish Falcons' Alliance refused him admittance. Moreover, even the Socialists have warned him in their newspapers against too free use of the friendly <span class="page-break">\3</span>title of "comrade" and in that way have ordered him to cease to embarrass their organization.</p>
   <p>"Ever since the last convention of the Polish National Alliance the accused Dangel has kept up a tirade against the officials of the Alliance, [that is], against the members of the administration and the members of the advisory board. The defendant has at all times exposed to ridicule the enactments of the organization, has published protests, and in general has done everything possible to lower the organization's prestige and to hinder its development. The administration of the Polish National Alliance has received numerous letters from groups and councils of the Alliance demanding Mr. S. Dangel's removal from the Polish National Alliance. Despite this the administration waited patiently, hoping that Mr. Dangel would become settled. The administration's expectations, however, have not been realized. The calmness of the administration has only encouraged the defendant to carry on his nefarious work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"In view of these facts the administration of the Polish National Alliance places Mr. Dangel on trial. As proof of his guilt the administration will present in evidence the entire year's file of the Polish newspaper, the Nationalist (Narodowiec).</p>
   <p>"These charges have been pointed in five copies and are left to the disposition of the Censor of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>"The Administration Committee of the Polish National Alliance</p>
   <p>"N.K. Zlotnicki</p>
   <p>"J. Magdziarz</p>
   <p>"J.P. Szymanski"</p>
   <p>Asked how the defendant pleaded, guilty or not guilty, the attorney for the defense, Mr. Niedzwiecki, arose and made a motion in behalf of his client to remove the chairman of the trial from the list of the judges in this <span class="page-break">\5</span>case. The reason set forth was that the examiner was incompetent. The attorney for the defense also questioned the competence of three other judges, charging them with prejudice toward the accused person. As proof of his statement he referred to various public appearances of the defendant and of the judges' appearance against him. This the defense attorney verified with affidavits and newspaper clippings. Mr. Mallek, the attorney for the Polish National Alliance, acknowledged in principle the validity of the defense counsellor's demand as justified by a State law.</p>
   <p>Asked by the chairman of the trial whether the defense did not wish to have the present judges hear the case, the defense counsellor stated that he did not make reference to the whole trial board but only to three of its members, who were prejudiced against the accused. These he enumerated as Messrs. Karpanty, Majewski, and Heller. The chairman of the trial adjourned the case for five minutes for the purpose of arriving at a decision.</p>
   <p>At the end of the recess the chairman announced that the trial board <span class="page-break">\6</span>requested the presentation of the affidavits and of the other proof that would establish the charges of partisanship made against the chairman of the trial and against Messrs. Majewski and Heller, The attorney for the defense then presented to the examiners the requested evidence, which he had in his possession.</p>
   <p>Attorney Mallek maintained that all motions should have been presented in their proper time, and that the constitution of the Polish National Alliance specifically rejects motions presented at the last moment. The attorney for the defense stated that he would adhere strictly [to the rules] and abide by the formalities observed in all courts. He also stated that the summons was presented to the defendant on too short notice, and that the defense had appeared for the purpose of presenting that motion. Mr. Niedzwiecki also raised other charges of a formal nature and in particular stated that he has only a copy of the original charges. The chairman of the trial informed the defense that the original charges are those made by a Council of the Polish National Alliance in Pittsburgh.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The counsellor for the defense, in a determined manner, continued to base his arguments upon technicalities. The chairman of the trial showed the copy of the charges to the prosecution, that is, to Messrs. Szymanski, Zlotnicki, and Magdziarz. He then ordered them to read it. If it should prove to be in accord with their original charges, they were then to forward it to the Censor of the Polish National Alliance. In addition to that they were requested to affix their signatures on each of the copies as well as on the original. The defense attorney protested against this and requested that a record of the procedure be kept by a stenographer, and that a copy of the notes be given to the defendant. The chairman contended that the defendant should himself hire a stenographer if he wanted some one to take notes of the proceedings. The attorney for the defense maintained that the judiciary committee should facilitate the means of defense for the defendant and spare him expense. The board yielded to the demand of the defense.</p>
   <p>The defendant announced that he requested the appearance of the Polish <span class="page-break">\8</span>National Alliance's attorney to start the proceedings. He expressed his desire to expedite the trial that he might be able to leave and so save a hundred dollars for the members of the Polish National Alliance in Cleveland.</p>
   <p>After a brief pause the attorney for the defense offered an affidavit made by the defendant as circumstantial evidence. In it the defendant stated that he had received a letter from the Censor of the Alliance, requesting his presence for the trial but failing to mention who the judges would be, and that for that reason it was impossible for him sooner to prepare charges of incompetence against the examiners. In this connection he referred to several passages of the Alliance's constitution, and he appealed to the judiciary committee strictly to adhere to the formalities prescribed by the constitution.</p>
   <p>Attorney Mallek rejected the minor charges of the defense. In this controversy Defense Attorney Niedzwiecki stated:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>"I have seen jackasses older than I am."</p>
   <p>This caused an outburst of laughter among the spectators. Mr. Zlotnicki proved on the basis of a literal interpretation of the constitution that Mr. Niedzwiecki was wrong, and the latter maintained that it was a typographical error. Mr. Niedzwiecki then became angry and began to utter unpleasant threats.</p>
   <p>The chairman asked the defense attorney whether he considered that court as a civil court or a lay court. The attorney for the defense replied that he had a different conception of a lay court because the accused had been summoned by this court as an ordinary defendant, having no opportunity to select the judges. He then attempted to play upon the emotions of the judges and upon those of the audience, referring to the defendant's wife his children, and his business. He adhered stubbornly to his charges of incompetence and prejudice against the judges in this case, citing the State law. He finally made a definite demand that the judiciary committee <span class="page-break">\10</span>consider itself incompetent.</p>
   <p>Defendant Dangel maintained that he should be present at this court not in the role of defendant but rather as plaintiff. He then read the letter of Mr. Szajnert, who had ordered him to appear at the trial. He contended that on the basis of that letter he had been certain that he should appear before the whole advisory board and not before his enemies. He descended to pathos and in a tearful voice appealed to the sympathy of the members of the Alliance's court.</p>
   <p>The trial board then went into a conference. After a brief intermission the chairman announced that the judiciary committee was motivated by nothing else than a desire for justice. Consequently, in view of the charges of partisanship made by the defendant, the trial board had decided to transfer the whole case to the entire advisory board of the Polish National Alliance. This advisory board is to meet in Chicago on April 7, 1915.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>The defense attorney proposed that the same commission examine the material accusing the administration of the Polish National Alliance. The attorney further contended that this evidence was in the possession of Mr. Dangel. The purpose of requesting this examination was that the defense might present its opinion on the basis of this evidence to the experienced advisory board.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dangel again became very emotional, and he implored the judiciary committee to examine his material, saying that otherwise he would destroy that evidence and would voluntarily resign from the Polish National Alliance. The chairman of the trial told the defendant that the present committee was not qualified to examine his material, since it had been appointed for another purpose. That could be done only by the advisory board. The court then announced that for the time being it considered the whole case closed.</p>
   <p>To judge by the entire proceedings of the trial, it is clear that the defendant appeared for the hearing for the sole purpose of prolonging the examination of the charges. This the defense hoped to accomplish by resorting to <span class="page-break">\12</span>technicalities, thus avoiding, temporarily at least, the imposition of a just penalty.</p>
   <p>It is difficult even to think that any one who knows the entire activities of Mr. Dangel could believe that out of the whole Polish National Alliance there could be found even one of the more prominent members of that organization who had not been more or less venomously and even calumniously attacked by Mr. Dangel in his publications. The only exception to this, naturally, was the small handful of his allies, among whom, again, it would be impossible to select the judges to try him without violating even the most primitive principles of justice. It is to the interest of the Alliance's welfare to decide upon his activities in the shortest time possible. The time [for this decision] will come on April 7, 1915.</p>
