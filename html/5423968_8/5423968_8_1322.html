   <p>The month of September, 1910, was not as auspicious for the increase of the Polish National Alliance as were all the former months. This is the first time since the eighteenth convention of this organization that the central administration accepted less than one thousand new members in a single month. True, there was very little lacking to meet this figure, but there was a lack. This should never occur again.</p>
   <p>The strikes then existing in many Polish centers greatly contributed to the decrease in the rate of gaining new members for the Polish National Alliance. Wherever unemployment reigns there can be no thought of gaining new members to an organization. But when the labor difficulties pass, activity will again be felt in the coal districts and then, through the arduous efforts of our brother members of the Polish National Alliance, one month will cover all the deficiencies.</p>
   
   <p>This zeal is very important to all Poles; it is not sufficient for one to be a good member of the Alliance; it is not enough to fulfill all the obligations, such as paying dues, defending the organization against its enemies, and, in general, conducting oneself as befits a good member of the Alliance. It is necessary to do something more, namely, to encourage all one's acquaintances and compatriots and, in general, everyone who would be an adequate member to enroll in the organization. There is an obligation imposed upon every member of the Alliance to increase its membership. This action is especially necessary because whenever the officials have recommended that special organizers be appointed, the conventions have always refused to allot money for such purposes. They have claimed that it was unnecessary to have such organizers because every member of the Alliance was considered an organizer.</p>
   <p>One can well imagine what astonishing results could be accomplished if every member of the Alliance really did become an organizer and gain at least one new member for the organization. The result of this simple effort would be that the Alliance would increase twofold with each year. As a result, all the Polish immigrants would soon be absorbed in the ranks of the Polish National Alliance. But why even talk here of such matters. We certainly were not successful in our efforts to have every member act as an organizer, and moreover we cannot even say truthfully that every tenth member could be considered worthy of the title of organizer. It was found that only a handful of members were actually exerting their efforts for the benefit of the Alliance, while the others acted indifferently toward this very important cause. Everyone knows how to criticize--everyone seems to have some infallible and foolproof system for increasing and strengthening the organization. But how comparatively few are there who practice the real and only method of achieving any greatness and success, namely, exerting their efforts to build this greatness and success.</p>
   <p>In truth, any fellow member who, through his own initiative, gained at least one new member for the ranks of the Polish National Alliance in a period of one year, actually accomplished far more for the Alliance than all those who have talked, counseled, and criticized a great deal, if they not only have failed to gain new members, but also have turned many away.</p>
   
   <p>It is therefore suggested that all talks and criticisms be left until the time of the convention. In the meantime it would be best to gain new applicants by teaching those who are unenlightened, convincing the prejudiced repelling numerous attacks, and explaining the aims and merits of the Alliance. In a word, each member should do everything that will bring the greatest number of our fellow Poles in America under one banner.</p>
   <p>True, there are members of the Alliance who, in their public appearances, becloud the minds of many Poles by telling them tales of a hundred different banners under which a person can be useful to our motherland. In the same breath these misleaders add that our homeland does not demand of us immigrant Poles that we band ourselves under one banner. No true Pole should pay heed to such talk because even those who make such claims do not believe their own assertions. There are also people among us who flatter everybody, in the hope that in return for their adulation they can govern everyone. To these and to many others of their type the Polish National Alliance turns with a request and a petition not to disrupt the good work of the organization.</p>
   
   <p>Sound judgment and experience teach one that in order to be powerful, to have influence, and to be able to work profitably for our motherland, the Polish people must necessarily become united and not dispersed. Most Poles have enrolled in the Polish National Alliance. Moreover, this organization gains more members each month than all the other banners combined. The will of the Polish people is with the Alliance. This will is sacred and, hence, should be respected by everyone.</p>
   <p>In view of this preference of our people for the Alliance, the remaining Poles are urged to follow in the footsteps of our already enlightened compatriots. A request is also made to those who have become sufficiently enlightened to know where truth and duty lie, to direct their less fortunate brethren upon the right path. Had this but happened previously it is certain that many would now be members of the Alliance. There are many Poles with whom our fellow members come in daily contact who, yet, have either never heard of the Alliance or have seen it painted in an unfavorable and completely erroneous light. Such people frequently need just one word, one bit of encouragement, one explanation, in order to become supporters of the good side. Let us, therefore, not begrudge them this one word. We should be ever conscious of the fact that this is the best and, at the same time, the easiest, service that one can render in behalf of our motherland.</p>
