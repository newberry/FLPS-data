   <p>Last Saturday evening about three hundred guests gathered in the dining room of the Polish Women's Alliance at a banquet, to give recognition, by their presence, for the work of the Society of the Sons of Poland, which yesterday celebrated its fifteenth anniversary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kaniewski, chairman of the anniversary committee welcomed the guests with a short speech and then called upon Mr. Leon M. Nowak as toastmaster.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nowak, with his usual ease and ability, expressed his gratitude for the honor accorded him and declared that the organizing and concentrating of Polish immigrants under the banners of Polish societies is the only way to give then a haven in this, the "fourth district" of Poland.</p>
   <p>"If we had no organization, our native language," ended Toastmaster Nowak, "would be foreign to us and, as a consequence, we would not preserve the ideals of every Pole who wishes to free Poland."</p>
   <p>At the close of his speech Mr. Nowak gave Mr. Singer a silver table service in the name of the Society. Mr. Singer expressed his thanks in sincere words. Then all of those gathered, at Mr. Nowak's suggestion, sang "God Save Poland", accompanied by Mr. Dzietulski's orchestra. Then Mr. N.P. Orlowski, secretary of a commune of the Polish National Alliance, recited his own poem, "Serve Your Country!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Francis X. Kucharzewski spoke next, after being introduced by the toast-master. Mr. Kucharzewski's speech was sincere; he pictured the events in the life of this Society--now one of the wealthiest groups of the P.N.A.--from its very founding. "In the past, just as today," ended this worthy worker for the development of the Society, "we stood faithfully by the P.N.A. because in it we saw, as we continue to see, a truly Polish organization, a truly homelike organization, which has dried the tears of hundreds of widows and orphans, has helped them at a time when no one else wanted to help them.</p>
   
   <p>In our work we have always been quiet, not wanting publicity, not seeking renown, but working in a manner befitting sons of Poland."</p>
   <p>"Dear sister Poles!" began the next speaker, Mrs. Mary Sakowska, director of the P.N.A. "I am not going to speak about the history of the development of this organization because there are others who no doubt know it better than I do, nor am I going to talk about how it should continue its activities, because its development is the best indication that the Society knows what to do. I shall say a few words to you sisters about a very important matter, the collecting of contributions for the help of our homeland, moaning in its chains." Having presented in a few words the situation in Europe and the probable despair of the Polish women in the homeland, Mrs. Sakowska closed her address with the following words: "No less work falls to us women than to the men. Our duty is no smaller than theirs. A Polish woman should and must work with complete self-sacrifice during these times. She must collect contributions and convince others of the necessity of collecting contributions, because over there in the homeland poverty and hunger knock at the doors of our sisters' cottages. Wishing the Society the greatest possible development, I ask you to remember always wherever you are that Poland awaits your help."</p>
   <p>Next Mr. J.S. Zawilinski, secretary general of the P.N.A. and a founder of this group, gave a short address which we print below in as accurate a summary as possible.</p>
   <p>"Dear countrymen and colleagues," spoke Mr. Zawilinski. "Fifteen years have passed since a group of young Poles organized themselves into a society to express their love for the homeland, to give up some of their time to patriotic work and the service of the nation. Understanding full well that only united effort could bring appreciable results to the homeland as well as to the nation, we joined the ranks of the national and patriotic organization, the Polish National Alliance, and began work under its banner. We adhered absolutely to its aims and recognized how deserving was the cause of aiding Polish immigrants.</p>
   <p>"We have gone through all sorts of things in our socio-nationalistic life, working at expanding our ranks and taking an active interest in all matters vital to our organization. We have always considered its development and have always followed the example and suggestion of the Polish National Alliance, which we have learned to love with all our hearts.</p>
   <p>"Today, when we look back upon the fifteen years of our labor, we can justifiably say that, if we have not accomplished as much as we should have, nevertheless, our work has been worthwhile both for the Polish National Alliance and for our immigrants. They have been enlightened concerning matters of nationalism and politics and their young people have been organized. Every matter that the Alliance has taken up has always found a response in the hearts of our members, who offered their services liberally to every cause sanctioned by the board of directors of the Alliance. It is true that circumstances were to our advantage. We had no room for all sorts of demagogues in our group and upon those few occasions when a demagogue appeared the majority of the members at the meeting, in short order, settled him once and for all.</p>
   <p>"I have every reason to believe that our group will continue to go along this path, faithful to the homeland and the nation, faithful to the Polish National Alliance. Every good cause will always find willing workers in our midst.</p>
   <p>"Today, dear colleagues, on the threshold of a better lot for our homeland and nation we have the opportunity of showing our patriotism and devotion. The Polish National Alliance, in executing its political and national aims, has created within its organization the Department of Independence, whose aim is to bring help to our homeland, Poland, by collecting money. This money will be sent to the national government in the homeland for the needs of the country.</p>
   
   <p>"A great moment is at hand and it is time that we prepare for it. Our homeland asks us for our lives and our goods. We must not shirk this greatest duty, if we do not want to deserve the name of degenerate children of our mother. We, here in the free land of our adopted country, because of the political stand of this country, cannot offer our lives and blood. One alternative remains to us, to give financial aid. Our nation on Polish soil, impoverished to the farthest limits, will need financial aid. To whom should it look if not to its brothers and sisters, who find themselves in better material circumstances and with more liberty? Let us picture the present conditions in Polish areas at the time of this monstrous war of nations. The tragedy of the Polish nation is that through unfortunate circumstances she is forced to send the flower of her manhood into three enemy armies fighting each other, and one Pole is forced to kill another Pole! Every other house is in mourning: everywhere some beloved person or provider is missing, and there is grief, despair and hunger.</p>
   
   <p>"We, here in a free land, will not turn a deaf ear to the cries of widows and orphans. Our group will hasten with financial aid not only to provide bread for our people, but to break the bonds of servitude of our mother country."</p>
   <p>After Miss Aniela Nowakowska's reading, Mr. Michael Kmieciak, director of the P.N.A., known for his work in the Department of Independence, spoke in lofty words, emphasizing that even today, at a time joyful for the Society, we must not forget about those whose blood is covering the fields and those left at home who are suffering hunger and privation. He called for a collection for the Independence Fund.</p>
   <p>"Remember," ended Mr. Kmieciak, "that we must not forget for a moment what is happening in the homeland. Since it was not granted us to sacrifice our lives on the altar of the homeland, let us make a smaller offering, that of money, with the faith and deep conviction that we are not doing a favor, but doing our duty."</p>
   
   <p>Mr. S. Orpiszewski, editor of Zgoda, called upon to say a few words, congratulated the Society and then, summarizing the difficult moments in the Society's life when it was still small and poor, exhorted it toward further efforts for the nation's reconstruction. Next, Mr. Szymanski, director of the P.N.A., sang "Welcome and Live", written expecially for this occasion.</p>
   <p>The last speech was delivered by Mr. Singer. Having expressed his gratitude again for the gift, he promised that he would continue to work at his post as he had in the past, not emulating those who do nothing but criticize the whole immigrant community.</p>
   <p>"I thank you dear sisters and brothers," president Singer closed, "for coming, for honoring us with your presence. I thank you for the kind words with which you have referred to the Society and the work of its members. I offer my thanks to the gentlemen of the press and especially those of the Alliance press, for seeing to it that almost all of the Alliance members knew about this anniversary."</p>
   
   <p>After singing "Poland Is Not Lost" the guests continued to enjoy themselves for several hours.</p>
   <p>A charming souvenir of the pleasant evening spent at this anniversary is the one-issue paper edited by Mr. Nowak, which was given to all the participants in this celebration.</p>
