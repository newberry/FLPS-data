   <p>A few years prior to the recent United States census, the Slavs living in this country, especially Poles, began a very energetic campaign the object of which was to persuade the United States to recognize officially minor Slavic nations as political units. This campaign has not resulted in recognition of Poland by the United States, but Congress has passed a law authorizing a census according to the native language, which will make possible to determine the nationality of a person by the tongue he or she speaks.</p>
   <p>The United States has recognized officially such countries as: Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Finland, Luxemburg and so on; but Poland, Lithuania, Ruthemia, Bohemia, and their sister nations were not accorded this honor.</p>
   <p>We will disregard the recognition of the Slavic states because at present we are interested in a just and impartial census of the Slavic races in the United States. Whether this census will bring about the desired result we shall see.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At the proper time the Polish press has encouraged the educated Poles to take examinations for census clerks and enumerators, of which there were over seventy thousand. These examinations were so ridiculously simple that any Pole, residing over a period of five years in this country, could easily pass them and get 80%. Notwithstanding the extreme simplicity of these examinations, the outcome was that only two Poles received positions as census clerks, whereas, three thousand people are employed by the Census Bureau. Four hundred of these are Jews, who, besides clerical positions, hold other jobs, such as those of experts and supervisors.</p>
   <p>We do not know the exact number of Poles employed as census enumerators, but, at all events, that number does not exceed a hundred, though there are seventy thousand census enumerators in the field.</p>
   <p>The census blanks filled by the enumerators indicate that: (a) A large percentage of them did not understand the instructions given to them by the Census Bureau, and neglected to fill the special column indicating the native tongue of the foreigners. (b) That the majority of the enumerators were very simple minded people, without any ethnological knowledge <span class="page-break">\3</span>concerning other races. These enumerators entered persons born in Russia as Russians, in Germany as Germans, in Austria as Austrians, and so on. (c) One of the groups of enumerators consisted of Germans, and they entered every Pole who was born in Germany as German, unless some one insisted that he is a Pole; then he was registered as such.</p>
   <p>If we take these three kinds of enumerators into consideration, we will come to the conclusion that the Poles are losers in number. To correct this, the Census Bureau has established an editorial department consisting of two hundred people, who were supposed to correct the errors in the column indicating the native language of the person. But here, instead of a correction, there was a regular elimination of Poles and Slavs in general. The Census Bureau did what was possible by furnishing the editors with rules and regulations in making corrections. Those rules and regulations were supported by philological and rational evidence, but unfortunately this evidence has been produced by Jews and Germans, who made a person German if this person was born in Germany and the name had a Tentonic sound; but if the name was purely Polish the person was entered as such. If the native tongue of a person born in Russia or Austria was <span class="page-break">\4</span>not entered in the language column, then such a person was left unclassified or was classified as Jewish. If a recorded person spoke Jewish, while its parents spoke Polish, then the parents were made Jewish. But this is not all, for, if it happened that a Jew roomed or boarded with a Polish family, then the entire family was recorded as Jewish. This system was also followed reversely, that is, if a Pole happened to live with a Jewish family, he was registered as a Jew. The author of this article, during his travels throughout America, has observed the fact that many Poles were boarding with Jewish families. Those Poles were registered as Jews. One particular locality was inhabited chiefly by Ruthenians born in Galicia (a province of Austria) and as they belong to the Greek Catholic Church they were classified as Greeks.</p>
   <p>Our Polish-American politicians may form their opinions, as to how accurate are the figures gathered by the Census, Bureau, after reading these remarks, and they should also notice how we are counted, ignored, and unjustly treated.</p>
   <p>Now, who is responsible for our helplessness and neglectfulness in public matters? The fault is ours. Instead of accusing the chauvinists of discrimination against us, let us admit that we are negligent. The opportunity is there, it is ours, so let us take advantage of it.</p>
