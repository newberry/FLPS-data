   <p>We had an opportunity several times to bring to our readers news about the special Americanization organizations existing in the United States, which have branches in New York City. These units are primarily foreign language information bureaus. Their functions are to carry out programs of Americanization amidst the particular nationalistic groups represented. The apparent source for the upkeep of these foreign language departments expressively reveals that the process of Americanization, that is, the Americanization of immigrants is carried out in an entirely different way from that of the American public, together with its numerous societies. For these bureaus speak to the immigrants in their native tongue--not in English--honestly deeming that the immigrant has a better understanding of the topics in question.</p>
   <p>But not only is the outward form of activity different. There is also a difference in substance. While the average so-called Americanizers begin <span class="page-break">\2</span>to speak in English to the immigrants on the terms of "America First and Last." The above mentioned bureaus teach in their native tongue what America is, what kind of useful institutions she possesses, what is found in this country--in one word, acquainting them thoroughly with the fundamental knowledge of the land in which they make their new home. No wonder then that such Americanization is not supported in the main by anyone, for it is difficult to offer support when principally they perform a more useful task, carrying out a wide field of activities in general education and information, to which the immigrant cannot be indifferent, especially when such activity is lacking within his group.</p>
   <p>The method of action in solving these problems differs more, for, while the so-called Americanizers do not care about the nationalistic feeling, the above mentioned bureaus make an effort to retain the prevailing feeling for the longest possible time. Such an example was cited recently by Dr. Edward A. Steiner in a speech based on the theme of the title of this article at a reception of one of these departments.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"The problem among the nationalities," said Dr. Steiner, "is greater today than the international problem. Class prejudice [both]racial and religious, are in the long run the greatest of the incurable social illnesses. And there are other causes which retard the process of reaching social harmony. One of these reasons is the fact that the proper social development depends upon culture and flows out of the soul of the individual, whereas the economic development of our country is rooted in the ground and rather fixes a certain phase of our civilization, and not culture alone."</p>
   <p>Civilization, at least modern civilization, is plainly mercenary. Dividends are instantly given, products are obtained at certain rates....on credit. Culture, however, is not found on the exchange. This, in contrast to civilization, brings immediate losses. This does not mean that it does not pay for itself; on the contrary, it pays but not in cash money. Culture is imbedded in the past. Therefore, we are directing our social conditions by devised words, whose negative significance we raise by prejudice, and we are <span class="page-break">\4</span>resolutely stepping away from the road that leads toward social harmony. Such terms as "nigger," "dago" and "hunky" immediately darken our brain and bar the way for respectful thought to such an extent that one could not close the doors of his home better with a Yale lock against burglars. The saying, "One hundred per cent American," also becomes malignant and harmful just as the German "Deutschland ueber alles" (Germany above all). The expression "Nordic" is another of these thought-up terms which helps to have an excuse for everything, but it does not explain anything.</p>
   <p>An interpreter or translator of such words has a difficult task to fulfill. He must remove prejudice from them, tear himself away from small egoisms, reach to the very depth of these words and present them in their true sense. This task is not simple amidst our variety of nationalities. However, it is necessary if we truly desire to have the development of our social life advance along with our material advancement. This does not actually mean that we should flatter the immigrants and their offspring. An immigrant does not need any flattery but only respectful consideration. From the standpoint of philo-Semitism, one is just as bad off [by professing] <span class="page-break">\5</span>anti-Semitism. The immigrant does not bring along [traits]of the highest quality, at the same time everything pertaining to him is not made up of odds and ends and refuse which he finds. He also has his prejudices and looks after his own interest under the influx of these words. Just as the American public looks upon the immigrant as raw material, the immigrant looks upon this public as if it were decayed.</p>
   <p>The problem of solving these important differences demands the obliteration of the agitation and waste of the cultural talents of the immigrants, which they brought along, and simultaneously prove that the zenith of culture rests on one thought, although it is variously manifested. It would be desirous to see here the blooming of Jewish culture because upon its summit are found Hebraic prophets and not parvenus. The same desire is expressed for the fruits of the Catholic culture of the saints and its development in this country. The Hebrew prophets and the Catholic saints are not opposed to American culture anymore then Goethe and Pushkin, or Dante and Sophocles are. There is no concern about any particular culture. However, there is great concern about materialism--the greatest enemy of culture.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>There is also concern about Jewish materialism, for without dreams the people are condemned to extermination.</p>
   <p>This staff is convinced that our political institutions are completely safe and only by dishonesty does danger threaten them, for here lie the inabilities that lead to downfall. It is further accepted that our biological future is greatly endangered by a loose life than by a mixing. A prediction is made that within a proportionally short time the various racial groups will permit themselves to be drawn into one cultural unit, and this will give us Americans. The public schools, the press, common feeling in literature, and future conquests in this field, our political institutions and homes, our knowledge of international and national affairs will bring about this cultural coherence. What the immigrant brings with him will have a lesser influence on the development of this culture than that which he finds here, depending upon what cultural center he is going to fall into. In view of this, this department is not going to condemn this to any extent nor predict its ruin, unless there is a desire to remain erudite Calvinists, believing in predestination and in the coming <span class="page-break">\7</span>of salvation from the "Nordics" and from the condemnation of others. Heredity will play an important role and the blood will come to the fore, although it is not certain today what role it's going to take or play; but biological experimentation will not be able to strike us with awe.</p>
   <p>One thing is certain today, primarily, that is, it is too late to lament and too early to say anything about the disappearance of a great race for the great race is yet to come. The combined will of the people is in a position to appease the hereditary hindrances. There is no concern about the race because there is something more than a biological formula or common flesh that can be subjected to measurements, for man has a soul.</p>
   <p>The people must rise above all biological learning and create conditions in which the singular life of the individual will become richer, in which personality and not fortune or possession will be a measure of merit in activity, and in which, finally, everyone of us will be wholly himself and in this way enrich the whole. Such conditions are already existing not only <span class="page-break">\8</span>in the hearts and thoughts of people of good will but also in the homes, schools, churches, communities and even in industry. Only the blossoming into full growth is necessary and in addition to this the proper understanding and sympathy of these appeals is required.</p>
   <p>It is judged that relative to such a conception of Americanization none of the immigrants will be opposed for it assumes respect for both sides and only desires that all Americanizers would follow this road.</p>
