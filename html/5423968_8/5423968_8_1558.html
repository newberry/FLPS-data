   <p>A patriotic manifestation commemorating the November insurrection of the Poles against Russia in 1830 was held last night at the Holy Trinity Parish Hall through the efforts of all parish societies. The affair was opened by S. Terczewski, who called upon S. F. Adalia Satalecki and J. J. Chrzanowski to act as chairman and recording secretary respectively.</p>
   <p>Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, pastor, who delivered the first address, urged work and sacrifice for Poland. A historical speech was given by I. Machnikowski. Other speakers were T. Rudzinski, Mrs. Kadis, and Anthony Stefanowicz, who spoke in Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>Declamations were made by Casimir Adamowski, Miss P. Sniegocka, and A. Lisztewnik. A piano solo was rendered by Mrs. Lande. Solos were sung by Miss A. Wojtalewicz and Mr. Gatkowski. Songs were also given by the Chopin and Wanda Choirs.</p>
   <p>At the close of the exercise a collection which netted $37.15 was taken for the Holy Trinity School. One fourth of this sum was turned over to the Rapperschwil Fund.</p>
   <p>Upon a motion made by John F. Smulski, it was agreed to send a letter of thanks to Dr. Lewakowski for his stand at the Austrian parliament in Vienna in behalf of the Poles. In this respect a committee composed of Reverend C. Sztuczko, J.F. Smulski, and E. Z. Brodowski was chosen to take care of the matter.</p>
