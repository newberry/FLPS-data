   <p>Day before yesterday [December 14, 1910], Dziennik Zwiazkowy published the report of a commission consisting of members of the present administration of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. In order to show this newspaper's impartiality, we present here a statement submitted by L. Szopinski, former president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>We [Dziennik Zwiazkowy] neither defend nor attack anyone. Considering, however, the importance of the matter in question and the notoriety it has gained, we feel that it is only proper to present the viewpoints of all persons involved, so that the public itself may draw its own conclusions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Szopinski's statement is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Editor: In the name of impartiality, I ask that you publish the <span class="page-break">\2</span>following reply to attacks and calumnies directed against me as a result of Theodore Ostrowski's fraudulent practices as treasurer of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>"In the first place, it is a fact that Ostrowski, as treasurer of the organization, admitted the fraud. He estimated that he had taken about $85,000 from the Union's treasury, and that he had used this money for his personal and business expenses.</p>
   <p>"Subsequent to this admission, Ostrowski stated that to cover the shortage he was signing over his property and securities to a third person for the benefit of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>"It is not for me to judge whether or not the shortage is adequately covered. But when a person, upon being found to have misused funds entrusted to him, covers the shortage partly or in full in order to escape prosecution, it is hardly sufficient reason to praise him.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"If the fraud was verified and Ostrowski admitted his guilt, an investigating committee appointed by the present administration to clarify the matter, for the time being at least, ought to refrain from expressing its personal sympathy for Ostrowski. Instead, it should demand that Ostrowski explain when and in what amounts he took the money, and how he kept his manipulations secret. His son-in-law, W. Czaja, who was his secretary and who had charge of all his building accounts, might be able to assist him in this; however, Ostrowski himself, who has been a well-known contractor for many years, is not so incapable that he cannot give a clear account of his manipulations.</p>
   <p>"The checking of accounts, especially when a treasurer has committed fraud, and has covered it in a manner known only to himself, might present difficulties to anyone. But because Ostrowski was such a treasurer, and because he kept his fraudulent practices skillfully concealed, he cannot now pretend stupidity; he must show clearly how he was able to misappropriate a sum as large as $85,000 and successfully keep his operations hidden.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"There can be no concessions on his behalf under the circumstances, even if others were involved in the manipulations with him. But even if such is the case, no one else but Ostrowski himself should name the persons and the amounts they received, in order that they should share with him both morally and materially the responsibility for the fraud.</p>
   <p>"If, however, the above-mentioned investigating committee, chosen from among the present administration and all personal friends of Ostrowski, speaks in its first report of "the deficit from past years and the inaccuracy with which accounts were conducted", then it is clear that the committee is merely pointing the way by which Ostrowski can lie himself out of his fraud. These tactics will not lead to the desired end.</p>
   <p>"I might have spoken of this "deficit" ten years ago when I took office in a Union that was completely shattered, burdened with debts, without funds; and with an exceedingly small membership. But when, with my colleagues, I turned the administration over to [S.] Adamkiewicz, I transferred to him assets <span class="page-break">\5</span>amounting to more than a half-million dollars, and a membership list of 40,000. Everything was properly recorded, as can be verified from the report of the auditing committee of the last convention.</p>
   <p>"Neither I nor anyone else, except Ostrowski, have had to make any explanations to this committee or to the convention; and he inspired such confidence that he was unanimously elected for the fifth or sixth time, I think, and if the readers will recall that before and during the convention Ostrowski, together with the Reverend Wojtalewicz and others, created a strong clique to oppose my re-election, and that he dragged out everything possible against me, then it is clear that he and his friends would have certainly made known every dollar I had taken from the treasury dishonestly.</p>
   <p>"As a matter of fact, it is clear today that he had personal reasons for wanting to remove me. During my administration it was very unhandy for him when I insisted most strictly that the treasurer deposit all money collected during the course of the day to the Union's account in the bank; to make certain that <span class="page-break">\6</span>this was done, I arranged that the bank make daily reports showing how much money was actually deposited by the treasurer. This control was very inconvenient for him and his associates.</p>
   <p>"Another point which aroused Ostrowski's anger and indignation against me concerned the sum of ten to fifteen thousand dollars which, according to the statutes of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Ostrowski as treasurer could administer himself. I demanded that he place additional security in the hands of the Secretary General, and he was forced to do so, by giving notes and other valuable papers.</p>
   <p>"During my administration, Ostrowski was very cautious and always produced the necessary cash upon my demands. It may be that he used it for his own business from time to time, but at any rate he always had it on hand for financial reports. Then, too, I never had any real foundation for suspicions. Ostrowski was considered a very wealthy man; his credit was good and he was generally respected.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>"After making his explanations to the auditing committee and to the convention, Ostrowski explained himself also to a committee of the new administration when it took office. By order of the administration, this committee consisted of President Adamkiewicz, Secretary General Budzban [no initials given], Chairman of the Board of Directors [J.] Czekala, and the Union's legal advisor, N. L. Plotrowski. Everyone knows well that this committee, composed of people antagonistically inclined toward me, would have gladly brought out any item that would justify the bitter and unfounded attacks that were made against me at the convention in Cleveland. And so, if Ostrowski's accounting before this committee left his "virtue untarnished" and did not awaken even the slightest suspicion, and if, as he claims today, there was a deficit in the treasury accounts, then it is clear that he has skillfully and cunningly led into error these who are defending him at the present time.</p>
   <p>"The above-mentioned committee's claim, that the incumbent administration did not dare to accuse the veteran treasurer of a shortage, is simply a case of pulling wool over the public's eyes in order to save their good friend, for at <span class="page-break">\8</span>the time when the accounts and funds were turned over to the new administration, there was no question of suspicions or accusations, but simply of ascertaining the true state of affairs. This was the sacred duty of Adamkiewicz and his colleagues of the new administration.</p>
   <p>"Instead of calling Ostrowski to account point by point, using the last balance as a basis, the new administration contented itself with examination of Ostrowski's application for a surety bond, in which he stated that all accounts were in proper order and that not a cent was lacking.</p>
   <p>"In giving such a detailed report on the basis of the last balance, Ostrowski know how he stood and could see before his eyes the sum that was missing from the treasury; had there been a shortage through the previous administration's fault, he could have said so boldly then, without waiting a year and two months. But this is exactly what he could not do, for he know that the balance was correct except for the fact that there was no money in his treasury, since he had taken it illegally and used it for private purposes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>"In order to cover the obvious fraud, he cultivated the acquaintance of the influential members of the new administration, and by turning their attention away from his own malpractices, he cunningly brought about an investigation of my own activities and those of the secretary general.</p>
   <p>"They hired a professional accountant a month after the convention and paid him $250, but this expert had Ostrowski and his friends as advisors, so he failed to discover the sad truth, that is, Ostrowski's fraud.</p>
   <p>"As far as I am concerned, I think it is clear that as president I had nothing to be with the treasury.</p>
   <p>"At any rate, if the new administration adhered so closely to the letter of the contract with the bonding company, then, of course, the bonding company must cover Ostrowski's shortage. The company supplies a $40,000 bond, while at the convention in Cleveland Ostrowski claimed that his deficit amounted to about $40,000. How, then, and under whose administration did Ostrowski defraud <span class="page-break">\10</span>the organization of an additional $45,000, for his total embezzlement is supposed to be more than $85,000? Why is Ostrowski as well as the new administration so completely silent on this important detail?</p>
   <p>"But the responsibility for this falls entirely upon Adamkiewicz and his associates. I had no influence on their decisions in this matter, except that on retiring from office I called the new administration's attention to the importance of Ostrowski's surety bond application and advised them to file a copy of it with the Union's records, since it forms a part of the contract with the bonding company concerning the bond covering Ostrowski.</p>
   <p>"If a commission were to investigate thoroughly all of Ostrowski's malpractices, it certainly should not be the one chosen by the new administration at its last meeting, for neither the incumbent president, Adamkiewicz, nor any member of either this or the previous administration should be part of it, for the simple reason that the decisions and activities of the present administration must also be carefully investigated. Only an impartial committee or a special convention <span class="page-break">\11</span>can properly settle this matter.</p>
   <p>"As far as I am concerned, I willingly submit to investigation by the courts, the convention, and any group of respectable people who can guarantee an impartial settlement of the whole affair. To the calumnies heaped upon me by him, who himself admitted the fraud, and by those who want to clear him at my own and the Union's expense by making a martyr of him, I will not reply; I do not know how to fight with such weapons. Let them say and write what they will, and if they are really so certain of their position, let them take the case to court, and there prove that Ostrowski is really a martyr, an innocent lamb.</p>
   <p>"Leon Szopinski,</p>
   <p>"former president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union"</p>
