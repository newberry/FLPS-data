   <p>One of the many factors in the dissolute life of some of our girls is their frequenting of fortune tellers, who now are reaping a real harvest. The girls are earning well and everyone wants to know about their future.</p>
   <p>Probation officers say that as a result of fortune tellers already more than one girl has lost her innocence. Do you, mothers, know that your daughters are going to fortune tellers? Do they speak to you about that?</p>
   <p>Probation officer Litta Stiles of Milwaukee said that the fortune tellers are charging factory girls 25 cents or more for foretelling their future. Some of the girls have heeded the fortune teller strictly, conformed themselves to her prediction and have gone off on an evil path. Miss Stilles (sic) made known that one girl, whom the court turned over to her guardianship, went to a fortune teller and was told that she should run away from home. The fortune teller said that if she would run away from home,"good fortune" would meet her, because she would meet a young, handsome, and rich man and be "very happy." Just as soon as the girl prepared herself to run away, she was caught and found herself in a jail for juveniles.</p>
   <p>To another girls the fortune teller predicted that her mother would die. The girl became so frightened she became sick and had to remain in bed for a few weeks.</p>
   <p>Two young girls, Irene and Mary, on the advice of a fortune teller, began to look for boys on the streets. They met some boys and admitted that they did not even know them, but acted on the fortune teller's advice. The fortune teller told them that in the future she would tell them more if they would only bring more customers to her.</p>
   <p>Evil is making greater inroads right along. We are warning the parents ahead of time, to guard their daughters carefully, and their sons as well, who allow themselves all kinds of extravagances.</p>
   
   <p>Our old Polish proverb proves itself here: "On a bent tree even goats jump." This Gypsy contagion is not held by Germans or the English; neither do the Americans keep it, only we, the Poles. We allow any "chiseler" to take over hard-earned money. It is not much to wonder at minors or inexperienced older girls. It is right to wonder at. older people, influential, community leaders, creators of laws for the regulation of social relations.</p>
   <p>There is no lack of Polish citizens in higher offices. Instead of watching children, whom you can never look after altogether, it is proper to call the attention of those influential citizens to the vice dens, and make a plea with them to remove them.</p>
   <p>If you will properly present to the authorities the activities of the fortune tellers, they will have to seek another work.</p>
