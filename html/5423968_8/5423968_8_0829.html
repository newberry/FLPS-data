   <p>The excursion to Poland, arranged for the school youth by the educational department of the Polish National Alliance (P. N. A.) and scheduled for July 2, 1931, is arousing a well-deserved interest. This fact is particularly emphasized by the great number of inquiries concerning this excursion, received from all over the United States. People request further information about this undertaking.</p>
   <p>To begin with: parents wish to know whether children are permitted to travel with this excursion alone, or whether they must be accompanied by their parents; and if permitted to travel alone, whether they will be given suitable and sufficient tutelage, on the journey as well as in Poland. In answer to these questions the P. N. A. educational department assures all, that ample provisions have been made for the safety and welfare of the children.</p>
   <p>Accredited, trustworthy leaders, have been chosen to care for the boys, and the girls will be under the careful guidance and direction of capable chaperons. A delegate of the P. N. A. Executive Board will also be present.</p>

   <p>However, may we remind you, that only youths above fifteen years of age, of either sex may travel alone; while children below that age must be accompanied by parents or be under the guardianship of an older person.</p>
   <p>The educational department has, with the able assistance of the consulates, been assured by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Warsaw [Warszawa] that all necessary facilities will be granted while en route to Gdynia, whence they will continue under the careful guidance of the Polish Immigration Board. This excursion will be of tremendous educational importance to the Polish Youth born in this country who will have an opportunity not only to become acquainted with Poland, but to come in contact with her unusually rich culture, so far removed from the American. He will behold the thousands of historical memorials, so precious to every Pole so Poland is really one great museum; for there is not a span of soil, which has not played some role in her history. This excursion will be an object lesson which will imbue our young people with a consciousness that will make them proud of their Mother-land, and her past, which may well be envied by all foreign nations.</p>

   <p>The tour through Poland includes the larger cities and such other places, as have played a prominent part in the history of our country. Ample time will be allowed in each of the cities to give the visitors and opportunity to observe everything. Included in the list of cities and places not to be overlooked are: Wieliczka, Czenstochowa and Zakopane. Briefly speaking, the youth will see all of Poland, in its length and breadth.</p>
   <p>This vacation will be a turning point in the lives of our youth and will mark pages in his book of memories; set them to thinking constructively regarding views and opinions of national import; the horizon of their views will be broadened and their prejudices to everything that is Polish will vanish.</p>
   <p>The P. N. A. Educational Department, with the advantages and benefits of the excursion in mind, has taken steps to lessen the cost of this delightful and advantageous excursion to the minimum, so that the largest number possible might participate.</p>
