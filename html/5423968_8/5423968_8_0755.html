   <p>The administration of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union sent on the 5th day of February, 1917, the following telegram to President Wilson:</p>
   <p>Woodrow Wilson</p>
   <p>President of the United States</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>We heartily approve your action in severing diplomatic relations with Germany, whose methods in conducting the present war have undoubtedly absorbed all patience and good will of the American public.</p>
   <p>We wish to assure you, hereby, of our loyal support in this impending crisis, and promise faithfully to firmly stand by you, and if necessary, we will do everything possible to help defend the honor and dignity of the Old Glory.</p>
   <p>The Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America.</p>
   <p>P. Rostenkowski, President; J. S. Knopa, Secretary.</p>
