   <p>Monday September 7 at 8 P.M., Commune No. 2 of the Polish National Alliance held a nationalistic mass meeting at Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Lesner called the meeting to order and asked Mr. W. Szymanski to take over the chairmanship of the meeting and called upon the undersigned to act as secretary.</p>
   <p>In a few words, Mr. W. Szymanski explained to the assembled people the aim of the mass meeting and invited Mr. Zielinski, associate editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, to deliver the first address. Mr. Zielinski greeted the audience with the remark that if they continue to come to mass meetings in such "large" numbers as today, it will be evident that they do not care about winning the independence of Poland and rebuilding their homeland. Not the magnates but the plowman, he said, will reconstruct Poland--men who love the Polish soil with all their hearts and souls.</p>
   <p>The second speaker, Mr. S. Rokosz, asserted clearly and intelligibly that the Poles should work hard and should contribute their offerings to Poland's cause.</p>
   <p>The third speaker, Mr. S. Orpiszewski, editor of Alliance publications, pictured for the assemblage the horror of the present situation in our unfortunate homeland. He asked that all Poles should be cognizant of their duty to collect money--whatever anyone can afford to give--in order to help the mothers and children whose husbands and fathers are being killed in this horrible European war.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Miss Emily Napieralski, secretary general of the Polish Women's Alliance. She spoke from her heart with great feeling, calling upon both the young and the old to help the unfortunate homeland by offering money.</p>
   
   <p>If the need should arise, she said, the young people should sacrifice themselves and offer their very lives for beloved Poland. We should give up everything to free ourselves from the yoke of foreign oppressors.</p>
   <p>The last speaker, Mr. A. Gorecki, described the probable consequences of the present war and asserted that Poland must be freed because we shall have earned this freedom. Nevertheless we should be prepared, he reminded us, and our greatest merit would be our ability to collect millions of dollars for Poland's reconstruction.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. W. Szymanski announced that the collection at this meeting had yielded $29. He thanked the speakers for their trouble. The audience indicated by its quiet behavior its appreciation of the importance of the times.</p>
   <p>To close the meeting "God Save Poland" was sung.</p>
   
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>(Signed) A. Dobrzanski</p>
