   <p>In view of the remarks which have been purposely and maliciously circulated and which have now been going on for quite some time to the effect that the Polish National Alliance has betrayed the fundamental postulates of a free and independent Poland, as set forth in its constitution, I consider it my duty to come forth in this matter and prove that the Polish National Alliance not only has not retreated even for a moment from its aims and purposes, but has faithfully and persistently continued, in accordance with its fundamental precepts, in the direction of a united, free, and independent Poland. The ferment which some people are trying to introduce into the ranks of the Alliance is an artificial product, or rather a terroristic method designed to hurl the Alliance from the pinnacle of its nationalistic activities to the role of an ordinary stepchild.</p>
   <p>As I have stated before, we are living in a time of such extraordinary historical <span class="page-break">\2</span>upheavals that a strong head and tremendous courage of spirit are necessary in the face of the continuous promises of our enemies--which are always calculated to be to our disadvantage--in order to avoid the mental whirl which leads to grave mistakes.</p>
   <p>Those who have been chosen by the members of the Alliance to head our organization have scrupulously adhered to this principle. But the bad will of some, the opposition of others, the underestimation of the importance of the moment of still others, and, what is worse, the desire on the part of some individuals to order the interests of the whole organization in the light of their own personal convictions, have split our immigrants into enemy camps, and the Polish National Alliance has been drawn into the vortex.</p>
   <p>The twenty-first convention in Schenectady clearly established the political policies of the Alliance when it passed a resolution creating a special <span class="page-break">\3</span>commission to exercise control over the national funds. It placed the control and division of the national funds into the hands of this commission with complete confidence. The entire work of both the Central Board of Directors and the various commissions and departments of the Alliance has been based on these decrees and recommendations. Besides this, the convention accepted the union of the Polish National Alliance with other organizations [in order to] form the Central Polish Relief Committee, which in view of the development of affairs in Europe, felt itself obliged to take up political as well as relief work.</p>
   <p>It was then that those who have always been inimically disposed toward the Alliance took up the cry of protest, prohibiting the Alliance from working for Poland--from working for the restoration of freedom to our dissected homeland.</p>
   <p>The Central Board of Directors could not heed this protest. It did not want to and could not betray the fundamental postulates of the Alliance and the <span class="page-break">\4</span>mettoes of the founding fathers of our organization. Adhering to the great ideal of a free, independent, and united Poland, it did everything which should have been done according to its power and possibilities, in the strong belief that this course and not another should be pursued.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, those who would like to see the Polish National Alliance become merely an insurance company, have exploited every little detail and practically every private statement which had been voiced. They have twisted these around to suit their needs, changing the sense and meaning, and have used them as a basis for hurling trumped-up charges of national betrayal.</p>
   <p>The meaning of the well-known "protest to the civilized world" has been turned around. An attempt has been made to persuade the people that this is a protest against Poland, that it unites us with Russia by a fraternity of arms. They have tried not to see the real meaning of the protest which was aimed <span class="page-break">\5</span>at the German government, which wanted the Polish army even before the boundaries of Poland were established, before a Polish government was formed, before Polish authorities took office. They have tried not to see that the paragraph about the fraternity of arms did not refer to Russia but to the countries allied with her, namely, France and Italy; that this was and is a protest against all those who, accepting the idea of a Polish state, are willing to renounce their claims to Galicia, Silesia, East and West Prussia, and Poznan; that this was and is the collective voice of the Polish soul; that we will never yield our rights to all the Polish lands, the ancient abodes of our ancestors.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, this was the way in which the members of the Advisory Board of the Polish National Alliance, in the name of which I am now speaking, understood it--and this, after all, is the way it should be understood.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the editing of this article was a little obscure for those who look <span class="page-break">\6</span>for words and not for substance--but who, today, can guarantee that this firm and clear stand of the National Department did not influence the course of political events in the Kingdom [Translator's note: Section of Poland], which have now deviated greatly from the original intentions of the German government? Who can assert today that the courageous and determined stand of the Kingdom, which with civic understanding is now forming its own government and will not begin to think of an army until after this is accomplished, did not and does not continue to get inspiration and courage from just such a protest as this? Who today will dare assert that it was not just such a forceful reminder which made those who, in exchange for the decree of November 5 [Translator's note: A decree granting a tiny Polish state], were willing to renounce their claims in advance to the rest of the ancient Polish lands, turn from their course and slowly begin to remember something about a united Poland?</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, it is the people who are least qualified to do so who take it <span class="page-break">\7</span>upon themselves to pronounce judgment in these matters. Some of them maintain that the Polish National Alliance has betrayed the Polish cause, while others maintain that the Alliance should not concern itself at all with Polish political matters. Meanwhile both groups are wrong.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance, as an organization of the common Polish people who emigrated to America, has a wide sphere of nationalistic activity, which is clearly set forth in its constitution and approved by its conventions. The Polish National Alliance has never departed from these principles and never will, much less betray its national banner.</p>
   <p>Therefore, those brother Alliance members who have allowed themselves to be influenced by, and who are uncritically following, the protests of the fomenters are going astray. They are even trying to undermine the meaning and influence of the Polish National Alliance by demanding the convocation <span class="page-break">\8</span>of a special convention. They are trying, though perhaps unconsciously, to lead the Polish National Alliance from the heights of this activity into the vicious circle of selfish inactivity.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the Polish National Alliance does not expect inactivity from its members. In view of the importance of events and their changeability, whereby a theory which has been established today might show itself to be impractical tomorrow--it behooves us first to concentrate all our resources on relief activity and to aid those who are starving, and at the same time to believe that those to whom the wheel of the Alliance ship has been entrusted have no personal interest in doing mischief, but on the contrary that it is greatly to their advantage to perform their duties well.</p>
