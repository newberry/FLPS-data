   <p>The fight against the high cost of living has been started the wrong way by some Chicago women who, instead of fighting the speculators who buy directly from the farmers, yesterday destroyed a quantity of foodstuffs in a few grocery stores and meat markets as a protest against high prices.</p>
   <p>The Poles should abstain from taking part in activities of this kind. Why should we condemn the poor grocers and butchers for the fault of the speculators who demand exhorbitant prices? If the grocer himself pays high prices for his goods, how can one expect him to sell them cheap?</p>
   <p>There are women, however, who put all the blame for the high cost of living on the small businessmen. One of them yesterday went from butcher shop to butcher shop and poured kerosene over the meat. This, in her opinion, was the way to fight the high cost of living!</p>
   
   <p>As a result of this absurd crusade against high prices, the following meat markets were damaged: Jacob Drewno's, 2533 Division Street; Samuel Berkman's, 130 North Western Avenue; and Pawlowski Brothers', 1235 North Robey Street.</p>
   <p>Three women--M. Steinholz, 2043 West Division Street; S. Lanz, 2019 West Division Street; M. Podeno, 2034 West Division Street--were arrested by the police. Other women are being watched.</p>
