   <p>Anyone who accidentally finds himself in that branch of the Criminal Court headed by Judge John J. Sullivan, could irrefutably claim how indispensable is the need of the existence of a Polish Welfare Association, which some of our best citizens have in mind to organize.</p>
   <p>Sometimes the best Polish child, in bad environment, in back streets and in alleys, wanders off the straight and narrow path, on which his parents and society would like to have him travel. The children exposed to this danger are those of poor parents, who work hard for their livelihood. The mother is likewise forced to work, in order to add to the insufficient earnings of the father. Due to lack of some sort of organization to take care of minors, they are left, inexperienced, to fate and a prey to evil influences so easily Finding access in minds not yet developed.</p>

   <p>To the most burning needs of our society, particularly in larger cities, belongs the establishment of an association having as its aim the guardianship of minors, and to those, who have conceived the thought of establishing a Polish Welfare Association, belongs the most credit. Wholesome results of the activities of such a welfare association are being noticed among the Jewish society, and there is not the least bit of doubt today, that our social workers will found a no less great and no less worthy organization.</p>
   <p>As we have mentioned at the beginning of this article, five Polish youths appeared before Judge Sullivan's court. Two of them, having more well-to-do parents, had defenders. The defense of the other three youths was taken up on the recommendation of the Judge, absolutely without charge by the well known Polish lawyers, Judge Edmund K. Jarecki and Joseph Lasecki. The prosecutor was Assistant States Attorney, Charles Q. Wharton, the arm of the law was represented by John Philbin.</p>

   <p>These youngsters belonged to a well organized band of thieves - each of them from childhood had an infamous record. They also had fire arms in their possession, with which they were outfitted by one previously fined in a police court, Mr. Louis L. - living at 1134 North Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>The oldest of the accused, W. K - 1618 Haddon Avenue, is a youth twenty-one years of age. This is not the first time that he has become acquainted with the authorities. He already has appeared before the Juvenile Court and Boys' Court and has served out his fines in reform institutions. The second, an eighteen year old youth, Leon L. - 1650 West Division Street, has been incarcerated three times in the Cook County reform school. One only seventeen years old, Edward Z - 1758 North Talman Avenue, is a novice in this occupation, having no record. The parents of the boys were present at the trial, with the exception of those of Stephen K - , who was alone, his parents most likely having lost all faith in him.</p>

   <p>The accused broke into the meat market of Albert H - 1721 North Talman Avenue, where they stole meat valued at $620.00, breaking in through the rear door at 10:30 P:M. The father of Z - informed the authorities about the burglary. Besides that, on February 8th they stole from Edward P - 1948 Evergreen Avenue , an automobile as well as two others from unknown parties, one a Chevrolet which they sold for $2.00 and the other they sold for $1.10.</p>
   <p>Due to the eloquent presentation of defense represented so valiantly by Judge Jarecki and Attorney J. A. Lasecki, Judge Sullivan continued the case, with the intention of establishing a more detailed account of circumstances among which this punishable act was accomplished. The low price received for the stolen articles - a question so justifiably raised by the defense, allows the contention that pure criminal impulses did not exist in this case, but rather the influences of unruly and unbridled fantasy of youth, discerning bravado in violation of the law.</p>

   <p>These youths according to the claim of L - belonged to the Y. M. C. A., but such a useful organization could not have had any influence upon them because it does not take into consideration the ways of thinking of the child of a Polish emigrant, who, coming from a different environment - knows how to counterbalance its mind and return with ease to the straight and narrow path of honesty under the influence of its own countrymen. So that this example undoubtedly will arouse us to work so much harder for the establishment of a Polish Welfare Association.</p>
