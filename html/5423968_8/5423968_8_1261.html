   <p>On October 29, the second rally for the purpose of organizing a new group of the Polish National Alliance in the vicinity of the parishes of St. John Cantius and Holy Innocence was held at the hall of J. Bielat, 1209 West Chicago Avenue. M. Baca and Mr. Kilanowicz spoke at the rally, exhorting those present to join the ranks of the Polish National Alliance because it was the best and the biggest Polish organization and because every Pole should belong to it. In order to give the Polish people residing in this district the opportunity to insure themselves, at a very small fee, in the event of death or sickness, there will be one more rally at the same hall on Sunday, November 5, at 2 P. M. Everyone should, therefore, take advantage of this opportunity. You, young men, who do not as yet belong to any organization, and you who have wives and children, join us under the banner of the Polish National Alliance. You will then be sure that in the event of sickness, you will be assured help, and you will not have to ask anyone to take pity on you.</p>
