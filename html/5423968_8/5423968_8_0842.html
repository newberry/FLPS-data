   <p>[Translator's note: The Polish National Alliance publishes two newspapers, namely: a daily, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, and a weekly, Zgoda, both on the average of eight pages to each edition. The latter of the two publications, the Zgoda, being the official organ of the Polish National Alliance, a benevolent organization of about 300,000 members, contains, besides the regular organizational news, editorial articles, and correspondences, also a special section, devoted to the interest of the women members of the Polish National Alliance. It is from that section that today's article is taken to be translated. The article follows.]</p>
   <p>In the previous edition of Zgoda you, dear sisters, have read the report of how at the Christmas season the Polish National Alliance has been giving a helpful hand to the poor and needy Polish families through its welfare department in Chicago.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Now, let us reflect for a while and consider, if such benevolent, charitable activity could not be extended to other localities, wherever there are membership groups of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Everything can be accomplished where there is a good and strong will. Our P. N. Alliance women members are noted for their energy, for their love of good work, and for their noble hearts; hence I believe that taking up a new humanitarian activity will fully respond to the high qualities of their character. With that aim in view I submit below a concise narrative of the origin and development of our welfare department in Chicago, being deeply convinced that the reading of that short story will inspire our co-members in other localities to imitate the example of their Chicago Sisters.</p>
   <p>It is generally known that since some years ago the P. N. Alliance Women's Auxiliary is giving each year at the Christmas season certain donations to the needy and destitute Polish families, particularly donations in the form of baskets filled with eatables. That unquestionably beautiful custom of lessening the wants of the poor and needy families has been fully endorsed by <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mr. Jan Romaszkiewicz, the President of the Polish National Alliance, and by his initiative the scope of our charitable activities has been broadened by reorganizing the Women's Auxiliary into the welfare department. This in turn became representative of the P. N. Alliance' groups and of the Gminy, with the privilege to accept into membership also single persons, though not members of the Alliance. The financial start was opened with one dollar yearly fees on the part of each active member, and five dollars fees from the honorary members.</p>
   <p>Each one of the members endeavors to solicit for the cause even the smallest donations from friends and sympathizers, while other proceeds, turned into our charitable funds, are derived from different entertainments, plays, social amusements and the like.</p>
   <p>Though a wearisome work, it is not shunned by members of our welfare department, for they know that they are serving a good cause.</p>
   <p>In the first year of its active existence the funds of the welfare department were reaching the mark of over $2,000, while in the last fiscal year the receipts at our treasury were exceeding the mark of $5,000, making it possible <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>for the welfare department to give out a much more considerable help to the needy and to distribute during the past Christmastide over 1,200 baskets, the contents of which could easily be figured at a few dollars each. Besides, in the month of December alone there have been given out $350 in cash for relief. A detailed financial report for the past year will appear soon. It should be remarked in advance that we do not accumulate the money in the treasury, but we give it out for the designated purposes as soon as it is received.</p>
   <p>It is noticeable that lately the donations into the treasury of the welfare department are flowing rather abundantly, and we notice on the list of the donators not only names of different groups and Gminy of the P. N. Alliance, but also the names of many single persons from all walks of the Polish community, and even the names of our little Polish children. This plainly shows that our Polish community is fully appreciative of that beautiful humanitarian work done by the welfare department.</p>
   <p>It should not be passed with silence that all members of the above mentioned institution are performing their duties disinterestedly and that none of its <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>officers receives any remuneration for her services; nor does any auxiliary committee request the Board of Directors to pay any bills or accounts, which means that each committee is paying its own accounts with its own funds. Hence a dollar donated to the treasury of the Alliance's welfare department for the benefit of the poor is given to the poor in its entirety.</p>
   <p>The collecting of funds as well as performing other duties in that benevolent work is wearisom, difficult and at times even tedious, for before we give help to anyone, a special investigating committee is diligently investigating and carefully discerning if a given person deserves to be relieved, so that any possible abuses would be precluded. Yet there is not felt any shortage of willing workers, whose royal reward is in the inner satisfaction from the duty fulfilled.</p>
   <p>In the above related short sketches I have presented to you, dear sisters, the beginnings, the development and the activity of the welfare department of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>I cherish the hope that in your territory, in your locality, in your P. N. A. group it will be also possible to organize and establish a committee for <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>carrying out similar activities. Just think of it how many tears would be wiped off, it there would be a charitable committee in your neighborhood, and also a full network of such committees throughout the country!</p>
   <p>The beginnings are always and everywhere arduous. But whosoever has a strong will and faith, shall always reach the goal. Let us not measure the aims by our power, but our power by the aims, and then there will be found both the power and the workers to carry the project through.</p>
