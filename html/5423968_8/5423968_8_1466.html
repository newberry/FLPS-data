   <p>It is with great pleasure that one of our antagonistic newspapers publishes a resolution adopted by a certain society of the Polish National Alliance, for it is primarily aimed at the Dziennik Chicagoski. The resolution supports the idea of organizing the Dziennik Narodowy (Polish National Daily).</p>
   <p>This is nothing new. Many Polish newspapers have been devoting space to such a plan for a long time. We have said nothing of this because we greatly doubted that even a large organization would care to put much money in such a venture. We voice no opposition to organizing such a newspaper; however, regret is expressed for those who will lose by helping to finance such a paper. The Dziennik Chicagoski has withstood the competition of the Telegraf (Telegraph), Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily), and a second Telegraf. This paper can wish the new daily, in the event that it is published, all the <span class="page-break">\2</span>success in the world; for it will not interfere with the progress of the Dziennik Chicagoski. Experience permits us to make much a statement.</p>
   <p>We should like to say a few words about the resolution which was adopted primarily because of us. Various aspersions have been cast at this daily and we desire to answer them in a brotherly way, without anger or hatred.</p>
   <p>The resolution states that the Dziennik Chicagoski does not act in accordance with its platform, for "it does not take an unbiased point of view on all things".</p>
   <p>No, dear brothers, we do not look on all things in an unbiased way, but we do take an interest in everything in accordance with the principles that have been taught us by the kings, heroes, and teachers from times immemorial up to the present. We are not biased, dear brothers, but those are who have a distorted attitude toward our affairs, or those who have taken away the first two words from the immortal slogan "Faith and Fatherland," or those who wish to <span class="page-break">\3</span>change the banner to "Fatherland and God," claiming that patriotism has nothing to do with religion. This outlook is certainly biased; we take into account both sides, the religious and the patriotic.</p>
   <p>It is asserted that we have attacked the organization to which the society belongs and thereby have irritated their feelings of patriotism and nationalism.</p>
   <p>No, dear brothers, we have not attacked your organization, and we have always treated your members with the greatest respect. This is evidenced by the fact that many of them are our friends. But we are opposed to those who lead the organization along false roads, and who by their pronouncements confuse the general public. It is only natural that such tactics hurt our religious and patriotic feelings.</p>
   <p>We are accused of systematically confusing public opinion, of casting aspersions upon the Polish National Alliance, its governing board, various Polish institutions, and upon persons holding important positions in the Polish <span class="page-break">\4</span>public light, as well as upon those heroes who lost their lives in the Polish insurrections and in other wars of Polish history.</p>
   <p>No, dear brothers, we do not slander or calumniate anyone, but truth and facts are pointed out in order to show how the leaders of the above-mentioned organization have slandered Polish institutions, representative Polish individuals, the unfortunate insurrectionists (by arranging blasphemous services in the Independent National Church in their honor, as an insult to the forefathers of our heroes), Polish history (by a sacrilegious defamation of one of the greatest holy bishops and martyrs of Poland), etc.</p>
   <p>No, dear brothers, we do not behave in the way that you claim we do, but those that you wish to protect do behave that way. We do not attack and challenge, but protect Polish institutions, historical facts, and leading Polish citizens when they are attacked. To remain silent when, as a patriot, we can protect those assaulted, would be a national crime. Such crimes are committed by the accusers--those who are responsible for dividing the Poles with <span class="page-break">\5</span>some kind of independent Catholicism, or by those who close their eyes when it comes to defense.</p>
   <p>Do not read our daily newspaper, dear brothers, if you do not agree with its policies. We never made it a point to oppose your organization, but be honest, recall the facts, and support your periodical newspapers with the same beliefs and with the same patriotic and national feelings that they support. Under such conditions you will honestly admit that we have the same right to come to the fore for our religious and patriotic feelings and that we have the same right to express them clearly.</p>
