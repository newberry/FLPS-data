   <p>Although the main festivities to commemorate the Polish Constitution of the Third of May (1791), begin today and end tomorrow at Bradley Hall, the parishes held their own celebrations yesterday for their members. Last night's celebration at the new St. Stanilaus Kostka's hall was held for the members of this parish, and it served as an introduction to other celebrations which will take place at this hall.</p>
   <p>Last night's festivity however, deserves special attention. It brought us joy and, as it happens quite often, some sadness. Let us hope that the joyful moments will remain with us forever as pleasant memories and spiritual upliftment, and that the unpleasant ones will be obliterated from our minds and changed for the better.</p>
   
   <p>It was a beautiful Sunday morning of May, right after a gloomy Saturday, and the holiday spirit was everywhere. Even a stranger in a Polish neighborhood must have noticed that this was not a simple Sunday observance but some unusual national holiday. Almost all buildings were beautifully decorated, and thousands of flags, Polish and American, fluttered from the roofs and the windows. Large portraits of Polish patriots decorated the sides of many buildings and here and there one could see large portraits of George Washington, father of our country, with appropriate inscriptions. The streets were filled with people, almost everyone wearing some kind of medal, badge or tricolor ribbon indicating that he or she was a participant of the celebration.</p>
   <p>The Church of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, the interior of which was beautifully decorated with Polish and American flags and with all kind of national emblems so as to indicate that the church solemnities were connected with a great national holiday, was filled to capacity at every Mass. At 10 a.m. a High Mass was said in honor of the Fatherland. For this Mass the large temple of God could not accommodate the people who came to worship God. The great masses of the faithful raised their imploring voices to the Holy Virgin, mother of God, Queen of the Crown of Poland, asking her for the liberation of Poland. These devotional prayers and supplications filled the hearts of the faithful with holy joy and gave them assurance that a nation having such Queen still lives and has a future, even if at present it must experience great difficulties.</p>
   <p>Soon after the noon hour, the church yard and surrounding streets were filled with throngs of people, and the entire parish presented a picturesque sight. A very solemn vesper service was going to be celebrated in honor of church societies. The members of these organizations, dressed in their full regalia and with banners, formed themselves in lines ready to march into church. Here alone could anyone form an idea of the great number of the faithful belonging to this parish. Not only some non-members but also many members of the societies could not find a place in the church, as pews and aisles and all standing room were filled with people. The Knights of the Blessed Virgin, garbed in their picturesque uniforms, stood at the aisles. Societies could be distinguished by their uniforms or banners. Standard-bearers stood at both sides of the altar.</p>
   <p>During the vesper services, which began at 3 p.m., the Reverend Felix Zwiardowski, who came from Texas, delivered a patriotic sermon. After the sermon, a litany was sung to the Blessed Virgin of Loreto, to whom, as Queen of Poland, an appeal was made. The litany was followed by the blessing of the Holy Eucharist.</p>
   <p>The evening celebration began at 8 p.m. at the beautifully decorated Polish hall, and the entire program was adapted to the occasion.</p>
   <p>Quite often, especially in America, no attention is paid to the object of the commemoration; hardly or no mention is made in speeches of that which is commemorated. The subject is rather avoided or at best an attempt is made to connect the object of commemoration with a problem that has nothing to do with it. Some persons have no idea of what a commemoration is; they think that a program composed of a few numbers, including patriotic singing, constitutes a great commemorative celebration. We should discuss practical questions, especially those which can be applied to our immigration and those which point out how we may imitate - the examples of those whom we commemorate. We take for granted that at an occasion such as a commemoration, all speeches, theatrical plays, and songs should remind the participants of that which is commemorated.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's program was devoted entirely to the Polish Constitution of the Third of May declared in 1791.</p>
   <p>The speakers did their best to give an accurate description of this historical event. Reverend F. Szukalski, a priest from Beaver Dam, Wis., in his very interesting discourse based on historical facts, described how the Polish Constitution of the Third of May came into existence, explaining the causes of the sad partition of Poland. Mr. B. Klarkowski, the teacher, said in his enthusiastic talk that the constitution was accepted by the people because in spirit it is part of us. Reverend V. Barzynski read and explained the Constitution. Mr. Vincent Jozwiakowski, a young Pole, delivered a very enthusiastic speech to the young people, pointing out the great significance of the Polish Constitution and what they can learn from it. A variety of entertainment proper for the occasion was given between the speeches. A first-class orchestra played Polish compositions. This orchestra played at the Mass and will play again Tuesday at the solemn Mass to be officiated by the Archbishop of Chicago. Several members of the orchestra are Poles. Well-trained choirs, accompanied by the orchestra, sang Polish songs and compositions suitable for the occasion. One of the compositions was the "Hymn of the Third of May," specially composed for this occasion by the well-known poet Mr. S. Zachatkiewicz. The school choirs, composed approximately of eighty girls and fifty boys under Mr. A. Kwasigroch, parish organist, sang beautifully.</p>
   
   <p>It may be said that the celebrants paid close attention to the speeches, and enjoyed the musical selections a great deal. Miss Rose Kiolbassa, who delighted her listeners with her beautiful voice and displayed a great talent, was rewarded with great applause. Miss Kiolbassa distinguished herself at the choir by her clear alto voice. She was equally good at the piano and finally, to top it all, she won the hearts of the public with a superb recitation. Her success was so great that she was given applause and showered with flowers.</p>
   <p>This important and beautiful celebration was concluded with the singing of "God Save Poland."</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbasa, who was the chairman of the committee in charge of the celebration, shared the platform of the hall occupied by the clergy and the presidents of the societies.</p>
   <p>And now let us direct our attention to the sad lack of interest shown last night during the celebration. At occasions such as last night's, the large Polish hall can hardly accommodate those who wish to participate, yet last night the hall was half filled. It is true that the public behaved wonderfully, that they were enthusiastic, yet it was sad to see that the hall was only partly filled. Perhaps some were tired by the all day celebration in the morning and the afternoon; perhaps some prefer to attend the general celebration which will take place tomorrow; and perhaps to some the prices seemed too high.</p>
   <p>[The Polish Constitution was declared on May 3, 1791.</p>
   <p>"In this historical document Poland guaranteed to all Poles, regardless of class or rank, peasant or merchant, laymen or clergy, equality, freedom of conscience, and a share in the government. This Constitution was to be revised every twenty-five years. It was an ideal constitution, a forerunner of democracy, later used as a model by nations who deemed it necessary to perfect their government. Burke, Lafayette and Washington believed it to be the best of all known constitutions." From the book Poland and her People. Transl. note.]</p>
