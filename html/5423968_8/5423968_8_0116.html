   <p>Yesterday the case against Stanislaus Segers, publisher of the former Djabel (Devil) and the present Kropidlo (Sprinkler), was finally brought to trial before Judge Payne in the Criminal Court.</p>
   <p>Mr. Segers was accused of criminally slandering Andrew Kwasigroch, organist of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>As we know, this case was started last year immediately after Mr. Segers announced in his scandalous organ a sensational story about Mr. Kwasigroch. The article stated that Mr. Kwasigroch had murdered his maid and had been sentenced to three years imprisonment; that through the influence of Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, he had been given a lenient sentence. Naturally, the entire contents of the article was a lie.</p>
   <p>Consequently, A. Kwasigroch, desiring to put an end to the scandalous Djabel, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>now Kropidlo, entered suit against Mr. Segers for libel. The case went from one court to another until it reached the Criminal Court.</p>
   <p>The charges were brought forth before Judge Payne by Assistant District Attorney Todd.</p>
   <p>Attorneys for Mr. Kwasigroch were Max Drzemala [also Drezmal] and Davis. Mr. Seegers' attorneys were Max Kaczmarek and Geeting.</p>
   <p>To prove the charges in the case several witnesses, namely, Kwasniewski, Schultz, Klarkowski and Czekala, were questioned, and a copy of the Kropidlo [sic] was also introduced as evidence. The proceedings lasted two days.</p>
   <p>Attornies for the defense contended that the article in the paper was not libelous, that it was directed against some other person, etc. But these arguments were of no avail.</p>
   <p>Yesterday at 4 P.M. the jury, after hearing the speech of the prosecuting attorney <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and after receiving instructions from the judge, came to the conclusion that Segers was guilty of criminal libel.</p>
   <p>The fine was set at five hundred dollars or one year in jail, and sentence will be imposed by the judge next week.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, after the verdict was reached, Mr. Segers was arrested. When no one put up bail for him he was taken to prison.</p>
   <p>Mr. Segers' attorneys will ask for a new trial.</p>
