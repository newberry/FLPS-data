   <p>The Women's Auxiliary held its meeting on November 3, at which Mrs. Walerya Lipczynska, commissioner for all the states, who has been in Chicago for several days, was present. The Auxiliary sincerely welcomed this real, indefatigable, and never-discouraged social worker. Mrs. M. A. Kuflewska opened the meeting and had Mrs. K. Bucholz the secretary, read the minutes. The minutes were unanimously accepted. The committees gave their reports.</p>
   <p>The organizing committee reported the establishment of new women's groups in several neighboring districts.</p>
   <p>The social committee was thanked for the well-arranged social evening for the benefit of the Home for the Aged and Crippled, and was asked to continue the good work. Nevertheless, since one of the ladies resigned because of lack of time, a new committee was elected and promised to arrange another such evening for the same purpose during Advent.</p>

   <p>The committee for elementary schools gave a satisfactory report. A great many children are coming to the elementary schools in the Town of Lake and the vicinity of the Holy Trinity Parish. Fewer children attend the elementary school in Avondale due to the lack of an appropriate hall. All three elementary schools are functioning regularly and efficiently. The length of the school period and the amount of the teachers' pay have been finally fixed. The lessons are to last two hours; the salary is to be fifty cents per hour.</p>
   <p>The Women's Auxiliary realizes that the work of the teachers is worth more; it cannot, however, be reckless in its expenditures. Since one of the teachers has resigned due to lack of time, and since another school is to be established, two teaching positions will be open. These will be filled by competitive examinations.</p>
   <p>New business: It was decided to take part in the ceremonies attending the laying of the cornerstone of the new home of the Polish Women's Alliance. The <span class="page-break">\3</span>Auxiliary has appropriated ten dollars as a gift.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to send reports of all the meetings of the Auxiliary to the commissioner, Mrs. Lipczynska.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned.</p>
