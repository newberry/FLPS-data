   <p>We read in the last issue of the Zgoda (Peace), that at an extraordinary session of the central administration, held on January 16, it was finally decided to build a Polish National Alliance Home.</p>
   <p>It will be built on West Division Street (the third and fourth lots west of Noble Street), on lots, described in the mortgage records as "Lots 22 and 23 in Block One (1), in Moherhoff's Sub. of S. ½ of Block 13 in the Canal Trustees Subdivision of the W ½ of Sec. 5, T. 39 N., R. 14 E. of P. M." This spot is opposite the home of Mr. Kiolbasa.</p>
   <p>The lots cost $4,900.00.</p>
   <p>The committee, comprising Messrs. Blaszezynski, Wleklinski, and Centella is authorized to transact all business concerning the building of the Polish Alliance Home. The committee is publishing an appropriate notice <span class="page-break">\2</span>to the architects, and asks them to send sketches and plans and an estimate of costs, before January 29.</p>
   <p>On that day, the central administration will consider the plans and bids submitted.</p>
   <p>The central administration has adopted a motion that the cost of building the Polish National Alliance Home, should not exceed fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars.</p>
