   <p>A Polish wholesale grocery store, incorporated under the name of Chicago Wholesale Grocery Company, was organized a few months ago and is doing business at 134-36 West Washington Street, corner of Union Street.</p>
   <p>This is the first Polish business of its type in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It was organized by prominent businessmen, and its officers are A. X. Centella, a member of the Central Administration of the Polish National Alliance, president; S. Radnicki, secretary; W. Wachowski (a trustee of the Polish Roman Catholic Union), treasurer; and Mr. J. Szostakowski, from South Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Polish grocers of Chicago should support this first Polish wholesale grocery store most heartily. This is a duty arising from a proper understanding of national solidarity. Why should we support others when we can get the same goods at equally low prices from our own? In this manner the profits go to our own people.</p>
