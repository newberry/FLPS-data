   <p>The United States Congress has passed a law against illiterates, to limit immigration. This is a disaster for our comrades immigrating to the United States for a piece of daily bread.</p>
   <p>We have protested once before against that law, and we are protesting against this new law again.</p>
   <p>Petitions should be sent to the President by every association and organization like the one we outlined, and sent also to Congressman J. M. Curley, Washington, D. C.</p>
