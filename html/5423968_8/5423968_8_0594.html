   <p>While still living in my native land I heard from many Poles coming from America that the Poles here hold themselves together well in regard to their nationality. That is, they preserve their Polish language and customs, in one word, they feel and think in Polish. Listening to these narratives I became cheerful at the thought that I, also, would be able some day to find out for myself the truth.</p>
   <p>Being born and reared in my native land, in that part of Poland which Russia had taken in the dismemberment of that country, where all free thought and lively emotions are riveted in fetters of steel, I often thought about my fellow countrymen in America, how fortunate they must be, living in such a free country where they can educate their children in their mother tongue, speak in public about their affairs, such as politics, etc., so that often, very often, I sighed for that freedom of America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At last my wishes became a reality, because upon being compelled to leave my dear native land, I left for America. But I traveled beyond the ocean with a happy sensation to be able to live in freedom with my fellow countrymen and to be able to work for the good of my fatherland.</p>
   <p>After coming to America, from the first moments until the present time, I have been attentively observing the life of our emigration, and the result of my observations are as follows:</p>
   <p>Our Polish people, as I have found from books, writings, and from what I have noticed personally, have not been idle and are not now idle; instead they have shown every year an improvement in their common welfare.</p>
   <p>They are improving our trade, broadening our intelligence, organizing numerous libraries, literary societies; they are creating recreational and educational clubs for our youth, organizing all kinds of patriotic and church societies. In general, they are continually thinking abour elevating their Polish culture, over here. As I have mentioned, I wish to study longer the question of the Polish language.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The Polish language, considering that Poles are always associating in the life of other nationalities, stands relatively very well in America; thanks to the influence of an enlightened people and a sincerity given to their national affairs, who are not sparing any effort or work in this direction. Our language is being appreciated and respected by those of our people who know little of it so that it has become preceptible that familiarity with it is making steps forward, and that we are acquiring more workers in this sphere.</p>
   <p>Speaking in praise of our Polish people it is also proper to mention especially once more about the evils in regard to the question of preserving the mother language. In many families the parents converse with their children in English more often than in Polish, and some parents congratulate themselves that their children are so young and yet can speak English so well. Talk with these children in Polish and God have mercy on what you hear! The words, sentences and phrases are so altered and twisted that you cannot understand some of them.</p>
   <p>And what can we expect from such children and from such bringing up? When such a boy grows to be a youth, you cannot see much of the Polish element.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>He speaks mostly in English at home and in his meetings, and he is not even ashamed of his ignorance of the Polish language. And why is it so? The answer is simple - because his parents inculcated within him the English language from his infancy, to which they paid more attention, and so he has accustomed himself to it and fallen in love with it. That is why he does not use the Polish language and sometimes even laughs at it, and, if in an emergency he has to use the Polish language he is ashamed of it because he does not know it.</p>
   <p>That is bad, very bad, my fellow countrymen!</p>
   <p>Remember the proverb, "That with which a crust becomes imbibed when it is young, that it will smell of in its old age."</p>
   <p>Some father might think to himself: What good is the Polish language to me? It will not give bread to my children in America. Here they have to know English because they need it, whether at work or in business. Judging so, the father judges wrong.</p>
   <p>I am not opposed to the fact that English is a necessity in America, but I will call your attention to the fact that to learn the English language <span class="page-break">\5</span>every child here has a thousand possibilities, but to learn the Polish language there is no place beside our churches, parochial schools, and the family home. Therefore, the parents should try and speak with their children in Polish at home, inculcate them from childhood with out language, not English; pray with them in Polish, tell them about our history so that it will bring our an attachment to the fatherland, its affairs, and traditions.</p>
   <p>When parents will act in this manner, then the child whether small or growing up, hearing the Polish language becomes accustomed to it and will eventually fall in love with it. Then he will not be able to hold it in contempt or laugh at it, but will preserve an affection for it throughout his entire life and in the future generations.</p>
