   <p>In the last four months there has been a considerable increase of membership in the ranks of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Each month shows an average monthly gain in excess of a thousand new members. This total has been a dream which we believed, could never be realized. The accomplishment was indeed a surprise, especially since it was achieved without the aid of trained agents. The monthly increase heretofore, was an average of 600 to 800 members, which was considered normal; no special consideration or thought had,however, been devoted to this work, therefore, this unexpected enrollment has added to the prestige and power of the Polish National Alliance, and should show even greater results in the future.</p>
   <p>It is not surprising that a thousand two-hundred new members, should lead one to believe that they, after observing this unusual increase, can rest upon the laurels of past performances, and thus, if the Polish National Alliance continues at this rate it will not be necessary to adjust ourselves to existing circumstances. We could go ahead with the plans intended for the increase of only normal proportions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Several weeks ago we published a notice, stating that the Polish National Alliance is not keeping up the necessary pace, and that it should have a monthly increase of at least 2,000 members.</p>
   <p>At present we have about 1000 lodge units. If each of these secure only 2 now members each month, then membership would grow normally. Now however, the average is one new member a month for each lodge. This is positively not sufficient, and might be considered a standstill.</p>
   <p>Ordinary effort is not enough to overcome losses which are caused by death and other inevitable reasons. The Polish National Alliance is a large but ever growing organization, and steps should be taken to farther increase its growth by a membership drive in which all should participate. If, however, we have reached a point where we leave the work to someone else, then we also have reached the phase where our progress halts and we are retrograding.</p>
   <p>We must always remember that work performed for the Polish National Alliance is work done for our native land; the more we do for one the more shall the other benefit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The Alliance and Poland are one and the same in their meaning; their purpose is to benefit the Poles; and in them we see Polish thought materialized. In its development we see power spreading its effects in all directions. Without the existence of this organization the Polish element in America would be a body without a soul. In consideration of this, every member of the Alliance should take pride in wearing and displaying the membership pin or button. But this is not all, we are facing a bigger task.</p>
   <p>We must acquire a reputation as founders of national ideals. We must increase the membership of the organization, despite obstacles. Every one, without exception, should volunteer to build this organization to a faster tempo. We must apply every effort to make it a virtual giant in its field. We have previously appealed to you in a newspaper, requesting that each lodge contribute 2 new members per month. The Alliance would them, at the time of its next convention, have 12,000 new members within its fold. Is that really so difficult to attain? There is no apparent reason why the average lodge, consisting of 30 to 50 members, cannot solicit 2 members; even if they are relatives or friends.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It would be a disgrace if we were compelled to openly admit defeat in our effort to secure only one new member. We must exert all energy at this time, when hatred runs rampant on all sides, and enemies seek to check our growth. Let us of the Alliance, become working units rather, than mere observers, who assume and hope that someone else will do their share. Let every member be a promotor, whether he is an officer of the organization or not. This is not the time to procrastinate or wait for the action of others; we must increase our ranks two-fold, because it is a dire necessity.</p>
   <p>All who possess energy and ambition and do not wish to be adjudged dead or inactive members of the organization, should roll up their sleeves and work. The field is vast and unlimited; all that is required is a desire to approach those who have not yet felt the hand of the organization, and emphasize the duty of being a part of this great family. Therefore, we reiterate, let us work in the face of hardships, and then, despite existing obstacles, our efforts shall be well rewarded.</p>
   <p>This organization represents our Mother Country in America, it guides us during life and does not forget its sons in death, nor the fate of its children after their life's journey. Let us increase our ranks, and make the Polish National Alliance more powerful.</p>
