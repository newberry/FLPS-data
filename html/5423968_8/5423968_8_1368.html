   <p>Dear Brothers and Sisters:â€”</p>
   <p>Next Sunday, Oct. 15, a group of the Polish National Alliance in the Town of Lake, will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the organization of the Polish National Alliance. A committee of delegates representing this group from Town of Lake is contributing greatly to this activity, to make this celebration one of the best over held and to bring glory to the Polish National Alliance. The principal aim of the committee is to invite all Polish Societies from our community to take part with the groups of the Polish National Alliance in this great and honorable celebration.</p>
   <p>This celebration will begin at 4 o'clock in the afternoon at the corner of 48th and Paulina, where the different groups led by a band will march to the hall located in the park at 45th street. The admission is free, so be present.</p>
   <p>We have high hopes that the societies from Town of Lake, which have in the past worked and assisted us in all our affairs, will be kind enough to accept our invitation and be represented by a large group at the 25th year celebration, in other words the silver Jubilee of the organizing of the Polish National Alliance groups in Town of Lake.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
