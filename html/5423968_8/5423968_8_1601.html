The necessary quorum for making decisions at monthly meetings will be five members, and at quarterly meetings eight. Monthly meetings will be held every first Wednesday; at these meetings regular routine problems will be taken up.</p>
   <p>The organization of the Polish League will begin creating branches without alleting them to districts for the time being. With this in view, a suitable announcement will be published in all newspapers, and copies will be sent to the Polish clergy, societies, prominent Poles, etc. To this announcement will <span class="page-break">\3</span>be attached the statutes of the League, instructions for branches, and bulletins in behalf of the petition for abolishing the Russian-American Treaty.</p>

Nagiel, and L. Szopanski, who are not members of the central board of the League.</p>
   <p>It was voted to purchase suitable office books and supplies, for which twenty-five dollars was appropriated. The headquarters of the League will be temporarily located at the office of the Polish Publishing Company, 141-143 West Division Street.</p>
