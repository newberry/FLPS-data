   <p>The way some of our young ladies are behaving we read about in one of the recent numbers of Pobudka (Reveille).</p>
   <p>Just as our young men, the greater part of whom are keeping away from Polish societies, national or religious, so our young ladies are forgetting mainly that they also have their role to fulfill in life, that they also should mold their future early in life. For the heavy and responsible duty of rearing and directing our future generation awaits them. Truly, it is disheartening when one thinks of how they will acquit themselves of all this in the future, when one more attentively observes their present lives.</p>
   <p>No matter how well you would seek, you cannot find that something within them that would impregnate the hope of a better tomorrow, something that would make them worthy heiresses to the grateful memory of our women workers, mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers. They are closing their eyes to their future, they are not worrying about tomorrow, they avoid work in societies and are living in the confusion of the present day.</p>
   <p>They are in the greatest part baby dolls and nothing more than just dolls in the broad sense of the word. When you meet them at some sort of entertainment or picnic, then you imagine that you would leap into flames after her, so pretty is the young rascal and so gallantly done up. This impression, nevertheless, bursts like a soap bubble when you approach her and start a conversation with her. You will convince yourself thereupon that her modern coiffure and elegant dress is a delusive cover under which is hidden a desperate emptiness.</p>
   <p>The conversation which is started, in spite of efforts on both sides, somehow does not fit together. It is as if you were walking over small clods. One not acquainted with the intricate Polish-American dialect imagines that he has suddenly found himself in the society of people just arrived from the moon, and not among Poles.</p>
   <p>Now, what sort of impression is made upon the person meeting for the first time the majority of our young lady participants at our bulls and revels. The things you will nevertheless always find with them is a fascinating smile imprinted upon their faces, and in their mouth, bright shining teeth, because they are encased in gold.</p>
   <p>Their only aim in life is dress and entertainment, to have a good time and to surround themselves with a circle of admirers, fascinated by their outward appearance and delusive charm. That is their dream, that is their highest rung of happiness upon this earth which a women in her opinion can attain. They imagine that one can have in his brains just shopped straw, that one can speak any old language, that the main thing is to have a cute face and a nice dress, because by this most often the naive one will be caught and such is our female youth in its overwhelming majority.</p>
   
   <p>Who is to blame for these sad conditions? No one else but the parents and vile environment. I know, in fact, a few Polish families who care about their children's future and endeavor to bring them up as good members of society, as good Poles. Such parents care before anything else about this, that their sons and daughters should know their mother language and use it everywhere, except where they are by extreme necessity compelled to use the English language. There is still not enough of such families.</p>
   <p>The remainder, with the most renowned patriots at their head, these already are not Poles, they are Irishmen of Polish descent. Polish origin, Polish patriotism, is not making speeches at anniversaries or national holidays; nor idle talk at gatherings and party meetings; it is Polish souls and hearts, the preservation of Polish culture, which directs us to bring up our children in Polish spirit, instilling in young pure hearts the love of Polish language and deep respect for Polish tradition. Not by words but by acts, by what we have made of our children and how we have prepared them for life will the future judge us and designate a place for us in the memory of future generations.</p>
