   <p>Through the efforts of Reverend W. Furman, pastor of St. Casimir Church, and the co-operation of the parish societies, a patriotic manifestation commemorating the insurrection against Russia on November 29, 1830, took place at the parish hall Sunday, December 2, at 3 P. M.</p>
   <p>Shortly after 2 P.M., the hall, decorated to fit the memorable occasion, was filled to capacity. Just before the program got under way the members of the Holy Cross Society entered the auditorium en masse and took their places on the right side of the hall, while the members of the Women's Choir, under M. Marcinkowski's direction, followed behind and took their places on the opposite side.</p>
   <p>John Rosinski, president of the Program Committee, opened the exercise and called upon Reverend Furman and John Grzegorzewski to act as chairman and recording secretary respectively.</p>

   <p>The pastor spoke a few but sincere words, pointing out that the large gathering present indicated the true patriotic fooling of the Poles in St. Casimir Parish. He stated that peace and unity was becoming accepted fact and that the congregation was taking more interest in matters of the Church and the fatherland. Songs by the parish choir followed, of which the "Farewell of a Soldier" was outstanding. Warm applause was given this group for its fine work.</p>
   <p>J. Mirski was the next speaker of the day. He painted an oral picture of the November rising and emphasized the valor of our forefathers. The causes of the failure of this attempt for freedom were also touched. Generous applause was given the speaker as he made his bow.</p>
   <p>Miss Mary Pawlowska gave a stirring recitation of a poem, "The Anniversary at Prague," followed by the singing of the Women's Cheir, which sang <span class="page-break">\3</span>"Of Smoke of Fires." Both numbers were well received by the crowd.</p>
   <p>The speech by Albert Wachowski created quite a stir among the gathering. He reviewed the highlights of Polish history to the present day and pointed out that lack of unity and harmony is the cause of all evil. He did not mince words when he said that there is lack of unity and harmony within our ranks today. "We do not support our own kind and do not wish ourselves success," the speaker averred. He insisted that an end should be put to all this, for we should remember that we are Poles, that we should not only train our children but instill in them our patriotic feeling and impart to them the need for harmony and unity, and the need of fulfilling patriotic Obligations. "Without this Poland will not be rebuilt," concluded Mr. Wachowski. This stirring address won the acclaim of the audience.</p>
   <p>A declamation, "The One-hundredth Anniversary," by Louise Lewandowska, was next on the program, followed by a short talk by Alphonse Tokarski.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>This speaker talked on the persecution that befell the Poles after the failure of the November insurrection, a persecution which has been growing steadily ever since. "Yet," he said, "we have been able to withstand this merciless onslaught....We live and will live as long as we will safeguard in the depths of our hearts the love for our fatherland." Generous applause followed as the speaker left the stand.</p>
   <p>"In the Shadows of Kosciusko" was recited by Miss Golembieska. Then the local choir sang "Where is My Home?" followed with declamations by young Andruszkiewicz and Rosinski.</p>
   <p>The pastor took the stand to conclude this memorable but sad occasion. His address was long and full of meaning.</p>
   <p>"Poland," began the speaker, "was great and valiant. The Polish nation continued to be victorious as long as it had faith in God. But as soon as this belief began to wane and the spirit of unfaithfulness began to prevail, <span class="page-break">\5</span>selfishness and unrestraint took root. Dissension and lewdness without reflection started to reign. It was shortly afterwards that the country began to weaken and fall, because God no longer favored it with His blessing."</p>
   <p>Later the pastor referred to our condition in America and pointed out the menacing movements against our society: currents spreading through disbelief, excessive growth of unscrupulous capitalism, the exploitation by millionaires who have shortcomings in faith and other moral principles. The speaker stated that only true Christianity can deliver us from all this.</p>
   <p>"No matter where evil prevails," continued the pastor, "whether in Europe or America, we should not lose hope. The understanding Lord is not going to persecute us forever for our fathers' wrongs and will once again have mercy upon us. All of Europe is in a state of anticipation. No one knows when the zero hour will arrive, therefore, we should be prepared. We should work in brotherly fashion and not in anger and hate, for it is <span class="page-break">\6</span>certain that our fatherland will rise once again in heavenly light and favor. The white eagle will rise and spread its wings high over our homeland."</p>
   <p>It is needless to say that this speech impressed the audience, for the long applause spoke for itself.</p>
   <p>A collection made for the Polish orphans netted $7.15.</p>
   <p>"God Save Poland,"a Polish hymn, was sung by all present to and the program.</p>
