   <p>At the special meeting, held on July 7, by the Central Board of the Polish National Alliance (P. N. A.), there has been endorsed and published a proclamation to the members of that organization and to the Poles at large calling for a uniform crystallization of national and political aims before the incoming liberation of Poland out of the hands of the oppressors. The proclamation emphasizes the necessity of an ample financial support to the cause of liberation of Poland on the eve of portentous political possibilities.</p>
   <p>The proclamation stresses the fact that the Polish National Alliance has been founded more than thirty years ago as a national political organization for the purpose of helping Poland in her struggle for independence; that it has faithfully carried the banner of that ideal, and that it will continue to do so, even amidst numerous opposing agitators and factions proposing a different political program for the liberation of Poland, and that, therefore, it feels to be well suited in the fulfilment of its duty to point out to its members the safest course of procedure and action towards the liberation of Poland. To this end the Central Board of the P. N. A. has also ascertained the opinion of and received advice from the best Polish patriots, statesmen and publicists, such as Henryk Sienkiewicz, Biskup Bandurski, W. Tetmajer, Waclaw Sieroszewski, W. Gasiorowski, and many others, and therefore regards its policy for securing the independence of Poland as based on solid grounds.</p>
   <p>With these and other assets to its credit, the Central Board of the P. N. A. feels it has the right to admonish all members of the P. N. A. to hasten with their donations to the cause of Poland's liberation, and particularly to help the Polish Military Fund and the Polish military organizations, which are the nucleus of the future Polish Army.</p>
   <p>To safe-guard the funds and to direct their distribution into proper hands, there will be a Board of Supervisors, under the direction of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
