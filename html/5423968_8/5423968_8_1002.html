   <p>With the outbreak of the war the influx of immigration from Europe has ceased, and as a result the stream of new members joining the [Polish National] Alliance has decreased.</p>
   <p>An organization as powerful as the Alliance cannot stand still. It must develop and grow year after year. In order to assure the Alliance of a constant stream of new members, it was found necessary to conduct a strong campaign among the Poles who have already been living here for quite some time.</p>
   <p>With this in mind, the central board of directors, in conjunction with the advisory board, established the organizers' bureau.</p>
   <p>The convention did not sanction the establishment of the organizers' bureau.</p>
   
   <p>The idea of establishing a permanent organizer, who would devote himself to increasing the growth of the Polish National Alliance, has been discussed for a long time, but the matter has been postponed from year to year. Therefore, I undertook this task for one year as a trial, in order to gather the necessary material and to decide, on the basis of facts, whether or not the Alliance needs an organizers' bureau.</p>
   <p>The first year's trial work produced the following results: Within one year (from April 1, 1916 to March 31, 1917) 21,168 members joined the Alliance. Of these, 12,127 members joined the Alliance through the medium of groups and members, while 9,041, or forty-two per cent of the total of new members, were brought in through the Alliance's organizers.</p>
   <p>The exact figures for each month are as follows: [Translator's note: Here follows the list of new members month by month. The list has been omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>For the entire year 12,127 new members were brought in by groups and old members; 9,041 were brought in by the organizer's bureau, making a total of 21,168 new members.</p>
   <p>The expenditures of the organizers' bureau for typist's salary, printed matter, and postage, for this period amounted to $3,263.22. If we divide this expenditure by 9,041 members gained through the organizers' bureau, we find that the cost of obtaining each new member was barely thirty-six cents.</p>
   <p>By gaining nine thousand new members over and above the members that would have joined through regular channels, the Polish National Alliance has gained the following benefits: It has extended its influence, it has gained over $3,600 in registration fees, and, lastly, it has increased its revenue from monthly dues (twenty cents per member), by $21,600 a year. These dues will benefit the National Fund, the Alliance School, the Alliance's Home for Immigrants, and various other departments of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Besides gaining these new members the organizers' bureau has contributed directly to the general development and strengthening of the Alliance in the following manner:</p>
   <p>1. The organizers, by going from house to house and informing people about the Alliance, have acquainted tens of thousands of people with the Alliance who had never even heard about our organization. They did not enlist all of them as new members, but they prepared the ground for further work.</p>
   <p>2. The organizers distributed during the year tens of thousands of brochures and circulars. Such advertising must have a good influence on the general development of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>3. The organizers' bureau sent out prepared lectures and notices to the Alliance groups, calling all members to work.</p>
   <p>A year of this sort of work has produced satisfactory results. In spite of the lack of fresh immigrants, and attacks against the Alliance, the organizers' bureau has added nine thousand new members to the Alliance.</p>
   <p>All sorts of organizations, such as the Knights of Columbus, the Foresters, and Woodmen, are drawing our brothers into their organizations by the thousands. They arrange complete campaigns for Poles. They pay from three to ten dollars for each new member gained. And they make money on this!</p>
   
   <p>Is it not our duty to develop a strong campaign, in order not to permit the Poles to lose themselves among strangers, to show our compatriots that every true Pole should stand under the banner of the Polish National Alliance? One year's trial organizational work has shown us plainly that such a campaign yields good results. Nine thousand members constitute a real gain for the Alliance, both moral and material.</p>
   <p>After a year's trial work, I presented to the Alliance the conditions on which I would agree to conduct this work further. A special committee appointed to investigate my work, explained that the central board of directors would not want to decide on a salary for this organizational work without the consent of the convention. In view of this I agreed to continue working to develop the Alliance without salary, leaving it for the convention at Pittsburgh to decide whether or not my work deserves a reward.</p>
   <p>We still have a year and a half to the next convention. Within this time we can accomplish miracles. Let us all get to work! At a time as critical as the one we are witnessing, when thousands of Poles are dying on battle fields, when thousands of Polish women and children are dying of poverty and hunger, it is our duty to concentrate all the Polish immigrants into one group and to organize them into disciplined ranks of the Alliance in order that they may not become lost among strangers. Let each Alliance group select three organizers from among its members for three months. Besides this let every member concern himself about the development and strengthening of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>By the time of the next convention we must have 200,000 members in our ranks.</p>
   <p>Let us get to work earnestly, and we shall accomplish what we set out to do.</p>
   <p>With fraternal regards,</p>
   <p>Joseph Mierzynski,</p>
   <p>Chief Organizer of the</p>
   <p>Polish National Alliance.</p>
