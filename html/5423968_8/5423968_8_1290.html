   <p>At present the Polish National Alliance is passing through a new era of persecution by two extreme reactionaries of Polish society in America. The organization is combated by extreme ecclesiastics on one side and socialists on the other.</p>
   <p>This does not mean that every clergyman and every socialist is an enemy of our patriotic organization. There are exceptions, and most likely they are numerous. But, generally speaking, we can say that extreme rightists, as well as extreme leftists, are not favorably inclined toward our organization and would rather that it did not exist.</p>
   <p>To tell the truth, they want to take under their control something else <span class="page-break">2</span>which was created by the Polish people through thirty years of hard work. But, seeing that this is impossible, our opponents resort to other means. What they cannot combat they attempt to destroy, and if this also proves unsuccessful they endeavor at least to weaken it.</p>
   <p>There is a certain amount of agreement noticeable between the clericals and the socialists, who stand at such absolutely opposite extremes: they both want to harm the Polish National Alliance. There is nothing that unites them; on the contrary, everything separates them, so that they are mutually the worst of enemies. And yet, whenever there is a possibility of doing harm to the Alliance, of weakening its activity, of obstructing its growth and development, these enemies are strangely in accord with each other on that one point.</p>
   <p>And what is their interest in this matter? Upon closer observation it is impossible not to note that the chief concern of both these extreme factions is a desire to gain control over our people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The people themselves govern in our Polish National Alliance. This is manifested by their sending delegates to conventions, by the holding of general elections in matters of utmost importance, and by the strict control the people have over officials. The entire activity of central administration of the Alliance during each two years between conventions is determined by what was ordered by a freewill vote of a majority of the delegates at the preceding convention. Moreover, even this activity of the central administration is under the constant surveillance of a censor, who is chosen for this purpose by all of the delegates at the convention.</p>
   <p>Does the same procedure follow in the camp of our opponents? It is best not even to speak of this.</p>
   <p>Suffice it to say that in no other organization are people as certain of effecting their will as in our Polish National Alliance. This is not agreeable to certain elements who consider themselves authorized and chosen to instruct the popular will.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>People are very happy to exercise their free will, and for exactly this reason individuals--people who are the most enlightened, most eager to work in behalf of our motherland and our nationality--join the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The opponents of the Polish National Alliance hate to see progress and patriotism. Some of them hate to see even moderate progress; others cannot stand patriotism because they unjustly consider it a barrier in the path of progress. Then there are those who hate both equally. It is because of this that a considerable amount of dissatisfaction with the Alliance originates among the two factions and a considerable amount of their work is directed against the Alliance.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, it is known that patriotism and moderate progressiveness are two of the greatest virtues of man. They are two of the best and most certain goals toward which everyone should strive--two elevating elements that can bring joy to every nation and place it upon the highest rung of <span class="page-break">5</span>the ladder of perfection. Only ill will or complete ignorance can be opposed to progress and patriotism.</p>
   <p>These virtues find their way more and more often even among these two extreme factions of society. Moderate progress already has many followers among the best sons of the church, not even excluding the priests. Patriotism today is not strange even to some socialists, for example, those in Germany, in Czecho-Slovakia, and especially in the United States.</p>
   <p>Progress does not prohibit one from believing in God and fulfilling our religious obligations. Neither does patriotism deny any one the right to consider any economic theory good. The churchmen as well as the socialists can, therefore, spread their teachings at will without colliding with progressive and patriotic people. Moreover, the chances of both would be far better if they would stop employing tactics that shock a person's feelings and would stop causing hatreds among sane and right-thinking masses of people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>But, then, that is their business and not ours. We members of the Alliance firmly believe in the beneficial power of progress and in the elevating and ennobling strength of patriotism. We wish to serve our people truly, all of them, irrespective of party or convictions. We wish to serve our motherland with deeds and thus to serve all of our people.</p>
   <p>It is, however, necessary to possess strength in order to serve effectively and to take action that will be worthy and far-reaching. In former ages strength was represented frequently by rich and powerful individuals. The gaining of one such person for some cause could bring victory and success. Today we find that times have changed. Today, power rests in the masses of the people only, in the people themselves, in their good will and their unanimity. Today, everyone who wishes to accomplish something great in behalf of some ideal must begin by acquiring the greatest number of supporters for this ideal. Individuals--even the best--do not mean so much today. The most they can do is to become useful as leaders who point the road to the masses.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>For this reason the building of a great National Alliance in a foreign land--an Alliance based upon patriotism, democratic principles and moderate progress--is today of utmost importance in the eyes of every patriotic Pole who really wants to serve his motherland. Today we do not need lengthy party programs or interpretations of what the people will do or should do when they meet. The people are wise and sincere, they will know what to do and how to do things when they all find themselves under the motherland's banner. Today they are not all under it. There is, however, a considerable part of them now, and it might be added that they constitute the best part. But that does not suffice for a great service, for an effective and fruitful service.</p>
   <p>The members of the Polish National Alliance are therefore urged to lead our Polish people under the Alliance banner, under the banner of the motherland, under the banner of progress and patriotism. If our people wish to serve their motherland, let them build the one and only, the universal Polish National Alliance.</p>
