   <p>Last Saturday, May 5, the Podhalan Society, Group 1850 of the Polish National Alliance, held a social at A. Zembal's Hall for the purpose of attracting new members, and it was unusually successful.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Bobrzecki, president of the Podhalan Society, opened the exercises, and called upon Mr. Leon Nowak, president of Commune III of Holy Trinity parish, to act as chairman, and on Miss A. Skierczynski to act as secretary. The president ardently besought those present to arrange such socials more frequently, because such gatherings enlighten the people; and as examples he showed how the Americans, English, French, and even the Czechs unite and work for their nations. Mr. Bobrzecki asked the audience to be quiet during the program, which was as follows:</p>

He also reminded us of how the early Polish immigrants to this country suffered persecution in America on the part of people of other nationalities; and today, thanks to the labor of those who always work in the national field for the good of all, we can be proud of being Poles and of being able also to love our adopted country.</p>
