   <p>Mutilating the Polish language is criticized presently by Polish writers of various Polish newspapers. They claim that the Poles themselves do not respect their own language, so how can we demand from others the respect for our language. This is true beyond all doubt. This condition is much to be regretted.</p>
   <p>But how can it be any other way when as soon as the child leaves the home, he likely does not hear a Polish word mentioned, even in the home. The parents are forced to accomodate themselves with other foreign phrases, in order to be properly understood.</p>
   <p>The most common way to avoid that is to read a let, especially aloud, to yourself, pronouncing the words the way they are written. Let every one of our readers promise himself this duty to perform daily, to read at least one article from the newspapers aloud. Do not get discouraged with the fact that you may not know the meaning of one or two of the words while reading. Because as soon as you meet these unknown words, read over <span class="page-break">\2</span>the sentence to yourself over again and then try to grasp the meaning, or else ask somebody until you have succeeded. If one doesn't know, the other person will.</p>
   <p>A person with ambition and will can learn everything. If the reader heeds this advice for a certain time, he shall notice how fast he will enrich himself in the art of speaking and in knowledge. It is our duty to familiarize ourselves with our native tongue, and the best tutor in our language for us is the newspaper. The editors try to write simply and understandingly for us.</p>
   <p>Aside of this, let us reciprocally become teachers. As soon as we hear someone speaking Polish incorrectly, we should nicely correct them. Let us admit to criticism likewise if we happen to be wrong. Every language, and above all others the Polish language, is a very difficult one to learn. No one can speak his native tongue perfectly. Let it be known <span class="page-break">\3</span>that even the best educated persons living - the writers - make mistakes.</p>
   <p>So then let there be no offense if you should happen to be corrected while in the act of reading or speaking.</p>
   <p>Let us strive for distinction in the use of our language and know that the Polish language is one of the prettiest languages in the world.</p>
