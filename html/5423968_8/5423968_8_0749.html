   <p>Our readers and Alliance [Polish National Alliance] brothers already know that Congressman Medill McCormick of Illinois introduced a resolution in Congress on April 9, requesting "that the Congress of the United States declare itself for the unification and liberation of Poland, for the absolute independence of Ireland, and for the reconstruction of Belgium and Serbia, ruined by the war. This resolution, which has been rather favorably received, has been sent to the Committee of Foreign Affairs for discussion and recommendations.</p>
   <p>Congressman McCormick's resolution reads:</p>
   <p>"Whereas the United States is now at war with the German Empire, and,</p>
   <p>"Whereas other great powers are fighting this Empire in order to insure the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>rights and freedom of all small nations, so that the latter may take their rightful place among large countries; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that the House of Representatives send sincere greetings to the houses of deputies in Rome and Paris, to the Duma in Petrograd, to the Houses of Commons in London and Ottawa; to the Houses of representatives in Cape Town, Melbourne, and Wellington; and to the lawmaking bodies of other countries which are at war with Germany, in the hope that peace may be signed only after Belgium and Serbia are reconstructed as sovereign nations, and Ireland and Poland receive freedom and autonomy in their former boundaries. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that the speaker of the House of Representatives send this resolution to presidents and speakers of the above-mentioned houses of parliament."</p>
   <p>This resolution is at present in the hands of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, and may soon come up before Congress for discussion. Therefore, it is our duty <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>as Poles desiring a united, free, and autonomous Poland to make every effort to have this resolution passed in both Houses.</p>
   <p>The central board of directors [of the Polish National Alliance] has sent an expression of gratitude to Congressman McCormick for his manly and noble stand in the matter of Poland's independence, to which he has sent a sincere reply, addressed to K. Zychlinski, president of the Alliance, suggesting that groups of the P. N. A. send telegrams or petitions to him or to the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee requesting that the resolution in the matter of Poland be accepted by Congress.</p>
   <p>This matter is of the utmost importance, and it is up to us to make every effort to have Congressman McCormick's resolution accepted by Congress. There is not a moment to lose, because any day now this resolution may be sent to Congress. Therefore, all Alliance groups and influential Poles should send telegrams and petitions at once to the Hon. Medill McCormick, Congressman at Large from <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Illinois, Washington, D. C., or to the Hon. Chairman, Foreign Relations Committee, Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Any group wanting to send its request by telegraph can do so in any manner that it sees fit.</p>
   <p>Let us not neglect this matter so important to us, as the acceptance of this resolution by Congress will be a great victory for our cause. Then we can surely expect a free and independent Poland.</p>
