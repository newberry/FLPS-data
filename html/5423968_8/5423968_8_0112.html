   <p>About two months ago we published a news item that Mr. Adam Magdziarz, 36 Chapin Street, was accused by the president of the Casimir Jagiello Society of embezzling forty dollars, presumerably collected by him partly for the benefit of the Holy Trinity parish, and part as society assessments.</p>
   <p>We have just been informed that the case came up for trial today, and the accused, who was defended by Attorneys Czarneski and Company, was found not guilty.</p>
