   <p>The following passage is taken from an article entitled "Nationalism", recently published in the Chicago Tribune. "We must and will destroy every nationalism except Americanism. We do not want German societies here, nor Polish societies, nor Irish societies, nor Swedish societies". Very aptly another newspaper Dziennik Ludowy, makes this rejoinder to the Tribune: "It takes no trouble to write that we must and will destroy every nationalism, but the writer should also tell how it is to be done. It is likwise easy to write that "we do not want German or Polish or Bohemian or other nationalistic societies here" in which are developing and getting more powerful every day", but again the editor should inform us what the Tribune has to offer in their place to those who arrived here somewhat more recently than he and the others on the Tribune's editorial staff or their ancestors - to those who do not know the language, the custom, or the laws of the United States and have only by grace of the above-mentioned societies begun to comprehend what they would never have comprehended if, when they landed on American soil, some one had thrust a copy of the Tribune into their hands and had told them to get rid as rapidly as decently possible of their extra-territorial affiliations.</p>

   <p>"This is not the line along which true Americans have worked in the past, and they are not working along it now. This is not the way to convert foreigners into Americans, although it was the method employed by the old Teutonic Order. By this method the Knights of this Order long ago converted the Prussians to Christianity, and they wished to apply the same method to the Lithuanians. And although times have changed, the Chicago Tribune would still like to convert foreigners not to Christianity but to Americanism after this obsolete fashion. This recent editorial in the Tribune is also reminiscent of the Teutonic Order in the brazen style in which it defends those present-day descendents of the Teutonic Knights in America, who did not want to take part in the celebration at the Coliseum on July 4, (Loyalty Day). It has an ominous sound. "Za twoje myto kijem cie obito - for paying your debt a thrashing you get, "those persons, who organized this expression of loyalty on the part of the "hyphenates" must have maid to themselves after reading this article in the Tribune. And yet the Tribune's editorial has done some good by stating the question clearly and frankly. For every doze there is an antidote, as the Tribune doubtless well knows.</p>
