   <p>With the combined efforts of all the church and nationalistic societies of St. Michael the Archangel's parish a patriotic demonstration was held in the parish hall, commemorating the adoption of the Polish constitution of May 3, 1791. The initial speaker of the evening was Zbigniew Brodowski, president of the Polish National Alliance. He was was succeeded by Casimir Neuman, editor of the Dziennik Chicagoski. The Reverend S. Cosimi, C.R., was the third speaker, and B. Klarkowski was the fourth.</p>
   <p>All the speeches were in a sincerely patriotic vein. The other numbers, songs, declamations, etc., hold the interest of the audience throughout the program.</p>
   <p>The important feature of the entire affair was the fact that societies of two factions, religious and nationalistic, not only worked hand in hand to plan this program but demonstrated that peaceful co-operation can exist <span class="page-break">2</span>between them.</p>
   <p>Credit should be accorded to those who made this patriotic exercise possible.</p>
