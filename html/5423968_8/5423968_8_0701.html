   <p>In order to become an American patriot, one must be an Indian and belong to the Sioux, Cheyenne, Brulle or any other Indian tribe. This is only a crude involuntary jest that forced itself under the pen when we began to write about American patriotism, yet it contains some truth.</p>
   <p>Let us forget the Indians and take up the expression "American" in the sense used here, that is, meaning the United States, and let us discuss American patriotism from that point of view.</p>
   <p>The United States came into existence because, in some English colonies in America, tyrannized and exploited inhabitants of different nationalities, especially the English, decided to throw off the heavy yoke. After succeeding, they established a republic and gave it a very beautiful constitution, <span class="page-break">\2</span>which enabled them to acquire more territories and accept into the union other states later on.</p>
   <p>Whoever came to this country and acquainted himself with its Constitution, has not only become a citizen but also has tried and is trying to carry out the principles of the Constitution. Furthermore, he endeavors with all his might to develop this beautiful country, helping in its growth and trying to make it greater than any other country in the world. Whoever is prepared to defend the sovereignty of this country with his life and his possessions, he is a good American patriot.</p>
   <p>Such patriot, therefore, has certain privileges and certain duties. His privileges consist of freedom and the right to elect the representatives of the government, or in other words the right of making laws indirectly.</p>
   <p>As he rules the country indirectly through his representatives, it is his duty to know the laws, their merits, and their demerits. If in his opinion the laws are faulty or impractical, he should endeavor to improve them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>It is also his duty to enlighten others on the subject. Before elections, he should listen very carefully to all arguments for and against the candidate running for public offices, and then act according to the dictates of his conscience, that is, vote for such representative or judge as, in his opinion, shares his convictions.</p>
   <p>Thus, if some one thinks that McKinley's Bill is harmful, he is not only allowed but should express his opinion why he thinks so, because this leads to critical examination of the subject by others, and finally to proper reform.</p>
   <p>If some one thinks that Silver's Bill or any other measure is harmful, he should oppose it by all legal means. By opposing a bill a citizen does not besmirch the American nation with mud; on the contrary, he proves to be a real American patriot who tries to improve our institutions. It is the duty of every American patriot not obliged to kiss the foot of the Czar that kicks him, to paint out the defects of the laws, their harm at the time, or the fatal consequences that might occur in the future.</p>
   <p>Is it possible to be a patriot of two countries simultaneously, for instance, <span class="page-break">\4</span>of America and Ireland, of America and Germany, of America and Poland?</p>
   <p>The author of the article in Zgoda thinks that this is an impossibility, but it is understood by a seven-year-old boy, a foster child of one of our citizens, whose father is an inmate of an insane asylum, who loves his father above his life, and who would also give his life for his foster father.</p>
   <p>We will discuss this some other time.</p>
