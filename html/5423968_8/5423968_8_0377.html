   <p>There is a tendency, on the part of the great mass of American born youth of Polish extraction to alter, or change their Polish names to Anglo-Saxon. Whatever justification, there may be for a person in public life, to change his name we cannot comprehend. The changes are so complete, that their national origin has been completely eradicated. for instance, Steve Carr, a professional prize fighter, who, not so long ago beat his opponent Nathan Mann.</p>
   <p>The name Carr would not indicate that he is a Pole. His name, Stefan Surowiecki is not difficult to pronounce and he was born at Meriden, Conn. On the fourth of February he left for Australia, where he will have several bouts, he will then proceed to Africa, and then back to America. He is a young, clever and sturdy fighter; and his future as a boxer seems bright. All of this don't mean a thing among Poles, because nobody knows that he is of Polish extraction.</p>
