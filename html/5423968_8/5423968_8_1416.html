   <p>The directors of the P.N.A. museum and library are striving to raise funds to purchase new Polish books. Due to the number of P.N.A. members, there are not enough books in the library to furnish each member with at least one book, but after they have read most of our books what have we to offer to our members? This is the great question that confronts us.</p>
   <p>To overcome this shortage of books, the directors have made arrangements to hold a picnic, August 5, at Laznowski's grove, located on Irving Park, opposite the Slovis cemetery. The admission fee is ten cents a person. At this reasonable price the directors are sure a tremendous crowd will be on hand. Music, entertainment and games will be played, the proceeds of this picnic will be used solely for purchasing new books. We are sure everyone will spend an enjoyable Sunday.</p>
