   <p>The Polish National Alliance censor has no right to complain about the abundance of his duties. His work started with an address of thanks to those who had supported and elected him as the "people's choice" and ended with a message calling forth another convention. Two speeches during the course of two years is not much; otherwise the labors of the censor would have amounted to more. The Alliance members would have canceled this office long ago if it were not for the endeavors of certain ambitious Polish individuals who deem it an honor to boast about a worthless title before the American public. This is especially true of businessmen who wish to arrange certain deals during the election campaign.</p>
   <p>This circumstance also explains the tone of other addresses or appeals which are circulated, written as though they were by important individuals of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>day, presidents of republics, or revolutionary committees which prepare the people for the most violent undermining of the government. In order to give criticism to such an appeal one must be cautious not to burst out with laughter ever the naivete of the authors, who go so far as to count upon the credulity of the readers of such statements, for they are of the opinion that words and phrases are all that are necessary to impress them. T. M. Helinski is guilty of such naivete in his recent appeal. This is surprising because he is a sensible and intelligent person, for he speaks of "confidence in justice and the help of God" in the continued national work of the Polish National Alliance. He further asserts that his discredited organization will wrest Poland from her shameful state of bondage".</p>
   <p>Nevertheless this naivete is only pretentious. Mr. Helinski is aware of present conditions. He knows the trend of thought in the Alliance groups, as well as the reaction against the efforts of the present leaders of the Alliance. Thanks should be extended to these leaders for attempting to introduce into the Polish national and Catholic element fallen Poles in the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>form of Jewish rabble, socialism, anarchism and "Independent" [those independent of the Pope] brewlers.</p>
   <p>This Polish and Catholic element is going to voice a strong protest against the abuse of sacred rights for sacrilegious aims. This element will make a motion requesting a change in the constitution and will support new candidates for the various offices in the Polish National Alliance. These offices were taken ever by individuals whose actions are responsible for the present state of affairs. Zgoda, official organ of the Polish National Alliance, is responsible for elevating these outcasts to the dignity of patriots.</p>
   <p>Just which of the particular evils is going to be used as a basis of protest by the conservative faction of the Polish National Alliance is not for us to guess at present, but it is as clear as the sun that the present officers of the Polish National Alliance and the Zgoda stand against the party of honest people. They are preparing to divert the attention of the Alliance members at large from the evils, which were brought about by the leaders and were <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>glossed over by them with beautiful phrases which were heretofore unknown in the columns of the Zgoda.</p>
   <p>At the recent meetings of the Polish National Alliance groups, the speakers urged their listeners to "stand by the sacred beliefs of our forebears". The Zgoda has taken up the "banner of Christ" today, to protect it, despite the fact that the Alliance stated sometime ago that it has nothing in common with any religion. To this same category of phrasomongering, whose aim is to confuse the people, belongs a "series of matters" which, according to the censor, "should be taken up at the next convention". This entire series is mentioned below in order that they may be taken up more fully in the future issues of the Dziennik Chicagoski. The matters which have significance and also those which do not will be discussed. The purpose of this is to determine whether the Polish National Alliance should be considered a general Polish-American organization, relative to its efforts in maintaining our nationality and the Catholic faith, or just as a Chicago clique which is trying to confuse the people through phrasemongering and by shutting out of their hearts their Polish <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>culture and religion.</p>
   <p>The duty of the censor, but not the duty of the members of the Alliance, at the next convention, should be that of bringing up for discussion several major issues, some of which are:</p>
   <p>1. Introduction of a graduated death benefit fund.</p>
   <p>2. Publication of a Dziennik Narodowy (National Daily).</p>
   <p>3. The Immigration Bill cause.</p>
   <p>4. Search for suitable places for colonization.</p>
   <p>5. Measures for extending education among the poles in America.</p>
   <p>6. Measures for settling the differences which have sprung up at the various Polish parishes and have brought shame to the Poles at large.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Poles who are concerned about the honor of their nationality to take steps to improve their position. The misunderstandings <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>which have arisen within our ranks have lowered our position in the eyes of civilized peoples and give the best evidence to our enemies to prove their claims that we are not politically mature or fit to be self-governed.</p>
   <p>7. To pass resolutions which would prevent accepting applicants who are too old for membership; those who have had the opportunity to get into the organizations for many years; sickly persons; or those whose wives are ill.</p>
   <p>8. Continued support of the Polish National Fund at Rapperschwil, Switzerland, and co-operative work with the Polish Immigration Alliance in Europe.</p>
   <p>9. Closer relations with the Poles in Brazil.</p>
   <p>10. A special and general fund for delegates.</p>
   <p>11. Support of the Falcons, Singer's Alliance, and the Polish Youth Alliance of America, since these organizations work hand in hand with the Polish National Alliance, for they can accomplish a great deal for the Poles.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>This will help to eliminate any controversy which may arise at the convention because the delegates will know that serious matters are to be taken up.</p>
   <p>The convention also ought to consider the matter of a more solid organization.</p>
