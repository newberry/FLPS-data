   <p>We wish to call the attention of our fellow men to an important affair, from which we may benefit in the present and the future. It is solely an affair of citizenship. It is a known fact that a great number of Poles came and live here; we find many here in Chicago who possess qualified rights for American citizenship, but alas! they did not take advantage of these rights.</p>
   <p>Carelessness indicates lack of intelligenge; it likewise portrays lack of ambition and, besides, this carelessness is very injurious. We are held for public criticism by those who are American citizens; we are deprived of organized strength in politics, the politics of our country.</p>
