   <p>Yesterday afternoon at a combined meeting of representatives held at the Roman Catholic Union building, a motion was passed consolidating and uniting all Polish organizations in America. It was decreed that one joint committee would be formed which would be called the Polish Central Committee in America.</p>
   <p>Up to the present time the following organizations have joined: Polish National Alliance, Polish Roman Catholic Union, Alliance of Polish Falcons, Polish Women's Alliance, Union of Polish Clergy, and National Council. Several smaller organizations have declared their intention to join but were unable to send their representatives to yesterday's meeting.</p>
   <p>It was decided to support and maintain separately all five treasuries of the organizations, but to place their funds under the control of one joint administrative board. An appeal was issued to the people asking them to make sacrifices and contribute to the Polish cause. Mr. A. Karabasz, censor of the Polish National <span class="page-break">\2</span>Alliance, was unanimously elected president. Mr. P. Rostenkowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, and Mrs. A. Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance, were elected vice-presidents. Mr. S. Osada was elected secretary. It was decided that the most prominent Poles throughout America should be included in this committee.</p>
