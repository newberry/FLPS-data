   <p>Saturday, January 7, the Avenue Cafeteria, 1250 Milwaukee Avenue, was the site of the interesting program presented by the G. Washington Post, No. I, of the Polish-American Veterans' Alliance at its annual installation of officers.</p>
   <p>That this organization has progressed through its energetic work was proven by the fact that Michalski's hall was filled to capacity, although this was the first affair planned on such a large scale.</p>
   <p>It must be conceded in the main that the various affairs planned by this organization have always been of the best. This was proven at the last annual affair, celebrating the end of the World War, for the Union hall could not find room for all.</p>
   <p>Merit for these successes lies in the fact that many of the veterans belong to <span class="page-break">\2</span>this post who have been very active in Polish affairs in Chicago. Let us hope that the ranks of this organization will pass the one thousand mark, then the fruits of combined action will become even greater. A regular meeting of this post will be held this evening at 8 o'clock in the Atlas hall, 1436 Emma Street, near Noble.</p>
   <p>The regular program of Saturday's affair started before eleven o'clock in the evening. Before and at the end of this program, dancing prevailed to the strains of a fine orchestra made up of veterans.</p>
   <p>The program was officially opened by John Korczak, one of the outstanding workers of the post. He called upon toastmaster Francis Glowacki, one of the organizers of the Polish-American Veterans, who was instrumentally active in the organization at its conception.</p>
   <p>After the playing of American and Polish hymns, the toastmaster presented a very interesting talk. This was followed by the installation of the new officers of the G. Washington post under oath, which was delivered by F. Kemp <span class="page-break">\3</span>present commander of the Polish-American Veterans. The same oath was also taken by the women's auxiliary, whose president is Mrs. Przeslawa Kobrzynska.</p>
   <p>The first speech of the evening was delivered by Commander Kemp, who appealed to the large audience to make an earnest effort to increase their membership. He also appealed to the audience in general to support functions of this post, as well as the women's division.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Parewska sang a group of songs. The audience rewarded her with generous applause.</p>
   <p>The next speaker of the evening was the former commander of the P. A. V. A. (Polish-American Veterans' Alliance) Leon T. Walkowicz, who has and is always willing to offer his assistance to affairs of this nature. Incidentally, he was one of the first organizers of the above mentioned Alliance.</p>
   <p>A violin solo was rendered by Eugene Lukaszkiewicz, and also by Edward Rosczewski.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Miss Victoria Roslzewska played the piano accompaniment.</p>
   <p>The work of the P. A. V. A. (Polish-American Veterans' Alliance) was summarized by the well-known veteran of the Spanish and World Wars, Sigismund Wisniewski. He was followed by George Wojciecaowski, who rendered a piano solo.</p>
   <p>The newly elected president of Lodge 41 of the Polish National Alliance, B. J. Kozlowski, made a speech in the name of his group. He also appealed to the audience to support the G. Washington post.</p>
   <p>Joseph Gorski, commander of the P. A. V. A. (Polish-American Veterans' Alliance) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the entire State, who attended this affair with his charming wife, spoke in the name of the veterans of his State. He made an appeal to all the Legion posts of this State, as well as those of Chicago, to work harder and more energetically this year in instituting new posts.</p>
   <p>Mrs. P. Kobrzynska followed with an interesting discussion. She is the wife of <span class="page-break">\5</span>Dr. John. P. Kobrzynski, and president of the Women's Legion, Post #1.</p>
   <p>"The Women's Legion," said Mrs. Kobrzynska, "is at your service, and will arduously work for the poor invalids and sick members of G. Washington Post. Make an effort to get as many women as possible to join our ranks, for the more there are of us the more we will be able to accomplish."</p>
   <p>The last speaker of the evening was Vincent Celmer, commander of G. Washington Post. He thanked the entire audience including the members of the program committee, and commended Messrs. W. Wisniewski, Trybulca, and Pawelka for their work.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the toastmaster thanked everyone for their kind indulgence throughout the program. The entertainment started after this speech.</p>
   <p>It must be added that Anthony Haskiewicz, former director of the central administration, took part in this affair with his wife, Veronica Haskiewicz, who is president of the Women's Legion at the Town of Lake Post.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The central administration was represented by Commander-in-Chief John Dadowicz, Adjutant General John Stanek and Director Lyjak, including correspondent Henry Trawinski.</p>
