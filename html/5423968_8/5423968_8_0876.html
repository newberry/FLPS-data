   <p>Three years ago, when the Chicago societies introduced Polish Day in Chicago, the action met with the approval of all the Poles in Chicago. The Polish Day celebration of 1927 will be held on July 17, at Riverview Park, Western and Belmont Avenues. The program is being arranged by a special committee of representatives of all Polish organizations in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The net proceeds of Polish Day are divided in two equal parts, one of which is turned over to Polish welfare organizations, and the other to the scholarship fund for Polish youths in unniversities.</p>
   <p>To make this Polish Day a success, the program committee makes an appeal to all Polish organizations, societies and clubs not to sponsor any picnics, dances or other functions on this day.</p>
