   <p>Under the foregoing title, Gezeta Katolicka has published the following article:</p>
   <p>"There are individuals who maintain that it is useless to do anything to preserve the Polish nationality in America, as it will be drowned in the Anglo-Saxon sea, anyhow.</p>
   <p>"We do not belong to the rank of these prophets. We do not, because we cannot believe in this ominous prognostication that the Polish nationality cannot last very long in America, that in time it will lose itself in the mass of the American people. Should this happen, it will be our own fault, for this might occur only if we were too weak or incapable to exist as an independent nation. We are not confronted with this danger today because our number is growing daily, because we build new churches every little while, because we build our own schools, because we establish new settlements, and because we form new organizations which contribute toward the preservation of our nationality. For this reason the Polish spirit is greatly animated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"However, all of us sense that this favorable condition cannot last forever. We all must admit that if we desire to help our immigrants to establish Polish settlements, if we desire to present them with opportunities to become prosperous and acquire the Polish spirit, we must be well organized like other nationalities, which have strong influence, as for example the Swedes and the Bohemians, who have strong influence despite the fact that numerically they are a hundred times smaller than we. And let us look at the Irish, how strong they are, and what powerful influence they exert upon the fate of their native island. And why are they able to do this? They are able to do this because they are united, and in Union there is strength. Could we not, united, serve ourselves and our native land? Irish and Germans have organized protection for their immigrants in this country. They have immigration homes in port cities, free employment bureaus, and colonization associations. Finally, they have high schools, banks, and strong influence in politics and in private life.</p>
   <p>"We Poles should also have all this, and we will have it provided we convince <span class="page-break">3</span>ourselves that there is strength in unity, provided that once convinced, we forget our differences and endeavor with all our might to unite ourselves. We should endeavor to do this, so much more because our motherland demands it. It may be said that she is extending her imploring hands toward us, as from a grave of bondage, and she seems to call to us as a mother to her children: 'Love one another.' This unity, now so greatly needed, is the aim of the Polish League of America. The creation of this unity and the national strength emanating therefrom is the principal aim of the League. Bound by this unity, and with the help of God, we will resist denationalization successfully and be able, as Mr. Jerzmanowski, president of the League, said, to serve our motherland and ourselves.</p>
   <p>"What is the Polish League of America? Whence has it come? These questions have been discussed many times, but it won't hurt to return to them again.</p>
   <p>The Polish League was born in 1849 in Western Poland, in the province of Posen. Its originators were a group of well-thinking people headed by</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Archbishop Przyluski. Its existence was short, because the Prussian government did not like its activities and suppressed it. But the work initiated by the League was not lost. The nation awoke as if it had been touched with a magic wand, and began to work. The League held bazaars, improved the Polish industry, established co-operative stores and banks, paralyzed Jewish influence and Jewish trade, and founded a students aid society....the aim of which was to give financial support to poor students. The seed planted by people of magnanimous heart in our fertile soil brought rich fruit. Today our people in the province of Posen think constructively as good citizens, for which they are indebted to the Polish League.</p>
   <p>"When the discord among the Poles in America reached its peak, while the children of one mother shackled in fetters were busy accusing one another, many times without any cause and more often than not on account of trifles, a group of good people, who had no selfinterest but the welfare of the people at heart, got busy to figure out a way to put an end to our fratricidal war.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"Then came the year of Kosciusko, when it was absolutely necessary to stop quarreling and establish God's peace and order. Then someone suggested the plan (and we purposely leave out the names of the founders) of founding a Polish League in America, on the order of the one founded by our forefathers in the province of Posen fifty years ago. What was beneficial and fruitful for them fifty years ago would not be detrimental to us. This idea found many supporters among the people who look soberly and without prejudice at our problems. At a mass meeting held in honor of Kosciusko, the foundation for the Polish League of America was laid."</p>
