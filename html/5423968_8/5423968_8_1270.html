   <p>The Polish newspaper Polonia, edited in South Chicago, recently attacked the committee on arrangements for the exercises commemorating the November Revolt. It also made unbecoming remarks about the speakers present at this occasion. The attack was made, according to the newspaper, to prevent any agitation on behalf of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>To tell the truth, there is nothing evil in propagandist activity; it is permissible and proper for everyone everywhere to agitate on behalf of the Alliance as one of the best Polish organizations.</p>
   <p>The committee on arrangements, however, informs the Dziennik Zwiazkowy that a general meeting of representatives of all societies present at this patriotic exercise was called immediately and it was decided unanimously that there was no such agitation.</p>
