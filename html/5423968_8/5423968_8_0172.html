   <p>How to make a criminal out of an honest man? There is a short answer: In America a criminal can be made with the aid of the law. Anybody can be locked in jail if any good-for-nothing can secure a warrant, even on a false accusation. This system is manufacturing criminals. If a young boy, for a minor offense or often totally innocent, just once is locked in jail, it is often the case that he, after leaving jail, will detest and hate society, the police, and authorities, which will push him deeper and deeper in conflict with the law, and in a short time he will become a declared and hardened criminal. In no other civilized country is it so easy to go to jail as it is in this land of freedom. He who kills ambition and shame, breeds criminals.</p>
