   <p>Considering that all our Polish organizations and societies, as well as all true Poles personally, are endeavoring as much as possible to help our fellow countrymen in Poland, suffering from hunger and all kinds of misery, by collecting offerings for this cause; and,</p>
   <p>Considering that the periodical Free Poland, edited by the Polish National Council in America in the English language, with the aim of informing those of other nationalities about the Polish question, like-wise needs material help so that it can carry as far as possible the word about Poland, so that it can more effectively and universally rouse public attention to the Polish cause, with the aim of developing an opinion favorable to this cause in the nations of the world, and in diplomatic and political circles; therefore,</p>
   <p>Be it resolved that the Polish Democratic League of Cook County spread <span class="page-break">2</span>its activity in the spirit of its constitution and in the field of clean Polish politics, believing that with its influence it will repeatedly be in a position to add a hand to the realization of our aims and the national problems, together with our proper associations working in this thought, further,</p>
   <p>Be it resolved that the League as its first act in this direction aid the Polish political national publication, so called Free Poland supporting this national periodical, so that it would not only further spread information about our Fatherland, but so that it can be able in the future to develop in the field, struggling more effectively with its foes; finally,</p>
   <p>Be it resolved that we call upon all the members of the League and upon our countrymen generally, as well as those of other nationalities, with a plea, that they support the funds of the publication Free Poland with their gifts, and that the League make the initial offer <span class="page-break">3</span>for this noble cause.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee of the Polish Democratic League of Cook County.</p>
   <p>F. P. Danisch, President.</p>
