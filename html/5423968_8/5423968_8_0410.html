   <p>Not long ago there was founded a citizens league in Chicago whose main problem was the Americanization of non-citizens of Polish descent.</p>
   <p>The work of the citizens league, we should imagine relies exclusively upon inducing non-citizens to obtain their citizen papers and to furnish them the necessary pointers.</p>
   <p>The undertaking is undoubtedly good - recognition is due to the initiators and workers.</p>
   <p>But the best thing can be spoiled through improper use and treatment.</p>
   <p>Americanization does not belong to simple matters. An instructor giving pointers to non-citizens can unknowingly fall into fake Americanization and do more harm than good to the citizens of Polish descent.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>We believe that the instructors of the new citizens league understand their task well. We know several of them personally, nevertheless, we wish to call attention here to persons interested in the proper treatment of matters pertaining officially to the citizens league.</p>
   <p>Already in their first official statement, the league refers to non-citizens as "pests" and "parasites."</p>
   <p>We dare to claim that such disparaging reference to non-citizens rather tends to discourage non-citizens than to awaken in them the confidence in the citizens league so much desired.</p>
   <p>By bestowing such a name on all non-citizens, we insult our fathers and forefathers, who came here from Poland and other places. What is more, we insult Columbus himself, who consequently taking the thing, had to be a "pest" and "parasite."</p>
   <p>Non-citizens in reality are the most productive part of American society.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>They give to the country ability, strength, energy, in a word, everything that is best within them,and in return receive only a piece of bread.</p>
   <p>Non-citizens do not have the right to vote; cannot occupy an office; cannot benefit from the many rights and privileges of citizens; they cannot enter into the course of city, state and national affairs.</p>
   <p>Non-citizens are not "pests" and "parasites," but rather are injurers of themselves. They harm themselves. They deprive themselves of many rights. They become a burden, in many instances, to themselves. But to their country they are a priceless acquisition, and naturally that is why they do not belong to the category of radicals, bolsheviks, open or secret foes.</p>
   <p>In giving pointers to non-citizens it is proper to raise this particular point, and to explain to them that by accepting citizenship they will gain all of that which to them as people is justly due.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Furthermore, the instructors should, in giving hints on citizenship, always mention the difference between fake and real Americanization. We have written about this during the past two weeks quite extensively.</p>
   <p>Here we wish to add that a non-citizen of Polish descent does not divest himself of his character, nationality or ancestry by accepting American citizenship; nor his place in Polish organizations, in Polish parishes, and in the Polish school. He should feel that he is a part of Polish power, which is composed of immigrants and their children in America.</p>
   <p>In this collective Polish power lies the strength of every individual citizen of Polish descent. If that strength weakens, all of us become weak along with it.</p>
   <p>We wish success to the citizens league. Let it Americanize non-citizens, but in the right direction. Let it give them the best pointers but not deprive them of Polish strength and character, or as the Rev. Kruszka says, "Polish individualism."</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>We wish that among the workers there would be as many individuals as possible with a comprehension of true Americanism, who know how to defend those non-citizens from false Americanism.</p>
