   <p>(Letter from Mr. Anthony Czarnecki, associate editor of the Chicago Daily News.)</p>
   <p>To the editors: Please call the attention of our countrymen, especially our young men, through your paper and other Polish publications, to an important matter, a matter which has recently come not only to my attention but to the attention of many of our brethren as well.</p>
   <p>This concerns the present trend on the part of our young Poles--who are joining the American army and navy in relatively large numbers in order to serve the Star-Spangled Banner and our oppressed and unhappy Poland during the present crisis--to change their Polish names at the time of enlistment.</p>
   <p>I have noticed in several instances that our boys, upon joining the army or navy, change their names, handed down to them by their fathers, and give entirely un-Polish names, supposedly under the pretext of simplifying matters <span class="page-break">\2</span>for the Federal authorities.</p>
   <p>In order to prevent the continuance of this, I ask you editors to take this matter up in your publications as energetically as possible, pointing out the loss which Poland's cause suffers by such a changing of names on the part of our boys joining the army and navy.</p>
   <p>The more Polish names that appear among those who are fighting in the ranks of the Stars and Stripes, the more recognition there will be for the Polish cause in our Government circles here.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, every young man who enlists to serve this country, either in the army or navy, should remember that his name, if it is Polish and not American, will show in the future how much those of Polish blood now fighting helped their adopted country.</p>
   <p>By giving American names when enlisting in the army, instead of their own Polish names, these young Poles harm the Polish cause. After this war, when <span class="page-break">\3</span>Poland is free and independent, everyone who has changed his Polish name for an American name, and has thus concealed his Polish origin, will be ashamed and will blush when others point with pride to their fine Polish heritage.</p>
   <p>If someone feels that he has important reasons for changing a purely Polish name, especially in order to simplify its pronunciation for the Americans, for Heaven's sake let him at least change it to some other more easily pronounced Polish name, which at present will not too badly conceal the evidence of how many of our boys joined the ranks of the defenders of this country. After all, Pulaski's Polish name is not too difficult for the Americans to pronounce, and there are many other typically Polish names which will be easier for the Americans to pronounce than many purely American names.</p>
   <p>Young Polish men, stop and think this over, and warn others against changing their Polish names at this critical time. When the history of this war and the participation of the United States in it is written, let there shine <span class="page-break">\4</span>forth as many Polish names as possible among those of the heroes of this country who took up their arms. Let every soldier or sailor of Polish ancestry be registered under a Polish-sounding name.</p>
   <p>After all, in Poland our enemy forced foreign names upon us in order to erase all evidence of our nationality. Will we here in a free land at the present historical moment lend support to the work of our enemies by ourselves changing our Polish names?</p>
   <p>Could any of you, even at the present time, show evidence that Germans or others have changed their names for more American-sounding ones?</p>
   <p>It is best to keep one's Polish name, and if it is changed, for the love of God, let it be changed to some simple but nonetheless characteristically Polish name. There never has been a time when it was so important to keep Poland's name in the public eye as now during this war and in this country.</p>
   <p>Let us not give the enemies of everything Polish an opportunity during this <span class="page-break">\5</span>war to announce that Polish names and the Polish language are trifled with by the Poles themselves, and that for this reason the changing or ignoring of them by others is justified.</p>
   <p>Let us give our own Polish names in offering our services to this country, regardless of how they are mispronounced. Incorrect pronunciation is only a temporary matter, while registering in the army or navy is a matter for all time, because in the future historians will use these records as sources of important data.</p>
   <p>If I were not personally convinced of the spreading of this evil, evidently through the failure on the part of some of our young men to realize the importance of it, I would not bring this matter up at the present time.</p>
   <p>Knowing personally about these occurrences in the past few days from several directions and sources, I feel that it is my sacred duty to appeal to the young Polish men through the Polish papers not to follow the example of those few exceptions who through negligence have concealed the fact in the present <span class="page-break">\6</span>war that they as Polish children are serving our adopted country. Perhaps some of those who have assumed non-Polish names, on reading of their actions in the Polish papers, will rectify the situation by having their Polish names added on to their American pseudonyms in the official records.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Anthony Czarnecki</p>
