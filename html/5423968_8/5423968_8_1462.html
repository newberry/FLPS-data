   <p>All of our clerical newspapers admit that the Polish National Alliance is the most powerful organization in America. Pick up any newspaper and you will see that it writes about the Alliance.</p>
   <p>All are interested in the Alliance, all Polish newspapers write entire columns about Alliance affairs. It is quite a while till the convention but our papers are already writing about it. Willing or unwilling, they admit first place to our institution.</p>
   <p>It is most certain that little will be mentioned about the convention of the Roman-Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>This is very pleasing to us. We have won in the struggle of recognition.</p>
