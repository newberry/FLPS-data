   <p>The suicide of Michael Makucz (whose name was previously given as Makus), 31, of 2820 Short Street, reported by the police on February 5, took a new turn when his wife and a boarder, John Ulacek, gave a written confession of committing the murder. All the details of the horrible crime were given by them.</p>
   <p>Monday, February 4, the Deering Street Station was notified by telephone at 5 P.M. that a Pole, Michael Makucz, had committed suicide by cutting his throat. Two police officers were sent to investigate and found Makucz dead, with his throat slashed, lying in bed. It was apparent that Mr. Makucz had committed suicide.</p>
   <p>The police, however, after further investigation, found that the couple were not happily married, that the husband was jealous and accused his boarder, Mr. Ulacek, of secret relations with his wife, and that the couple was known not to have lived in harmony recently. From this, it was adduced that perhaps <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>murder had been committed. Questions were put to Mrs. Makucz, who informed the police that her husband came home intoxicated and a quarrel ensued. She left her husband in this state and went to visit her neighbor. When she returned a few hours later, she found her husband dead. Mr. Ulacek, when questioned, asserted that he found out about the incident later.</p>
   <p>The police also found out in the neighborhood that the widow had not been happy with her late husband, and as a result she was placed under surveillance. Various methods of questioning failed to produce a confession from her. Yesterday morning it was evident that the murderess had not had a restful night. She was questioned anew. The police told her that she must reconstruct the crime beside the body of her husband. Finally, an officer brought her to her senses and advised her to save her soul. In the end, Mrs. Makucz admitted the crime and in a shuddering voice said that she would tell the details of the crime to the court.</p>
   <p>The examination was held yesterday at the Deering Street Station. Prior to this, the scene of the crime was carefully searched by the police.</p>

   <p>When Mrs. Makucz was brought before the court, she held a five-month-old infant in her arms. At a distance sat Mr. Ulacek, who listened to her admission.</p>
   <p>"My husband and I," declared the murderess, "did not live in a happy state for a long time. My husband--it is of no great importance whether it was justified or not--was jealous of Mr. Ulacek, the boarder, and this often caused violent arguments between us.</p>
   <p>"Saturday there was another argument and my husband threatened to kill me and Mr. Ulacek.</p>
   <p>"I related this incident to Mr. Ulacek, and after a long discussion about all the unpleasant incidents, we decided to get rid of this situation once and for all and avoid further threats by murdering my husband.</p>
   <p>"Sunday, Makucz, as it often happened, went on a spree and returned the following day about noon in an intoxicated state. He started the argument <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>anew but soon went to his bedroom and fell asleep.</p>
   <p>"This was considered by us a most opportune time to execute our plan. After a short while, Mr. Ulacek stole into the bedroom, drew out a penknife, which was previously sharpened, and slashed the sleeper's throat. I watched all this as I stood by the door.</p>
   <p>"Blood began to gush out as if out of a stream. Mr. Makucz, coughing, raised his head, but lowered it shortly on the pillow. He quivered a few times and then everything was ended.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Ulacek and I brought a little order to the room, a kitchen knife was dipped in the blood of my murdered husband and placed beside the pillow. in order to make it appear as if Mr. Makucz had cut his own throat, after which I went to my neighbor.</p>
   <p>"After an hour, thoroughly composed, I returned to my home and shortly-after ward I dashed out to inform my neighbors. The penknife with which the crime <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>was committed was thrown into the stove and Mr. Ulacek left for a nearby saloon to drown his conscience....."</p>
   <p>After this, Paul Buziak, who was under suspicion, was questioned, but it was discovered that he was completely innocent in the matter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ulacek was not heard. Later, however, he gave a signed confession of his part in the crime. The details given by Mrs. Makucz were confirmed in the signed statement, but another particular was added: "When I placed the penknife to his throat," the guilty culprit writes, "fright enveloped me, and then Mrs. Makucz entered and held the awakening husband with all her strength to the bed until the act was completed." Mrs. Makucz meditated in silence when this was revealed.</p>
   <p>Both murderers were sent to the Cook County jail, where they will remain until their trial before the criminal court. No bond was set for their release.</p>

   <p>The late Mr. Makucz, as well as his wife, hailed from Jaroslawia, Galicia, where his father is a wealthy farmer. Both knew each other from childhood. Ten years ago, Mr. Makucz came to America and soon sent for his fiancee; they were married here. They lived happily for a few years until their friend, Mr. Ulacek, became a boarder. Then many arguments occurred, and finally this dastardly act was committed.</p>
