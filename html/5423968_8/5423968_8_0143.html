   <p>An important editorial on the Polish-American youth, in which the author discusses the causes of criminality among youths of 16-21 years of age, was published in the Dziennik dla Wszystkich.</p>
   <p>In this editorial the author emphasizes that the main cause of most of the crimes committed by youth lies in the fact that our young men spend more than they earn.</p>
   <p>A youth, not earning enough, and yet yearning for good times, attempts by holdups, robbery and thefts to get the necessary money for those "good times."</p>
   <p>The article ends with the following words: "Parents and the whole Polish-American community ought to understand one great truth. Give our youth a decent and agreeable family life. Don't let them run around loose. Don't teach them that the dollar is the only thing worth while. Show them the <span class="page-break">2</span>spiritual values of life.</p>
   <p>It is high time that our press takes up this very important question. The press is the main medium through which the vital problem of improving the moral and spiritual education of our youth can and should be undertaken.</p>
   <p>But unfortunately, the majority of our editors ignore the spiritual aspects of life. Many of them believe that a man is a soulless machine to produce dollars, to eat good and tasty meals, and to empty bottles of forbidden whiskey.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we should demand of our editors that they take up the problem of educating our community about the great moral and spiritual values of life; and about the need of cooperating with God, from whom we receive all we possess.</p>
   <p>Similar problems are being discussed by prominent American newspapermen, but our editors are too "smart" to play with these metaphysical questions.</p>
