   <p>A social gathering of the Hegewisch, Illinois post of the Polish Falcons of America met yesterday. Gymnastic exercises were performed by members of the teachers' group of Chicago. The mere fact that so many people attended, indicates that Group 169 will turn over a new leaf, and will progress satisfactorily. Until recently, this group was having difficulties. There was an influential person in this group who practically broke it up for his own personal reasons. From the large group which it formerly was, only twelve members remained. These, nevertheless, exerted all their efforts to keep the group from total dissolution. Of these, credit should be given primarily to Francis Kuzniara, Jacob Ginelski, and Anthony Kosiba. They spared no effort to keep this Falcon post alive.....</p>
   <p>At present, the group does not have an instructor. This is probably the main cause for its stagnation. Formerly Jozef Kosiba was the instructor. He was a very good one. On his departure for Detroit, Michigan, however, no one could be found who was qualified to take his place.</p>

   <p>The field for action is very large. The group has all the necessary apparatus--also apparatus for children. It has a large gymnasium at Mr. Ginalski's, and a little money in the treasury. There are plenty of young people in Hegewisch; and, such citizens as Mr. Antoni Kosiba and Jacob Ginalski, are wholeheartedly devoted to the cause of the Falcons. The material is there; the patrons will not deny their support; and the place is appropriate. The only thing necessary is a man who has adequate gymnastic training. This need will eventually be supplied when the group sends its best performers to the physical education school in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The group was honored by the presence of Mr. and Mrs. J. Lipinski. Mr. Lipinski is the commissioner of the Polish National Alliance for the State of Indiana. He spoke briefly, then introduced Mr. Henry Lokanski, secretary-general of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, and asked him to speak on matters pertaining to the Falcons. The speeches were preceded by wand, and paralled bar exercises.....</p>
