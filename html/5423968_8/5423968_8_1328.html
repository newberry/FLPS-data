   <p>Great national and social organisms strive continually to replenish their life-giving strength, that wanes with the years and causes a certain amount of stagnation to creep in. The Polish National Alliance is such an organism. For the past quarter of a century its entire mass of members has continually fought for its existence, for a possibility of development, for a better future, and to sustain Polish national ideals. For more than a quarter century it has exerted its efforts to defeat the opposition and hatred, the insinuations and ill will, of those who, unable to stand the good work done, wished to belittle everyone and put our people in the shade by egotistically making themselves appear brilliant.</p>
   <p>This constant struggle has necessarily exhausted the organization. Some have withdrawn from active work and wish to spend the remaining portion of their lives in peace. Others have begun to feel a decrease of energy; still others worked unceasingly until their dying days and refused to code their established position. There still are thousands of veterans left upon the battlefield of the Polish National Alliance, but it is difficult to demand more youthful effort from them. They continue in their work, but their numbers are waning. Individuals have to do the tasks formerly done by hundreds. Not many of these remain and they only wait for others to relieve and replace them. These others are the younger generation; it is their turn now to carry on the work begun by the veterans of the Polish National Alliance; it is their turn to carry the ideal work further, under the watchful eyes of experienced leaders, and to aspire to the goals found inscribed upon the banner of the Polish National Alliance. Consequently, the Alliance, like every other organism which hopes to live and be active, must continually rejuvenate itself.</p>
   <p>Various paths lead to the goal; one is purely material, the insuring of the young members; another ideological, the welding of national ideals into a unit paying homage to these ideals. It is the latter path on which the Polish National Alliance and the Polish Falcons Alliance in the United States are progressing together.</p>
   <p>They have united in adopting the principle of equality, freedom, and brotherly love. Both organizations understand the importance of this union because they profited from it in a comparatively short space of time. Young people idealistically inclined are enrolling in the Polish National Alliance. In the near future they will replace those who retire after exhausting their strength in the battle for the welfare of the Alliance. The Falcons, too, have gained strong foundations for their existence. They are well aware of the fact that an unarmed, untrained army, without reserves, must disperse in a short time and become extinct. They also understand that in every organization, even the most idealistic, there must also be material factors, upon which it can and must rely and without which the slightest provocation can bring the entire ideology to naught. Because of this, the Falcons acknowledge the need for mutual insurance, since, after all, that is our mutual national fraternal aid. Finally, the Falcons understand the motto: "In unity there is strength!" It is due only to this union that the Falcons Alliance is growing in an unusual manner and is beginning to take on the appearance of a powerful organization.</p>
   <p>It is due, therefore, to the understanding of all these benefits that the Falcons refused to be led astray. There were times of great trial. Evil-thinking individuals attempted to mislead and disperse the organization, but an overwhelming right-thinking majority withstood the attacks and remained at their posts, prepared for every eventuality. While only small groups of individuals have transferred themselves into the camp of the enemy, the banner of the Alliance has taken thousands of true Polish Falcons into its fold--men who make it the model of their ideals.</p>
   <p>The Polish Falcons have given a good account of their rights. The Polish National Alliance has proof that it is worthy to care for brethren who know how to withstand opposition. It is worthy of the assistance of those who are not broken by the strongest of enemies. The Polish National Alliance can look bravely to its future because a righteous and strong volunteer (The Falcons) has come to its aid. United, these two organizations are in a better position to further their aims in a more progressive manner. When the present veterans of the Polish National Alliance step out of the ranks, they will be replaced by the capable younger set, trained by the experiences of their elders.</p>
