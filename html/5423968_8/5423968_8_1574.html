   <p>II</p>
   <p>In my last week's report, I described the work of the central beard of directors of the Polish League in America and its development during the first three months of its existence. To supplement by statement, I should add that, during this first quarter of a year, the League was incorporated in the State of Illinois, and that most of the members of the central board of directors were bonded according to the regulation prescribed by the Polish Mass Meeting.</p>
   <p>Last week, the League gained members in the State of Michigan, and a new agency (the seventh) was organized in Ludington, Michigan. It may, therefore, be said that the Polish League has members in all states in which Poles live.</p>
   <p>Today, I will attempt to acquaint the friends of the League and the public <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>with the outline prepared by the central beard for future work, which will and must be undertaken during the following quarters, before the next convention, which will be held is May, 1895. This, the second part of my report, is not official, for I was not authorized by the administration of the League to make it, but I am quite confident that it will not be indecorous on my part if I take the liberty of presenting it, because I feel that, as secretary of the League, it is my duty to present these plans to the public.</p>
   <p>Because of a very important reason, which I cannot disclose because it is outside of the jurisdiction of my office, the trustees of the Polish National Fund did not adept for themselves any rules or regulations, and they have not begun their activities. This matter must be finally and definitely settled during the next quarter. The trusteeship of the Polish National Fund, an authority equal in rank to the central board of the Polish League controlling some of its [the trustees'] actions, constitutes, in a way, a separate authority, but it must co-operate with the central beard of the League; therefore, a mutual understanding within a very short time is absolutely necessary.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>From now on, the central board of the League will direct its activities toward further development of the Polish League. The more agencies we will be able to organize in different Polish settlements, the more members the League will have the more opponents who are silenced by facts instead of words, the more <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the public will have in the central board, and so much the quicker the members of the board will realize their duties and perform them according to their ability. As stated above, there are nucleuses of the Polish League in all states in which Poles live; therefore, we hope that further organization work will be relatively easy. The return of the president of the Polish League from <span class="gap">[gap]</span> will undoubtedly contribute toward this, and the work itself will be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> by the already existing agencies.</p>
   <p>In the next <span class="gap">[gap]</span> at its <span class="gap">[gap]</span> meeting, the central board of the League <span class="gap">[gap]</span> appoint a committee preparing a detailed plan <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the and Welfare department prescribed by the constitution, and this <span class="gap">[gap]</span> will be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> at <span class="gap">[gap]</span> convention. Appointing of these <span class="gap">[gap]</span> will here sufficient time for preparing the plan, will be more <span class="gap">[gap]</span> <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>later on, when the membership of the Polish League will be larger than it is new--at a time when the choice of capable personnel is relatively poor.</p>
   <p>Baring this second quarter, the organization will be firmly established, more agencies will be organized, and the foundation for future development of the Polish League in America will be laid; in the third and fourth quarters, we may try to establish relations with Europe, as was propounded by the founders of the League (at the first massmeeting). In order to influence the European press favorably toward the Polish League in America, we must be able to show, not only plans and good intentions, but something that is tangible and well organized. Our countrymen in Europe are aware that the Poles in America held a general <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and that the Polish League has been organized--and they are very favorably inclined toward our plans. Attempts were made to discredit. us in their eyes, therefore we should not be surprised at their <span class="gap">[gap]</span> they will show their sympathy toward us when our plans become established facts, and there is hope that the Polish League in America will be able to present these facts six months after its establishment. Then it will be possible to give it <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>publicity in the Polish press of Europe, as was done here in America, and, though opposition is possible and even probable over there, as it was here in America, yet the victory will be so much easier if the facts proving the existence of the League are introduced.</p>
   <p>In carrying out these plans, the central boar of the League is confronted with difficulties arising from inadequate funds and the lack of opportunity to hold frequent conferences. If the central board of directors consisted of people who are wealthy, ready to make a sacrifice, devoted to the cause of the League--people who could serve without detriment to themselves or their families, if it had special agents who could travel continually, or funds necessary for such undertakings, then the League would undoubtedly make better progress. There is no doubt that the ideals of the Polish League are accepted with open hearts, and that the organization is supported everywhere, but, in our circumstances, where all transaction must be affected by means of correspondence (the more so when the press wields only a small influence over our people), progress must be very slow and the work tedious and painful.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>We desire to gain the support of 1,500,000 people, but we can reach only a few thousand of them through the press. This is very inadequate and, in this respect, we are surpassed by other nationalities, especially the Irish, among whom there are only a few who do not read papers.</p>
   <p>We need persuasive words. Of course, in gaining members, we will also gain helpers for propagating the League idea by words and deeds. We do not say that we cannot obtain great results, but we do maintain that the progress must be slow, and that the beginning is rather difficult.</p>
   <p>According to the declaration made at the mass meeting, this first year of the Polish League's existence is only a year of preparation. During this first year, the central board of the Polish League must be considered as an organization committee and its members understand their duties accordingly. At the coming convention, the central board can prove by facts that this organization has thousands of members in every state where Poles live, that agencies are organized wherever it is possible to do so, that departments are established <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>and their activities are outlined, that the departments have capable officials and workers, that the educational and the welfare departments are ready to begin their work, to open a bank, to hold bazaars, to organize workingmen's clubs, etc., that we have established relations with Europe, and that the sympathy of our countrymen has been gained. I do not think more could be expected. All this is not yet activity in the full sense of the word, but a preparation for activities. No one will expect more from the central beard in this preparatory year, especially if we take under consideration the difficulties with which we were confronted--hard times, lack of funds and strong agitation by our opponents.</p>
