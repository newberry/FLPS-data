   <p>There are many Poles born in America. If they have Polish sentiments, if they are Polish-American patriots, it is due to their parents and their teachers.</p>
   <p>What virtues should a Polish-American possess? Above all he is a patriot, not a partisan. He supports only a good cause. He pays his taxes and bills. He is well informed in all public affairs and is always ready to defend justice.</p>
   <p>In grave matters, he is not prejudiced against any race or color; he does not regard either a yellow or black-skinned man as an animal. He does not favor militarism, but is ever ready to defend his country in case of war.</p>
   <p>His heart beats stronger at the sight of the White Eagle or the Stars and Stripes. His mind follows the ideals of Kosciuzsko, Pulaski, Washington and Lincoln. He respects women, old and young.</p>
   
   <p>He looks straight into the eyes of the person to when he is speaking, and he speaks that which he thinks. Falsehood is strange to him. He respects industrious people and despises idlers. He is broad-minded and will not bear bigotry. He speaks quietly and slowly but thinks a little faster. He possesses a good sympathetic humor, but he laughs more with his eyes than with his mouth.</p>
   <p>If he suffers a material loss he does not lose much time by feeling sorry for himself.</p>
   <p>Once in four years he plunges himself into polities and runs for an office; he is even enthusiastic about it. He runs for office but after election he forgets all about and does not harbor any hate towards the party of the winner.</p>
   <p>He likes to make money, why not? Money is always necessary, but he is thoughtful of others, he likes to see his friends be prosperous. He envies no one, is not glad on account of someone's unhappiness.</p>
   
   <p>He does not like to show off before the poor how rich he is. He is charitable and helps others as much as he can. He likes to have a family and his own home, an occupation and a good name.</p>
   <p>He favors reforms but is not a revolutionist, neither is he stubborn in his conservatism. He is loyal towards his family, his friends and his country. Yet, his loyalty, his love, and his goodness is not expressed in words that would hurt others worse off than he.</p>
   <p>He is a gentleman in all his life, not because he offers his seat to a woman in a street ear or tips his hat to her on the street; but he also exchanges friendly words with his enemies as long as the enemy does not attack his religion, his flag or his woman. ( In Poland and some European countries they not only tip the hat but also kiss the women's hands, and repeatedly say, "I kiss your hand a little.")</p>
   <p>He does not invade and rob other countries in order to make himself and his country rich, because he does not want anyone to invade and rob his own. He wants to live in peace.</p>
   <p>He does not want his government to overpower the whole world. No! He only wants brotherhood and friendship with the whole world.</p>
   <p>This wish could be fulfilled providing all the parents and schools would try to cultivate these Christian virtues in our children.</p>
