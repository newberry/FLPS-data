   <p>All of the Polish-American veterans of the World War ought to unite in Polish organizations in order that they may sustain their Polish spirit away from their native land. There are here in America some of these American organizations, to which the Poles belong, but they only endeavor to denationalize them, command them to forget that they are Poles, and to keep in mind only that they are a hundred percent Americans. We are citizens of this country and fulfill all obligations regarding America. We always have and always shall continue doing so, but we also must remember that the faith of our fathers and the history of our nation must also be very dear to us. No one could influence me to deny my nationality.</p>
   <p>Although I am a citizen of this country, no one could tell me that the Polish culture is worse than the American, because I am quite familiar with the history of my native land and America's. I know by proven facts that several of these American organizations are against foreigners in <span class="page-break">\2</span>America, and are trying to have them deported back to Europe. That is why our obligation is to stand by our Polish class; to feel and remain Polish, while fulfilling our duties as citizens of America.</p>
