   <p>Sunday, Sept. 29, at the home of the Z. N. P., a concert and entertainment was given to raise funds for the Z. N. P.'s library and museum. The Polish public supported this concert so earnestly that the hall was filled to capacity. The program was made up of selections consisting of musical and vocal numbers and declamations, which were beautifully performed.</p>
   <p>Some of the numbers on this program were executed so dramatically that it was a pleasure to be present and witness them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ruy Steimann, violinist; Mr. Tomaso, mandolin-player; and Mr. G. Lo Verde, pianist, received tremendous applause for these beautiful musicals. Miss S. Kolakowska and Mr. W. Szuwalski were greatly applauded for their declamations.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Ernest, M. Nowakowski and Mr. J. Szymanski sang opera numbers accompanied by Miss K. Durska at the piano.</p>

   <p>Choirs from St. Stanislaus, United Polish Singers' Society, and the Chopin Choir, combined as one group, sang three pieces under the direction of Mr. Mallek. The applause was so great they returned and sang an encore.</p>
   <p>The program came to a close with Paderewski's Choir, which sang, "Order of Battle."</p>
   <p>The net proceeds of this concert were $260, which was given to the secretary of the Z. N. P.</p>
   <p>The Zgoda takes this opportunity to thank Mr. Kolakowski for planning and for making this concert a huge success.</p>
