   <p>The civic club Thaddeus Kosciusko, in St. Hyacinth's parish, Avondale, will hold a meeting Wednesday, December 27, at 7:30 P.M., at the parish hall. There are many important matters to discuss. Members are urged to bring along their friends who have not yet obtained their first or second citizenship papers. The club will aid them to get these papers, since its purpose is to help our countrymen in every way possible to become citizens of the United States. The secretary of the club is Mr. Francis Krocker, 2854 North Hamlin Avenue, well-known member of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
