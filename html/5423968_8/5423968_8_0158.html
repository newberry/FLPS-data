   <p>The Chicago police bulletins are publishing a vast number of crimes committed by our Polish-American youth. This is being tolerated because there isn't anyone who would care and look after our young Polish immigrants.</p>
   <p>Not until now have the people, people of good will, established an organization, with Judge Jarecki at the head of this society, whose chief aim is to extend care for the straying Polish youth in Chicago. This organization is something like a lantern, casting light upon our Polish children, taking them away from the hands of the police and guiding them upon the rightful way. We should and must come to the aid of such an organization.</p>
