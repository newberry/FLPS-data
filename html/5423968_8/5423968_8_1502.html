   <p>Meetings were held on December 3 and 6 by the newly organized Welfare Department of the Polish League. This new branch elected the following officers: Stanislaus Szwajkart, president; John Nering, vice-president; W. Burda, recording secretary; Francis Kwasigroch, financial secretary; Reverends Vincent Barzynski and Adolph Nowicki, spiritual directors (sic); F. Wleklinski, W. Jedrzejek and W. Jozwiakowski, civil directors.</p>
   <p>A number of motions were adopted at the initial meeting. A committee worked out the regulations for the Welfare Department which were adopted at the second meeting. It was agreed to divide the various duties among a number of committees, one of which, the Financial Committee, was chosen; others are in the making. This committee will be headed by F. Kwasigroch, W. Jedrzejek, and W. Jozwiakowski. The secretary was urged to make haste in getting in contact with the secretary general of the Polish League relative to the needs of all its agencies.</p>

   <p>A questionnaire is being prepared and will be sent out to all agencies. The purpose of this is to find out the conditions prevailing in each agency so that proper measures may be taken to remedy any situation that might hinder the development of the agencies. Among the other actions adopted by the Welfare Department were: organization of labor societies, political groups, building and loan associations or saving banks, according to the needs of Polish communities in various cities. It was also agreed to set up a Polish bank in Chicago, since there is no need to organize any building and loan association, because many are already in existence.</p>
   <p>Plans are being made to have all representatives of the League convene in Chicago in January.</p>
   <p>It must be added that, although the Welfare Department is set up to help the Polish League and its members, it will also give assistance to the general Polish public.</p>
   <p>From the beginning, as long as all the committees are not chosen, meetings <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the Welfare Department will be held weekly.</p>
   <p>This organization is also going to come to an understanding with the Educational Department, another department of the Polish League, and co-operate with them in their endeavors. The first step in this direction has already been taken Mr. Jozwiakowski, who is a member of the Educational Department, has been made a director of this group, and he has been consulted on plans for mutual assistance.</p>
