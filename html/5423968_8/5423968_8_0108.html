   <p>Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, pastor of Saint Hyacinth Parish, was robbed yesterday by a Polish youth who worked as a servant at the parish rectory. The boy, John Rezmarowski, 14, has been stealing small sums of money for a long time. The pastor became suspicious when he noticed small change was disappearing from the Sunday collection box. In order to make sure, the priest had planned to set a trap for him, but postponed the idea until he could get another boy to take Rezmarowski's place.</p>
   <p>Yesterday at 7:30 P.M. Reverend Sedlaczek left the rectory to perform his duties at the church. When he returned half an hour later, the pastor found that Rezmarowski had disappeared with about two hundred dollars. This sum was an accumulation of hard-earned savings that were to have been used to pay a part of the parish debt. Although the police was informed, no trace of the boy has been found as yet. The only report that has been received is that he is hiding somewhere in Saint Stanislaus <span class="page-break">2</span>Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>It must be added that the doors of the parish were locked indicating that the thief had a set of duplicate keys.</p>
