   <p>A beautiful thought has become a reality. A great work has been started, and now there is nothing else to do but follow the details of the plan, so that the young organism of the newly founded institution may be strengthened, that its imperfections may be corrected, and that it may be completed. Then there shall arise a great work, of which American Poles may be proud, and which they may regard as an honorable accomplishment, and say, with the Roman poet, "We have erected a monument which will outlast the bronze."</p>
   <p>The Polish-American community is still young, and has just passed the childhood stage. It consists of the sons of one mother, who were forced to live under three different governments. When these sons met on free American soil, they immediately felt that they were one family--and they united their aspirations into one common aim. This aim is to defend their national rights, and to <span class="page-break">\2</span>endeavor to gain political independence, to which we Poles, as a civilized and a Christian nation with rich literature and still richer history, are entitled; for very few peoples have rendered such great service to civilization, or shed so much blood in its behalf, as our forefathers did.</p>
   <p>Many roads lead to Rome. So there are many ways and means of defending and obtaining rights, for there are as many opinions as there are people. Every person is entitled to personal liberty and freedom of thought; every person also has the right to demand that these privileges be respected, provided that he endeavors to obtain them by honest means.</p>
   <p>The attacks on the projected Polish League, and the mass meeting, must have made a very painful impression upon every well-thinking person.</p>
   <p>No one has dared deny the noble, lofty aims of the mass meeting and the League, but some conceited individuals have, in spite of this, tried to frustrate this good undertaking and destroy good seed. Weeds will grow, even on a <span class="page-break">\3</span>well-cultivated soil; they start to grow abundantly, usually in the spring, but in a short time they are suffocated by the rich growth of good seed.</p>
   <p>The Polish people in America gave honorable proof that they possess good qualities, and that they represent good soil, because they did not allow the agitators to mislead them, but persisted in their undertaking; and there is good reason to believe that they will persevere, and convert their noble intentions into deeds.</p>
   <p>The weeds are still spreading, but they shall be subdued.</p>
   <p>I do not have in mind the opinions expressed by the entire party, for they expressed their opinion openly, and acknowledged the purpose of the new institution. With the help of God, the differences of opinion will be reduced to one common denominator, and then co-operation will follow.</p>
   <p>But this is not the issue.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>I have in mind the opposition of the separate individuals of ill will who, either by anonymous pamphlets or by secret agitation, are trying to weaken the confidence of the people, and who are trying to discourage co-operation by forecasting a gloomy future.</p>
   <p>Are these people not aware that the means with which they are fighting brand them?</p>
   <p>Only screech owls and bats hide in the darkness. Truth loves light. Like brigands, they lie in ambush and attack by surprise, because they are ashamed of the wicked means with which they are trying to disparage truth, and because they are degrading our reputation.</p>
   <p>It is true that American Polonia has, in its midst, several negative personalities, "Catilinarische Existenzen" (Catilinarian persons), as they are properly defined by the Germans; hence, it is not strange that there are individuals who hate everything that is good. For the same reason, they oppose solidarity in <span class="page-break">\5</span>order that they may "fish in troubled waters".</p>
   <p>Of unknown descent and questionable character, these individuals, after gaining some influence, by cunning and every other means, annoy society, and attack everything that is good. And wicked, anonymous pamphlets are their weapons. It is hard to discover the personnel of such a clique, It is not easy to penetrate the secrecy with which they are surrounded.</p>
   <p>As they do not believe in virtue, and do not know justice, they do not fear Gods' punishment. They are interested only in sowing evil, in exploiting the good nature of the people. And, as they cannot get satisfaction from the good which has been accomplished, they seek to hide their identity, to please their vanity, and, finally, to wreck everything that is good.</p>
   <p>Our people, by God's grace, possess too much common sense and decency to be misled by these false prophets. They know how to distinguish between good and evil. And finally, they know how to uproot the weeds, so that they may not <span class="page-break">\6</span>pollute good crop.</p>
   <p>However, it will not harm us to be careful, and find the source of these currents.</p>
