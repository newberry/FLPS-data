   <p>On Sunday, August 30, 1914, at 6 P.M., the Falcons held a successful mass meeting at the Adam Mickiewicz library and education room. The meeting was arranged by Group No. 3 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons; by Liberty, women Falcons' Group No. 24 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons; and by the Stephen Czarnecki Cavalry Division, Group 549 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons.</p>
   <p>It is regrettable, however, that the Tannenberg Group did not participate officially in spite of the fact that the president of this group was notified on Wednesday by the committee on arrangements that the work had begun. There was ample time--only good will was lacking.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stanley Marcinkowski, president of Group No. 3 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, opened the meeting, calling upon Mr. Joseph Dzwonkiewicz and the undersigned to act as chairman and secretary, respectively. Mr. Dzwonkiewicz invited the presidents and their wives, the veterans of the year 1863 [Polish January Insurrection], and the speakers to come up on the platform.</p>

   <p>The orchestra of Group No. 3 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons played a medley of Polish tunes. The audience applauded enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>Next there was a speech by Mr. Michael Wleklinski, gallant and well-known worker in the nationalistic field, who in his excellent and sincere speech called upon the people for united and harmonious work for the reconstruction of our homeland and appealed to them to make contributions to Poland's cause.</p>
   <p>Group No. 3 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons presented more music. President Stanley Marcinkowski then spoke, exhorting the young men to take part in the drills. In accordance with the order of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, the speaker called upon Szembarski, S. Balinski, and J. Sadowski to form a recruiting bureau. One man enlisted.</p>
   <p>Miss Emily Napieralski secretary of the Polish Women's Alliance, spoke. In her speech, full of feeling and emotion, she called upon both the young and the old to aid the unfortunate homeland, not only by contributing money but by offering their lives as well. The words of the gallant speaker made a deep <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>impression, and the audience rewarded her with a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>A collection was taken for the Kosciusko Fund. Misses Chrzanowski, J. Bauer, Balinski, and Michalski collected $41.83.</p>
   <p>Mrs. J. Bauer made a short speech, exhorting the people to unite at this critical time. The audience applauded enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>Next was a speech by Mr. M. Mezydlo, for many years a worker in the nationalistic field. The speaker explained that all the accusations against the Rapperschwil Treasury are unfounded because the Rapperschwil Treasury [Polish museum on foreign soil (Switzerland), established after partition of Poland and kept by private donations] exists and the funds have not been stolen. The audience applauded.</p>
   <p>Music by Group No. 3 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons followed.</p>
   <p>The next speech was by Mr. Zembrzuski, who was interrupted by the arrival of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>President Casimir Zychlinski and Editor J. Przyprawa, whom the audience greeted with a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, described the present tragic situation of our unfortunate homeland. The audience listened to this speech with tears in their eyes. Upon completion of the speech, the audience rewarded the speaker with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>Thereupon our gallant Mr. Michael Wleklinski again went around the hall, this time collecting for cannons and ammunition. The collection yielded $11.62.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Przyprawa, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, described in his speech the results of the present war and its consequences, arguing that Poland must be free, because its geographic situation demands this. The audience received Mr. Przyprawa's speech with a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michael Wleklinski asked Mr. F. Lukaszewski to take the collection box and make the rounds of the hall again, because our homeland needed money.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Mr. Lukaszewski granted the request and collected $4.07.</p>
   <p>Then, on Mr. Wleklinski's suggestion, Mr. Dzwonkiewicz ordered Mr. Szembarski and Mr. A. Taff to stand at the doors with boxes and collect for the Kosciusko Fund. They collected $2.93.</p>
   <p>Our gallant Mr. Wleklinski then addressed a few remarks to our sister Poles, which speech the audience received with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mrs. J. Bauer announced that the women's society Development, Group 48, had appropriated fifty dollars for the war fund, which sum is to be handed over to the board of directors of the Polish Women's Alliance.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Dzwonkiewicz announced that the collection had brought in $60.45. He thanked the speakers for their trouble in the name of the United Falcon groups, especially Miss E. Napieralski, secretary of the Polish Women's Alliance; Mr. C. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance; Mr. J. Przyprawa, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy; and the director of the orchestra of Group No. 3 <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, as well as the audience, which showed by its large attendance and its exemplary behavior that it understood the gravity of the times.</p>
   <p>The meeting was closed by the singing of "God Save Poland."</p>
   <p>For my part, I can add that the members of our Bridgeport audience took home with them an excellent impression, telling one another that they did not remember ever having had such a successful meeting.</p>
   <p>Therefore I ask you again in the name of the Falcons of our district not to send the collectors who are collecting contributions to the Kosciusko Fund and for the Department of Independence away. To those who besmirch us, everlasting shame for being traitors to the sacred cause.</p>
   <p>Stanley Golski,</p>
   <p>secretary of the mass meeting.</p>
