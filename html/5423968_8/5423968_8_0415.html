   <p>A league has been organized during the past few days by a group of Poles, whose aim is to stage the broadest compaign possible in the City of Chicago and County of Cook, in order to train and urge all non-citizens of Polish descent to obtain their first and second citizen papers, at the same time giving them the necessary instructions on subjects that each applicant is required to know.</p>
   <p>For many years past, much has been said and written in Polish newspapers about the obtaining of rights of citizenship by every Pole. There have been conducted, and are being conducted, schools of citizenship in many Polish sections and others. The United States government understands the need of naturalization and renders all kinds of assistance in this direction, supplying information, books, teachers and all kinds of other help. The political institutions of the United States demand that every person should take an active interest in the government of this country. The one that benefits from the privileges of citizenship should also fulfill the duties of citizenship. The political make-up of this country requires, that every man and every woman, who have reached their age of majority and possess at least an average intelligence, should take an active part in governmental functions, so that they could decide by their vote, who will occupy responsible political positions, who will set up the laws, who will carry out these laws, who will mete out justice, who and in what way will he or she dispose of the public money. Citizenship is a state, before which all public officials are responsible, which is the final source of every authority and every law and without which no state or government can function or exist.</p>
   <p>In a democratic country all people are equal. All benefit from the same laws and privileges in the same measure.</p>
   <p>All have the same protection. All can endeavor to demand justice in the same courts for wrongs done to them, all benefit from the same freedom of speech and the right to organize, from an equal liberty of religious belief, from an equal right to earn a livelihood and becoming wealthy. The people possess all the authority, which in the constitution and statutes they have delegated to their representatives. That is why ina community of such a make-up, an individual, who does not take upon himself any duties, and only cares to benefit from privileges which all enjoy, is an anomaly.</p>
   <p>In spite of being called upon, both orally and in writing, in spite of threats and pleas, in spite of appeals and addresses, there are yet very many Polish men and women in our city who have not taken even the first step toward acquiring rights of citizenship.</p>
   <p>There exists a law in the State of Illinois and in many other states, that after a certain number of years, a non-citizen cannot be an owner of real estate. A bill is before the Congress of the United States, according to which every non-citizen man or woman will be forced to register and pay a special tax. In the presence of such legislation naturalization is still slow among our countrymen. It should not be so. Intelligent Poles in this city have organized The Naturalization League of the State of Illinois, which will put on a training campaign in the city and county, which will not omit any Polish section, which will try to get every Polish man and woman to take out their citizen papers at the earliest possible date. Wherever schools already exist, they will be incorporated in the general field of action. The schools will be conducted regularly by competent instructors. All possible help will be given the applicants so as to simplify the way for them and speed up their joining the ranks of citizens.</p>
   <p>At the organization meeting of the Naturalization League of the State of Illinois, which was held last Monday at the Illinois Athletic Club downtown, the following officers were elected: Prof. M. Szymczak, President; Mr. A. Maciejewski, Vice-President;for Cook County; Mr. W. Kaszuba, Secretary; Mr. Paul Drzymalski, Treasurer. The executive committee will consist of the following: Messrs. S. L. Kolanowski, S. I. Witmanski, J. A. Lasecki, W. Krawiel, J. J. Chemma, F. Brodnicki, F. J. Tomczak, J. Gagol, J. Mucha and others.</p>
   
   <p>The league will cooperate with those who are already working in this direction, and will not try to impose its direction on anybody. It will occupy itself with agitation and information about the necessity of citizenship. It will furnish instructors where needed. It will support by advice and encouragement, and will also render its moral support. It will not spare active support but will harmonize with those who are already working in this field. It will make efforts so that this work will bring the best and most remarkable results.</p>
   <p>Schools of citizenship already exist in many Polish sections, from which have come many citizens. These schools owe their beginning to a campaign initiated eight years ago by Mr. S. Kilanowski, with the cooperation of Dziennik Chicagoski, whose co-editor he was at that time. This work is bringing today a rich harvest. Mr. Kolanowski never neglected this work and at present in the League he is taking up the same work even on a larger scale than he did eight years ago.</p>
