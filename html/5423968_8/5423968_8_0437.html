   <p>Businessmen of the Chicago Avenue district, covering an area from Hermitage to Noble streets, opened the Christmas shopping season amidst a gala celebration. A new lighting system, which was recently installed, was officially put into operation. The large electric lights added brilliancy to the gaily decorated store windows, lamp posts, and streets. Lively music filled the air. Along with this, many bargains were featured to attract the large throngs of people. The entire locality of the Holy Innocence Parish took part in the special dollar day bargains. Outside of the State Street shopping district in downtown Chicago, Chicago Avenue offers the greatest values in silks.</p>

   <p>At the head of the Chicago Avenue Businessmen Association is the well-known financier Joseph Ruszkiewicz. It was through his untiring efforts that the fruition of this organization was possible, including the new lighting system. All Polish businessmen are at the head of this organization, not other national groups. The Polish people are the dominant factor in this vicinity.</p>
   <p>There is a great deal of talk going on about the widening of Ashland Avenue and Robey Street. City directors are taking down the cost of the real estate. It has been said that the matter has gone into the hands of the court. It will be a long time before any favorable decision will be reached, not mentioning when the work will begin. Chicago Avenue businessmen are going to watch the outcome closely and see that this <span class="page-break">3</span>improvement does not damage the property of the owners. It has been rumored that a pool room is to be erected at one of the corners of Chicago and Ashland Avenues. The businessmen have already taken this up with the court authorities and an injunction has been asked for, to restrain any such plans.</p>
   <p>John Sobieski's citizens' club of the Holy Innocence Parish has taken steps to have the present Republican administration clean the streets and alleys in this neighborhood.</p>
   <p>The new Alliance National Bank, Chicago and Ashland Avenues, of which <span class="page-break">4</span>Mr. Ruszkiewicz is president, has a capital of over a quarter million dollars. This is unusual growth for a bank. It must be remembered that this banking institution opened to the public just two months ago. It is apparent that the people have a high regard for this bank, for it is under federal supervision. The Polish businessmen have taken advantage of the checking accounts. This helps them eliminate countless hours over keeping books. [These who wish to increase their capital holdings are given the opportunity to do so by purchasing gold bonds that yield seven per cent interest].</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The bank is situated in a very suitable location. Three Polish parishes are within its immediate vicinity: Holy Innocence, St. John de Kanty, and St. Helen. The bank can be reached from any part of the city by streetcar.</p>
   <p>All the Polish people in this section of Chicago are happy because a Polish bank has been opened for their service. They need not fear speaking in their native tongue, for a Polish speaking representative is stationed at every window. The initial financial report of this institution will be issued shortly. Sending money abroad is one of the specialties of the bank; no one need have any fears. The Alliance National Bank has issued 50,000 of its own paper bank notes. The value <span class="page-break">6</span>of real estate and business has increased in this district considerably since this bank opened.</p>
