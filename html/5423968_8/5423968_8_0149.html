   <p>A New York subcommittee, investigating crime, reports that it is attributable to the senationally written, unhealthy and unsavory articles of periodicals seeking publicity. The subcommittee is protesting against this practice and points to the power of suggestion which affects especially the subnormal type. There is a necessity for censorship and, the subcommittee states, it may improve conditions but is, however, not desirable. Beyond doubt, the accounts in the newspapers contain only fragments of the editorial opinion; the only purpose is to increase the circulation and they do not assume the responsibility of elevating our moral standard. Reading about violence can readily lead one astray, especially the immature element.</p>
   <p>A non-critical reader, who peruses the crime topic in the aforementioned type of publications, is usually convinced that it is a courageous act and its perpetrator a hero; eventually, in a moment of weakness he yearns to emulate the desperado. It is a fact that the press devotes not only columns but sensational headlines - which are worshipped by youth - to out-laws, even after they are sentenced to die. It is also proven that murderers in death cells, awaiting execution, receive love letters from anonymous admirers.</p>

   <p>For the welfare of society it is necessary that we control the press, so that it confines itself exclusively to rigid business angles. The most effective results would be obtained through the power of public opinion. Another dangerous instigator of wickedness are motion pictures with a crime inciting text. These detrimental films have a devastating influence on the character of our youth.</p>
   <p>We know from history that censorship defeats its own purpose and often proves itself undesirable. It is exceedingly difficult to find censors who, in the course of their duty, will not err, and consequently we have undortunate results. These censors readily assert themselves as tyrants and bureancrats whose actions are more destructive than beneficial. Therefore, before we apply such drastic procedures, if only as an experiment, we must first try other methods, such as protests from the public and unrestricted discussions.</p>
