   <p>Instructions and explanations are offered to the people to answer frankly and truthfully all questions asked by census officials, as they are not representatives of any tax levying bodies but officials of the Federal Government.</p>
   <p>All civilized nations take the census, either every five, or ten years, in order to learn the true state of the nation.</p>
   <p>The consus-taking officials are sworn to secrecy and the government itself is not interested in individuals but in the people as a whole.</p>
   <p>The people must also bear in mind that withholding the necessary information is punishable by law. The Poles are also reminded and asked to remember that they should register their nationality as Poles, not as Germans, Russians, or Austrians.</p>
