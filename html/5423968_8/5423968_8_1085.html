   <p>In the last edition of the periodical, Free Poland, Mr. Leon C. Nika, a young attorney, writes on our organization.</p>
   <p>"Another of the Polish organizations is the Polish Roman-Catholic Union of North America, with a membership of 100,000 members, licensed as a fraternal benefit society in the State of Illinois in the year 1898. The Polish Roman Catholic Union is based upon the principles of the Roman Catholic faith and the national traditions of Polish Catholics for their mutual moral and material assistance. The assets of the Union amount to about $2,000,000. The Polish Roman Catholic Union has paid out in death benefits over $3,000,000; for disability to its members, over $31,000; and for educational purposes to its members $50,000. The Polish Roman Catholic Union has collected for the Polish war sufferers in <span class="page-break">2</span>Europe the sum of $30,000. It has its own library valued at $10,000, and has its own home located in the city of Chicago, valued at $190,000. The personal property of the Polish Roman Catholic Union is valued at about $4,000. The Polish Roman Catholic Union also has its own printing shop valued at $31,000, where the official paper for the organization is printed, called Narod Polski, with a circulation of 70,000. At the present time the Union is establishing a daily paper. In addition to the printing shops and library, which are located at their home, a spacious hall is found for banquets and social gatherings. Part of this building is divided into offices and rented out."</p>
   <p>From the above we can see that Free Poland is supporting our organization. It is not the first time that it has written about the Union.</p>
