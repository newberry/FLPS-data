   <p>This society has the purpose of promoting by word and deed the benefits of a higher education for Polish youth.</p>
   <p>It is urged particularly that the high education of Poles be gained in Polish institutions, wherever they exist.</p>
   <p>By word and pen the society will remind the Poles of this patriotic duty, to guide the parents who become negligent in this respect.</p>
   <p>Since the St. Stanislaus' College at Chicago is an institution of high learning, which with regard to results compares favorably with the American institutions of the same standing, it has the right to issue diplomas; for the reason the Students' Aid Society decided to pay special attention to St. Stanislaus College.</p>
   <p>The Society believes in its holy mission, and at the same time expects, that there is not a Pole who does not approve of the Society's purpose.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The society tries to interest all classes of the Polish communities with the wish that every Polish patriot, without exception, however poor he may be, will, must and may become a member of the said society.</p>
   <p>For that reason a minimum fee of $1.20 per annum was agreed upon (30 quarterly) which amount is sufficient for one to become a member of this society.</p>
   <p>Of course each patriotic member is allowed to make bigger contributions, if he wants to, so that the funds may grow.</p>
   <p>We apply in person or by letter to the sec'y: Kazimerz Neuman, 143 W. Division St. Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>The society thinks it is doing a patriotic duty by following the outlined program of education and high learning for the Polish youth on which their future depends.</p>
   <p>Although it was organized only four weeks ago the society has 76 members, among them the 76 years old historian and patriot, Zygmunt Milkowski, who is of the opinion that the Poles in the U. S. never will loose their warm and sincere love for their fatherland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The society expects that Poles, not only in Chicago but wherever they live in U. S. will join this society.</p>
   <p>If these expectations are fulfilled, and the good results of our work begin to show then we may report to our brethren in our dear fatherland:</p>
   <p>"We watch and we will be ready." Chicago in September 1900.</p>
