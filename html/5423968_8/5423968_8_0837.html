   <p>As the Golden Jubilee Contest has been carried through under the auspices of the Ways and Means Commission, appointed by the Central Board of the Polish National Alliance, (P. N. A.) we deem it our duty to send, in the name of that Commission, our hearty thanks to the great army of Alliance men and women workers, by whose perseverance and energy the jubilee contest has proved to be a great success.</p>
   <p>We feel proud that we had our part in cooperating with so large a crowd of brave Alliance pioneers, whose jubilee accomplishments constitute a new mark in the powerful progress of the Polish National Alliance and give a further splendid testimony to the Alliance Brotherhood.</p>
   <p>Those great jubilee deeds and accomplishments give not only hope, but also an assurance that that army of Alliance champions will again readily stand up to the future call, and that it will move the P. N. A. a step forward towards the fulfulment of the duty, with which we have been entrusted by the will of the founders of the Polish National Alliance, namely, to unify all Poles in America in that Alliance.</p>
