   <p>The Polish League of America, which was organized in Chicago last year, has recently opened a new branch at Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Reverend Jachimiak is largely responsible for its opening, for he made all the plans.</p>
   <p>A dedication ceremony took place on March 21 in the school hall. Officers were also installed. M. Kaliszewski was appointed president.</p>
   <p>This is the nineteenth branch to be opened in less than a year. Long live the Polish League!</p>
