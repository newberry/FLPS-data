   <p>What is Avondale? Avondale is a section of Chicago, located in the northwestern part of the city, including Kosciuszko Park. Avondale is inhabited mostly by the Poles. A majority of them live near the two Polish Roman-Catholic churches, Saint Hyacinth and Saint Wenceslaus.</p>
   <p>Most of the early settlers of Avondale were Poles from the German province of Posen. When the Poles began to settle in Avondale, it was still a prairie. Almost all of the business was in Polish hands. At that time the Poles of Avondale patronized their own business, because they were from Posen, intelligent, patriotic and prepared for the struggles of life. Many intelligent Poles lived in that district and Avondale Polish settlement was proud of itself.</p>
   <p>However, this ideal condition did not last very long, for about six years ago there were about ten Jewish stores on Milwaukee Avenue between Diversey and Belmont Avenues.</p>

   <p>The most important causes of these unfavorable changes are undoubtedly the unenlightenment, lack of ambition and then, the World War.</p>
   <p>It is true that we have three Polish merchant organizations in Avondale, but there is no unity among them; they lack harmony and good will, consequently other nationalities are giving them good lessons.</p>
   <p>The second cause is the war. During the war many of our brothers living in other settlements accumulated little fortunes with which they decided to buy nice homes. As their old settlements were rather too old and well filled, they came to Avondale and with the accumulated money have built nice homes. Now comes a very interesting part. Most of these new settlers were used to patronizing other nationalities and they continued to do so in Avondale. Then, some of the old settlers followed the example and now the Avondalian Poles have nothing to be proud of.</p>
   <p>The Merchant Organizations. One of the oldest Polish merchants's organizations in Avondale is the Avondale Merchants Association, which was founded eleven years ago. This organization had its ups and downs, was <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>reorganized and improved by correcting its mistakes. At present it has 135 members who pay their dues, which are $10 a month. Altogether there are about 200 members in the organization.</p>
   <p>To this organization belong merchants conducting their business on or near Milwaukee Avenue. Mr. John Hojka, the co-partner of a great furniture store, is the head of its executive committee. This is not a Polish organization, but the Poles predominate in it. The difficulty is as follows: When there is a meeting of the organization, all the members of other nationalities attend it, but not the Poles. We are not there and they beat us. If this will continue much longer, it certainly will cause us serious damage.</p>
   <p>The second organization in Avondale is the Polish American Business Men's Association. This organization has about 63 members and most of them are old settlers. Some merchants belong to both organizations. The aim of this organization is to uplift our Polish commerce. Even the members of this organization do not support their own, more energetic members. Mr. Milewski, the owner of a shoe store, is the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>president of this association.</p>
   <p>The third organization of the Polish businessmen in this locality is the Avondale Country Club. This is a social organization, the purpose of which is not only to help its members in commercial lines but also to make their lives more pleasant. The membership fee is $100 and $25 a year. This organization has 73 members. At present the organization occupies a beautiful building on Milwaukee Avenue. They have over $2,000 in the treasury. The members of this club are also interested in politics and are supposed to support Polish candidates, but here again there is no cooperation.</p>
   <p>Final Remarks. Instead of one we have three merchant organizations for one and the same purpose. Why three small weak ones and not one strong organization? Because there is no unity among us, some people accuse us of having a good time instead of honest work. Statements were made that our young men are not interested in business. On the other hand the Polish merchants are being accused of very poor service and people are complaining that their stores are not up to date.</p>
