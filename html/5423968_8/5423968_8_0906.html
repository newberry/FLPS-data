   <p>A bill marked "S299" has been brought into the Senate on June 18, 1919, by Senator Myers, entitled: A Bill to prohibit admission to the mails of the United States of newspapers, periodicals, magazines or publications printed in a foreign language.</p>
   <p>This bill of a projected statute is contrary to the constitution of this country which guarantees liberty and tolerance. It tears down principles of justice and dishonors without exception the entire press and foreign language population. It discredits and disregards loyalty, patriotism, sacrifices and above all, blood and property, laid down by this foreign language population as an offering to the United States in its fight to bring freedom to all peoples. Therefore against this projected repressive statute, significant of despotism without limitation, the administration of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, in the name of its organization, has sent into the hands of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>every member of the United States Congress the following protest:</p>
   <p>The great World War ended with the triumph of those principles for which the United States always stood and which were enjoyed and cherished by the various nationalities that have settled in this country. They made it their home and became part and parcel of this nation. It became evident that in the spiritual and economic development of those nationalities, in their making as American citizens, humanity, justice and freedom have done more to make them loyal citizens than the Prussian system of forcible denationalization.</p>
   <p>The Poles, by their voluntary enlistment prior to the enactment of the draft law, by their generous investments in Liberty Bonds and War Savings Stamps, their donations to the Red Cross and their various other activities with which they supported the war, have given ample proof of their loyalty and devotion to this country and its government.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Being Poles by birth they naturally love their mother tongue, but upon their return from the battlefields, where many of them have spilt their blood for freedom's sake, these heroes find that a great many chauvinists in this country have become enemies of that freedom for which they fought, and have raised a standard with the inscription upon it, "Away with the teaching of one's native tongue even in private schools; away with foreign literature and foreign language press!"</p>
   <p>To that class belongs, unfortunately, Senator Myers of Montana, who recently has introduced in the United States Senate a bill to prohibit the admission to the mail of the United States of newspapers, periodicals, magazines or publications printed in a foreign language.</p>
   <p>Senator Myers wants the United States Government to do not only what Germany and Russia have been doing, but the very thing which the result of the world conflict has condemned. He wants to separate the United <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>States from the outer world by a Chinese wall in order to "Chinafy" this country.</p>
   <p>One need not be a foreigner in order to protest against such a bill. The idea is contrary to American tradition and every principle of liberty. No nation which is truly civilized would tolerate such a law, because such a law, besides being unjust, would be a hindrance to the cultural development of the nation. It would also tend to strain friendly relations between our nation and others; besides it would be contrary to the conditions embodied in the peace treaty.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in the name of the Polish Catholic Union of America, we enter hereby a most solemn protest against the bill and beg to ask you most respectfully to vote against it.</p>
   <p>N. L. Piotrowski, President</p>
   <p>I. Wroblewski, Secretary-General</p>
   <p>Chicago, July 21, 1919.</p>
