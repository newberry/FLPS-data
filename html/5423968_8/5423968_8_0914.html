   <p>On October 16, 1918, at a meeting of the 'Woodrow Wilson Polish American League of the State of Illinois," whose president is the president of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, Mr. Piotrowski, there was sent to the President of the United States the following telegram:</p>
   <p>Chicago, Oct. 14, 1918</p>
   <p>Hon. Woodrow Wilson</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>With unbounded faith in your judgment and statesmanship, we, the members of the Polish-American Woodrow Wilson League of Illinois, pray that in this momentous hour in the world's history, after four years of untold miseries and sufferings inflicted upon humanity throughout the earth by the most barbarous and cruel nation since the days of the Huns, you, Mr. President, the exponent of civilization, may be guided by divine grace to bring about peace to the world based on the high principles of justice and humanity, which will assure for future generations the rights of humanity, by destroying the autocracy which has been a continued menace to peace and liberty. Let the murderer of innocent women and children whose sword still drips with blood be compelled to surrender unconditionally and to pay the full penalty for his crimes.</p>
   <p>N. L. Piotrowski, President.</p>
   <p>Thomas Blachowski, Secretary.</p>
