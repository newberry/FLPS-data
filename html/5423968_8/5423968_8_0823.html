   <p>The Polish National Alliance's three-month levying contest has evoked in the P.N.A. communes and groups a noticeable agility and enlivenment.</p>
   <p>The contest presents a particular opportunity for both material and moral benefits to those, who shall engage themselves in enlisting new members into the P.N.A. during the time of the contest. Besides the $3 and $1.50 reward for enlisting an elder and a junior member, respectively, there is also a reward in the form of an excursion steamship ticket to Poland, for enlisting into the P.N.A., 50 new members during this pre-convention three-month levying contest.</p>
   <p>Knowing that there are in the United States about 4,000,000 Poles, of whom only about 300,000 belong to the P.N.A., it should be regarded as possible to enlist into the Polish National Alliance many new members. As <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>an example, we may quote the P.N.A. Group 2582, the Chicago Polish Women's Club, which within a few months has enlisted 200 women members, and which further resolved to attain before the next Sejm(Convention)a round figure of 500 members.</p>
