   <p>A most praiseworthy step forward has been taken by the Polish-American community and those who are responsible for organizing the Polish Welfare Association for the care of the Polish Delinquent Youth.</p>
   <p>The striking feature in the Juvenile Courts of the City of Chicago and Cook County is the great number of cases of Juveniles of our nationality - and the lack of proper care of them, by some responsible people who could aid them, and properly protect them from "pot luck", the ill-defined position of their cases, - in which they get the short end of equity.</p>
