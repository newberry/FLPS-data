   <p>A few months ago Archbishop Iveland said that the Catholic churches in our country, the United States, should be Americanized. This was an insult to all Polish parishes in Chicago as well as in the United States. Polish priests in Chicago are greatly opposed to the demands of Archbishop Keane and Bishop His to have all sermons spoken in the English language.</p>
   <p>Polish people are greatly opposed to this form of Catholicism compelling Polish Catholic people to listen to sermons spoken in the English language, when the majority of older people do not understand it.</p>
   <p>If this request is fulfilled, the Catholics will demand that the Germans, Italians, and all other nationalities do likewise. This question was raised by Archbishop Keane against the Poles. For what reason? Are the Polish parishes getting too rich? Are they expanding too fast or is it that the Irish want to dominate the Catholic world? Can't the Polish Catholics have as much freedom as other nationalities? Isn't the United States a land of freedom? It is, but that is no reason that the Irish should have more <span class="page-break">2</span>preference than any other nationality.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Chicagoski was the first newspaper to take up the fight on behalf of us Poles. This newspaper wants to remind us Polish parents that if our children grow up and cannot speak their native tongue, the whole blame will rest on the shoulders of the parents. Therefore, now is the the time to stand up and fight for your religious rights. In another article this paper pointed out that, according to the rules of the church and the Bible, no one can restrict the use and teaching in any language in Catholic schools and churches. When did Archbishop Keane and Bishop Eis think of this idea?</p>
   <p>It is true that Bishop Eis said in one of his speeches that the children in this country speak the English language better and more correctly than their own native tongue, but this is due largely to the fact that they came in contact with children speaking this language either in school or at play while their native tongue is spoken mostly at home.</p>
   <p>We, Polish people, should not trouble ourselves too much with the affairs of <span class="page-break">3</span>the French, the German, the Irish, or any other nationalities in regard to the church, but take care of our own interests. What are these countries doing to help Poland win back its freedom? Nothing. They want us Poles to be under the rule of other countries so they can do what they wish with us. Do they want to do the same with us Poles in regard to the Catholic religion?</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance took up the fight here and is doing everything possible in its power to awaken within the Polish people the urge to fight for their rights and their native language.</p>
   <p>Polish churches were built with the hard-earned money of us Polish people, who donated wholeheartedly; schools were erected, monuments in memory of Polish noblemen and heroes. Our museum and national treasury is a hundred times dearer to us Poles here than the museum and national treasury in Rappersville.</p>
   <p>By this time the Polish Courier printed an article: "We haven't any right to fight if we have nothing to fight for, but the Polish people would be blind if they didn't fight to protect their own name and nationality. We know that the existence of the church depends on the support of the people <span class="page-break">4</span>and their donations. We must and should do our utmost to protect and prolong the life of the Polish Catholic churches. It is our life, our backbone; without it we are lost. We should never deny in the eyes of anybody our Polish nationality; we should be proud of it.</p>
   <p>"No other nationality in this city can boast of as many churches, Catholic schools, amusement centers, and Polish clubs and societies as the Poles. Be proud of them, we need your support."</p>
   <p>The Polish priests are doing their utmost to make the Polish parents realize the worth of this fight. They do not compel the Polish parents to force the children to attend Polish parochial schools; it is up to them whether their children learn the Polish language or attend Polish schools, but this is a minor factor in comparison with the fight that we are confronted with at the present time. We are fighting to continue the use of the Polish language in our sermons, because it is our solemn duty.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we feel that Archbishop Keane and Bishop Eis will realize what <span class="page-break">5</span>it means to the Polish people to forbid then to use their native language; we feel that eventually this matter will be dropped.</p>
