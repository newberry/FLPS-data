   <p>Sunday September 20, the ceremony of the unfurling of the banner of the Society of the Sons of the Mountains on the Skawa, group 1524 of the Polish National Alliance, took place. This relatively young society (it has been in existence not quite two years) has one hundred members and an assured steady increase. The main contingent of members consists of compatriots from Zembrzyce in the western part of Galicia on the river Skawa, which flows into the Vistula.</p>
   <p>The ceremony was begun by a parade of several societies (one a military society in uniform) to the Alliance building, where the new banner was kept. At about 2 P.M. the societies began their parade marching along Noble, Augusta, Paulina, and West Superior Streets to St. Innocent's Church, at the corner of West Superior and Armour Streets. The parade was headed by Joseph Makarski, the chief marshall, on horseback. He was followed by the officers of group 1524, who in turn were followed by the color guards bearing the furled banner and <span class="page-break">\2</span>accompanied by many sponsors of both sexes. First came the society which had arranged the celebration, marching in columns of four, followed by other societies which were taking part in the celebration as guests.</p>
   <p>Among these the Thaddeus Kosciusko Guards, group 1299 of the Polish National Alliance, attracted especial attention by their uniforms and arms. The division of scouts following the Guards presented a very pleasant picture. Two bands played, one furnished by Prof. Przybylski and the other by the White Eagle Sharpshooters, who were taking part in the procession. Women's organizations, too, were well represented in the parade.</p>
   <p>One of the assistant priests of St. Innocent's Parish performed the liturgical ceremony of blessing the banner. The sermon delivered on this occasion had an inspiring effect upon those gathered, since it included a patriotic discourse concerning the difficult state of war in which our homeland finds itself at present. During the unfurling of the banner, sponsors assisted by holding <span class="page-break">\3</span>ribbons which were fastened to the pole.</p>
   <p>After the church ceremony the parade was re-formed and, accompanied by the bands, marched back to the Roman Catholic Union building via Armour, Erie, Noble, and Augusta Streets.</p>
   <p>The ceremony was continued at the hall of the Union building, where chief marshall and chairman of the committee, Joseph Makarski, opened the meeting and called upon Paul Danek, president of group 1524 of the P. N. A., to act as chairman, and Thomas Wojciechowski, secretary of Commune 75 of the P. N. A., to act as secretary.</p>
   <p>The chairman called upon Francis X. Wleklinski, of the Central board of directors of the P. N. A., as the first speaker. Mr. Wleklinski made a short speech dedicating the new banner of the Society of the Sons of the Mountains on the Skawa and handed it over to the president and the standard-bearer of <span class="page-break">\4</span>the Society.</p>
   <p>During the actual unfurling of the banner the band played appropriate music and the military society presented arms.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Dydek, president of Commune 75 of the P. N. A., to which group 1524 belongs, delivered the next address. The enthusiasm and sincerity of his words found a sympathetic echo in the hearts of the listeners.</p>
   <p>The Harmonia Choir, which was called to the stage, sang a number under the direction of Edward Krotochwila. The applause was so enthusiastic that the choir was forced to sing an encore.</p>
   <p>John Lipowski, a member of the board of directors, spoke in the name of the Society of the Sons of the Mountains on the Skawa, group 1524. The speaker promised that the Society would continue to work tirelessly for its own good <span class="page-break">\5</span>and the good of all and that the banner unfurled today, bearing the coats of arms of Poland, Lithuania, and Russia on one side and the seal of the Society on the other, would be an expression of its noble aims and its constant readiness to sacrifice itself for the homeland, which at present is going through the horrors of war.</p>
   <p>Michael Kmieciak, another representative of the Central board of directors, stressed the horrible fate of the Polish nation and its land on which the bloody battles of our three annexers, Russia, Germany, and Austria, are being fought. He exhorted the people to give to the cause of the homeland, which is in desperate need of our material help.</p>
   <p>Next the sponsors, called by name, went up on the stage and signed their names in the memorial book. Their names are as follows: [Translators note: Here follows a list of forty-five names.]</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>It should be mentioned that the banner is very beautiful and impressive. It was made by the Polish firm of Mr. Szczepan Konieczny, 1243 North Ashland Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>At about 5:30 P.M. the ceremony proper of the unfurling of the banner ended and a social evening began, which was to last well into the night.</p>
   <p>The fact that the Society of the Sons of the Mountains on the Skawa is developing so well, (its financial standing is attested by the purchase of its own banner) is partially due to the efforts of its capable administrative staff. The staff consists of the following members: Paul Danek, president; John Borawski, vice-president; Paul Suwada, financial secretary; Joseph Waclawik, secretary; Joseph Makarski, treasurer; John Lipowski, marshall; Michael Godawa, standard-bearer; and John Talaga, Stanley Gruszeczka, and Karol Zwierowski, administrative council.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>We, on our part, extend our sincere wishes for continuous development to the Society of the Sons of the Mountains on the Skawa, group 1524 of the P. N. A.</p>
