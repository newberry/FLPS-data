   <p>Last Saturday the Star of Hope, Group 202, of the Union of Polish Falcons in America, a gymnastic society, gave its Orange Ball at Pulaski Hall on South Ashland Avenue. A great many people attended, and had a very good time far into the night. Mr. Nagle's orchestra supplied the music for the dancers.</p>
