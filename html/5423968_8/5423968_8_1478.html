   <p>Besides good will there must be order and the proper sequence in our actions.</p>
   <p>From all sides are heard remarks that something should be done for an ideal, something should be done for Poland, something must be done to correct conditions among us.</p>
   <p>We all agree with this and, in expressing our good intentions, we do it harmoniously. But when the time comes to carry out these good intentions, then matters appear in a different light.</p>
   <p>Our Polish Roman Catholic Union, for example, combines the power of religion with the power of patriotism; it wishes to perpetuate religion and a free fatherland. The Polish National Alliance, indifferent to the power of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>religion--leaving it to the discretion of individuals--depends almost entirely on the power of patriotism with which to regain our fatherland.</p>
   <p>The purposes of one and the other are the same; the good will is the same in one as in the other. Logically, therefore, these two camps could march along together without causing harm to one another.</p>
   <p>But, no! They are fighting, attacking each other, destroying themselves. This results in battles, fraternal strife, destruction.</p>
   <p>If our fathers, who had complained about the licentiousness prevalent in Poland in more recent times, could arise from their graves and see the ignoble conditions of our social structure, they would willingly return to their graves, so that they would not see the tragic fate being prepared for us by personal feelings, selfishness, and the quarrels of individual patriotic adventurers.</p>

   <p>A heavy burden has fallen on us here in America. We are to retain our individuality here on the soil of Columbus, raise our souls to a higher spiritual plane, rid ourselves of fatal diseased growths which have attached themselves to our souls in the last one hundred years of imprisonment, and finally, to give all our strength for the purpose of liberating our beloved fatherland from the hideous chains of bondage.</p>
   <p>Will we perform this sacred duty? With tears in our eyes we are forced to answer, "No!"</p>
   <p>Casimir Brodzinski says: "A nationality is an ideal born in us; its members are united, and wish for its realization. It is one family enjoying the same family hearth and adventures. It is as one person in its aims....God desired nations to be as individualized as are people, and so they exert an influence on all mankind and create the necessary harmony in thought and action."</p>
   <p>All sincere patriots understand the importance of these words, and that is why <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>they defend religion, the national tongue, and the fatherland with its monuments and memorials. They severely condemn the irreligious, the anarchists and all other destroyers of our national ideal....Therefrom flow appeals to guard everything that represents an individual national trait.</p>
   <p>This thought created the Polish Roman Catholic Union on this continent discovered by Columbus. It is an organization guarding the pure faith of our fathers, truly and sincerely Polish. That this organization must declare war upon the enemies of our Polish ideals and those opposed to our Catholic ideals should not surprise us. But let this battle be not the purpose but the means to an end.</p>
   <p>Fight the enemies of idealism; love our brethren.</p>
   <p>Do not make this a fratricidal, heartbreaking struggle that would leave behind it a lasting, bitter enmity....Let its aim be to fight evil and not to shame and destroy our brethren. Fight with love.</p>

   <p>The newspapers--the teachers of the reading masses, who watch every movement--should accept this reasoning if they desire to see their people as one power, unbreakable, and enormous, capable of accomplishing the great aims intended.</p>
   <p>Alas! One thinks of profit, the other of personal satisfaction, another of this, another of that; instead of unity, there are quarrels, enmities destruction. Where does all this lead to? That is clearly seen.</p>
   <p>Personal ambition comes first; selfishness wins; quarrels triumph; the newspapers oppose one another; everyone is pulling for his own interests without regard to the general welfare, without a thought of holding together and keeping the national ideal, our fatherland, unblemished.</p>
   <p>We almost come to the point where a Pole will be ashamed to call himself a Pole; and whose fault is it? Our owns One brother is willing to give the other brother the finishing blow.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Such things have happened in the past and, alas, are happening now among us exiles.</p>
   <p>Will times improve? We cannot prophesy about that now....Let us pray, however, that they will, soon. Do not let troubles frighten us. Let us make a public confession of our political transgressions, and let us endeavor to improve. Perhaps such an improvement will come.</p>
   <p>National solidarity will be realized, there will be only one shepherd that is, the national ideal--and one sheepfold--all the children of our beloved fatherland, Poland.</p>
