   <p>The students of St. Stanislaus Kostka College, Chicago, who distinguished themselves by staging the Kosciusko celebration last month, again have given proof of their true patriotism, for, with the consent and co-operation of their teachers, all of them have joined the Polish League, and, besides the one-cent assessment, have collected among themselves a nice sum of money for the League. Yesterday, in the name of five teachers and forty-six students, they handed the secretary of the League six dollars and twelve cents as the yearly assessment, and five dollars and ten cents as a voluntary donation to the treasury of the League. This is a beautiful example of the spirit of our Polish youth, and deserves great credit.</p>
