   <p>A six year old boy testified before Judge Harry B. Miller in the Criminal Court. The testimony was to describe in what circumstances his father, Jozef Szczypanski, 31 years old, a grocery owner at 1736 Lull Place, was shot and killed by two of the five bandits who entered his store.</p>
   <p>The oldest of the five hoodlums, Michael Cios, is 22 years old. The ages of the remaining four range from 15 to 19 years.</p>
   <p>Chicago has gained for itself a terrible reputation not only in the United States, but all over the world.</p>
   <p>It is with great grief that we have to state that in this hideous criminal record, Poles occupy the first place. Indeed, within the last few years <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>criminality has increased among our youth. Quite often we find Polish names among those being cited on the criminal list in Chicago.</p>
   <p>There are many Polish Roman-Catholic churches, but apparently they don't do much to remedy this condition. Even the Polish press does not seem to be very much interested in these sad facts, or it is just trying to avoid discussions on that very important matter.</p>
   <p>And yet, something has to be done about it. We must save the unfortunate youth from perdition, and our name as Poles, from disgrace.</p>
   <p>Once in a while, the Polish Roman-Catholic churches sponsor hilarious parties, during which elders and youths are encouraged to indulge in drinking bouts. Cards and other gambling ideas are openly advertised in the clerical papers, through which the sponsors try to attract the crowds.</p>

   <p>Everything for business and God's glory.</p>
   <p>We do not have yet enough influence to turn the Polish masses back on the right path. But at least let us keep our youth from depravity. The best and the surest way to attain it is through the religious and cultural work in the various youth organizations.</p>
   <p>Thus, fathers and mothers, set an example for your children. Your exemplary attitude towards God and the church will pave the road to decent and cultural outlets for the emotions of your own children.</p>
