   <p>The pages of criminal statistics are more and more filled with Polish names.</p>
   <p>Chicago is not in the last place. Polish colonies are furnishing plenty of material for the newspapers, bringing shame to us Poles.</p>
   <p>Not so long ago a man of Polish descent committed suicide, drinking poison. His father, citizen Dominowski, operates several saloons. He has a good reputation and "honest income."</p>
   <p>The young man was a good draughtsman. His future was promising but his bad habits get the best of him, making him wild. He took the wrong path of life and as a result he is lying today on the slab.</p>
   <p>Crime does not pay. This is the warning to the parents. They should watch their children very closely. In a case where the children are going wrong, report at once to the court. Better to be ashamed now then to wait till he commits the actual crime. Parents, save your honor!</p>
