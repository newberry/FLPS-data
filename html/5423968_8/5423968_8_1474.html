   <p>Resolution adopted on May 5 at a special meeting of the Pulaski Volunteers.</p>
   <p>Whereas, Dziennik Polski [Polish News, not Polish Daily News] published an article on April 27, purporting to be a report of a dance given by the Pulaski Volunteers, in which certain unjustified accusations were made, which were pure figments of the imagination of a certain deluded reporter; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, everybody enjoyed himself at our dance as at any other respectable Polish dance; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, this reporter evidently desires to injure the good name of our organization, which has many times proved its devotion to the Polish cause, as the drills at the various celebrations conducted in the Polish language prove, and <span class="page-break">2</span>which is supporting the Second Corps of the Polish Soldiers in America, a patriotic organization to which they belong; be it therefore</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we protest against these unjust accusations in this article, and in the name of Justice we call on the Dziennik Polski to publish an effective article, which will restore the good name of our organization, which may have suffered dishonor in the eyes of the public due to the libelous article mentioned above.</p>
   <p>Companies A, B, and C,</p>
   <p>Pulaski Volunteers.</p>
