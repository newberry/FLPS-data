   <p>The members of St. Adalbert Parish held a meeting at the school hall relative to the fatal shooting of a Polish boy, A. Przybylski, by Detective W. J. Egan.</p>
   <p>This incident is truly revolting.</p>
   <p>The murder was committed for no apparent reason. Not only is the perpetrator of this act going to be set free, but the incident was falsely reported in the American papers, which made it appear that A. Przybylski was a thief.</p>
   <p>Because of this we have adopted the following resolution as a form of pretest:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"We, the citizens of the Ninth and Tenth Wards, have adopted the following resolution at a meeting held on November 3, 1895, at 4 P.M., in the school hall of St. Adalbert Parish:</p>
   <p>"We pretest against the behavior of Detective Egan who, for no reason whatsoever, fatally shot Anthony Przybylski, a seventeen-year-old Polish boy, on October 21, 1895, on 26th Street.</p>
   <p>"We protest against the false assertions of the American papers, which claimed that A. Przybylski was thief and made his living by stealing--which is entirely untrue.</p>
   <p>"We announce publicly that the assertions referred to above are lies. We were very well acquainted with this youth and with his parents, and we considered him an honest and trustworthy boy. No one held any grievance against him, a statement to which the undersigned vouch with their own signatures.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"This resolution will be published in all the papers and will be communicated to the proper authorities.</p>
   <p>"F. Czerwinski, chairman,</p>
   <p>"W. Pelka, recording secretary."</p>
