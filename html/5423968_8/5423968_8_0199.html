   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbassa has asked us to publish a warning against a certain swindler who is taking advantage of the Poles.</p>
   <p>This person is James B. Leckie, who, advertising himself as the manager of the Chicago Merchants' Police, has extracted from the people various sums deposits for jobs as night watchmen.</p>
   <p>This Leckie is a first-class swindler, who has already served a few jail sentences for similar crimes. His office is at 921 Monroe Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa advises the Poles not to have any business dealings with this man Leckie or his office, if they don't wish to be losers.</p>
   <p>Leckie is so infamous that he has even attempted to advertise his Merchants' Police in our paper. As soon as we discovered the kind of man behind the <span class="page-break">\2</span>company, we, of course, canceled his advertisement at once.</p>
   <p>One of those swindled by Leckie is a Pole, Mr. John Kowalski of 38 Sloan Street.</p>
   <p>He gave Leckie one hundred and fifty dollars as a deposit and it is doubtful whether he will get his money back. We have examined the contract given to Kowalski and found it was prepared in a very tricky way.</p>
   <p>We therefore warn our Polish citizens not to deposit any money without first considering the matter carefully, and especially without some sort of guarantee or bond insuring them against swindlers.</p>
