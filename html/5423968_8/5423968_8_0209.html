   <p>Work on a two-story brick building for Mr. John Niklewicz, owner of a grocery and meat market at 2136 North Robey Street, will begin next week. The new building will be erected at 2134 North Robey Street, next door to the store now occupied by Mr. Niklewicz, and will cost $7,500. So far the contracts for the work have been given exclusively to Poles. John Konczyk, well-known builder of St. Hedwig's Parish, received the bricklaying contract. W. Pafunt, carpenter contractor and builder, well-known member of the Polish National Alliance, with offices at 2329 Frankfort Street, received the carpenter contract. Karol Luka will supply the iron work. Contracts for the minor jobs, such as plumbing, decorating, plastering, etc. have not yet been given out, but they will no doubt be given to Poles.</p>
