   <p>Thanksgiving eve, Wednesday, November 24, St. Casimir Young People Society of St. Stanislaus Parish is arranging a play and dance to be held in Schoenhofen's Hall.</p>
   <p>The entire proceeds of this affair will be donated, half to the fund "Polish" Immigration Home" and the other to the "Koszciuzko Monument Fund." Because of the great esteem which the popular society of St. Casimir enjoys and above all the purpose to be attained, we favorably commend this affair and urge all good citizens to help these young members to success whose watchword is "Work In The Field of Nationalism."</p>
