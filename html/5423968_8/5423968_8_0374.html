   <p>Anyone recalling how the new Polish settlement, called Sobieski Park [now Calumet Park], looked half a year ago must admit, were he to look at it today, that great improvements have taken place in it since then.</p>
   <p>When people began to buy lots in this subdivision some time ago, the place was still a wood, and its future was rather doubtful. Today it looks entirely different. We wish to call your attention to all the improvements in this locality.</p>
   <p>In the first place, we wish to point out that almost all lots on this subdivision have been sold. All trees have been cut down and removed. The streets have <span class="page-break">2</span>been cleared and sidewalks laid. Several settlers have built beautiful residences and the most important achievement is the new Polish Catholic church, which is almost finished. Buy now before prices go up.</p>
