   <p>Mr. K. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, called the meeting to order at 2:25 P.M. He devoted a few words to the memory of Anthony Mallek, "one of the pioneers of the Polish emigres, father of Polish song in America, former secretary general of the Polish National Alliance, and a member for many years of this organization, an indefatigable worker in the nationalistic field". He asked those present to pay homage to the memory of Anthony Mallek by rising.</p>
   <p>The secretary general read a resolution [relative to Mallek's funeral,] and the board of directors accepted by rising. The resolution will be published in the papers.</p>
   <p>A motion was passed to the effect that the entire Central Board of Directors will take part in [Mallek's] funeral. The censor of the Polish National Alliance is sending his representative. The body of the deceased, if his <span class="page-break">\2</span>family permits, will rest for a while in the meeting room of the Polish National Alliance building. The administrative board will take care of this.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that the United States has severed diplomatic relations with Germany, the Central Board of Directors decided to send President Wilson a special telegram, which the secretary general read. This telegram was unanimously accepted, and it was decided to send it at once.</p>
   <p>Further business of the organization was discussed in accordance with the program and rules of the Central Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Mr. K. B. Czarnecki, vice-president, will represent the Polish National Alliance at the Fraternal Congress in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 8.</p>
   <p>The president of the Polish National Alliance received a reply (stereotyped) from the President of the United States to the telegram sent by the Central Board of Directors on his address of January 22 to the Senate.</p>

The money will be sent through the American embassy at Petrograd, either together with the contributions of other organizations represented by the Central Polish Relief Committee, or separately.</p>
