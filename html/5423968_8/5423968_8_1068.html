   <p>The Polish National Council sent a rather lengthy telegram yesterday to President Wilson, in which it thanked the President for his clear and just presentation of the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>Among other things, the telegram stated: "There can be no peace founded on oppression and injustice. The peace which is to come must bring with it liberty for all, both large and small, strong and weak. It must guarantee the inviolable safety of life, faith, and social development of all the peoples which up to now were subject to enemy rulers.</p>
   <p>"Mr. President, you have spoken nobly about Poland. You have definitely asserted that Poland must be united, independent, and autonomous.</p>
   <p>"For this noble definition of freedom together with justice, we, Americans of Polish ancestry, wish to express our deepest gratitude and loyalty to you <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>as President of the United States and one of the greatest champions of the ideals of humanity whom the world has ever known.</p>
   <p>"Poland, impotent in her misfortune, has not looked to America in vain for help, justice, sympathy, and an honest evaluation of her cause. She has not waited in vain for the great moral support which America can give her. America has spoken through the mouth of its President; it has spoken with might for the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>"Long live the Republic of the United States and the future Republic of Poland!</p>
   <p>"Dr. J. P. Wagner, President,</p>
   <p>"P. Rostenkowski, vice-president,</p>
   <p>"F. S. Barc, secretary,</p>
   <p>"J. S. Skibinski, editor."</p>
