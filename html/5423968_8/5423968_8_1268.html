   <p>In the general census conducted here in America every ten years, hundreds of thousands of Poles have been enumerated as Russians, Germans, and Austrians. As a result of this, the official census does not give the exact number of Poles in this country. The Polish National Alliance, both through the press and by means of special circulars, has done everything possible to instruct our immigrants how to register. The Alliance has gone so far as to obtain a separate census column for the Poles, but in spite of all this many of our unenlightened compatriots did not register themselves properly during the 1910 Census. As a result of this, the number of Germans and Russians in this country increased at the expense of the Poles. In the city of Chicago alone, the Census gives 56,000 Russians, although we know well that there are less than ten thousand.</p>
   <p>Since a great majority of Poles registered themselves as Germans and <span class="page-break">\2</span>Austrians, the number of our people in this country has been considerably lessened. This, of course, robs the Poles in no small measure of part of the political power they have in this country. Among the Bohemians we find that national associations, as well as priests and pastors, instruct their people in national duties. Among our immigrants, however, except for the Polish National Alliance, no one takes the trouble of explaining to our people that they are Poles and should register as such. Let us, therefore, learn national solidarity from the Bohemians. Let there be no question in the next Census as to the exact number of Poles, so that we may regain the prestige due our people in America.</p>
