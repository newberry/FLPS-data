   <p>At a meeting of Commune 3 of Chicago, representing sixty-two groups of the Polish National Alliance and 5,000 members, the officers of the commune reported their decision regarding the action of Commune 88 of Cleveland, [relative to the] resignation of two officers of the Polish National Alliance, Mr. Casimir Zychlinski and Mr. Joseph Magdziarz, president and treasurer respectively of the Central Board of Directors, and regarding the request of this commune that a special convention of our organization be called.</p>
   <p>After an exhaustive discussion, Commune 3 appointed the undersigned special committee to send the following expression of its views on the matter to all the Polish-American publications, and to all the communes of the Polish National Alliance:</p>
   <p>"Commune 3, with due respect for the political convictions of all citizens, solemnly condemns the distasteful and insidious step taken by Commune 88 of Cleveland, asserting that the Cleveland commune had neither reasons nor the <span class="page-break">2</span>right to demand, for political reasons, the public resignation of the officers of the Central Board of Directors elected to office at the Schenectady Convention, and has subjected itself and the Alliance to ridicule in the eyes of the Polish-Americans.</p>
   <p>"Commune 3 reminds you that the basic ideal on which the Polish National Alliance was founded and on which its existence rests was and is to work for the independence of Polish lands partitioned by the armed might of three neighboring invading powers, and the following departments work in accordance with this ideal: The National Department, composed of representatives of all the large Polish organizations in America; the Central Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance, which belongs to this department; and the Commission of Five appointed at the Schenectady Convention.</p>
   <p>"Commune 3 emphasizes that the protest of the National Department, which bore the signatures of both of these officers of the Polish National Alliance, was timely, because the Alliance will never be taken in by Prussian, Austrian, or Russian promises, and will never sign a new partition of Poland as the congress <span class="page-break">3</span>at Grodno did, and will never agree to the shedding of rivers of Polish blood for the final victory of the Germans, who have been hostile toward us from the very inception of the Polish nation.</p>
   <p>"Commune 3 sees no need of a special convention for the discussion of the financial and internal affairs of the Alliance, but it has demanded and continues to favor the idea of calling a general Polish congress in Washington on May 3, for political purposes, in the firm belief that a congress representing the Polish people in America, who have been organized for years and have borne the burdens of organizational and political activities, would clearly place before the whole world during this great year of 1917, during which the fate of Europe and Poland will be sealed, the beautiful ideals of justice for all nations, and would demand reparation for the crimes inflicted on Poland in the eighteenth century.</p>
   <p>"In paying tribute to the President of the United States for his address on the subject of peace, in which he demands among other acts of justice for oppressed <span class="page-break">4</span>peoples a united, independent, and autonomous Poland with access to the sea, Commune 3 recognizes the above words, taken from the hearts of all the Poles, as the dreams and aims which we solemnly vow to defend to the last drop of our blood!</p>
