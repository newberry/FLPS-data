   <p>At the meeting held on October 17, 1894, by the Central Board of the Polish League in the United States of North America, the following members of the beard and guests were present: E. J. Jerzmanowski, president; J. Napieralski and M. Kruszka, vice-presidents; Peter Kiolbassa, cashier; Reverend Vincent Barzynski, in place of Reverend Gulski, who represents the clergy; Reverend Gruza of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Dr. Czupka; Clement J. Belinski, chairman of the trustees of the Polish National Fund in America; Jastrzebski; H. Nagiel; S. Zahajkiewicz; Bednarz; J. N. Pietrowski; and Stanislaus Szwajkart, secretary of the Polish League.</p>
   <p>E. J. Jerzmanowski, president of the League, stated that many persons could not join the League on account of certain restrictions in the constitution of the organization, and suggested that the constitution be amended. Pursuant to his suggestion, it was decided to go ever the paragraphs of the constitution <span class="page-break">\2</span>and make the necessary changes, to be submitted for approval at the next convention to be held next May.</p>
   <p>The members of the board present at the meeting thereupon began the tedious task of revising the constitution. Every paragraph was discussed separately, and certain changes and cancelations were recommended.</p>
   <p>It was decided to print ten thousand copies of these changes and to send them to all agencies, societies, and persons in charge of the distribution of the League's literature.</p>
   <p>Subsequently, the secretary read the financial report of the League. The report shows that at present the League has ten agencies, of which three are in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Thirty-nine societies have applied for membership, and many of them have sent their contributions for the Polish National Fund and for the upkeep of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>League. The League has 1,554 members, and the condition of its treasury is as follows:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Treasury receipts</td>
     <td>$1,224.68</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Expenditures</td>
     <td>335.29</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Cash in the treasury</td>
     <td>$889.39</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>of this sum, $742.16 belongs to the Polish National Fund and $143.43 to the Polish League. The remainder, or $12.72, has not been entered, pending the decision of the donors, who so far have not stated for which fund this amount should be appropriated.</p>
   <p>It is understood that our collectors and agencies still hold funds, and that they will reach our treasury in time.</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Szwajkart</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
