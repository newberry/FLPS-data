   <p>Yesterday the House of Representatives passed the Immigration Bill. Many sections of this bill will stand in the way of those of our compatriots in Europe who may wish to settle here in the future.</p>
   <p>For this reason, the presidents of all Polish-American organizations and the editors of all Polish papers of Chicago have agreed to send a telegram to the Senate, protesting against the passage of this bill in its present form.</p>
   <p>A memorial, to be presented at protest meetings to be held by the Chicago Poles, will also be sent away with the telegram.</p>
   <p>Further particulars will be given tomorrow.</p>
