   <p>The nationality that voluntarily denationalizes itself or aids others in denationalizing themselves, commits a murder. Denationalizing one's self is moral suicide, and such murderers are Poles of America, who deprive themselves of their religion, their native tongue, and their wonderful customs and morals. Alas, the number of these moral murderers and the possibility of danger grows larger every day. We can add this much, that to this moral suicide is committed those who rid themselves of their religion.</p>
   <p>As soon as they have lest their religion, the hope for improvement of the nation's future is also lost.</p>
   <p>Today they are lost to their fatherland. But, on the other hand, those who abide by their Polish churches and Polish schools will not commit moral suicide, that is, they will not become denational.</p>
