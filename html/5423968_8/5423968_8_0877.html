   <p>"Thaddeus Kosciuszko stands forth today, one hundred and fifty years after the event which we here commemorate as one of the romantic figures of Polish and of American history.</p>
   <p>Born the son of a sword bearer, Kosciuszko received his preliminary education at home and later entered the cadet corps at Warsaw, where attention was attracted to his unusual ability and energy. Thus recognizing the possibilities of a capable leader of the future, he was sent at the expense of the state to complete his military education in Germany, Italy and France. At the age of twenty-eight he returned to Poland with the rank of Captain of Artillery, and at a time when far across the Atlantic the American Colonies were showing increasing indications of restiveness under British rule.</p>
   <p>When the American revolt became an open reality in 1776, it was only a few months until this young Polish leader volunteered along with his daring compatriot, Pulaski, for service in Washington's army. Kosciuszko brilliantly distinguished himself, especially in the operations about New York,and Washington promoted him to the rank of Colonel of Artillery and made him his adjutant. Records of the time assert that his humanity and charm of manner made him one of the most popular officers in the American army.</p>
   <p>The war ended, the independence of the Colonies won, and a new nation formed, Congress in the name of the American people, in 1783, tendered to Kosciuszko, the republic's thanks, the privilege of American citizenship, a considerable pension, landed estates, and the rank of Brigadier General, which rank he retained in the Polish service.</p>
   <p>Freedom's fight was ever Kosciuszko's battle, and the new Poland which arose from the World War represents today the end toward which he strove.</p>
   <p>America today entertains only the most friendly feelings toward Poland. The bond made by Kosciuszko has been cemented by the thousands of Poles who have crossed the Atlantic to America, feeling the same urge to the Westward which led their forebears in the dawn of history from the marshes of the upper Niemen and the Pripet into western Europe.</p>
   <p>As we honor the memory of this Polish patriot who fought to bring us the freedom which gave us the great Constitution of the United States and our present form of Government, I deem it proper to call attention to the evil in this country of the primary system which has changed the government of our political parties from one consistent with the general plan of our national constitutional government to one subversive of it.</p>
   <p>That which has distinguished this republic from the republics of the past which have failed, is that it has a representative government and is not a free democracy. It is our Constitution with its system of checks and balances, providing for laws made by the representatives of the people, instead of by the people themselves, which has given us most of the blessings which we enjoy today.</p>
   <p>The primary system under which the candidates of a political party are selected, not by representatives of the members of the party, but directly by the members of the party themselves, is inconsistent with the constitutional principles which have preserved and protected us as a government and people.</p>
   <p>As a result of the primary system, the present senatorial contests in the different states which theoretically involve national issues, are being largely fought out upon local and personal issues. This emphasizes, in my judgment, the increasing injury to our old system of government through political parties which has resulted from the primary system of nomination. In the old days through the nomination by political conventions under a representative system, the candidate selected, better represented his party's position on great issues. At present, when many candidates offer themselves at the primaries, personalities and positions upon local issues necessarily tend to over-shadow the position of the candidate upon the national issues advocated by his party.</p>
   <p>In our large centers of population, in county and city elections, the numerous candidates under the primary system for party nomination divide the impartial vote and increase the power of an existing administration with a controled vote to select its candidates. A state, county, or city administration, having large patronage and large business contracts to give, always holds its disinterested vote for a selected candidate. The more men running on the primary ticket for the place in question, the more certain is the organization to name its man who can secure a plurality against a divided, impartial majority vote. In many instances, in senatorial as well as state, county, and city contests, the nominee of a party selected by a plurality vote with a majority vote divided among several candidates, will represent ideas obnoxious to the majority and to his party. Yet, when he is nominated, the hatred of party regularity will still affect enough of the majority to result in his election.</p>
   <p>The primary system, therefore, is responsible for the election by parties of some men whose chief effort after election seems to be to disorganize their party and fight its policies. Again in our cities, the ballot in the primaries is so large that it is impossible for the average voter to know anything of the character, competency, or attitude upon the public questions of the majority of those on the primary ticket. He largely votes in the dark for all minor offices. Voting at haphazard for a number of candidates at the primaries, the chances are that his vote directly or indirectly, aids those interested in an existing administration supported largely by those in office or interested in public contracts. The primary system does not help the unintelligent voter, and in many cases compels the intelligent voter to vote unintelligently. It is lowering the standard of personnel in public office and public administration, and subordinating national, state and county issues to personal and organization issues.</p>
   
   <p>It is no answer to this situation to say that corrupt organizations can control a nomination at a convention for less money than they can control the primaries. This is questionable. But they are much more certain to control a primary than a convention, the impartial portion of which can unite intelligently in opposition. Again, the fight in the convention of the impartial and intelligent sections against the corrupt or controled candidate, better precipitates the issue before the people in the election. The opposition in the convention can always be trusted to make prominent in a general election the improper influence which resulted in the selection of a candidate while under the primary system. It is only occasionally and accidentally that the real forces of corruption behind candidacies become known to the public. A nominating convention composed of intelligent men inform themselves as to the character, ability and competency of nominees. The convention, having its mind on these qualities often with the power and desire to nominate an improper candidate, will follow reason instead of desire, and nominate a good candidate for the purpose of insuring party success in the election, where there is always a comparison of candidates according to these qualities. In a primary election the interested minority will demand and more certainly secure a candidate devoted to their interests.</p>
   <p>As our country develops in wealth and population, our state, country and city governments of necessity transact a larger business, and their power becomes more centralized. Immense road building projects are being carried out by states, assisted by the national government, and our state, county and city administrations are increasing expenditure. Not only are public employees used in getting out a primary vote to maintain an existing administration in power, but in many places all those interested in construction or other public contracts with their organizations and employees are expected to perform active service in getting out the primary vote for the same purpose. It is not too much to say that in some states and cities the power of the existing administration is so exerted that the dominant party will always present candidates at the election selected by those having a business and personal interest in the continuance of the administration. When this occurs, we have exchanged representative government of the people for an oligarchy dominated by self interest.</p>
   <p>It was to protect us from this that our forefathers so framed the Constitution of the United States as to give us a representative government and not a free democracy. When our political parties following the plan of the Constitution, selected their candidates for the bodies properly representative of the people instead of by a direct popular vote, there were occasional instances of evil nominations, but there was not the general breakdown in the standard of official personnel throughout our country, which we confront today as a result of the primary system.</p>
   
   <p>The American colonial army with which Thaddeus Koscziusko fought, gave us our freedom and made the Constitution of the United States possible. Let us honor his memory by standing behind the Constitution and the constitutional institutions of this nation. We should largely abolish the primary. Those of our citizens in whose veins there runs Polish blood know very well through what desperate and bloody struggle of mankind, good government finally emerges. They know very well the value of good government.</p>
   <p>I believe we have no class of citizens more devoted to our government and its principles than those whom I see before me. When you realize that the primary system not only is subversive of the plans and purposes of the Constitution itself, but tends to substitute in many localities government by an uninterested minority in place of representative government by the people, I believe you will oppose it."</p>
