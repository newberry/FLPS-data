   <p>Mrs. Anna Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance, in opening the nationalistic mass meeting, announced that since the war is destroying everything in the homeland, the convention committee had decided it was more fitting to call a mass meeting than to arrange a ball.</p>
   <p>The first speaker Rector Zapala began his speech by declaring that when we Poles gather at mass meetings or conventions we should talk as much as possible about the homeland and should keep it constantly in mind. The speaker, summarizing the history of Poland's fall, emphasized the fact that after the partitions, when Poland's enemies considered us dead, Poland rose to fight for her freedom. The heavy blows which fell upon the Polish nation were not able to take away the love of the homeland from the nation, to destroy the native language, or to tear out of the Polish soul hope of a better future, hope of the rebirth of the nation, and hope of the reconstruction of Poland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"Now all three of Poland's annexers offer her freedom," the speaker continued, "on condition that our brothers fight in their defense, to increase their aggressive power. But the annexers forget that the Polish nation is not a nation of beggars, who ask the annexers for favors: Poland does not need alms. The whole nation in uniting. In times such as these, in the face of such a cataclysm, we forget everything which divided us. The homeland needs our help, therefore we must and do give it to her. All of the mass meetings which are now being held, have for their purpose to encourage generosity. May today's mass meeting of the Polish women be an example of generosity for national purposes, at a time when this generosity is most needed."</p>
   <p>The next speaker, Mr. S. Orpiszewski, editor of Zgoda, greeted the delegates to the tenth convention as the editor of the official organ of the brother organization. He pointed to the influence of the Polish mother, the Polish sister, and the Polish wife on nationalistic work, and, turning to the delegates, he declared that he rejoices in the growth of this organization because when women organize there can be no fear of losing our national identity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Dr. M. Olgiert Kaczowska, who was introduced by the president, continued the train of thought of the speaker immediately preceding her by answering her own[rhetorical] question: "What was the Polish woman formerly and what is she today?" The Polish woman, as educator of her children, has always been confronted with a grave and important problem. Today the Polish woman's problem is greater, in that she is not only the educator of her children but the agent needed to pacify the cruel modern attilas, who are dealing Polish society blow after blow in order to kill the national spirit within it.</p>
   <p>What should the Polish woman, living here far away from the homeland, do when she reads descriptions of the horrible tortures which Europe is now witnessing? She should be a loyal daughter of Poland, she should help the homeland, and fulfill the duty of a pacifying agent. Here the Polish woman should bring about agreement between parties among the emigrants, calming the anger of some and the hatred of others, in order that all may work together as real Poles should."</p>
   <p>Mr. John F. Smulski, with his usual ease and zeal, spoke better, perhaps, <span class="page-break">\4</span>than he had ever spoken before.</p>
   <p>The speaker asserted at the outset that whenever the Polish Women's Alliance held council at conventions he had always been there and that he was glad to come today, in order at a time of such great importance to sacrifice a little of his own time to the cause.</p>
   <p>"Your organization," continued Mr. Smulski, "is based upon a firm foundation, is developing, and, I hope, some day will be the largest organization of Polish women in America. When I was invited by your president, I asked her what I should talk about and received the cryptic answer 'Talk about Poland.' It is easy and at the same time difficult to talk about Poland, because to utter phrases about Poland is easy but to speak about it as one should is very difficult. Poland must rise, but we cannot sit about with folded arms waiting for the moment of its resurrection. No one is going to hand us a free Poland on a silver tray (applause). Poland will rise only through our sacrifice, our sacrifice of everything that is nearest and dearest to our hearts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"Our countrymen in the homeland are fighting under three annexor nations, and what are they fighting for? The Belgian is fighting because the Prussian did not respect his neutrality. The Frenchman gives his life for his country, the Austrian is fighting for his country, and the Prussian is shedding blood for his country. But our countrymen are being killed there, our countrymen are being annihilated, while they are fighting not for their own benefit, for the future of their children, or for their beloved homeland, but for their annexor, for the benefit of their executioners. We have been living here in our emigrant colony for more than forty years, and what have we done for the homeland? We have collected a measly few thousand dollars now at the last moment. This is a very small sum, because when money is needed in the homeland and when we are asked for it, we should give much. Let us collect funds, let us collect and economize on everything. Historical necessity demands peace in Europe. A loud voice cries out, 'Poland must have what she deserves.' Otherwise there will be no peace. When the time comes for negotiating peace terms Poland must and will rise, (applause) because the most powerful will demand it."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Next, President Neuman called upon Mrs. Jaworska, Mrs. Ciborowska, Mrs. Warszewska, and Mrs. Szymanska, to take up a collection. (It amounted to $77.70.)</p>
   <p>Mrs. H. Setmajer, editor of Glos Polek[Voice of the Polish Women], who spoke next, emphasized the necessity for great generosity and sacrifice. It is not fitting for Polish women to be selfish. They should and must give because the homeland is in need and can expect help only from her children.</p>
   <p>Judge Edmund K. Jarecki, in his speech, pointed out the fact that we cannot go back to Poland now in order to fight there, but we should unite and with all our strength help the homeland financially and work for the nation's rebirth.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Majewski, commissioner of the Polish National Alliance for the state of Illinois, spoke in the same vein.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>To close this mass meeting Miss Emily Napieralska, general secretary, read the following resolution which was accepted by a storm of applause:</p>
   <p>Resolution</p>
   <p>We, Polish women, representatives of our respective groups of the Alliance of Polish Women in America, gathered together from all parts of the country for the Tenth Convention of the said Alliance, together with the Polish women of the city of Chicago and vicinity in general, assembled at a mass meeting at the Polish Women's Alliance building in the city of Chicago, this twenty-first day of September, 1914, after due consideration of the most vital question concerning us as a nation--the freedom of Poland--decree and certify the following:</p>
   <p>We solemnly declare that we have never recognized and do not recognize the loss of Poland's rights or the taking away of her autonomy and liberty, since they were torn from the Polish nation by force. They have not lapsed <span class="page-break">\8</span>but still legally belong to the nation.</p>
   <p>Further, we assert that we will not cease working and striving, in every way open to us, until Poland has regained absolute freedom and autonomy.</p>
   <p>Further, we solemnly declare that we neither sympathize with nor intend to support any of the following countries now fighting in Europe: Austria, which suggested the partition of Poland; Russia; and traitorous Germany, which for an entire century has perpetrated horrible crimes against our nation, while constantly singing Ausrotten.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, we decree and suggest that all of our national strength should be concentrated, that advantage should be taken of every opportunity of submitting the Polish cause to the forum of the world, and, above all, that we should work energetically and steadily to collect contributions. Money, Money, Money, Money--that is what we need desperately now, in order to oust the hunger and poverty which our brothers and sisters are already <span class="page-break">\9</span>suffering on our sacred soil. We consider this our primary and most imperative duty at this particular time! Therefore, we appeal to all who are able, to give early, give generously, give now!</p>
   <p>Let all Polish people in America get busy. The time has come for action. Let everyone fulfill his sacred duty toward his brothers and sisters suffering the horrible consequences of war. They are already suffering from hunger, want, and destitution; they lack food, clothing, and shelter. Poland cries, "Give my children bread, and at the same time do not forget about my deliverance."</p>
   <p>Therefore, you generous people, you loyal sons and daughters of Poland, hasten to extend a truly generous hand; give as much money as you can; collect these pennies with care. You who are authorized by the people to collect this money, with the assurance that it will be kept in absolute safety and under the strictest control, send this money as quickly as possible to <span class="page-break">\10</span>the threatened areas. Be merciful. Let your patriotism save our unfortunate brothers and sisters from destitution and annihilation. Save your fellow countrymen from starvation. Let everyone who believes in God and calls himself a Pole come to the rescue of his brothers and sisters: let him prove his service to his country now by action.</p>
   <p>Mindful of the heroic deeds of Polish knights, let us fan the flame of sincere, deep, and unlimited love for Poland, for the beautiful Polish language, and for our oppressed people, in the hearts of our brothers, husbands, and sons. Let us encourage and spread friendship and good will toward the peoples of related Slavic tribes. Let us instill in ourselves the idea that it is our duty to come to the rescue of our brothers and sisters who are now suffering misfortune and destitution as the consequences of the terrible war, which leaves behind it only destruction and ruin.</p>
   <p>We strongly support the demand for a Polish treasury and a Polish army, and <span class="page-break">\11</span>recommend and urge with all our hearts that the entire nation, in the firmest belief in the good of the cause, regularly and continuously supply the future government with these two necessities.</p>
   <p>We join, in spirit, our brothers and sisters who are sacrificing their lives and goods on the altar of Poland, now struggling toward deliverance and the creation of a national government. We assert our willingness to help in every possible way, to bring about Poland's autonomy as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Being of the opinion that honest administration of offices in this country adds to the good name of Poland and the Poles, we consider that it is our duty always to support our candidates running for municipal, state, and federal offices, irrespective of their party. We contend that our own poor man is better than the best foreigner.</p>
   <p>At a time of such grave importance as the present, we draw especial attention <span class="page-break">\12</span>of the citizens to the fact that, wherever possible, we should elect Poles as representatives to Congress, absolutely regardless of party, since the important thing is that Poles should be there. For our own interest and for Poland's interest we should have some Poles in the United States Congress. The present moment requires that we exert our strength in order to have official spokesmen for our just cause at the end of the war in Europe.</p>
   <p>We join in every honest attempt leading to the reconciliation and unification of the entire nation, always ready to make sacrifices and to work for the realization of the desire for a free and independent Poland for us, for our children, and for generations through time everlasting.</p>
   <p>At the request of President Neuman "God Save Poland" was sung.</p>
