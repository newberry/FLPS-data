   <p>Let no one get the best of us! Poles in Chicago are organizing a Polish fire insurance company, the shares of which will be sold only to Poles. This action is a protest against German and Jewish organizations that take away money from the Poles by charging them high premiums for fire insurance.</p>
   <p>For this reason, citizens A. Kowalski, W. Jendrzejek, E. H. Bessa, A. J. Kwesigroch, A. Schultz, Joseph Schroeder, Jan Mantz, Jankowski, Frank Mantz, J. Suwalski, J. Jakubowski, B. Badura, and E. Wisinski, secured a permit from the State of Illinois for selling shares at $100 each.</p>
   <p>The initial payment on a share is only $5. Other payments are arranged by the management. Shares are sold at the office of the secretary, Mr. A. J. Kwasigroch, 163 Blackhawk St., or at the meeting on Monday, March 2, at Mr. A. Schultz's, 679 Noble Street.</p>

   <p>A number of shares has been sold already, besides those bought by the directors. Therefore, we invite our countrymen to buy shares as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Whoever buys a share in March or in April, will still get 6% interest.</p>
   <p>A. J. Kwasigroch,</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
