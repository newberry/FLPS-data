   <p>Honorable Woodrow Wilson,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Sir:</p>
   <p>In this tense and fateful time when the United States confronts the gravest responsibility of our recent history, we, American citizens, members of the Polish National Council of America, hasten to assure the President of our unqualified support of whatever measures he undertakes to uphold the honor of America.</p>
   <p>As loyal citizens, we have ranged ourselves patriotically and unreservedly under the flag of our adopted country. And if overt acts of unjustifiable aggression challenge this republic to defend its dearest rights, we shall be among the first to rally behind the President, who in this crisis in our international affairs is charged with the arduous task of conducting our foreign relations.</p>
   <p>We call on all our compatriots to rally around the flag, Its security will mean that "government of the people, by the people shall not perish from the earth."</p>
   <p>(Signed) Dr. J. P. Wagner, president</p>
   <p>P. Rostenkowski, vice-president</p>
   <p>F. S. Barc, secretary</p>
   <p>S. Godzich, treasurer</p>
   <p>J. S. Skibinski, editor</p>
