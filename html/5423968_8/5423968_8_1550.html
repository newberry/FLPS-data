   <p>Last year the Polish League Agency of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish took upon itself the arrangement of staging patriotic manifestations to commemorate the Polish insurrection against Russia on November 29, 1830. Because this year the date fell on Thanksgiving Day, the patriotic exercise was postponed until Sunday, December 2, and arrangements were made for the use of the Polish Hall, Bradley near Noble Street.</p>
   <p>A capacity crowd filled the exquisitely decorated auditorium last night even the gallery was occupied. A festive air prevailed throughout the evening, and all enjoyed the speeches, declamations, and songs. Silence reigned throughout the program, broken only by applause as each performer made his bow.</p>
   <p>The program was opened with a short address by Leon Szopinski, president of the Polish League Agency. When he concluded, he called upon Reverend John Kasprzycki, pastor of St. John Cantius Parish, and Stanislaus Szwajkart to act as chairman and recording secretary respectively.</p>
   <p>After the stirring singing of "Farewell" by the St. Stanislaus Kostka College Choir under the direction of Ignatius Kowalski, instructor, a historical speech was delivered by I. N. Wrzesinski.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wrzesinski began his talk in the second person using the Polish League as his theme. He emphasized the noble aims and principles of this organization, including the opposition encountered during its start. The speaker urged the leaders of this group to continue their fine work, for in the and their efforts would overcome all obstacles. Afterwards he related the events that had led to the organization of this fine society and stressed the need for unity, understanding, and leadership. Mr. Wrzesinski also pointed out how these shortcomings could be eliminated through co-operation. Warm applause was given the speaker when he concluded.</p>
   
   <p>After the speech, the Women's Choir under the direction of Andrew Kwasigroch sang "Girl of Warsaw." This was followed by a declamation by the popular Miss Hedwig <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, whose rendering of the poem "By the Goplo" [a legendary lake] enchanted her listeners. Then the college choir sang "After the Battle," followed by a recitation, "To Youth," by one of the choir members, Joseph Kopczynski.</p>
   <p>The second speech of the evening was given by I. Kowalski, who spoke on the things he had read in the Polish press of America, stressing the conditions under which we are living. He pointed out the need of looking after the Polish youth who are to be the future citizens of this great free country. Mr. Kowalski also touched upon bridging the gap between the Polish immigrant and prevailing conditions in this country.</p>
   <p>Using the words "Brothers, to Arms! The Fatherland Is Calling Us!" Throughout his speech, the speaker continually stressed what the fatherland demands of us at this time, especially of the immigrants. He suggested that the best method is the care of our youth and then the striving for unity and understanding in our activities. In conclusion he urged that something be done about having Poles employed in establishments that the Polish people patronize.</p>
   <p>This was followed with the singing of "Song of Hope" by the St. Cecilia Choir under the baton of Mr. Kwasigroch. Such enthusiasm was expressed by the audience that it was necessary to have the chairman inform the people that the program was long, leaving no time for encores.</p>
   <p>The next number on the program was the presentation of drills by five military groups, of which the cadets, made up of Polish youth, were outstanding. Declamations by J. Sobieszczyk, "A Russian Gift," and by young Gorecki, "The Death of General Sowinski," as well as songs by the St. Cecilia Choir, followed.</p>
   <p>A speech by Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, brought an end to the gala patriotic program. The pastor stated that although he had made many speeches from that rostrum he had never had an opportunity to speak at so sad an anniversary.</p>
   <p>"We find ourselves in the presence of a sad and mournful year of the last partition of Poland," declared the priest. "As in the homeland, so in this country voices have come to the fore that this year should be one of mourning, commemorating the various national insurrections for freedom through patriotic manifestations. We are not only fulfilling this but are also conducting work for the common good of our poor motherland. We also feel her needs, her pains, her sorrows, and know how to act in order to relieve some of this.</p>
   <p>"It is useless for us to put on lavish demonstrations, for simple, sincere efforts made among our immigrants in Chicago and the country over will bring far-reaching results. A denial of certain material pleasures should be made and money spent in this direction should be turned over toward the work for the motherland."</p>
   <p>This affair opened at 8 P.M. and was concluded at 10 P.M. with the singing of "God Save Poland."</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Szwajkart.</p>
