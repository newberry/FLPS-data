   <p>In a recent address to a jury, Federal Justice Walter C. Lindley pointed out that our country is spending immense sums of money in its fight with the criminal world.</p>
   <p>As for us, we advocate the confinement of all criminals to an island, where they would be employed in government factories.</p>
   <p>This way the criminals would have to make up for the damages they caused to the country by their crimes.</p>
