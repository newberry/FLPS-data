   <p>Reverend [?] Sebatynski, a well-known missionary sent four dollars for the Polish National Fund of the Polish League to the Gazeta Katoucka (Catholic Gazette). This sum was collected from the participants of the Kosciusko manifestation held in Farewell and Sherman Counties, Nebraska.</p>
   <p>Today marks the sixth day since the Polish League was founded.</p>
   <p>J. Kaczmarer, from South Bend, Indiana, has informed us that several societies from that city have decided to join the Polish League. Bravo!</p>
   <p>The Polish League will be incorporated in a few days and the Central Board will then begin its work. In a few weeks the organization will be functioning.</p>
   <p>Join the League. Everybody agrees that the Polish League is a splendid institution.</p>

   <p>Whoever is interested in the affairs of the Polish nation should be glad to join the League, even Zgoda expresses its joy at the founding of the League, though with some reservations. Przyjaciel Ludu (Peoples Friend), which formerly opposed the Polish mass meeting and the Polish League, now shouts: "Long live the League."</p>
