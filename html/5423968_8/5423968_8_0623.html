   <p>The Episcopal Bishop McClaren gave a "Polish evening party" at his residence in Evanston, where Polish songs in translation were sung, also Polish poetry was recited. The musical compositions of Chopin and Moniuszko were played. A discussion on Polish question was held and a young Pole in America delivered a lecture on "Poles in America." The reporters of "English" papers were there as well as the owners of factories employing large numbers of Poles, like Mr. Wm. Deering, Mr. Charles Crane, Mr. Cyrus H. McCormick, Frank C. Lowden and others.</p>
   <p>The Americans are giving "Polish evenings" and we Poles are ashamed of our Polish names and disclaim the use of the Polish language.</p>
