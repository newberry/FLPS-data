   <p>Just like the plague of black death spreading in China... so here in Chicago the vice of playing dice is spreading among Polish boys, thus demoralizing our children.</p>
   <p>Day and night, at billiard halls and counters, they are playing dice. Also on the sidewalks of the side streets groups of boys play, not for pennies, but for dollars and even higher.</p>
   <p>In the evening you very seldom can notice old people in the pool halls, but there you can see the minors playing and planning their future crimes.</p>
   <p>Our desire is to stop this, report it to the chief of police and stop gambling in our districts and clean the city from gamblers and crime.</p>
