   <p>The Polish National Alliance has many enemies. We cannot call them opponents because no one could be an opponent of a thing so good, noble, and useful, without becoming simultaneously an enemy of the Alliance. Such, after all, is the fate of good institutions and of right-thinking people. Both are opposed, depressed, and hampered in doing good, by people who are basically evil; and individuals of that type can and should be termed enemies.</p>
   <p>The principal difference between an opponent and an enemy is, according to our convictions, that an opponent believes sincerely that the thing he opposes is not good, and therefore wants to correct the thing. An enemy, on the other hand, knows well that the thing he hates is good, and for that very reason wants to destroy it--it stands in the way of his <span class="page-break">2</span>attaining some of his personal and entirely unworthy goals.</p>
   <p>The enemies of the Polish National Alliance could easily be divided into three general categories. In the first we include those who are antagonistic to the organization because of its progressiveness and its democratic system of management, that is, a system in which the people, and not individuals, decide. These enemies use the cloak of religion against the Alliance and tell people the lie that the Alliance is an enemy of faith and the church. They are well aware that such is not its position; but those who fight with the assistance of lies are indifferent to whether they lie more or less, as long as they can accomplish their own goal. To these enemies of the Polish National Alliance belongs a certain part of the Polish clergy--that part which wants to gain absolute control over the people. This is but a fraction and not a large one at that, but it is very vociferous. Priests who are earnest and sane, who take their esteemed mission seriously, do not conduct a scandalous warfare with the Polish National Alliance. Some might be opponents of a certain faction <span class="page-break">3</span>in the Alliance, but they are not enemies of the whole organization.</p>
   <p>The second category of enemies is constituted of those who fight the Alliance because of its patriotism. Here are a certain number of Polish Socialists or, to be more truthful, international Socialists using the Polish language. These people are not interested in the cultivation of the economic thought known as Socialism as much as they are interested in the control of the well-organized and wealthy Polish National Alliance. Their intention is to ruin this organization if they are unsuccessful in uprooting patriotism from its midst. Since it is impossible to uproot patriotism from the hearts of normal Poles, the only alternative the Socialists have is to annihilate this source of patriotism by destroying the organization. These people also resort to lies and calumnies of another kind. They present the Polish National Alliance as being opposed to the interests of the working people. That the Alliance itself employs union men only and that it defends organized labor in its articles are facts of no significance to these radicals.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>A Socialist speaker ascends a platform and, in a very calm manner, lies to his listeners, by telling them, for example, that the Alliance, in its articles, supports the strikebreakers against striking union men. These gentlemen lie in the same degree as those who call the Alliance an enemy of religion.</p>
   <p>In the third category of enemies of the Alliance we must include all those who are personal enemies of certain workers in the Alliance who have been given the organization's confidence. For example, Mr. X. or Mr. Y. was not elected to some office during a convention; hence Mr. X. or Mr. Y. must have his revenge--on the Alliance. Therefore, he causes a secession, tears whole groups away from the Alliance, hires agents and sends them to various groups, and writes letters and prints circulars. He does all of this seemingly with good intentions, but in reality he is interested only in satisfying his ego and showing the Alliance what the organization lost by failing to recognize his greatness. These enemies are probably the worst because, although members of the Alliance themselves, they betray their own organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance must fight with all these foes in order to weaken their evil influence upon its development and activity.</p>
   <p>The newspapers of the Polish National Alliance do everything they can. They answer the attacks in so far as they are worth answering. Some of these charges are so silly that they deserve no answer.</p>
   <p>The newspapers point out the errors and lies of various assailants, but little can be gained from teaching someone sincerity who knows beforehand that he conducts himself shamelessly and insincerely.</p>
   <p>Neither the newspapers, nor the central administration, nor individual officials, are able to cope with such a great number of enemies of the Alliance. Their branches spread throughout the entire nation, as do the numerous articles with which these evil-thinking people conduct their campaign.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The greatest obligation in the battle against the enemies of the Alliance, therefore, rests upon the shoulders of the Alliance members themselves. All of the members of this organization should take part in this warfare and defend themselves and their interests.</p>
   <p>The most applicable method in this battle, and the most formidable weapon, is an arduous exertion of energy in building the Polish National Alliance. The members are therefore urged to do those things that their enemies want them to abstain from doing; the organization will benefit. If some misguided priest attacks the Alliance from the pulpit or in an article, the local members of the Alliance should increase their group twofold in one month. Parents should enroll their children in the organization. Everyone should induce his or her friend, relative, or companion to become a member. After all, the priest who attacks the Polish National Alliance has but one goal in mind--to harm the Alliance. The people should combat his influence by strengthening the Alliance in their</p>
