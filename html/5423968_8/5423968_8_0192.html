Although they have definite proof of the guilt of the accused, yet after several hours of deliberation they cannot agree upon a unanimous verdict. They are then released by the judge from further duty. The same comedy is repeated in the next trial of the same defendant until he is finally declared not guilty. Just what type of argument persuades the conscience and the reason of the jurors to allow themselves to make such mockery of justice--that is difficult to say. It is sufficient to mention that the local juries are of little worth and only cause the courts loss of time and money. Laws and justice here are being openly flouted.
