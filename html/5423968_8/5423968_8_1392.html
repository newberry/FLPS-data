   <p>Dear Brothers:</p>
   <p>For the second time we are addressing you, dear brothers, on this important question we intend to speak of the Polish Catholic Federation. The work and energy displayed was already mentioned to you during the recent address. We, nevertheless, hope that you know the necessity of organizing the Poles into one body or a Federation, and the great results we would be able to gain, if we were so united. Only working together we shall be able to save and keep our younger generation in the faith of our fathers and in Polish nationality. So, dear brothers, take this question under careful consideration at your future meeting.</p>
   <p>The Federation demands only ten cents dues a year from each member. Everyone can pay this. So for this reason join the Federation and contribute ten cents for this worthy aim. This small offering will make nobody poor, and from all of these small donations we shall be able to gather a large sum, from which we will be able to most our needs.</p>

   <p>We firmly believe, dear brothers, that you will be grateful to us for asking you to do this. Polish Catholic Organizations should and ought to belong to the Federation. We know that not one of our members has any complaints against this Federation.</p>
