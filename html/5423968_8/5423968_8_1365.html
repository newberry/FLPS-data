   <p>Summary:</p>
   <p>The celebration held Memorial Day at the foot of Kosciuszko's monument was a beautiful manifestation of Polish patriotism to the hero of two countries. Because this American holiday fell on a Saturday, a few Polish citizens thought that it would serve the purpose for the Polish people to pay tribute to Kosciuszke's monument in Humboldt Park and show the other nationalities that the Polish people in Chicago did not forget about their here.</p>
   <p>A few thousand Poles, among them the aged and the young, did not pay any attention to the prediction of bad weather but took part in this parade. The people gathered at the corner of Division and Milwaukee Avenues, displaying banners, flags and society emblems. The people along Division Street joined in the parade as they passed by until they reached the foot of the monument.</p>
