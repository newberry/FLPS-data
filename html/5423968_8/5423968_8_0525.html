   <p>In the last census of the city of Chicago the population of the city was two million three hundred eighty thousand five hundred.</p>
   <p>We can say that anything over two millions are Poles. Among Poles in Chicago half of them are from Poland and the other half are the first or second generation born in this country.</p>
   <p>Among Poles of the first and second generation there are many who do not understand the Polish language, they are ex-Poles, some of them never went to Polish parochial schools or they have forgotten how to speak Polish, having used it very seldom and they have taken not only the language but also the customs of a large American city.</p>
   <p>It is a very sad story but true, and it has happened very often. The Poles in Chicago generally live around the Polish churches. The parishes, schools and brotherly aid societies depend on the church and the parish indirectly, and directly depend upon large organizations.</p>
   <p>We have in Chicago about 750 societies. The Polish Roman-Catholic Union in Chicago represents 256 societies with 30,000 members of both sexes, brothers and sisters of the Union.</p>
   <p>There are 43 Polish parishes and churches of Roman-Catholics in Chicago.</p>
   <p>On the Northwest Side of the city there are 14 parishes close to each other, on the Southwest Side there are 12 parishes, in South Chicago there are 3 and in the suburbs there are 14 parishes.</p>
   <p>There are 20 parishes in Chicago, containing over one thousand families.</p>
   <p>The largest of the parishes and the oldest is St. Stanislaus Kostka; there are 4,000 families belonging to this church still.</p>
   <p>The smallest of the parishes is St. Mary of Gostyn in the suburb of East Grove with 50 families.</p>
   
   <p>To the Polish parishes of the Roman-Catholic religion belong 50,000 active families, and about that many do not belong to any parish.</p>
   <p>For the service in those parishes there are over 100 clergymen of our nationality, and the bishop.</p>
   <p>In every one of these parishes we have a school. Over 30,000 children go to these Polish schools, where they are taught by 525 sisters.</p>
   <p>Beside the Roman-Catholic churches we have one Independent Catholic church located on Lubeck Street. This church was established about 18 years ago.</p>
   <p>We have three Polish cemeteries, the largest and oldest one is St. Adalbert on the Northwest Side of the city; Resurrection Cemetery, on the Southwest Side of the city; Holy Cross, on the Southeast Side in the suburd of West Hammond.</p>
   <p>We also have a Polish orphanage under the name of St. Hedwig, where about 400 children are being raised and educated, and three shelters for poor children; a home for the aged and an orphan's nursery is being built and will be completed soon.</p>
   <p>We have a Polish hospital, St, Mary of Nazareth, built according to the most modern hygienic demands, containing about 200 patients in each section, among them about 20 poor patients receiving every day medical advice and medicine free.</p>
   <p>We have in Chicago a few Polish high schools. The oldest one is St. Stanislaus College, where every year about 175 students are receiving an education. Then there is the Holy Trinity High School and the Academy of St. Nazareth, a boarding school for girls.</p>
   <p>We have four daily papers and seven weekly periodicals. The most popular daily is Dziennik Chicagoski (Polish Daily News), published for about 20 years; one of the weekly periodicals is our society's official organ, Narod Polski (Polish Nation).</p>
   <p>We have all kinds of institutions of social or national character, a few Polish banks and about 50 savings, and building loan associations, representing $5,000,000 Polish capital.</p>
   <p>We have Polish print shops and book shops, libraries, information offices, commission houses, warehouses and stores. We have many Poles who are successful in industry, trade, manufacturing and business.</p>
   <p>We have hundreds of people of different occupations; lawyers, physicians, publishers, professors, artists, political officials, etc.</p>
   <p>We have buildings where the administration offices of our four general Polish organizations are located, Polish Roman-Catholic Union, Polish Alma Mater, Polish National Alliance, and Polish Women's Alliance.</p>
   <p>So we have everything in Chicago, plenty of people, talents, power and general well-being. The one thing we do not have among us Poles is mutual understanding, unanimity of action in our socio-national work. The damage done by this deficiency in our character is enormous, incalcuable, irreparable.</p>
