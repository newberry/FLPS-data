   <p>Yesterday evening, a gathering of Polish political leaders of the Eighth Congressional District was held at the rectory of the Reverend Francis Gordon for the purpose of discussing the possibility of electing a Pole from this district to the House of Representatives. The Reverend Gordon presided, with H. Lokanski acting as secretary. Earnest speeches for conducting as energetic a campaign as possible for the election of a Pole to this office were made by Father Gordon, J. F. Smulski, Alderman [S.] Kunz, Alderman S. Walkowiak, Committeeman [J.] Ruszkiewicz, the Reverend J. Obyrtacz, Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, the Reverend Zwierzchowski, Editor K. Wachtel, Attorney Koralewski, Editor J. J. Chrzanowski, Attorney [S.] Jankowski, H. Lokanski, and [P.] Rostenkowski, former president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>All of the addresses reflected anxiety for unity of action. This critical period also was emphasized as a time which we need a Congressional representative in Washington who would not only have influence in American circles, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but who would understand the Polish cause and would present and defend it in Congress.</p>
   <p>Although the exhaustive discussion continued until midnight, it brought no definite result. However, a temporary decision was reached to propose Koralewski for the post before a political mass meeting. A committee to call the mass meeting was not chosen.</p>
