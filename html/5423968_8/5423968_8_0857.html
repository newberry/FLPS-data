   <p>Walter Filipiak, the newly elected president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union Baseball League of Chicago, and manager of the champion Brighton Stars, addressed the members of the Alliance of Polish Literary and Dramatic Circles convention, on Tuesday evening, at Five Holy Martyrs Hall. The peppy president outlined the work which is being done to promote sports in the organization.</p>
   <p>"While the literary and dramatic clubs were doing their share toward the Polish intellectual cause," he said, "the Polish Roman Catholic Union is not neglecting the physical development of its youth."</p>
   <p>Filipiak expects the Polish Roman Catholic Union Baseball loop of 1930 to be greater than any in the history of the organization. He is formulating plans by which he hopes to make the Polish Roman Catholic Union Baseball loop the best in the city. No definite date has been set for the initial meeting of the year by the congregation of baseball managers, but it is hinted that the league will get an early start in its affairs.</p>
