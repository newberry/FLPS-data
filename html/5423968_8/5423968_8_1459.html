   <p>In a short while summer concerts will again be given in Chicago parks. Music is usually furnished by German orchestras with the exception of one Czech orchestra. Can't there be found one among our Polish orchestra directors, who would try and get the park authorities to engage at least one Polish orchestra in some park?</p>
   <p>Without a Polish orchestra we cannot expect other foreign orchestras to play Polish melodies. Within the past year the directors of the Polish Youth Alliance sent a resolution to the park commissioners in which they demanded that the concert orchestra render Polish musical compositions, but being late in the season their resolution did not bring about the necessary results. Such a resolution should again be sent whether or not a Polish orchestra is engaged. Messrs. Polish directors, to action! Demand that which 125,000 Poles in Chicago rightfully deserve.</p>
