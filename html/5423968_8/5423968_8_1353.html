   <p>This notice is to remind all those who intend to apply to the Polish National Alliance for tuition loans without interest, that applications for such loans will be accepted until and including January 15.</p>
   <p>If you have already received your application fill it out, and together with your school certificate, send it at once.</p>
   <p>All Polish National Alliance library groups who need more books, should apply to the Department of Education, which will supply them at once without cost.</p>
   <p>These groups which are able to buy their books, will save money, if they make their purchases through our Department of Education. Our order for books will be placed in the near future; it is therefore advisable that we receive your order promptly. We buy for less because we buy in large quantities, thereby effecting a saving in both cost and shipment.</p>
   <p>S. Orpiszewski, Secretary.</p>
