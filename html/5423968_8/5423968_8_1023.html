   <p>Yesterday afternoon at Paul Lenard's hall, 3737 South Wood Street, exercises commemorating the January Insurrection were held jointly with the installation of officers of the new Alliance group, which will bear the name of Bartosz Glowacki, [Group] 1972 of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by our well-known national worker, John Czurylo, who in a brief speech called upon Mr. W. Wrzesinski, director of the Polish National Alliance, to act as chairman, and upon Mr. W. Nalepka to act as secretary. Chairman Wrzesinski, in a short, terse speech, explained the purpose of holding commemorative exercises and national memorials. Following this the program was begun. It consisted of a speech by Mrs. M. Milewski, director of the Polish National Alliance; a recitation by a member of Falcon Nest 3 in Bridgeport; songs by the I. Paderewski Choir; numbers by the local orchestra; a speech by Mr. Sulewski, officer of Circuit II of the Alliance of Polish Falcons; and an unusually interesting one-act drama, entitled <span class="page-break">\2</span>"The Tenth Pavilion," produced by the local Falcon nest. Toward the end of the program a collection was taken up to defray the expenses of arranging the exercises by the new group, which brought in $13.01.</p>
   <p>Upon the conclusion of the commemorative exercises, the installation of the new officers of the group for the present year took place. These consisted of the following: W. Kozlowski, president; Frank Baranowicz, vice-president; John Nowacki, recording secretary; John Czurylo, financial secretary; Joseph Podemski, treasurer; Carol Chlebicki, commandant; Adalbert Nalepka, Walter Spiewan, and Leopold Mikrut, advisory board; Anthony Kozlowski, sergeant at arms; and John Kaluza, standard-bearer.</p>
   <p>With the audience joining in the singing of the Falcon hymn "Ospaly i Gnusny" [Sleepy and Lazy] and the national hymn "Boze cos Polske" [God Save Poland], this pleasant--and rare in Peter and Paul's Parish--national celebration was brought to a close.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>It should be added that all the numbers on the program came out exceptionally well and were enthusiastically applauded by the large audience. During the installation of the officers, six new members joined the Alliance's ranks and many more will join at the next meeting. Therefore, one can assume that the Bartosz Glowacki Nest, which has been inactive for quite some time, will now develop into a powerful group of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
