   <p>The beautiful Polish Hall that has been in process of erection by Andrew Szulc will be opened at St. Stanislaus Parish.</p>
   <p>The brick building, which is on the corner of Blackhawk and Noble Streets, has a modern front. The hall has room for 500 hundred chairs and 200 seats in the gallery. The stage is as large as that of Walsh's hall. The stage screen and curtain has been made by the Polish artist B. Markiewicz. The wardrobes for the men and women are large and commodious. Electric lights will illuminate the hall as well as the stage. Besides the large auditorium, there are a number of large rooms for socials, meetings, etc.</p>
   <p>This evening Sokol No. II will present a review on the stage. Two plays, "Falszywy Jakajlo" [The False Stammerer] and "Fryzyer Bohater" [The Heroic Barber], under the direction of Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, will be presented tomorrow.</p>

   <p>On-Monday, April 29, the Polish Cavalry will hold its annual ball.</p>
   <p>[Opening ceremonies not given in later issues.]</p>
