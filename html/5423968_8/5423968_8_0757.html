   <p>At no time, perhaps, in a political campaign of this country, or at least in Chicago, have the Polish citizens taken a more active part [in politics], nor have they ever been more interested in civic affairs than in the present year. And little wonder! It must be remembered that there are many Polish names on the tickets of both parties, names of men who at the coming primaries will strive to gain nominations, and who consequently [if nominated] will seek election to public office. They will endeavor to obtain that which has long been their due. By such action these candidates, as well as our people who vote for them, will manifest to American citizens of other nationalities that the Polish vote is strong and has some significance. They will also show that our people are not mere illiterate peasants who only know how to work hard, pay taxes, and keep quiet. A civic and national pride has been aroused in our people. We have finally arrived at the conclusion that as citizens of this country much is due to our people. The Polish citizens will not be satisfied with mere crumbs from the tables of <span class="page-break">2</span>politicians of other nationalities. It is the Polish vote that has always aided these politicians in gaining victory, and in return our people have received nothing, or very little.</p>
   <p>The Poles in Chicago have awakened. They realize that since there are 350,000 Poles in Chicago, of whom more than 60,000 are citizens legally qualified to vote, more important political positions are due to our people than jobs as street cleaners, park workers, and waterworks laborers. It is high time that the politicians should realize that it is not sufficient for our people to have but a few Polish aldermen in the City Hall or a small number of our compatriots placed as assistants in public offices. The Poles of Chicago have numerical strength and political power, and our people should let every one know that they know how to use that power properly for the benefit of Polish immigrants.</p>
   <p>And so a bitter, though bloodless, political battle is now in full swing in Chicago Whole columns of candidates of various nationalities have <span class="page-break">3</span>entered the political lists. Among these candidates there are many Poles. Our people have never in the past presented such a list of candidates of Polish extraction aspiring for various offices. What is most significant is the fact that as many as eight Poles are candidates for the office of Congressman. This means that eight Poles are endeavoring to become representatives to the highest legislative body in this country, where probably in the not so distant future a great deal will be said of our devastated and unfortunate Poland.</p>
   <p>The Poles as if instinctively have felt the importance of the moment. They have acknowledged the necessity of having their own representatives in Congress, that they, and not strangers, may discuss our affairs. It is natural to assume that people of other nationalities do not know the needs of Poles and are not animated by the Polish spirit. Probably strangers would soon forget our cause completely.</p>
   <p>For this reason as many as eight candidates in the three Congressional <span class="page-break">4</span>districts where Polish citizens are most thickly settled have simultaneously declared their intention of applying for that public office. It is therefore to be hoped that our people will succeed in electing some of these Polish candidates. This is only possible if we work hand in hand and cast a solid vote in favor of these Polish candidates at the coming primaries and later at the elections. And now a few words about our candidates. The Fourth Congressional District has the following Polish candidates: John Golombieski, a Republican, a former alderman, a member of the Polish National Alliance, who for many years has been active in political circles; John S. Palt, a Republican, little known politically, and a man who thus for has accomplished nothing in politics that would distinguish him from others, for whom the Republican Poles of that district would nevertheless do better to vote, unless they vote for Golombieski, than for a non-Polish candidate who perhaps has fewer qualifications than our candidates and would take little thought for Poles after entering Congress; and Stanley J. Kuflewski, who has the best chance of winning the nomination in that District, a druggist by profession, a sincere and responsible person, a member of long standing of <span class="page-break">5</span>the Polish National Alliance, a delegate to several conventions of the Alliance, active in every field and worthy to be our representative in Congress; one who will receive the support of the Bohemians living in that district, since they do not have a candidate of their own and therefore are expected to cast their votes for their fellow Slav, whose candidacy Poles also should feel it their duty to support.</p>
   <p>The Seventh Congressional District is recognized as the most extensive in Chicago. The following Poles there appear as candidates for Congress: Leon S. Mallek, a Republican, a young, capable, and energetic attorney, a son of Anthony Mallek, the founder of Polish singing in America, former general secretary of the Polish National Alliance and organist of Holy Trinity Parish, while Attorney Mallek himself is a legal adviser for the Polish National Alliance, with a well-rounded education, speaking Polish and English exceptionally well, agreeable and polite, and energetic and determined in important matters; a true Pole, coming from a worthy family, who once in Congress would bring no shame on our people but on the contrary by his activities <span class="page-break">6</span>there would cause us to feel pride, a candidate who would adequately represent the younger generation born and reared here; Michael Dominowski, a Democrat, member of the Polish National Alliance, an elderly person, lacking higher education, reserved in manner, an honest man, (although in the opinion of this newspaper these qualifications alone are insufficient for a public office so responsible as is that of Congressman), one whom Polish Democrats who will not or cannot cast their votes for Mr. Mallek, are asked to support rather than to vote for a candidate of some other nationality, since it is best to give priority to one of our own people.</p>
   <p>The most bitter political battle is in the Eighth Congressional District. Three strong candidates have entered the contest; each possesses qualifications of greater or less degree. The candidates are P. M. Ksycki, a Republican, an old member of the Polish National Alliance, a delegate to several conventions of the Alliance, its former vice-president, at present an advertising agent for the Dziennik Zwiazkowy, candidate for Congressman <span class="page-break">7</span>of that same district eight years ago against Mr. Gallagher, of Irish descent, giveing him considerable opposition, this indicating his political strength, and losing the election by less than five hundred votes as a Republican candidate in a Democratic district, a man who despite this handicap, would undoubtedly have been elected had it not been for the intrigues of some of the political machines which out of pure jealousy would not allow him to obtain that public office, one who had a higher education and speaks Polish and English fluently and eloquently, energetic and ingenuous, and adequately qualified to be a candidate for that office, one who will not disappoint the Republican Poles in that District if they vote for him; N. L. Piotrowski, a Democrat, an attorney of several years' experience, former city counsellor of Chicago, a special correspondent of an English-language newspaper, the Chicago Herald, who in his investigation of conditions in Poland remained in that country several months and sent a number of interesting letters [to the Herald], a man who speaks Polish and English fluently and is energetic and properly qualified for the position of Congressman, the candidate recently indorsed at a mass meeting sponsored by <span class="page-break">8</span>the regular Sixteenth Ward Democratic organization; and Z. H. Kadow, a Democrat, a young lawyer, an assistant State's attorney, member of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Because of the bitter political rivalry which existed between Mr. N. L. Piotrowski and Mr. Z. Kadow, by the advice of right-thinking and respectable citizens both candidates signed and made public an agreement to the effect that whichever should receive the majority of the votes of the Polish citizens at the mass meeting, held on Thursday, September 7, 1915, should be the candidate. In addition it was agreed that the candidate losing at this mass meeting would not only withdraw his candidacy but would also work in behalf of his opponent.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that an overwhelming majority (ten to one) of the Polish Democrats at this mass meeting declared themselves for Mr. Piotrowski, Mr. Kadow, as a true Pole and a man who keeps his word of honor, should be considered as no longer a candidate.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Should, therefore, Mr. Ksycki win the nomination on the Republican ticket and Mr. Piotrowski on the Democratic ticket, an honorable contest for priority between these two would take place. Whichever of these two Poles wins will be well suited to represent our people. It is for the voters to choose whom they wish to have as representative of the Poles at Washington.</p>
