   <p>The president of Ireland, William T. Cosgrave, arrived in the United States. In every city wherever Mr. William T. Cosgrave visits, sumptuous festivities are held and the whole Irish population manifests its sentiment for the transmarine fatherland.</p>
   <p>What a difference between the Irish and Polish nationalities! Particularly the Polish youth. They are not at all interested in the native land of their fathers. Many of them belong to Irish parishes and we can be certain that we will see some of them among the Irish crowds, greeting the president of Ireland.</p>
   <p>Today some of the Irish parishes, as for instance, St. John's the Burehman, have a great number of Poles among their parishioners.</p>
   <p>It is with grief that we admit that the Irish hunters are quite clever in setting their traps to get the Polish youth.</p>
