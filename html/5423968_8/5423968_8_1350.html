   <p>A twenty-fifth jubilee celebration of one of the oldest groups of the Polish National Alliance, group 41, known as the Young Businessmen's Society, was held on Sunday, September 11, 1910. A religious ceremony for the benefit of the society was conducted in the morning at the Holy Trinity Church. Reverend C. Sztuczko delivered an appropriate sermon in which he expressed his congratulations to the society, wishing them future growth and development. In the afternoon, at about four-thirty, the members of group 41, as well as other guest groups, met at a captain designated location, and to the strains of a musical band, marched to Walsh's Hall. Here they were met by a large committee from group 2 of the Polish National Alliance, which, as the oldest group, greeted its younger affiliate.</p>
