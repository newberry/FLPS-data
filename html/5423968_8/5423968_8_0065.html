   <p>For purposes of explanation, I announce that at present, besides myself and Dr. M. Olgiert Kaczorowska, several Americans well known in this city are taking an active interest in the matter of the Polish murderers sentenced to death. Yesterday, as Mrs. Witlain informed me, three legal representatives from Chicago left for Springfield to submit to the Governor of the State of Illinois a petition asking him to change the death penalty for life imprisonment.</p>
   <p>The petition is strong and convincing in form, presenting good points and reasons why the young criminals should not be hanged, but punished with life imprisonment.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Dr. Anna Wyczolkowska.</p>
