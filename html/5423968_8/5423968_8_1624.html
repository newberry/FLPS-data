   <p>According to the records kept by the secretary of the Polish League, exactly one hundred dollars was donated to this institution during the first week of its existence; namely, from Thursday, May 10 to Thursday, May 17, 1894. Out of this amount $41.23 goes to the Polish National Fund and the rest, $58.77, goes to the League itself.</p>
   <p>Eighty men and thirty-one women became members of the League, and ninety-seven children paid the special penny assessment--that is, from one to twelve--cents--to the Polish National Fund.</p>
   <p>This report may not be quite accurate and needs verification or rather confirmation by the Central Board of the Polish League and the Trustees of the Polish National Fund. As was explained by the secretary in one of his appeals, this inaccuracy was caused by a misunderstanding at the time of <span class="page-break">2</span>accepting the first donations. The donors did not always specify what amount should be credited to the Polish National Fund and what amount should go to the League, and the name of the donor was not always given. In South Chicago, for example, $7.82 was collected, and the entire amount was assigned to the Polish National Fund. Reverend Sebastynski sent four dollars which be collected, to the office of Gazeta Katelicka, to be applied to the Polish National Fund, but the names of the donors were not given.</p>
   <p>This mix-up must be avoided, so that in the future there will be no misunderstanding as to how the money is to be proportioned.</p>
   <p>Actually, more persons have joined the League than was recorded by the secretary. According to the information at hand, at least three hundred persons expressed their desire to pay the regular yearly dues; however, only two hundred and eight were registered.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>It should also be noted that not even one society, as such, has had sufficient time to make known its desire to join the League, so that all donations so far have come directly from individuals without the aid of any agency or society. This shows that the public was very interested in this undertaking even before it began to function regularly. We, therefore, have reason to hope that in a short time not hundreds, but thousands of persons will be joining the League every week.</p>
