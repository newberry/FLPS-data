   <p>Sentence was passed by American courts a few days ago, in two cases; that, imposed on a woman charged with the murder of her husband, the other case, we regret to state, was that of 6 degenerate youths of Polish origin who murdered a poor, innocent farmer. The case of the woman in Denver, was disposed of by acquittal, whereas, for a similar crime of cold blooded murder, the 6 boys were convicted; four were sentenced to death by hanging, and the other two, who are minors, to life imprisonment. In both cases the murder was premeditated and cold blooded; therefore, as a matter of justice the guilty should pay the penalty, yet, four boys were sentenced to the gallows for their crime, while in the other case, the woman who admitted a love affair with a millionaire, and had slain her invalid husband in cold blood was acquitted. In both cases the crime committed was murder, and the penalty should have been the same.</p>
   <p>We are not in favor of the extreme death penalty, but to set free a murderess is an invitation to other women to commit crime. But the woman had a rich lover who could use his money and influence in her favor. The decision in both cases indicates that American courts are a long way from impartiality and absolute justice.</p>
