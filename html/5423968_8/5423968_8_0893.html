   <p>Dear Brothers and Sisters!</p>
   <p>The 24th of June, will mark for us our first great demonstration upon the occasion of the golden jubilee of the Polish Roman Catholic Union Organization. This event the committee wishes to extend throughout the entire summer until late fall.</p>
   <p>The organizers in Chicago are planning a trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin with the aim of reflecting this event there, also to honor our loved chaplain, the most Reverend Father, B. Celichowski, who on this day also shall celebrate his silver anniversary of priesthood.</p>
   <p>Dear friends! we urge you to partake in this double celebration whether members of this organization or not. Our aim is to show the province what the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Poles of Chicago can really accomplish when they unite themselves for work.</p>
   <p>Every society in Chicago ought to be represented.</p>
   <p>The committee in Milwaukee will arrange for the visitors a glorious welcome.</p>
   <p>We invite you, Fellowmen, to participate in this trip, which shall be a wonderful manifestation.</p>
   <p>F. Tomczak.</p>
