   <p>From Dec. 1, 1914 to Nov. 30, 1915, there were 2,326 boys of all nationalities in the Juvenile Court; 489, or about 21% of the boys, were of Polish descent.</p>
   <p>In 1914 there were only 350 Polish boys before the Juvenile Court; then in 1915 the number of transgressive Polish minors increased to 139 (sic) cases of 35%.</p>
   <p>What was the reason for this demoralization of Polish boys? During the past year in regard to the matter of transgression I was trying to illustrate the reasons leading the Polish children to crime. And now I will prove by the facts that one of the many reasons of moral downfall of Polish boys is probably that they do not care much for the school, and</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>I will prove this by the school records.</p>
   <p>Here I will illustrate the table as to how the 142 Polish boys at the present time are under the care of the Juvenile Courts and what kind of benefits they have received from schools.</p>

   <p>From the above record we see that 83 boys or 50% of the total did not finish even the 5th grade, and only five received diplomas finishing the 8th grade, then only 15 are still going to school.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The same percentage can be found in boys of other nationalities. Boys under the care of the Juvenile Court with the same percentage of education. Is the neglect of schooling when boys are allowed to go into the world alone, breaking away from the control of the parents, one of the causes of transgression?</p>
   <p>And now about the Polish boys in general.</p>
   <p>This statistical table shows from what kind of grades the 86 Polish boys going to the parochial school received work certificates during the time of January 1, 1916 to February 16, 1916.</p>

   <p>In general, there were about 40 or 50% who left school at the age of fourteen; 32 did not reach the 5th grade, and only 15 went above 6th grade.</p>
   <p>But none finished the 8th grade.</p>

   <p>The 59 or over 40% of Polish boys who just finished 14 years of age left the school and asked for a certificate to work. Only 15 boys remained in school and reached the age of 15 years. 37 did not even <span class="page-break">5</span>finish the 4th grade; 35 barely finished 6th grade, and only 1 got through the 8th grade.</p>
   <p>From the above mentioned two tables we are sure that not only are there more Polish boys under the control of the Juvenile court, but as a rule the Polish boys leave school too soon.</p>
   <p>Then come the questions (1) Why and what is the reason so many of our Polish boys have to leave school before they graduate? (2) Why do Polish boys born in Chicago go to school only 7 or 8 years, and do not have plenty of ability to finish the 8th grade?</p>
   <p>In some cases and in some critical conditions of the parents, the boys have to look for work, but as it very often happens parents compel the children to go to work, so with the children's earnings they may increase their income.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The result of this is that these types are breaking away from the control of the parents, and are not able to find work; they fall down morally and finally they are under the care of the Juvenile Court.</p>
   <p>To stop such results, the pastor of any parish school might decrease the record of transgression of minors by carefully giving to school children certificate for work.</p>
   <p>Attention should also be given to the transferring of children from the parochial school to another. This does not bring them any benefits because they waste their time trying to learn the new system of another school.</p>
   <p>These facts are presented for attention and consideration. Why does a boy, born in Chicago of normal build, healthy physically and mentally, at the age of 14 leave school barely from the 5th grade, and often from 4th grade, going to school for 8 years? Why? Who is responsible for this. Where and what kind of medicine can cure this trouble?</p>
