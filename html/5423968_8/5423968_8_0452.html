   <p>What is to be understood by the word Americanization? Different people give different translations of it. American chauvinists by this word understand only one language, unity of thought and opinion, one sympathy and antipathy. They imagine that an inhabitant of America should not be able to speak more than one language. This is a foolish Americanization, similar to the Prussian system of denationalization.</p>
   <p>And where is American freedom, where is justice? If the American chauvinists were allowed today to throw the Polish language out of parochial schools, then tomorrow they will be allowed to throw out from these same schools the Catholic religion.</p>
   <p>The Polish parochial schools have the same program as exists in the public schools. The children learn the English language, United States history and arithmetic in the English language. All the subjects are lectured upon in the English language, because the Poles want to be <span class="page-break">\2</span>good citizens of the United States. They want to be equal to Americans in everything, fulfilling all duties in patriotism and speech. But above all they wish to be able to speak the English language because it is dear to them.</p>
   <p>We comprehend Americanization in this manner: teach everyone to write, read and speak the English language; acquaint everyone with the statutes, principles and ideals of the United States; demand from all respect of laws and the sacrificing of one's personal self for his country in time of need, but along with all of this not to tear away by force from any other languages which one has a knowledge of, or wishes to acquire.</p>
