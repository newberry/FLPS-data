   <p>President Schlessinger spent ten days in Chicago during which time he thoroughly investigated the situation of the Cloak-Makers Union. He was not satisfied with the meeting he had with the Joint Board only, but visited the meetings of every local in Chicago, and, besides that, he held conferences with various committees of both Joint Board and locals.....All who came in contact with him, at these conferences and meetings, will admit that he took into consideration every question in behalf of the Cloak-Makers Union and showed a very impartial judgement. The regular membership meetings at which he was present, were the largest ever attended since last year. With the fact that he is well known to the Cloak-Makers organization in general and especially to the Chicago locals, as well as the fact that he was for a long time a member and organizer of the Chicago unions, his recommendations possess a double value.</p>
   <p>Besides the recommendations he spoke several times and those who heard him must admit that all his speeches led towards one point, namely, to strengthen <span class="page-break">2</span>the Cloakmakers Union.</p>
   <p>1. To start a campaign organizing the complete dress industry. Changes in the personnel of the executive must be made before the International Union starts this campaign.</p>
   <p>2. No changes shall be made regarding the election of business agents.</p>
   <p>3. The finances must be administered the same as until now, namely, treasuries of the various locals must be one with that of the Joint Board, and those locals that have withdrawn various funds must replace them.</p>
   <p>4. The newly elected Financial Secretary of the Joint Board, Kogefski, must have the cooperation of all delegates of the Joint Board as well as the general membership.</p>
   <p>5. A system whereby the present expense can be reduced must be established. Strict economy shall be the aim.</p>
   <p>6. Brother Bernstein of Pressers Local 18, shall until the next election act as Chairman of the Joint Board.</p>
   <p>7. Transactions with the manufacturers regarding an agreement shall be taken up a few weeks later.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>As pointed out before, these recommendations were worked out by Schlessinger after a fundamental investigation of the situation of the Chicago Cloakmakers Union, and they were, according to his opinion, necessary to comply with in order to establish harmony in the Cloakmakers Union, and make it possible to start an extensive organizing campaign in order to strengthen it.</p>
   <p>A representative of Forward went over every point with Pres. Schlessinger before he left for New York and here is the explanation:</p>
   <p>Point 1. Regarding the reorganizing of Local 100 - Pres. Schlessinger claims that many of the members of the present Executive Board of Local 100 have not the slightest conception of the practical work required for a trade union. In order to organize the trade it is absolutely necessary to start a gigantic organization campaign. This will cost a large sum of money, and it may lead to a general strike. The International can not therefore undertake such an enormous task, unless there is a capable Executive Board in that local.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Point 2. Regarding the election of business agents.</p>
   <p>As it was in the past, any member of any local could be nominated, and if accepted as a candidate he was placed on the ballot. Who ever received the most votes was elected. Lately among the pressers an antagonism was created as they wished not to have regular ballots, as in the past, but that one of their members should be the business agent. Pres. Schlessinger was against such a plan because he believes that as representatives we must have in mind the interests of the Amalgamated Union and not have a system which will lead to the development of politics and patronage in only one local.</p>
   <p>It is true the workers are separated, according to their trade, in different locals, but the manufacturers must know that his workers belong to one organization and that one business agent deals with him for all the workers. There is another important suggestion under discussion in the new plan: If it will be permitted for the pressers to elect their own business agent. If so, all locals will demand the same right, and the result will be, instead of three or four business agents at the most, the organization <span class="page-break">5</span>will have a business agent for every local which would mean a greater and unnecessary expense for the organization.</p>
   <p>Point 3. Regarding the finances.</p>
   <p>It is to the interests of the cloak workers to economize. Even though they are divided into different locals on account of the different trades, yet they must feel as one body. Only then will they get the recognition of the bosses and are enabled to better conditions. The present system of keeping all money in the treasury of the Joint Board must continue. The locals that have withdrawn their funds must return them.</p>
   <p>Point 4. Regarding the newly elected Financial Secretary.</p>
   <p>Brother Kogefski is new in this office and seems to be an intelligent person. We hope that, in a short time, he will prove his capabilities. The International will send its auditor here, for a few weeks, to help him in his work. If Kogefski proves unable to carry the financial books of our great Chicago union it will not be hard to make a change.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Point 5. Concerning economy.</p>
   <p>The expenses of the union for various secretaries and clerks, is too large. It must be greatly reduced. The expenses for secretaries, executive board, and local secretary are approximately $225 a week. Schlessinger recommends therefore, that all secretarial work of the entire union should be concentrated. If all secretarial work of the Joint Board and of the locals would be attended to by three able persons, and not as at present by six or seven persons, then the union would save not less than $5,000.</p>
   <p>Point 6. Concerning a new chairman of the Joint Board.</p>
   <p>The former chairman of the Joint Board, Brother Schaffer, has taken work outside of the cloak trade and resigned. The vice-chairman, Brother Lederman, is filling his position, temporarily. The Financial Secretary of the Joint Board is a member of Local 5. The Recording Secretary of Local 81 is the Vice-Chairman also of Local 81. Therefore, in order that our Joint Board shall have peace and harmony, Pres. Schlessinger is of the opinion that the Chairman of the Joint Board must be a member of Local 18. Brother Bernstein of Pressers Local 18, is one of the oldest and best <span class="page-break">7</span>attested union members. There is no reflection on his record. He is a loyal and devoted union man and Pres. Schlessinger has expressed the hope that, as Chairman, he will fulfill his position with tact and responsibility regarding the general welfare of the union.</p>
   <p>Point 7. Regarding the agreement.</p>
   <p>The agreement with the manufacturers association is still unsigned. The bosses refuse to grant certain clauses that affect the operators. Pres. Schlessinger is occupied with very urgent organization issues and he figures that in about five or six weeks he may come to Chicago, especially to complete the contract.</p>
