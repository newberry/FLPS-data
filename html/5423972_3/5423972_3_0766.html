   <p>We are again getting ready to unionize the Jewish industrial workers. We already have shown the workers, two weeks ago, the importance of unionizing the Jewish workers in Chicago industrial labor shops, but at the same time before we can begin to build a union of this kind, we must first find out why the old unions have gone under, so when the new builders of an organizatin for the united Jewish industrial workers, must bear in mind that it will take new systems, new energy, and new ideas to organize and to stay organized. For this is the only way a union of this kind will bear fruit.</p>
   <p>Right now is the opportune time for the Jewish workers movement to get the industrial workers organized in to unions, for the longer the delay in organizing, the longer will explortation continue by the employers continue. So hurry get busy, organize and stop struggling for your existence. If you wish to improve conditions, by all means, organize.</p>
   
   <p>Now is the time for all Jewish workers to get organized because there are already some very strong workers unions who will be glad to assist you in every way possible and to affiliate with you if necessary.</p>
   <p>One other problem which is vital; the united Jewish industrial workers must bear in mind that it is the building of a new workers alliance, which is to carry on the work among the Jewish masses of Chicago. The results are very gratifying, for it is some few years since there was not anything done in regards to the uniting of the Jewish tailors here, but we are in hopes and think that this time, success is assured.</p>
   <p>For the last few years, the tailoring trade has gone to its lowest ebb. Never before has the trade been at such a low ebb as at the present time. The conditions of the tailoring workers is appalling. The prices for their labor have been distressingly, lowered. The working hours are from twelve to sixteen a day, and being an organized, the bosses and foremen are ruling with an iron hand.</p>
   
   <p>The United Garment Workers, as the only organized tailor union, has decided to carry on an energetic and aggressive campaign in uniting the Jewish tailors in Chicago. The United Garment Workers will not leave a stone unturned, until all tailors are organized. They expect to work through mass meetings which are to be held every two weeks in all parts of the city. Through the newspapers, they expect to awaken the enslaved sleeping tailors. They will call on all the tailors who are weak and oppressed to organize themselves into strong unions and with united efforts to fight against their mistreatment by the bosses and foremen.</p>
   <p>Is there any other way or means whereby the tailors can be protected, except by organizing? There is absolutely no other better and faster way to improve conditions for the poor oppressed tailor! Organization is the main weapon with which to combat. We also wish to state to you unorganized Jewish tailors of Chicago, do not depend on any one to help you. It is a case of helping yourselves. It is entirely in your own hands. Organize and your oppression will cease.</p>
   
   <p>Right now is the opportune time for organizing. The United Garment Workers will welcome you with open arms, so do not over look this opportunity. Take advantage of it while it is knocking at your door, for the longer you wait, the worse your chances for better condition.</p>
