   <p>Delegates of United Hebrew Trades submitted important reports of their unions, at their last meeting, which started an interesting discussion regarding present conditions in the labor world, and what is to be done to strengthen the unions.</p>
   <p>Reduce Wages of Retail Clerks.</p>
   <p>The delegate of the Retail Clerks Union, local 195, reported the union having a conference with the West Side Merchants Association, owners of gents furnishings, clothing, and shoe stores, and that the bosses want to reduce the wages five to seven and one half dollars a week. The union, on the contrary, is demanding a fifty hour instead of a fifty-four hour working week. A second conference will be held to discuss the new agreement where they will try to come to an understanding regarding the reduction in wages, which matter was left unsettled.</p>
   <p>The Retail Clerks Union requested the United Hebrew Trades to start an organization campaign in the Jewish districts, to organize retail clerks and salesmen of the stores, which are not organized.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The delegate of local 195 pointed out many stores on Roosevelt Road, Milwaukee Ave., and other streets, where clerks are prohibited from organizing. He declared that the Jewish organized workers and sympathizers are not interested, and are not doing their duty to help the retail clerks, go on with their work, by organizing them, and that when they go to the stores to buy, they do not inquire whether the clerk carries a card or not. This brought a long and hot discussion, regarding conditions in the whole labor movement, also regarding the strange actions of the unions who do not try to help one another.</p>
   <p>Nearly all the delegates present at this meeting were under the impression that this condition is not a healthy one, and that something must be done, to work together to help organize the unorganized in the Jewish districts, especially the clerks. It was determined to appoint a committee of seven from various unions, to work out a plan to arrange a large organizing campaign, that will continue their work until the clerks and other workers will be rightly organized.</p>
   <p>The International Bakers appealed to the Jewish workers for moral help. Comrade Joseph Smith, general organizer of the International Bakers Union, came to the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>United Hebrew Trades, and informed the delegates, that the strike against the largest bakeries, such as Livingstons, Schulze, and Wards, was still on, and would be on until these trust companies realized that they must deal with baker unions, and have union shops. Comrade Smith declared that the workers could help and must help - as on this battle depends the existence of the Baker Union of America.</p>
   <p>If these bosses shall succeed in winning on local 2 - then they will start on the Jewish bakers, in New York, and try to install the open shop system. Comrade Smith showed that these bosses have cut the wages of the scab workers, considerably. They pay only $15 and $16 a week for long hours, yet they have not reduced the price of bread. That means that their cry that the high price of bread is the fault of the union is false, they were looking for bigger profits, and to fool the public by claiming that they were worrying for the public. Sure they are, for their own public, the bosses association!</p>
   <p>Comrade Smith appealed in the name of the tens of thousands bakers, to all the Jewish men and women to buy Jewish bread with the Union Label of the Ferband.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>If that will help force the bosses that have organized to break the unions, to recognize the union demands for human conditions and human wages. The Bakers Union is demanding very little from the Jewish working masses. The bakers are not asking for money, not asking you to work, nor to sacrifice. The Bakers Union merely asks that you eat bread with a Union Label, baked by union bakers, a small demand but an important one, because, on this depends the existence of the whole Baker Union of Chicago and of the whole country.</p>
   <p>A Boss Who Wants to Break the Fur Dressers Union.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bromberg from Bromberg and Co., 1426 N. Halsted St., wants to break the union of fur dressers. The delegate of the Fur Dressers Union declared to the United Hebrew Trades, that the whole International of the fur workers, will do all in its power to show this - that he cannot carry out his plan. It is very important that all fur manufacturers should know that this Mr. Bromberg is combating the Fur Dressers Union, and it is to their interest to know that their work is being done by strike breakers.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The fur workers of Chicago are financing the strike against this boss. Every striker draws strike benefit, and can strike for a year if Mr. Bromberg wishes to keep it up this long.</p>
   <p>Small tailor bosses have new schemes to fool the union. Where a man's business is a losing proposition, he looks for a partner to share his troubles. The small ladies tailor bosses found a new remedy, which is an old one in other trades; they hired a foreman and instructed him to say that he was a partner in the business. If so he does not have to account to the union for his actions. He can work as long as he likes, according to the report of a delegate from local 104 - Ladies Tailors Union. Such small bosses appeared in quite a few of the Ladies Tailoring Trades, and the union determined that the boss who came with a foreman as a partner, to the union, and kept the partner's business, would have to prove in black and white that he has a legal partner, and if it was found to be only a scheme to fool the union, then a strike would be declared against him.</p>

   <p>Waiters Union starting a campaign to organize the waiters in Messingers. The delegate to the United Hebrew Trades complained about the conditions of the waiters and cooks in Messingers, so that there remains to be done nothing other than to start a battle against the company, in order to force them to employ members of the Waiters Union. One of the lunch rooms owned by Messinger, where the waiters work fourteen hours a day, for small wages, is on Roosevelt Road, near Kedzie Ave., a neighborhood where there are many restaurants, and where union waiters are working. In this lunch room, hundreds of Jewish union workers, and other progressive workers, are eating. The Waiters Union appealed to all those who ate in Messinger's, at Roosevelt, near Kedxie, to inform the managers of that place, that they know that there are non-union waiters employed there. Those who come in there should give the boss to understand, that they will come to eat and drink when the place will be unionized. Otherwise they know of plenty of places where union waiters are employed, and for their money, they have a right to be served by a union waiter.</p>
