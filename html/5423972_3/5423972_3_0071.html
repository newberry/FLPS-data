   <p>The writer of this article met a group of tailors last Thursday afternoon at the headquarters of the Amalgamated, where they had come to protest to the manager of the Joint Board against their business agent, Charles Weinstein, who, they allege, has misrepresented their economic interests.</p>
   <p>The writer of this article was requested by this group to publish their protest and bitter disappointment in the Courier. He agreed to this, under the condition that the other side will later have a chance to answer the complaints.</p>
   <p>This is the essence of the protest:</p>
   <p>1. That the tailors who work in Shop No.1 of Ederheimer and Stimes, 1911 <span class="page-break">2</span>West Roosevelt Road, were indirectly pushed out of the shop thanks to the co-operation of the shop chairman, Harry Eidelman, the business agent, Charles Weinstein, and the shop foreman, who combined to take away from them certain work which legally belongs to Shop No. 1 and to transfer it to Shop No. 5.</p>
   <p>2. Neither the chairman nor the business agent had informed the workers that the company intended to make changes in its shops.</p>
   <p>3. The chairman and the business agent were always more in sympathy with the workers of Shop No. 5 than with those of Shop No. 1, although both shops belong to one local union.</p>
   <p>4. The business agent and the shop chairman were always indifferent to them <span class="page-break">3</span>and never took up their complaints against the foremen, about insults, ill-treatment, and so on.</p>
   <p>This group of tailors has in its possession facts to support each one of the aforementioned four points. These facts serve as a basis for their complaint and protest. In this group were also a few elderly, gray-bearded Jews, who, with tears in their eyes, told this writer how shamefully they had been treated and betrayed and how,finally, they had been locked out and delivered to king hunger. The tailors of Shop No. 1 of that company are now without any means of support. They were simply thrown out on the street.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the higher officials of the Amalgamated will give a satisfactory answer to the painful cry of these two hundred workers, of whom they ought to take care and whose interests they have to protect.</p>
