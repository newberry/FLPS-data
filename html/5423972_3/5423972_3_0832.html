   <p>The Amalgamated declared a strike at the Lawrence Stein Machine Co., yesterday, 815 W. Van Buren street, because the company discharged the machine adjusters who are members of the Amalgamated Clothing workers of America, Local 272. The sewing machine adjusters notified the firm that they demand a raise of $2.00 a week, and a forty-four working week.</p>
   <p>Last Friday, a representative of the union, had a conference with the bosses who promised to grant the demands. On Saturday, the bosses withdrew their promise and locked out the workers. Sam Levin, manager of the Joint Board, and E. Klein, representative of the machine adjusters, Local 272, tried to settle the strike in a satisfactory manner, but the firm acted stubborn, refusing to recognize the union and grant its demands. The union had no other way out than to call a strike against the company.</p>
   <p>The machine adjusters, who fix the new machines in the tailor shops, will have the full import of the Amalgamated in the battle against the firm, which will not grant the demands of the workers.</p>
