   <p>We hold no brief for Mr. Morris Hillquitt, the well-known lawyer and Socialist leader, because he is a Socialist, though a fine type of a Socialist, and we do not believe in Socialism. We hold no brief for Mr. Hillquitt, because of his ignoring the Jewish people. A man of his type could be of great help to the Jewish people, and he does not raise a finger to do it. As far as our knowledge goes, Mr. Hillquitt is not identified with any Jewish organization, with any Jewish activity, and we have therefore no reason to hold out Mr. Hillquitt as an ideal Jew, but we must give him credit for courage and audacity.</p>

   <p>The Jewish press in New York, as far as it is not strictly conservative, is just considering the Soviet Government as a sort of sanctuary, and no matter what the Soviet Government does, it is right and holy. The strangest thing about this is that none of Yiddish dailies in America is bolshevik or friendly to bolshevism as a system of economics and politics. There is more opposition to bolshevism among Yiddish newspapermen than among newspapermen of any other foreign press in America. We could not name five Jewish journalists in America who are deserving, of the term "bolshevik." The Jewish newspapermen are too smart and too clever to believe for a single moment that bolshevism constitutes the height of political and economic wisdom. But still, while the Yiddish newspapermen as individuals are not in favor of bolshevism, many of the Yiddish newspapers would not dare to utter a word of criticism against bolshevism or to censure any of the actions of the Soviet government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Why this holy respect for the Soviet government and its policies we do not know, but we know that the Yiddish newspapers in New York, as far as they are strictly conservative, ignore all the sins of commission of the Soviet government and never say a word about the sins of omission. When it comes to bolshevism and to judging the actions of the Soviet government, the Yiddish newspapers say "Do not touch me," and they are very anxious to make people believe that the Soviet government is beyond reproach. They consider criticism leveled against the Soviet government as an attack on human freedom, but at the same time, these newspapers, their staffs and their managements, are not bolsheviks; nay, they are anti-bolsheviks.</p>
   <p>Under such circumstances, we consider it very courageous on the part of Mr. Hillquitt to state publicly and definitely that the Soviet form of government is fundamentally bad, that the entire political fabric of bolshevism is wrong to the core, and does not deserve the support of American Socialists.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>This attitude taken by Mr. Hillquitt toward the Soviet government of Russia testifies to the fact that his mind is not influenced by the whim of a part of the Yiddish press, and that he is willing to swim against the current. Mr. Hillquitt's definite stand against Sovietism will be beneficial from many points of view. The liberal and radical Yiddish newspapers, though not bolshevik and not in sympathy with the bolshevik policies, have deemed it advisable not to criticize the Soviet government, probably because most of the critics of the Soviet government are reactionaries, capitalists, monarchists, and representatives of the white terror in and outside of Russia. These Yiddish newspapers, being probably ashamed of the company of the critics of the Russian Soviet government, prefer to ignore many oppressive measures of the bolsheviks rather than to criticize them. This in our mind is the underlying motive of the attitude of the above characterized Yiddish newspapers to the Soviet government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Now that a man like Mr. Hillquitt, a recognized Socialist leader and Socialist was courageous enough and bold enough to come out in open opposition to bolshevism, many of the Yiddish newspapers, may no longer be ashamed of criticizing the Soviet government whenever such criticism is necessary and fitting, and they will thus not arouse the suspicion that they and their leaders favor bolshevism or are in sympathy with the bolshevik proposition.</p>
   <p>In America, bolshevism is not popular, and it is not popular for a number of good reasons. Since the Yiddish press is not bolshevik either, because its representatives do not believe in bolshevism and are opposed to it, the attitude to the Soviet government is today such as to make the American people believe that we Jews, do favor bolshevism, and as long as they ignore the crimes of the Soviet government and suppress every criticism of the Soviet government policies, they actually sometimes create the impression <span class="page-break">6</span>of being in sympathy with bolshevism, and such an impression does not do us any good, especially since it is a false impression. We feel therefore that Mr. Hillquitt's courageous stand will help a great deal to change the present state of affairs, and will stimulate criticism of the Soviet government policies, and only then, when the liberal Jewish newspapers will be frank in their criticism about the Soviet government, will the masses of Yiddish readers know what the bolshevik political and economic fabric looks like, and it will learn to hate and to despise it.</p>
   <p>We appreciate the courage of Mr. Hillquitt, and we are grateful to him for what he said on the subject of bolshevism at the Detroit Socialist Convention. His remarkable statements on bolshevism throw a glaring light on his personality. He is a Socialist and a Marxist, but he is not a slave <span class="page-break">7</span>to the intellectual fashion of the day. He has come to distinguish between real freedom and fake freedom as practiced by the bolshevik government; between popular liberty and state despotism, as practiced by the bolshevik government. We hope that his attitude toward bolshevism will have a beneficial bearing on the radical and liberal minded Yiddish press in New York.</p>
