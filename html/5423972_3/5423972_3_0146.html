   <p>At the last meeting of the United Hebrew Trades important questions were discussed. The shochtim and butcher workers, who until now had only one union under one charter from the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of America, have parted and each have separate locals, and both belong to the meat cutters and butcher workers union and the United Hebrew Trades. Due to certain reasons growing out of the sentimental feeling of the butcher workers, that they be classified as high in rank as the shochtim, a request was brought up by the butcher workers to have a local of their own.</p>
   
   <p>A committee of the butcher workers brought this question up before the United Hebrew Trades, and a committee was formed to go to the Shochtim and Butcher Workers' Union, and point out to the butchers, that it is very necessary that peace and harmony should reign among them so that the butcher bosses may never have an opportunity to use one or the other, as a tool, which will be detrimental to the interests of either one, or both locals. At that meeting the sentiment prevailed that the butcher workers part was sanctioned by the shochtim.</p>
   <p>Last Monday afternoon at a well attended meeting of the shochtim they reorganized under a new charter name, issued by the Amalgamated meat cutters: The Shochtim of Chicago. They elected new officers for the year.</p>
   
   <p>A committee of the United Hebrew Trades, present at this meeting, related the necessity of the friendly relations that must be maintained between them and the butcher workers, in order to safeguard their own interests. In order to carry out this principle, the United Hebrew Trades suggested that the shochtim appoint a committee of five members, the butcher workers - a committee of five, and the United Hebrew Trades a committee of three, and these thirteen men shall act as a joint board to transact all important questions for both unions, and shall also partake in transacting and discussing with the butcher bosses regarding the new agreement and whatever grievances that may arise between them.</p>
   <p>The shochtim accepted that suggestion. Monday night the butcher workers held a meeting in Fitzgibbon's Hall. The First Vice President of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters Union, was chairman.</p>
   
   <p>A committee of the United Hebrew Trades presented the decision of the Shochtim Union which was accepted, and obligated themselves to work in harmony with them.</p>
   <p>They elected officers to complete the term, and there is no doubt that they will have a real lively organization that will do a good deal to keep up their present conditions, and also to better future conditions.</p>
   <p>The Waiters And The Jewish Restaurants.</p>
   <p>There are hundreds of waiters working in restaurants in the Jewish districts. Some of the waiters are members of the Waiters Association local 7, but the majority are not organized, and are naturally working under poor conditions, with small salaries and long hours.</p>
   
   <p>The Waiters' Union determined to organize the waiters working in Jewish restaurants. The appointed delegates of the Waiters Union, to the United Hebrew Trades, asked in the name of his union, that the Federation help them in the campaign to organize the Jewish waiters. No doubt the Federation will do all in its power to help in this important work, but it will be necessary, that all union men and progressive workers in general should help the Waiters Union and the Federation in this work, by urging the restaurant owners to employ union waiters, and those eating in the restaurants can be the best organizers. All they have to do, is ask the waiter, serving them if he has a union card of the Waiters Union, and if the waiter answers yes, then he shall show the union card. In this manner everyone who eats in a restaurant, will be helping the Waiters Union organize the trade.</p>
   
   <p>United Hebrew Trades elect delegates to the Chicago Federation of Labor Unemployment Conference.</p>
   <p>The questions of unemployment brought up some interesting discussions among the delegates of the United Hebrew Trades. Some were under the impression that all unemployed people must be helped whether they are union members or not, without exceptions.</p>
   <p>The majority of the delegates declared that the general conditions in the unions are not so good, and it would be impossible to raise enough money to help such a large army of unemployed, including both union workers and non-organized workers.</p>
   <p>It was determined that no activities will be started, to help the unemployed until there will be a demand from the unions that are affiliated with the United Hebrew Trades, to start such work.</p>
   
   <p>Until last meeting there was no such demand from any union. In the discussions it was.</p>
