   <p>The United Jewish Trades is a Jewish central body, but has within its 32 Unions, but 3 who discuss their business in the Yiddish tongue. Most of the membership is gentile and in the recently organized unions Jews form but 20% to 30% of the membership, there to the Federation headquarters comes the immigrant, the Pole, the Lithuanian, the Italian and the Jew whose psychology the United Trades, which in itself composed of immigrants, best understand. At the A.F. of L. headquarters the language and manner of conducting meetings are strange to the immigrant but at the trades office one speaks Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, or Yiddish and one understands one another.</p>
