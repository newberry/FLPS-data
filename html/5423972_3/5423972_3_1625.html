   <p>William H. Taft's inauguration, according to preparatory plans was to exceed those of all the former presidents, but nature would not permit them to make an exception for President Taft.</p>
   <p>Every right thinking person will ask himself the question: Why were they intending to make more fuss with Taft's inaugural than with any of the former presidents? The answer will be found in Taft's inaugural speech, which is considered a sort of program for the new administration. What did Taft say in his speech? He notified us he will follow the policies of Roosevelt, that means he will holler at the trusts, but that he will not do anything against them. He wants a strong army and navy to maintain peace. Nevertheless, he will follow all of Roosevelt's policies, but one. When Roosevelt posed as a radical, at least by his talk, the capitalists lost all their confidence in him. Therefore, Taft immediately assured the capitalist that he will not utter one word against him. He declared that injunctions are very important and that they must not be rejected, but the judges that issue those injunctions must deal with justice; with that the capitalist is assured that if at any time he will contact the court for an injunction against a union, strikers, etc., the judge will always find a law of justice to favor him.</p>
   <p>All of Taft's speech consisted of promises of what he was going to carry through for the interests of the capitalist class. Not a word did he mention of the working class, not a word mentioned of what the government was going to do for the thousands of unemployed, that are going around in the large cities, from factory to factory looking for work, not a word mentioned of the millions of children and women who are forced to go to work in factories to keep from starving to death, while their fathers and husbands cannot obtain employment. The only time he mentioned the worker was when he spoke of injunctions; were it not for the injunctions, he would have forgotten that there is a working class in America. When labor wants to use the power of the government for their own interests then they must elect, not those candidates selected by the capitalists, but those selected by the workers, with a program in the interests of the workers, that come out to the people and say that they stand for the interests of the entire nation.</p>
