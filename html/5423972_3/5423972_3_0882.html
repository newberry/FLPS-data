   <p>For a period of two years, the Dressmakers Union, local 100, attempted to organize the workers of Goldstein's Dress Shop, 1379 Milwaukee Ave. but the workers paid no attention to the organized dressmakers. Mr.Goldstein, the boss saw that his workers were satisfied with slavery and long hours, at short wages, and inhuman treatment, so he suppressed them more and more, until their patience gave out. The workers left the shop and turned to the union requesting aid and organizational course.</p>
   <p>The dressmakers were accompanied by the cutters and pressers. The joint board of the Cloakmakers Union with local 100, will do everything possible to win the Shop in favor of the Dressmakers Union and will not permit these bosses to suppress the workers.</p>
