   <p>If anyone has ever doubted the power of working class solidarity, the strike of the shoe repair workers will convince him that, armed with his weapon--solidarity--the worker is able to attain for himself better working conditions.</p>
   <p>The Independent Shoe Repairing Union was organized only a few months ago. All of the workers manifested unity and were united in all activities. When they went out on strike last Wednesday for better living conditions, it didn't take long--three days--before the employers yielded and signed an agreement with the union.</p>
   <p>Besides a two-dollar raise and a forty-hour week and other important concessions, the workers here also gained recognition of their union, which has been officially recognized by their employers. This is the most important gain that the workers can point to.</p>
   <p>The union of the shoe repair workers is a young organization. The successful strike has strengthened it and it remains now for the workers themselves to stand firmly by their union and make stronger their position.</p>
