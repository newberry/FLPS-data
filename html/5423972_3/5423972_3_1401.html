   <p>Henry Ford wants to be president of the United States.</p>
   <p>We do not blame him. Minor lights than Ford have a similar desire. It is a well known fact that there is not a priest who would not like to be Pope and there is not a politician who would not like to be President, and as Ford is in politics and is convinced that he is a wise man and a great statesman, and consequently thereof he wants to be president of the United States. He believes in his political genius and he believes that he is the right man for the job.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, like all voters who naturally have the final say in the matter, I disagree with Mr. Ford. He is an able manufacturer of cheap machines, an able business man, but an unable statesman.</p>
   
   <p>For the short time that Mr. Henry Ford is in national and international politics, he has succeeded in making a jackass of himself. He believed he could terminate the war by just getting the boys out of the trenches. He organized a peace ship that proved to be a boomerang to all burlesquers and comedians in this country and abroad. Upon his return from his peace mission abroad he started his campaign against the Jews, believing that all international evils can be remedied by oppressing the Jews, but since the Jews are not isolated atoms in this world and are connected with other peoples commercially, politically, and socially, he started a campaign against those who associated themselves with the Jews. To be sure Mr. Ford is not only against the Jews. He is against the liberals, against the radicals, against the socialists, and against disbelievers, against free thinkers, and against all those who disagree with him. He is against everybody who does not believe in his wisdom and he is only for those who are helping him either in his business or in his political enterprises.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ford believes he can rule the universe just because he can produce cheap cars. The late Theodore Roosevelt, who knew a thing or two about human nature, said that Mr. Ford is not a plain ass but a jackass, and this opinion of Ford is shared today by millions of Americans.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ford as a president would surely put over some stunts. First of all he would begin to disfranchise the Jews. Then he will begin to introduce an economic boycott not only against the Jews but against those who are connected with the Jews and Jewish business. Then he would start proceedings against those who protest against these actions, and before his first year of office will be over, the United States, the most orderly country in this world, will be the most chaotic country on the globe.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ford says history is bunk, probably because he does not know any history. How Mr. Ford is going to rule a country that must be governed by certain historical events, treaties, agreements, diplomatic associations, diplomatic treaties, etc., is beyond us. A man who does not give a rap for the past cannot possibly recognize treaties and agreements, cannot be guided by certain diplomatic and political treaties. He must start everything all over again.</p>
   
   <p>American intellectuals, American scholars, and American artists will not be edified by the thought that Mr. Ford is the president of the United States, for as far as Mr. Ford goes, scholarship, science, art, all those things are superfluous. All that is necessary in this world to be comfortable is to possess a Ford car.</p>
   <p>Fortunately the chances for Mr. Ford to attain the presidency of the United States are not so good. True, his seven thousand agents throughout the country have received instructions from his headquarters to boost him, and they will surely do a great deal of boosting. The Dearborn Independent will boost him too, but the electorate of the United States does not consist only of Ford agents and the staff of the Dearborn Independent, and we do not believe that either the democratic or republican party will be too eager to identify itself with Mr. Ford, because none of the parties are willing to lose nine-tenths of its voting strength.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ford may run as an Independent, but he surely won't be the only one to run as an Independent. As an Independent candidate he will get the Independent votes of all his agents and clerks; that is about all. We do not believe that Mr. Ford will draw a half of the votes that Mr. Debs commanded when he ran on the Socialist ticket, because the American voter is a serious-minded person and does not want to waste his vote on a joke, and Mr. Ford as president of the United States is a huge joke. In spite of the Ford for President boom, we need not be afraid that the Detroit gentleman will soon be president of the United States. [Editor's note: This article is in English originally.
