   <p>The Socialist party of America yesterday issued a call for an emergency convention to be held in Chicago on August 30.</p>
   <p>The convention will deal mainly with the problem of the "left-wing" which was recently expelled from the party, creating a definite split in the unity of the work of the American Socialists.</p>
   <p>The so-called "Leftists," now spread over the entire country, opened their convention in New York yesterday.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, as elsewhere, the "Leftists" were ousted from the Jewish Socialist Branches which are now being organized by the local City Central Committee. The "Leftists" today have their own "party" where they fight among themselves.</p>
