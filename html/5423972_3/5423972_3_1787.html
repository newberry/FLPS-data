   <p>The Jewish Public Votes.</p>
   <p>Today is election day in Chicago and the Jews of Chicago are very much enthused over their Jewish candidate, Mr. Hugo Pam for Superior Judge of Cook County. He receives a hearty welcome in Douglas Park Auditorium today. The office of the Courier is continually answering telephone calls from all parts of the city from individuals inquiring how to vote for Hugo Pam.</p>
   <p>There was a most enthusiastic meeting at the Douglas Park Auditorium last night. The meeting was somewhat in the form of a holiday. Every one seemed to be encouraged and confident that their Jewish candidate for Judge will be elected with a great majority. The crowd at the meeting spent their time in a most enjoyable Jewish manner, and dispersed at midnight fully resolved to cast their vote the next morning for Hugo Pam.</p>
