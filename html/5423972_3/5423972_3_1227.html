   <p>The Worker's Cooperative Society and the North Western Cooperative Society have decided at their meetings to merge in the management of each of their grocery stores and Comrade Chinoy, the manager of the North West Side Cooperative grocery has been appointed to the managership of the Douglas Park District store, 3300 W. 15th St.</p>
   <p>The reason for this act is to introduce greater efficiency in the purchase of supplies and greater economy in the expenses.</p>
   <p>Because the shareholders of the Cooperative Society live too far from the grocery store, it was found necessary to develop a neighborhood trade.</p>
