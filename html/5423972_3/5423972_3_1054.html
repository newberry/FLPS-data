   <p>The ladies tailors' asked The Chicago Federation of Labor for help in the strike at Marshall Fields, Carson Pirie Scott, and Blum's.</p>
   <p>The main stumbling block for the ladies tailors is the few large department stores, that are under the impression that by starving the strikers, they will be able to break the strike. The smaller bosses signed the union agreement.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Federation of Labor has agreed to appeal to all unions to help the ladies tailors.</p>
   <p>Credentials were issued to striking committeees who will visit all organizations, and appeal for help.</p>
   <p>The ladies tailors are continuing with the strike of the alteration workers, which has been in progress for over five weeks, and the bosses of the cloak stores on State Street and Michigan Avenue, also have in mind one remedy against the strikers, and that is to leave them strike until circumstances will force them to give up their battle.</p>

   <p>That's what makes it so important, for all the organizations in the needle industry to help the ladies tailors win the battle.</p>
