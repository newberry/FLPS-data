   <p>The Jewish butcher workers, belonging to the Butchers' Union, Local 596, have a very important problem to decide if they want their union not to suffer in the near future from the conditions that caused unemployment among its members.</p>
   <p>There are in Chicago about four hundred Kosher butcher-shops of which only about 60 or 70 employ outside help.</p>
   <p>Some employ one person; others two or more. Together they employ over a hundred people. Three hundred of these butchers are assisted by their wives and employ colored help to help pluck chickens, in this way eliminating additional butcher help.</p>
   <p>The small as well as the big butchers are employing colored help, this being the reason why so many butchers are unemployed.</p>
   
   <p>This is only one of the evils from which the Jewish butcher worker is suffering.</p>
   <p>With the coming of the depression, a new evil arrived which digs under the foundation of the Jewish Butchers Union.</p>
   <p>In bad times, those who lose their jobs seek for new ways to make a living. These people, who saved up money from the days of plenty, look for business enterprises in order to be able to exist and to make profits on their savings.</p>
   <p>Many Jews of Chicago, who had a few hundred dollars, people who never before were butchers, opened up butcher shops, taking in as partners unemployed butcher workers who were members of the union.</p>
   <p>This condition alone weakened the Butcher Workers' Union.</p>
   
   <p>In this way the new butcher bosses not only take away a certain number of workers from the union and make them their partners, but at the same time they make them non-union men. This condition alone weakened the Butcher Workers Union.</p>
   <p>The danger involved in opening new butcher shops and becoming business men is extremely great because the new butcher bosses are not as yet sure of their existence.</p>
   <p>Many of them find out in a short time that they cannot exist and that they must quit business and look for employment again.</p>
   <p>The question is, why are people opening butcher shops at a time when business is at its worst, thus taking away the little business there is from the butcher bosses who employ union help?</p>
   <p>The result of this is that some butchers are forced to dispense with their help.</p>
   
   <p>This condition not only becomes worse for the unemployed, but for the butchers as well. The amount of the unemployed is increasing daily; the Butcher Workers' Union, local 596, has already thirty unemployed members for whom the union must work very hard to secure some employment.</p>
   <p>The union does everything in its power to give its unemployed members one or two days' work a week. This task is accomplished with the devoted cooperation of members who have steady employment and share their jobs with those who have none.</p>
   <p>This, however, cannot remedy the situation entirely, due to the fact that the amount of the unemployed is growing very rapidly, and due to certain modifications in the trade.</p>
   <p>Many butchers have decided to consolidate their poultry departments in one store in order to save rent.</p>
   
   <p>The poultry butcher is able to attend to his business himself, and that is why so many butcher workers are eliminated from the trade entirely.</p>
   <p>Besides these evils, from which the butcher worker is suffering, he is mostly influenced by the dreadful conditions now prevailing.</p>
   <p>On account of the depression meat sales decrease. All these effects have a vital influence upon the Butcher Workers' Union.</p>
   <p>The leaders and officers of the union are trying very hard to improve conditions for its members.</p>
   <p>The question arises here, what can the Butcher Workers' Union do in order to find work for the workers who are unemployed?</p>
   
   <p>The answer is that the business agent of local 596 has proposed a plan, at the last meeting, that deserves close attention.</p>
   <p>According to present conditions in the butchers' trade, there are on the North West Side about 80 butcher shops which are not employing any union help. In the whole area, only two members of the union are employed. In most of these shops the proprietor and his wife do all the work with the help of colored people to pluck the poultry.</p>
   <p>This situation justifies the union to organize cooperative butcher shops, controlled by the union and its members, on the North West Side.</p>
   <p>People interested in the welfare of the union say that the latter has a right to exercise its power to establish cooperative butcher shops in that district, where there are about 80 small butcher shops in existence, that make it impossible for the workers to secure employment in their trade.</p>
   <p>Some people, reading about this plan in the paper, will come to the union with arguments and say that the 80 small butchers not employing union help have a right to be in business, and that the union has no right to take away their bread.</p>
   <p>The same argument holds true for the other side: the butcher workers who are sauntering around without work and whose bread is being snatched away by the small butcher bosses and their wives.</p>
   <p>The butcher union cannot therefore, stop and listen to the arguments of those who believe that an individual has a right to be in business; instead it should listen to what it should do in order to secure work for those who are unable to find it.</p>
   
   <p>The only question for the butchers union to consider is that of bringing about a suitable situation that will make it possible for it to employ a number of its members.</p>
   <p>If all the small butchers would have considered the condition of the unemployed butcher workers and established a system whereby each and every one of them would have employed for at least one day in the week, one member of the union, giving him an opportunity to work during a certain part of the week, conditions would not have been so grave.</p>
   <p>However, they are not doing it. Instead of taking in union help, they employ colored help. There remains only one thing for the union to do. It has to take the initiative and organize a cooperative in which all members of local 596 and other unions should become shareholders, together they should open on the North West Side two or three cooperative butcher shops where the unemployed members could work. Only on that basis will the union be able to strengthen its position among its members.</p>
