   <p>Over twenty-five hundred people filled the Ashland Auditorium last night and enthusiastically greeted the writer, M. Olgin and the labor leader, A. Epstein, who, in the name of the Socialist Federation, have opened a campaign in Chicago for the new daily workers' newspaper, Die Welt (The World).</p>
   <p>The speakers told the audience that the pseudo socialism in America has forsaken the revolutionary ideals of the workers of the old country and that only a new, sincere, revolutionary workers' newspaper can win the Jewish workers in this country for the class struggle toward socialism.</p>
   <p>In response to an appeal made by the chairman during the intermission, there was collected the sum of twenty-two hundred and fifty-eight dollars (including twelve hundred dollars in cash), in subscriptions for the stocks and bonds of the new newspaper. Besides this amount, some Workmen's Circle branches collected <span class="page-break">2</span>an additional nine hundred dollars, which they will turn over to the Socialist Federation. The enthusiastic meeting came to a close with the strains of workers' songs.</p>
   <p>The Federation is arranging a banquet in honor of Mr. Olgin for this evening in the Labor Lyceum.</p>
