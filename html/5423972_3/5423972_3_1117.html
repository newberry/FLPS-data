   <p>In many countries a movement is now launched to abolish strikes, which very often paralyze the industrial life of a country. One of the means to crush the strikes is the arbitration court. The workers, however, are of the opinion that they cannot settle their disputes through these courts and, when seeking to alleviate their plight, apply the old tested remedy, the strike.</p>
   <p>Such was the case in Australia a couple of decades ago. When the labor movement was still weak, the workers cherished the arbitration courts, considering them the best panacea for their troubles. But in the course of the last two decades, the labor movement has developed to such a degree that the workers feel strong enough to win their own battles for better conditions without the aid of any arbitration courts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The workers have attained, with the aid of arbitration, an eight-hour working-day, four hours on Saturday, a minimum wage with an increase of two dollars per day, and many other concessions. But when one begins to eat the appetite increases. The Australian workers are now demanding a six-hour working-day, to which the arbitration courts have not concurred. The workers' organizations, the trades-unions, have therefore turned to their old means, the strike, and though they have lost, they still do not nurture the idea of recognizing the arbitration courts.</p>
   <p>The workers have lost the strike for a six-hour working day because the dock workers strike hindered the transportation of agricultural commodities and the farmers have thereby suffered heavy losses. For this reason the farmers have organized themselves into a labor union, capturing the position of the striking dock workers. The arbitration courts have recognized this union and due to this the strike of the regular workers was lost.</p>
   <p>The farmers are, however, only accidental workers and will not always interfere <span class="page-break">\3</span>with labor. It is to be expected then that the Australian workers will eventually attain the six-hour working day. At any rate, the strike is once again manifested as the sole and best labor weapon in the struggle for labor interests, which can not be substituted by arbitration or any other such means.</p>
