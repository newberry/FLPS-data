   <p>In a time when some Jews argue about this or that one as a qualified leader in the community, other Jews, shivering from cold, wait in the public hunger line, at the employment bureau, and in the bread lines.</p>
   <p>There is nothing new in unemployment to excite Jewish civic workers or to find them unprepared. The Lechem Leravim (food kitchen) was not established merely for the "all year-round" poor; and the Hachnosses Urcheem (Strangers home) may keep open doors even for those who are no longer itinerants.</p>
   <p>Jewish civic workers, even those not connected with charity, at sight of our present bread line, should get their radical plans of curtailing future economic woes, since this cannot still the hunger of today or warm the present cold.</p>
   <p>Cold and hunger are non-partisan, non-confessional, and cosmopolitan. They have no regard for one's standards or position in life. To overcome these, we must employ a universal method whose usage to date has not been possible.</p>

   <p>It is also impossible to do away entirely with unemployment in today's economic setup.</p>
   <p>Chicago Jews cannot provide for the entire world; they cannot even solve the problem of unemployment among Jews, even that of their own community, but what they can do is to enlighten and mitigate the sufferings of the workless by aiding them as much as they can.</p>
