   <p>Bakers Want Peace, but Prepared for War</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Bakers Union a compromise committee of twelve was elected. They will be stationed in the office of the United Hebrew Trades, 1145 Blue Island Avenue where the agreements will be made. Those companies which will not sign a contract before April 26 will find themselves in the midst of a strike.</p>
   <p>The Bakers Union Local 237, are sure that a strike will be avoided, because it would be extravagant for the bosses to start any disputes. It is needless to say that the bakers want peace, but at the same time, they are prepared for war. If a strike should come, the compromise committee would immediately be transformed into a strike committee to carry on the strike.</p>
