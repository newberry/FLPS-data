   <p>The Workmen's Circle Prosperity Banquet, which took place Sunday, brought in the sum of $1,200 for the needy members of the Workmen's Circle.</p>
   <p>There were more than six hundred members, representatives of branches and women's clubs, who performed their duty in a truly brotherly fashion.</p>
   <p>The banquet, arranged by the relief conference, was opened by Mr. Witt, chairman of the 15th committee, who with a few appropriate words presented the toastmaster of the evening, Mr. Belman, the committee's secretary.</p>
   <p>In a short speech, Mr. Belman explained that this banquet is the result of the terrible crisis, and that the Workmen's Circle has always been and is the Red Cross of the workmen's movement.</p>

   <p>After conducting part of the program, the toastmaster presented Mr. Silverstein, a member of the committee, to make the appeal.</p>
   <p>Mr. Silverstein briefly outlined the present situation in which the committee finds itself. He painted vividly the committee's inability to do the utmost for its members, due to lack of funds. The answer to the appeal was a truly loyal one. The branches and the women's clubs were generous with their contributions. In addition, $1,200 was collected at the banquet.</p>
   <p>No speeches were made, except for the one by Mr. Bestok, chairman of the district committee.</p>

   <p>The program opened with the playing of the "International" on the piano by Eda Belman.</p>
   <p>The Women's City Central Committee was in charge of the very delicious meal, which was served to the gathering.</p>
   <p>A storm of applause greeted the chairman's expression of thanks to the Forward for the publicity given the banquet.</p>
   <p>A list of the contributions will appear at a later date.</p>
