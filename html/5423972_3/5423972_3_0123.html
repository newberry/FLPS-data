   <p>The Unions. The Workmen's Circle. The Party-Movement.</p>
   <p>The superficial observers of events and movements, upon considering the Jewish Trade Unions as we found them today, remark with contempt that there is nothing to be satisfied with: The movement is weak, lacking revolutionary spirit, and the entire twenty-five years of agitation, work, effort and energy which was embodied in it, the millions of pages of the "Forward" which were written within the last quarter of a Century, have accomplished very little.</p>
   <p>As one who has passed through this period of long years, who stood by the organized and unorganized Division of Workers in Chicago, I have seen the various changes which occurred in the past 25 years; despite the present unfavorable conditions which the Workers are living through.</p>
   <p>Twenty-five years ago, we did not have in Chicago an organized Jewish Labor-Movement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The only group that was affiliated with a weak and small Union, was the Cloakmakers. They upheld the Union throughout the busy season, and after the season the Union existed only in name and with a few active workers; radicals, who followed the shadow of an organization in order to begin Union activities at the next busy season.</p>
   <p>At that time, the cigarmakers who worked under the greatest degree of exploitation and servitude, were contemplating organizing a Union. And the conditions under which they worked have driven them to organize a Union.</p>
   <p>As far back as my memory travels, I can remember the five-cent Unions; that is, we determined to pay 5-cents weekly-dues, and the meetings were held in a basement, on the corner of Jefferson and O'Bryan Streets, beneath a restaurant. Comrades Leon Hannock, Sam Golden, and this writer were active in the Union. But this (cigar) Union did not exist very long, due to the strikes that were lost. Then the International Cigarmakers began organizing various departments in the trade.</p>
   <p>Two years later there were a few small Jewish Unions, and then the United Hebrew-Trades was established, which endorsed the organized movement. When the <span class="page-break">3</span>Unions ceased to function and act properly, the United Hebrew Trades ceased existing.</p>
   <p>Thus, several years passed and we saw a steadily developing Labor-Movement, for approximately 15 years.</p>
   <p>The Cloakmakers were the first who tried to uphold a Union, and always cooperated with the Jewish Unions of that time.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Labor-Movement revived with the approach of many "Bundists", workers who entered with Socialist ideas. Then the formation of Unions and the Workmen's Circle took place. The Jewish Socialist Division grew rapidly and, altogether, have done splendid work in propagating the principle that the class struggle combines the various parts of the entire Social Order.</p>
   <p>A new period was initiated with the Tailor strike. The great historical Tailor strike of 1910--1911 marked a new period in the life and development of the organized Jewish Labor-Movement.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Tailors were the founders and organizers, and the leaders of the Jewish and non-Jewish Clothing Workers Union.</p>
   <p>The first announcement of the disgraceful exploitation of Clothing Workers came from seventeen young Jewish boys and girls, who raised the banner of revolt against Hart, Schaffner and Marx.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The "Jewish Labor World", the weekly Socialist periodical, which existed then for three years, undertook to support the Tailors then in their struggle against the unbearable conditions.</p>
   <p>A conference was called by all Jewish Unions, of the Workmen's Circle branches and the Socialist Party organizations, which stated a representation of nearly 100 organizations was present.</p>
   <p>We were convinced at this Conference that the Jewish Labor-Movement lives, acts and does good work.</p>
   <p>The New York Forward pledged to support the Tailors in their struggle, and Benjamin Schlessinger, Manager of the Forward at that time, came to Chicago and published a special daily for some time. The New York Forward collected money and sent One Thousand Dollars to the Strike Committee, for the purpose of carrying on the strike.</p>
   <p>The "Jewish Labor World" collected approximately Twenty-Thousand Dollars.</p>
   <p>The result of that historical strike was that it laid the foundation for a Union, for the Clothing Workers of Chicago, and the entire land. This is proved to be a fact by the recent history of the Clothing Industry, and the present amalgamated Clothing Workers Union is the legal offspring of that historical strike, <span class="page-break">5</span>which was caused by the Jewish Workers who desired better living-conditions, and by the solidarity and loyal support that the Jewish Worker rendered to that struggle, which resulted in organizing the first great clothing fortification, - Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx.</p>
   <p>How the Workers Used to Live and Work and How They Live and Work Today:</p>
   <p>Prior to the existence of any Union, the employees used to work long hours, for small wages, and under horrible unsanitary and servile conditions. The Jewish baker, tailor, cloakmaker, carpenter, and painter - every Worker who did not belong to a Union, was an absolute slave.</p>
   <p>More afflicted than all were the Cloakmakers' and Men's Tailors.</p>
   <p>But now, regardless of how dissatisfied we may be, we all agree that the organizing Jewish Workers in Unions have elevated them to a material degree so that the unorganized Jewish Worker envies the organized.</p>
   <p>The condition of the organized Jewish Worker is now a bit worse, however, because of the economic crises, but it is one-hundred per cent better in comparison with the conditions which prevailed when they were unorganized.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The pioneers of this great transition were the Jewish tailors, cloakmakers, bakers, carpenters, cigar-makers, and ladies' tailors. These Workers have for many years struggled and finally succeeded in organizing the trades and inaugurating permanent, agreed conditions which they are, at any time, prepared to defend, in case the slightest attempt is made to undermine these conditions.</p>
   <p>The tailors were the first to introduce a 44-hour week. The cloakmakers were the first to introduce weekly-work, instead of piece-work.</p>
   <p>During the World-War (and the prosperity-period) the Jewish Workers reinforced their Unions, increased their salaries, shortened the working-hours, and, in general, won the respect of the employers.</p>
   <p>The post prosperity period brought new problems for the Unions. The organized capitalists began demanding that the Workers should return to former conditions. The capitalists started campaigning against the Workers' rights and privileges, and the Unions which were organized on a solid-basis, have done everything possible in not permitting the destruction of the foundation of their organization.</p>
   <p>And we see that the older Jewish Union, as the cloakmakers, bakers, carpenters, tailors, and painters, could not be conquered! When industrial conditions will improve, these Trade Unions will renew the fight for better conditions for the Workers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>In the life and struggles of the Jewish Workers in Chicago, the Jewish socialists played an active part.</p>
   <p>In 1908, July 1, the "Jewish Labor World", was organized. The Unions and the Socialist organizations cooperated in publishing the weekly papers. And the "Jewish Labor World" fulfilled its task in the best manner.</p>
   <p>In 1910 the daily "World" was published and the Jewish organized labor, in all its divisions, united about the paper and carried its burdens for a year and nine months.</p>
   <p>In 1919, January 1, the "Jewish Daily Forward" appeared.</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle was organized in September 1903. At that time we had a Socialist Club, under the name of "Lassalle Club". This Club carried on the work, <span class="page-break">8</span>in the Jewish District, for the Socialist Party. This Club accepted non-members of the Socialist Party, although they had to agree with Socialist principles.</p>
   <p>Part of the members of the "Lasalle Club, the Comrades Benenson, M. Ziskind, Hannock, Sam Golden, Alpert and Gillman, were the first founders of Branch 321, the first Branch to join the New York branches.</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle branches were organized from the LaSalle Club. Branch 32 was organized in this manner, with a Socialist platform and with Socialist principles and only members who were obligated to work and vote for the Socialist Party, were accepted.</p>
   <p>When the Jewish Socialists decided that Chicago Workers are in need of a weekly journal to promote its idealogy and support the Socialist Party, the Workmen's Circle rendered its fullest cooperation and the most material support.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>They also supported and took an active part in the daily Labor paper, "The Forward".</p>
   <p>The first institution that the Workmen's Circle founded was its own cemetery.</p>
   <p>The second institution for which the members strived and finally attained, was their own Home - a Labor-Lyceum; a building which is accredited directly to the Workmen's Circle - a building that is to serve as a cultural and social center of the radical Jews.</p>
   <p>The third institution, already in existence for four years, is the educational department, or the educational committee, which is in charge of the W.C. Socialist Children's School.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Socialist Movement:</p>
   <p>The Jewish Socialist Movement of Chicago developed parallel with the general Socialist movement.</p>
   <p>When the Socialist Labor-Party existed, the Jewish Socialists helped the S.L.P. in its work.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Socialists were active in agitating and publishing many radical papers.</p>
   <p>In good times, when the Jewish Socialist branches were united and were striving to accomplish things, the Comrades of the Northwest Side organized a Socialist <span class="page-break">10</span>Home for the movement.</p>
   <p>At this time many arguments occurred over the emergence of the Left-Wing Socialist Party, which sought to split the membership.</p>
