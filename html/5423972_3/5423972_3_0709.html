   <p>It is a pleasure to write of union activities of the past half year. A story that cannot be equaled, of victories, and activities of organizations, that have brought wonderful results.</p>
   <p>The Federation and its union have partaken in the activities for the workers in general, not only for the Jewish worker.</p>
   <p>The Federation, besides being an economical central body, is also a social institution, and has built up an influence, which we exerted wherever necessary, so that the workers organization began to have faith in our influence.</p>
   <p>The bakers local 287, whose new yearly agreement is to take effect May 1st, 1919, recently demanded a $5.00 raise in pay, and after a few weeks of conferences with the bosses, prior to May 1st, resulted in a victory. Now the bakers are demanding something new, not more money, nor shorter hours, but something <span class="page-break">\2</span>that will permit them to live like all men. They ask that the night work be abolished, and that they work days instead. If they succeed, they will have instituted the greatest reform for their union since its inception.</p>
   <p>The Butcher and Schochtim (slaughter) workers.</p>
   <p>The Butcher and Schochtim Union, although still young, is livlier than our older organizations. Their agreement expired in October. Their new demands are for 10 hours less work per week, and a $3.00 weekly raise, and thanks to their energetic solidarity, they won nearly everything.</p>
   <p>They gave the bosses to understand that the butchers and scochtim did not organize just to pretend, although the schochtim, as is thought by the Jews, are to live with the spirit, but they came to the realization that materialism is also a necessity, and now their local is the most outstanding of the Federation.</p>
   <p>Retail and grocery clerks who have been separated for a few months, are now together again. Their agreement expired at the beginning of September.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Their new demands are for 10 hours less work and a $5.00 raise in pay per week. They succeeded in getting a 6 hour reduction and a $3.00 raise a week.</p>
   <p>The horse hair dress workers, a small organization never heard of, came to the Jewish Federation, a short time ago, and claimed that it was about time that they demand a raise in pay. There being a shortage of help in that trade, concerted action on the part of the horse hair dressers union resulted in a 12 per cent raise in pay.</p>
   <p>Three months later, the same organization was a victor for another 18 per cent raise in pay. This organization with its booming trade and shortage of workers stands as high with the Federation, and is always ready to give aid and assistance to any call for a worker.</p>
   <p>The Mattress Makers Union which is well known as a good fighter has had its downfalls which have frequently resulted in disbanding. - Now however, it is so strongly organized that there is no power that can disturb it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The mattress makers of Chicago have made progress within the last six months, both in membership, and in receiving a raise pay.</p>
   <p>The Shoe Repairers Union also has nothing to complain about. The failure to better conditions is attributed to those in the trade who were not union men, until they came to the realization that their suffering must come to an end. They organized and in the last 6 months, they reached the point where they will renew their agreement. True, they did not succeed in shortening their hours, but they did win a raise in pay. They are now preparing new demands, and are in the hopes that this victory will put them in line with all other trades.</p>
   <p>The Progressive Cigar Makers Union is the livliest in our Federation. It is a fighting organization. We will write about them some other time.</p>
   <p>We have in the last 6 months succeeded in organizing the following trades: auto cushion workers, American felt workers, picture frame workers, Jewish stock yard workers and Hebrew teachers, and it is our joy to see that these unions exist and grow. They are all affiliated with our Federation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Many trades are calling on the Federation. They want to be organized. The Federation has become an important bureau for trades not yet organized.</p>
   <p>The large organizations, such as the Cloak Makers, The Amalgamated, the Furriers, the Raincoat Makers and Cap Makers are carrying on their own battles. Their activities are now on so great a scale that we read about them in the newspapers nearly every day.</p>
   <p>The Federation feels that it has done a great deal of good work for the trades, in the last 6 months, and hopes that soon, we will take up problems of more importance, not only for more pay - but also for a better socialistic life.</p>
