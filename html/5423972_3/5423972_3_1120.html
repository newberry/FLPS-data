   <p>The Cloak Makers Union, Local 144, called two strikes, at Max Cohen, and at Harry Bornstein. Both shops are located at 1242 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>The reason for the strike is the slack in the cloak trade. Every year at this time there is no work. Nevertheless, union workers would make up samples, dividing among themselves the little work on hand. This year the two above mentioned manufacturers discharged all their union men. The question is, who is now making the samples and getting whatever little work there is? That is what the union wishes to know.</p>
   <p>The Cloak Makers Union had trouble with these people five years ago, when they were in a partnership. The union is demanding nothing other but that union men be employed to do the work on hand.</p>
   <p>"We had no intentions of calling a strike at this time of the year," said Mr. Holzman, business agent for local 144.</p>
