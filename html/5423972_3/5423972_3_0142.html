   <p>There are several hundred Jewish waiters working in restaurants in the Jewish districts, of whom some are organized into the Waiters Association, Local No. 7. Many of them, however, are not organized and naturally, have to work under poor conditions, low wages, and long hours. The Waiters' Union has decided to start a campaign to organize the waiters in the Jewish restaurants.</p>
   <p>The delegates of this union have appealed to the Federation for support in this campaign. No doubt the United Jewish Federation will assist them in this important work, but it is necessary that the union members and all progressive workers do their part. The Federation will be instrumental in influencing restaurant owners to employ union men, and it is hoped that the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>patrons of the restaurants will help by asking the man who waits on them, if he has a card of the Waiter's Union. To remind the waiters of their union status will be in itself an excellent form of organizing. If the people are not interested in whether the waiter is a union or non-union man, the Waiter's union, together with the Federation, will never be able to accomplish anything.</p>
   <p>The waiters who are not unionized should be shown how important it is to their interest to do so.</p>
