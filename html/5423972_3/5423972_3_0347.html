   <p>Great joy now prevails in the ranks of the Chicago garment workers because of the new contract which the Amalgamated has closed with Hart, Schaffner and Marx.</p>
   <p>The conference between both parties lasted about three weeks, and a new three-year contract was signed yesterday. Under this new agreement the workers will gain better [working] conditions than before.</p>
   <p>The main clauses of the new contract are: (1) 49 hour workweek instead of 52 as existed previously; (2) A ten per cent increase in wages which will amount to the grand sum of one-half million dollars a year. (3) A minimum wage for apprentices. This is a great victory for the workers because from now on the general living standard will rise.</p>
   <p>A few well-attended meetings were held Friday at Hart, Schaffner and Marx where the International President, Sidney Hillman, and other speakers discussed the new agreement which the workers accepted enthusiastically.</p>

   <p>Principally, it was pointed out that from 1911, when the first contract was signed, until now, much has been gained by the workers, and this itself promises that in the future also, conditions will be improved, because Hart, Schaffner and Marx was the first firm in the garment industry to recognize the idea of collective bargaining.</p>
