   <p>As you already know, at next Tuesday's election there are two candidates for Alderman of our ward. One is Emanuel M. Abrahams, a Jew, the other is a non-Jew.</p>
   <p>On every Jew, lies the duty of electing a Jew, especially since that Jew is Emanuel M. Abrahams, who is well known among us, and stands always ready and willing to do us a good turn.</p>
   <p>Aside from that, the time has come for us Jews to have a political voice in our local government. Our Jewish community has now reached a size which warrants representation, and, since previous non-Jewish Aldermen, we feel, have not adequately presented our problems to the city as a whole through its representative body, the City Council, we think the time has come for us to elect a Jewish Alderman.</p>

   <p>With the election of Mr. Abrahams, we will receive the political recognition justly due us at this time. Mr. Abrahams is a man of character and energy and will surely accomplish the things expected of him. Therefore, we should convince our friends that Mr. Abrahams should be elected with the greatest majority we can possibly give him. We are convinced that he is the finest man we could possibly vote for at this time.</p>
