   <p>The Growth of the American Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>The growth of the American Federation of Labor in the past few years has been exceedingly great. This we have gleamed from the report of General Secretary Morrison, at the last meeting of the A. F. of L.</p>
   <p>In the period of October 1, 1909 to June 1, 1910, 223 charters were issued to new trade unions. The same period of the preceding year showed issuance of only 112 new charters. Jewish unions were among the many to whom charters were issued.</p>

   <p>Products with a Union Label.</p>
   <p>If you desire to help the Jewish worker in particular and the American worker in general, insist on the union label on everything you purchase. By doing this you will not only help the working class, but you will also assure yourselves of good, clean, wholesome products, products which are not produced by child labor, long hours or sweat shops. The union label is the best manner in which the working class can be helped.</p>
   <p>The United Garment Workers appoint an Organizer for the Chicago Area. As we have already stated in this column, the United Garment Workers have made some very fine organizational strides in Chicago and a number of new locals have been organized.</p>
   <p>May we congratulate the United Garment Workers in their decision to send a permanent organizer to Chicago to organize the garment trades. A Mr. <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Lesser has been chosen. Naturally he is capable, but he cannot accomplish everything himself. He will need the help of the other Jewish workers to insure success.</p>
