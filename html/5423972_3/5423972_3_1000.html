   <p>The overall workers now in the seventh week of their strike for the recognition of their union, the Amalgamated, complain that the bosses are sending reports to the government accusing them of Bolshevism.</p>
   <p>Joe God, 1067 West Fourteenth Street and Dave Jeffry, 3641 Grenshaw Avenue were freed yesterday by federal officials, each on a $1,000 bond, after being held for several days under suspicion of conspiracy against the government.</p>
   <p>As Mr. Gold says, certain bosses are plotting this action in their desire to break the strike.</p>
