   <p>Before the war, everybody knew what socialism was and who the socialists were; now nobody knows. Before the war, there was a united Socialist party in Germany, although there were several factions within that party. One faction, led by Edward Bernstein, represented the mild, revisionist [form of] socialism; another faction, with Bebel and Singer at the head, represented orthodox Marxism, and another faction, under the leadership of Dr. Friedberg, represented a more revolutionary [type of] socialism, known under the name of "Anarchosocialism"; all three factions, however, followed one policy in Parliament and they all voted according to the resolution of the party.</p>
   <p>A similar condition prevailed in France. The united Socialists of France also had their theoretical differences, their "cliques" and factions, but before the world, they appeared as a united power. Not only in Germany and France, but also in all other civilized countries where a Social Democratic party existed, <span class="page-break">2</span>the party was active and united, and all the attempts of the anti-Socialist forces to break the unity of social democracy were of no avail. In France and in Germany, philanthropically inclined capitalists attempted to organize scab unions, or Christian unions, but the organized proletariat was not deceived by the philanthropic capitalists and remained loyal to the Social Democratic party.</p>
   <p>Today, two years after the World War, social democracy no longer exists. There is no united socialism, but there are Socialist cliques, factions, and parties which fight each other as bitterly as the Social Democrats formerly fought against the bourgeoisie. Before the war, Kautsky was the idol of the Socialists throughout the world. Today he is a traitor. Before the war, Longuet, grandson of Karl Marx, was the ideal of a Social-Democratic leader. Today he is too right for the left Socialists, and too left for the right. The generally recognized Socialist leader, as a type, has completely disappeared.</p>
   <p>Today there are three Socialist parties in Germany: the Majority Socialists, <span class="page-break">3</span>the Independent Socialists, and the avowed Communists. The same is true of France, Italy, Austria, England, and the United States. Even in Bolshevik Russia, there are not only anti-Bolshevik Socialist forces, but even within the Communist party itself, there are various factions and schisms--there are the extreme right Bolsheviks, who are prepared to make concessions to the Mensheviks, and even make concessions to capitalism, and the extreme left, who wish to establish Communism throughout the world. The policy of Chicherin and Krassin hasn't the least resemblance to the policy of Bucharin. The first are moderate, even rightists, who are prepared to make peace with the world, whereas Bucharin claims that Communism cannot be localized, and the world must be either entirely Communist or entirely Capitalist.</p>
   <p>It is superfluous to mention that even the right Bolsheviks look with contempt upon a man like Scheidemann or Kautsky. On the other hand, the right Socialists consider their leftist comrades as destructive elements. The sharpest criticism of Bolshevism was made by the Social Democrats, not by the general public.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In short, social democracy no longer exists. Three different groups are wrangling over the inheritance of Karl Marx, and when it belongs to all three, it belongs to none. A wave of radicalism was created by the war, but the radicalism produced by the war, i.e., the radicalism born in chaos, is in itself a chaotic force, and, therefore, cannot be productive.</p>
   <p>The reactionaries throughout the world claimed at first that the mistakes made by society produced socialism. This is only partly true. At any rate, the truth is that finance capital is today alive because of the mistakes made by [the representatives of] modern socialism. As long as the Socialist forces of the world are internally divided, and as long as the three types of socialism fight among themselves for recognition, so long can the representatives of finance capital sleep peacefully.</p>
   <p>Radicalism without unity, without organization and discipline, is no power whatever. Even if the number of radicals in the world were five times as large as it is today, the radicals would still be powerless as long as there is no unity <span class="page-break">5</span>in their leadership, and no united and active organization.</p>
   <p>It is not to be presumed, however, that unity will soon be attained even though unity is imperative before radical activity can become effective and productive. The political dogmas and principles of Socialist faith cannot be realized mechanically because each person has his own common sense and his own temperament, and each person wishes to act in accordance with his own judgment. A political party can have unity and can work harmoniously so long as it is not tempted to realize its program. It is easy to agree on theoretical points, but when it comes to the execution of the program, it is not so easy to agree, and arguments and conflicts arise.</p>
   <p>The ruination of socialism came when it tried to carry out its program...because every Socialist has his own common sense, and tries to apply it to the problem of building a Socialist state.</p>
