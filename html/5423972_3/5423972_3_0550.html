   <p>The fifth biennial convention of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union came to a close yesterday in an atmosphere of perfect order, and at a high point of enthusiasm. The convention considered problems of the greatest importance not only to the one hundred and seventy-five thousand Union members, but also to all of organized labor.</p>
   <p>Sidney Hillman and Joseph Schlossberg, international president and general secretary of the Amalgamated, who have been heading this organization since its inception, in 1914, were unanimously renominated for their posts.</p>
   <p>A stormy ovation, that exceeded in intensity all earlier ovations, was given to both labor leaders at the time of their nomination. All the delegates arose from their seats and gave a thunderous, ten-minute ovation to each one <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of their beloved leaders.</p>
   <p>The stormy applause which Mr. Schlossberg received was considered to be also a strong protest against the Forward, which has conducted a "boycott of silence" against this intellectual labor leader.</p>
   <p>The delegates, at the close of the convention, showered their leaders with flowers, while some of the delegates, carried their leaders upon their shoulders.</p>
   <p>The same enthusiasm and ectasy which reigned at the opening session and which prevailed throughout all the sessions, also reigned at the closing session. This Convention will go down in the history of the Amalgamated as the most inspiring national gathering of the organization's history, where unity and harmony prevailed, and where a great deal of constructive work was accomplished.</p>
   <p>The most important part of yesterday's closing session of the convention was <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the instructive report of Mr. Schlossberg on his trip to Europe, where he went as a representative of the Amalgamated to the International Tailors' Congress in Copenhagen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schlossberg told about the needle trades industry of Europe where factories and machines like those in America do not exist, and where a great many workers still work at home under horrible working conditions.</p>
   <p>"The eight-hour day and the forty-eight hour week are not maintained there," said Mr. Schlossberg, "through both provisions were adopted officially. The International Tailors' Congress, for that reason adopted a resolution to do away with home labor." Mr. Schlossberg spoke about Soviet Russia, which was practically ignored at that Congress. He expressed the hope that this prejudice would die out in the near future and that true brotherly harmony and understanding would reign among the workers of the world.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schlossberg then spoke about his visit to Estonia, Austria, and Italy.</p>

   <p>The great fight of the Italian workers was then taking place in Italy. The Italian workers had confiscated the factories and had taken possession of them. "I will not venture an opinion as to whether or not those methods of struggle are desirable," said Mr. Schlossberg, in concluding his speech, "but I do say, fully conscious of my words, that the labor movement in Italy is united upon a mighty and powerful foundations."</p>
   <p>Mr. Hillman then introduced the assistant general secretary, Mr. Jacob Patowsky, who received a stormy ovation which lasted for a few minutes. The delegates arose from their seats and applauded heartily. Many delegates showered him with flowers.</p>
   <p>"This convention is the greatest in the history of the Amalgamated," declared Mr. Patowsky. "Its greatness consists in the beautiful spirit that has prevailed here and in the constructive work that has been achieved.</p>
   <p>"The reception that the Chicago Amalgamated has given to the delegates has certainly helped to create that spirit at the convention. As a Chicagoan, I <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>am happy to express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to my Chicago comrades."</p>
   <p>An impressive scene was created yesterday at the convention when all the shop chairman of Chicago marched into the hall. The Amalgamated band played the Russian "Hymn of Freedom". Mr. Sam Levin, manager of the Chicago Amalgamated, then congratulated the "captains" of the Chicago Amalgamated upon their steadfastness and devotion to the organization. Speeches of greeting were delivered by Frank Rosenbloom, Sam Rissman, Mariempietro, Maimie Santoro, and others.</p>

   <p>All the delegates and many Amalgamated members were present last night at a lavish banquet arranged for them at the Morrison Hotel, as guests of the Chicago Amalgamated. Many delegates and the chief officials, Hillman, Schlossberg,and Patowsky will leave this morning to visit Milwaukee. The Socialist city Mayor, Daniel Hoan, had asked them to come.</p>
