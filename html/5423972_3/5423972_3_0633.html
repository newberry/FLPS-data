   <p>The privilege of belonging to a union is that of the worker individually, and he does as he pleases in this matter. Of the ten million wage earners in America, less than half belong to labor unions, and the rest are unorganized.</p>
   <p>Both classes of workers, the organized and the unorganized believe that they are acting in their best interests, because no high principles are involved here, even by those who do belong to labor organizations. The unorganized workers, who do not care to belong to any unions, have various arguments to prove the practicability of their action. If we should ignore their arguments of personal freedom, that they have a right to work longer hours, that they do not care to have their working time limited by the union <span class="page-break">2</span>or something similar, then when we consider only the material problem, who profits more the organized or the unorganized worker, it will not require any great effort to prove that the latter is the loser.</p>
   <p>The greatest number of workers, who do not belong to any labor organizations, are naturally unable to carry out their theories of trade unionism, because they do not possess any theories, just as the majority of workers, who are members now of economic labor organizations did not possess them either. Just as these were drawn into these organizations through favorable conditions, so are others remaining outside because of unfavorable conditions. Neither possesses any principle or conviction.</p>
   <p>The minority which does not care to join organized labor is naturally the most ignorant and undeveloped, and has been influenced by the poisonous propaganda of the reactionary employers, who seek thereby to combat the labor organizations, in order to oppress and stifle their employees to a greater extent, so they may exact more profits from their labors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The most reactionary of these employers is, without doubt, Judge Gary, king of the steel trust. And this Mr. Gary has more than once propagandized his tens of thousands of employees to refrain from joining labor unions. First, because in belonging to unions the workers become industrial slaves, and second because they are being robbed of their hard earned few dollars: they must continually pay dues, assessments, strike funds, and other expenses.</p>
   <p>"Labor unions were perhaps once justified" said Gary, "because, I think, workers were not always treated justly, but now there is no necessity for any unions, because the workers are always justly treated."</p>
   <p>This statement was made by Judge Gary at a meeting of the stockholders of the steel trust in April of this year. Since then Judge Gary and his colleagues have cut the wages of their workers three times.</p>
   <p>The first cut in wages of twenty per cent occurred on the 16th of May.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The steel workers were earning $5.06 for a ten-hour working day. With the wage reduction their earnings were reduced to $4.05 for the same working day.</p>
   <p>Just two months later, July 16, the steel trust with the labor sympathetic Judge Gary at the head again out the wages of their workers. This time by nine and one half per cent, decreasing the daily earnings of the workers to $3.70.</p>
   <p>Five weeks later, August 29, the good-hearted and kind Judge Gary, for the third time within six months, again out the wages of his workers approximately twenty per cent, reducing the workers wage to $3 a day, or $18 for a six-day working week and ten-hour working day. For an eight-hour working day the workers receive $13.20 a week.</p>
   <p>To agree with Judge Gary, that bad business compelled him to out the wages of his workers so much is wrong, because the steel trust is the richest <span class="page-break">5</span>corporation in the country.</p>
   <p>Last year this trust made a clear profit of one hundred and eighty-five million dollars, besides the surplus profit of over a half billion dollars which the corporation owns.</p>
   <p>Now, it seems, the reason for Judge Gary's propaganda against trade unionism becomes clear, because if the steel workers were organized this reduction in wages would be an impossibility. This clarifies another thing, i.e. how much the workers are paying for the privilege of not belonging to labor organizations.</p>
   <p>The fact cannot be denied, that lately, wages were reduced in all industries, even in those where the workers are organized in powerful economic organizations. But the wages of these workers were previously higher, and the reductions were proportionately much smaller, almost insignificant when compared with the wage reductions of the employees of <span class="page-break">6</span>the steel trust.</p>
   <p>Let's take, for example, the needle industry, which has been recently affected by a reduction in wages. It is no secret to anyone that, in the last few years, the working wage in the needle industry was entirely satisfactory. It was at least twice as much as the wage of the steel worker in the best of times, yet, when the decrease in wages came, the needle industry was reduced ten or fifteen per cent at the most.</p>
   <p>The wages of Chicago's forty-four thousand Amalgamated members were reduced ten per cent six months ago, which was in accordance with a decision given by their arbitrator. They accepted this ruling under protest, and discussed very seriously the question of refusing arbitration at the signing of the new agreement.</p>
   <p>When the Chicago fur manufacturers made a motion last week to cut twenty per cent from the wages of their workers, whose earnings are at least <span class="page-break">7</span>four times as much as that of the present wage of the steel workers, the furriers declared a strike, and from all appearances it seems that they will win the struggle.</p>
   <p>We are turning back to the steel workers, whose weekly earnings for a forty-four hour week are only $13.20. When we take into consideration, that the dollar now, according to a report by the Bureau Of Statistics of the Department of Labor, is worth only thirty-nine cents, in comparison with the dollar of 1918, when it was then very hard to live on $13.20 a week, we can realize under what horrible condition these unfortunate workers are living.</p>
   <p>The privilege of not joining any economic organizations belongs to the workers personally, but the price which they are paying for it is high.</p>
