   <p>A Year of Practical Work in the Cooperative World in Chicago. By the president of the Cooperative Association. - H. Krohl.</p>
   <p>An interesting history of the establishment of the Cooperative Groceries and their accomplishment in one year. Thanksgiving day marked one year since the opening of a grocery store by the Cooperative Society. After two years of arduous work, the small group of idealists, who made many sacrifices, attended organization meetings, ignored holidays, canvassed from house to house in order to accumulate money, are now rejoicing in seeing the germ of their idea being developed; a real Cooperative Society is now established and is governed by the rules and regulations of cooperation.</p>
   <p>I shall now endeavor to tell how the class-conscious Jewish workers were made to understand the necessity of being consumers and not only producers. Our Socialist leaders understood that through a cooperative movement, we could demonstrate to the working masses the ground principle of Socialism: that if everything is produced collectively and consumed collectively, then every thing <span class="page-break">\2</span>should be owned collectively, and in stead of producing for profit - to produce for use. This is not utopian, but a scientifically formulated principle.</p>
   <p>The workers do not comprehend the importance of building a society in which each must be active and loyal in order to fight the profit makers who are protected by the government. They must pay for shares, buy at the cooperative store, attend meetings, occupy positions in the board of directors and control committee.</p>
   <p>The required number of members is approximately 470, whereas we have only 70, and we have only collected one half of the money required. Various political and economic organizations have shown very little cooperation. Other groups of the labor movement of the Jewish streets in Chicago have remained loyal to our cooperative movement. We maintain that there is only one road to follow in order to succeed and that is according to the plan of the Rockdale Pioneers.</p>
   <p>Our first mistake was by starting with a small capital. The creditors are pressing us for the money we borrowed. Secondly, we erred by not preparing <span class="page-break">\3</span>sufficient grounds for cooperation and, in general, being too hasty. Thirdly, we did not study the business before entering it.</p>
   <p>We have harnessed all efforts in order to succeed. A small group of members have collected $400 for a down payment on a Ford truck (Â½ ton). We simplified our control system by buying a cash register that recorded every penny that went in and out. A few months ago, we bought a store at 2734 W. Division St. complete with new fixtures, two new refrigerators, and an electric coffee grinder. We thought that an intelligent Jewish crowd would patronize us at our new location, but the contrary was true.</p>
   <p>At the end of six months, we called a conference of various organizations to help us, but nothing was done and the conference was dissolved. In the meantime we neglected our local organization activities, which proved very harmful to us. At this time, the Cooperative Society was in a critical condition and the members were called upon to render aid; we did everything possible and at present, the Cooperative Society is indebted to the sum of $500.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It would be unjust not to mention the support from the Mothers League, who have shared in building our society.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, may I state that though we have not made a financial success, we have succeeded in spreading the cooperative ideology in Chicago.</p>
