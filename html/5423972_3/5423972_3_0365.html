   <p>The secretary also informed the members of the different important activities of the Federation. There was not one question of any importance, which came up in the Jewish unions that the Federation did not sanction. In many cases the Federation was instrumental in establishing peace and harmony in the unions when necessary.</p>

   <p>The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: B. Mazur, of the Carpenters Union, president; Alshanski, of the Raincoat Makers Union, financial secretary; Mr. Lehrner, of the Hebrew Typographical Club, recording and corresponding secretary; and Mr. Weinstein, treasurer. It was determined that the financial secretary receive a salary of $5 a week for his services. All other officers of the organization are to furnish their services gratis.</p>
   
   <p>The delegates of the Hebrew Actors Union have requested the Federation to do something for them in reference to an opposing union which has been organized, and also using the name of Hebrew Actors Union. This competitive union has no charter and is using this name, to which it has no right according to the delegates' information; we understand that this opposing union is made up of amateurs, who were refused admittance into our union because they were not actors. The Federation has made faithful promises to get busy at once in handling this problem for the Hebrew Actors Union and seeing that our rights as a union are not infringed upon.</p>
