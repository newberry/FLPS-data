   <p>The Chicago Jewish baker's are now busy with the new contract which must be signed not later than May 1. The old yearly agreement expires Apr. 26. The workers did not put forth any new demands and it is expected that the bosses will avoid trouble by immediately signing the contract as they have done in previous years.</p>
   <p>The main thing that the bosses want to eliminate is the Day for the Unemployed. It has been a custom for many years among the bakers to have each baker, from the foreman on down, contribute one day's salary every week to the unemployed. This created a situation whereby the Baker's Union had solved in a practical manner the problem of the unemployed, which is a constant plague to every union. The bosses however are not pleased with this condition; since the solidarity of the workers is so strong that they do not allow their own to hunger, the bosses realize that the unity of the workers cannot be broken. Apparently there will be no clashes because the Bakers Union Local 237 is known for its strength, and the bosses have learned from experience that (in the event of a "fight"), they would surely lose.</p>
   <p>The controversies which have recently taken place in the worker's ranks are near settlement, because the bakers realize that divided, they will be in no condition to accomplish anything for their union. It is worth nothing that all rumors about the North West Side bakers attempting to organize a new union are false and without foundation, because the bakers have never thought of breaking away from the organization which cost them so much energy to build.</p>
   <p>Grocery Clerks Become Active</p>
   <p>The Retail Grocery Clerks Union has now begun active work to organize all clerks who still remain outside the union. Two massmeetings are arranged for Passover - the time when the clerks are not working. The meetings will be held on the Northwest Side and in the Douglas Park District. The union hopes to improve the condition of the grocery clerks who are now working sixteen and more hours per day at low wages.</p>
   <p>Special attention will be given to the clerks of Sam Cherry, 3511 W. Twelfth Street, who dismissed two of his employees because they joined the union. No one doubts that Mr. Cherry's other clerks will soon be convinced that it is unbecoming for them to be exceptions, and like all others they will join the union in order to strengthen their organization, which through united action will be in a position to defend their interests.</p>
   <p>A Meeting Of The United Hebrew Trades</p>
   <p>Rather lively reports were listened to by representatives of all trades at the last meeting of the United Hebrew Trades. It seems as though there is a general revival in the Jewish labor movement of Chicago, which is promising in all aspects.</p>
   <p>In order to inform the public of the activities of the United Hebrew Trades, it was decided to publish a brief but accurate report of the work of the P. A. G. for last year. A committee of three was elected to give a hearing to Mr. N. Olshansky, former business agent of the Raincoat Makers Unions, against whom certain charges are brought. A committee was also selected to help the Ladies Waist Makers Union carry on its organizational work.</p>
   <p>Hair Dressers Win Better Conditions</p>
   <p>The Hair Dressers Union, which is in existence only a few weeks, has already triumphed over the bosses and won better working conditions practically without struggle.</p>
   <p>Last Thursday all workers walked out from the shops after the bosses refused to yield to their demands, and after striking for only two hours they won their demands. On the average there will be a fifteen per cent raise in wages. The workers have also won other concessions.</p>
   <p>Cloak Firm Punished For Breaking Agreement</p>
   <p>The workers of Schuman Bros., 234 Market Street voluntarily walked out from the shop unable to remain silent while all the work was given out to contractors at a period when they were hungry. The leaders of the Cloakmakers Union induced them to return, assuring them that they would use all possible methods to obtain justice in this matter, despite their failure up to now to have the bosses punished for violating the agreements. The workers obediently returned to work and the Union kept its word.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday Judge Henry Horner of the Probate Court, after listening to the Union charges against the firm which had broken the agreement more than once by giving out work to contractors and sub-contractors, rendered the following decision:</p>
   <p>1. Schuman Bros. must pay $450 damages to the workers because the latter lost wages when they cast aside their work.</p>
   <p>2. The firm must pay one half the expense of the accountant who investigated the books and proved that the workers were justified in their action.</p>
   <p>It is believed that this decision of the arbitration Board will be a good lesson for other manufacturers.</p>
   <p>Among The Cap Makers</p>
   <p>The Capmakers Union Local 5 is now busy with the strike which it is carrying on against the firm of Gold, at Van Buren and Franklin. For many years this shop has been unorganized, and the union had almost given up hope of doing anything with it. Suddenly the workers voluntarily walked out on strike, demanding the right to be organized. The workers approached the union for support. The union immediately took over the strike, which is now being carried on in accordance with the rules and regulations of strikes. The only demand is the recognition of the union.</p>
   <p>The strike at Bair Bros., Franklin and Van Buren, which lasted two weeks, scored a victory for the workers. The firm yielded to all clauses pertaining to prices and reinstated all workers.</p>
   <p>Waiters Unite In One Organization</p>
   <p>The Waiters Union, Local 35 and the Chicago Waiters Association, which have existed as two distinct organizations in one trade, have now united into one union, Local 7, to which members of both bodies will belong.</p>
   <p>The Jewish and non-Jewish waiters belong to this union. Now that all are organized it is expected that the union will improve the working conditions of all restaurant employees.</p>
