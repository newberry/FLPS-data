   <p>The bosses, who employ egg candlers, will force the employer to open a wholesale cooperative Egg Store.</p>
   <p>The Bosses Association informed the Egg Candlers Union, last April, that they must reduce the wages of the employees 20%. The Union fought that demand and did not permit the bosses to carry through their plan.</p>
   <p>If the bosses determine to reduce the wages and declare a lockout, the Egg Candlers Union will open a Cooperative wholesale to the stores and will convince the bosses that they can get along without them.</p>
