   <p>The Jewish community of Chicago has recently matured. Various industries, which employ only, or a majority of Jewish workers, have developed rapidly. The Jewish employers, are numbered in the several thousands, and the opposing interests of the employers and employees cause a great deal of friction. And it has reached such a standpoint, that hardly a day passes by without some trouble arising in a Jewish shop between the employer and his workers.</p>
   <p>This trouble leads to strikes or lock-outs, as it is called by the mutually combatting parties. There are no strikes or lock-outs, which interest the great majority; it is merely a question of a few people, ten the most, but it finally results in unemployment and factories are suddenly left without hands.</p>
   
   <p>Both, the workers and bosses turn to the Courier. The former, no longer holding a job, refer to the Courier's Help Wanted Columns for employment, while the employers know that he will get hands by advertising in the Courier.</p>
   <p>Under the usual circumstances, the Courier can neither dictate nor command the employers or workers to settle a dispute between themselves. It would be against the principles of honesty and justice, if the publisher or editor should bar the news, editorials, or advertising columns to one or the other. Such a method would mean introducing a Russian censorship on the press.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, on ordinary struggle or dispute between Jewish employers and employees is not always a struggle between two equal combatants. Most of the time, if not all the time, the employer is much stronger materially. The Jewish worker in this country, is not a member, practically speaking, of a different class. Most of them are workers, temporarily. Every worker is of the opinion that he will soon become a business man, and that is why the workers, as a class, do not have any strong unions. And whenever Jewish workers of a certain shop declare a strike, they are not prepared for a struggle, they do not have the ammunition with which to fight and they are always the weaker. Therefore every struggle and dispute between the employer and employee is a struggle and dispute between the stronger and weaker one. And every right-thinking person will always sympathize with a weaker fighter, even if he is not entirely right, when he is fighting against someone stronger then himself.</p>
   <p>And therefore, the policy of the Courier, is when a dispute arises between the worker and boss, to favor the party of the workers, whether wrong or right. It is a tradition, in the office of the Courier to accept no advertisements of an employer if his shop is on strike.</p>
   <p>We have never recognized a strike in a Jewish tailoring concern, cigar-factory, or any other factory, as a class struggle. We decidedly deny that it exists.</p>
   <p>The Jewish manufacturer of clothing, cigars, or other articles, who employs a few Jewish workers, labors very strenuously himself, gets gray and old, prematurely, saves a lot of money, and is not a capitalist - is not a member of the capitalist class and does not have the capitalistic psychology. The Jewish employer and employee belong to one class; they are members of one family. They have the same psychology. They are both in trouble because they are Jews, because they are immigrants, and because they are foreigners.</p>
   <p>When the Jewish community of Chicago developed so that disputes between the employer and employee became daily occurrences, it became much harder on the Courier. The editorial department would certainly like to remain faithful to the policies and traditions of the newspapers; the news reporter would like to be available to all news concerning these disputes in order to furnish his reader with news which interests him, and not to be secured from the source, which opposes the interests os the workers.</p>
   <p>Disputes among workers and employers can break out anytime and anywhere. In this case the Courier should be immediately notified so as to be able to draw its own conclusions, when receiving information from the opposite side.</p>
