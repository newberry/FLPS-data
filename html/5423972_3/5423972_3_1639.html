   <p>Of all the Jewish Clubs in Chicago today, the Standard is the oldest, most prominent and most influential. It was organized April 4, 1869, and began its existence with 69 members. With the membership growing beyond the capacity of its quarters the Club in February 1889 moved into its own home, the present building, at Michigan Avenue and 24th Street.</p>
   <p>An addition containing bachelor-apartments, has recently been built at a cost of $100,000.</p>
   <p>The Lakeside, the second Jewish Club on the South Side, ranks next to the Standard in membership and importance. It was chartered June 2, 1884.</p>
