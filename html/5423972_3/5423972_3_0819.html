   <p>The strike in the dressmaking industry is a matter of days. The strike will be declared in a couple of days. The headquarters of the union, for tactical reasons, has not yet announced the exact date when the strike will be called. The entire machinery for conducting the strike is ready now. The strike apparatus will start functioning as soon as the red circular is given to the men and women workers in the dressmaking industry.</p>
   <p>The strike is being called in the dressmaking industry of Chicago, which employs about ten thousand workers. It is expected, however, that the cloakmakers will not remain indifferent to the strike. Very likely, they will stop working for a while in order to organize the strike better.</p>
   <p>It is impossible, of course, to foresee how long the strike will last. It is certain, however, that the strike will not last long in those shops where the majority of the workers are union members. The union expects that the workers in the shops which have not yet been organized, will enroll in the union as soon as the strike is declared.</p>
