   <p>The strike at the Temple Judea, to replace the discharged teachers, is still on.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Teacher's Union expected more justice from a manager of such an institution pretending reform and progressiveness.</p>
   <p>The hopes of the Hebrew Teachers Union were for naught. The Temple Judea management deals with their hired teachers as the capitalists often deal with their hired workers.</p>
   <p>The public that visits the Temple, should know that there is a strike there, because of unfair dealing to workers.</p>
