   <p>The Amalgamated Convention, which opens this morning in Chicago, reminds us again that we are not only the People of the Book but also the people of the needle. We are Princes of the Needle. The Amalgamated is not actually an officially Jewish union. A specifically Jewish union could be composed only of circumcisers, slaughterers, or matchmakers, but the overwhelming majority of the Amalgamated members are Jews. Besides the Amalgamated, there are plenty of other Jewish Princes of the Needle. Our enemies, who always try to find fault with us, even accuse us of having a monopoly of the needle trade; that is a new crime! The truth is, of course, that a tailor is usually a Jew. If the Jews should want, at any time, to play a dirty trick upon the Gentiles, they have only to declare a general strike of the pants makers, and then the Gentiles will not have any pants and will have to run around in pajamas.</p>
