   <p>The Chicago United Hebrew Trades and the Larger Unions, by Morris Sisskind.</p>
   <p>The United Jewish Trades was organized for the purpose of uniting all Jewish unions into an alliance to aid the activities of the smaller unions and for general social activities along political and cultural lines.</p>
   <p>The question is - Do the unions understand the importance of this task and do they fulfill their obligations they owe as a worker's organization to the entire Jewish labor movement? An affirmative answer would not be truthful. A great many of the Jewish trade unions as a whole and their leaders especially interest themselves but little in the united activity of organized labor movement.</p>
   <p>With the exception of several unions who have faithful delegates, no active interest is seemingly taken in the organization. It is time, that they are affiliated with the Trades, that they pay their monthly affiliation dues <span class="page-break">2</span>promptly, but their delegates come but rarely to the meetings, and this they would not do unless they were influenced by the spirit of separatism. The meetings of the United Hebrew Trades are the mirror of the organized labor movement; if the delegates attend, interest themselves in their duty as delegates of their unions, if they participate in the activities, then the Trades begins to function, and is a directing force upon the life of the worker. But, if the delegates do not attend and do not participate in the activities, then the body is paralyzed and powerless to function.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades finds itself in a strategic position in which it is possible to do a great deal for the labor movement in general, and for the small unions specifically.. There is much that must be done for the small unions. These unions are struggling for existence, they are oppressed by the crisis which has seized their trades and by the unemployment which exists among the membership.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The Trades, as an organization, does not have the financial means to enable it to support directly the smaller unions and thus enable them to exist. This should be the task of all unions and of the big unions especially. It is time that the large unions have their own problems, but if the strong unions do not assist the weak ones, then who shall do this?</p>
   <p>Regrettably, there is a certain number of unions, and the big unions at that, which act in a cold and reserved manner towards the other unions and to the United Hebrew Trades as a unit, and although they pay their affiliation dues regularly, they make no attempt to have regular representation at the meetings of the council.</p>
   <p>Aside from the question of support for the weaker unions, the Trades, as a central labor organization, has political, social and cultural interests. The United Hebrew Trades, for example, cannot allow its affiliated unions to be exploited by and for capitalistic politicians.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Trades must be on guard to protect the moral prestige of the organized labor movement</p>
   <p>The Trades has to interest itself in the cultural standard of the unions and to spread education and explanation among the organized labors.</p>
   <p>In general the spiritual and cultural standard of our unions is not what it should be.</p>
