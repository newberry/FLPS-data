   <p>While we labor to establish democracy and good government across the sea, we must not forget to do the same in every community in this country. We must preserve our institutions, and see to it that only persons fitted for the various offices are elected.</p>
   <p>On Tuesday, November 5, an election will be held here. The following offices are to be filled: United States senator and representative, State senators and representatives, and county and city officials. From both major parties, the Democratic and Republican, quite a few capable men were chosen in the last primary election, who deserve to be elected in the coming election. Many of them are already tried public officials, and one of them is Judge Harry M. Fisher.</p>
   
   <p>Judge Harry M. Fisher's candidacy for re-election to the municipal court bench, should particularly interest every Jewish citizen, regardless of the party to which he belongs. If the Jewish citizens intend to do their duty to themselves and to the community, they will re-elect him.</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher deserves this vote of confidence. He has rendered excellent service to the community, not only as a public official, but also as a Jew.</p>
   <p>For six years Judge Fisher occupied the bench of the municipal court, and he has faithfully fulfilled his duties to the citizens who elected him. The judges and the lawyers say: "Fisher is a distinctive lawyer"; the litigants who have appeared before him with lawsuits say: "Fisher is a judge who seeks to do justice".</p>
   <p>In Jewish affairs, it could be said that very few important matters occurred in Chicago in which Judge Fisher did not invest energy, time, and labor. There are very few Jewish organizations in Chicago, which have not heard his voice in the interest of the community.</p>
   <p>Not all Jewish citizens have had the opportunity to show their friendship and respect to Judge Fisher in the primaries, on account of the election laws, but they will have the opportunity to express their feelings to him in the coming general election, when citizens of all parties can march to the polls and vote for their particular choice.</p>
   <p>The Daily Jewish Courier, which brought out Harry Fisher as a candidate for judge six years ago, is now proud of the recommendation that it gave him, for Judge Fisher, with the aid of the Jewish citizens, was elected. Judge Fisher is one of the most popular and best informed judges occupying the bench of the municipal court in Chicago. He has established a big name for himself.</p>
   
   <p>The Jewish citizens must consider it a privilege to be able to vote for a man like Judge Fisher, and we do not doubt that they will do it on the fifth of November, and retain him in the office which he has vested with so much dignity for himself and for the entire community.</p>
   <p>We wish also to attract the attention of Jewish voters toward another official, Judge Henry Horner of the probate court, who should also be re-elected on November 5.</p>
   <p>Henry Horner has endeared himself not only with the legal profession, but also and particularly with hundreds of families who were obliged to go to the probate court for legal adjustment of inheritances. He is a man of deep sympathies, and takes especial interest in the circumstances of widows and orphans whose cases are in his court for judgment.</p>
   
   <p>Judge Horner is very busy in his office, yet he finds time to devote to other matters beneficial to the public. He is very active in Jewish affairs, and is one of the Jews who feels deep sympathy for all unfortunates. All of us extend our respect and recognition to him.</p>
   <p>Judge Horner and Judge Fisher deserve the cordial support of all Jewish citizens.</p>
