   <p>The main three issues won in the waist makers strike were a 44 hour work for the week; a raise in pay and full rights for discharged workers. All these issues were won to my full satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of the great mass of workers in the industry. The cost of this strike is a half million dollars.</p>
   <p>Waist workers, kimona and apron workers are going to organize. Local 100, a dress Union is starting a move toward organizing these trades in one, because the workers of these various trades are working as slaves.</p>
   <p>Local 100 has called a mass meeting for tonight at 1517 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
