   <p>To those who do not know the history of the workmen's movement, the present great victory of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America seems to be a miracle from heaven. And rightly so. The workers have been successful in fighting and securing arbitration agreements from the local tailoring bosses, the great mongers of this industry in America, which is like a wonderful unexpected undreamed of occurrence.</p>
   <p>The actual truth in this important victory tells another story, the story that this miracle is rather a mighty step forward for the cause, and this cause is the Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>For four long years, beginning with the unsuccessful official general strike in 1915, which marks one of the most wonderful chapters in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>history of the struggle of the general workmen's movement in America, the Amalgamated stood ever on the watch without laxity, struggling and struggling untiringly, and thus sowing what in time became ripe, bearing its present fruit for thousands of Chicago's tailoring workmen.</p>
   <p>It is certainly an exaggeration to believe, as some would, that the tailor struggle began at this point. About nine years ago, in 1910, Hart Shaffner and Marx was the only firm to recognize the union, an act which both sides never regretted, for the old moldy Rickard spirit upon whose ruins the Amalgamated built its glorious home, would never have been able to lay the foundation for that which the tailors have today finally secured. The workers hated the Bible-house atmosphere and avoided everything that had anything in common <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with the Rickard spirit. This, then, was the signal for the Amalgamated, a signal of revolutionary and progressive trade-unionism which instilled new life in all. When this same new, happy, just born organization left the old methods and proceeded from the a-b-c in its work to organize the tailors, its call became no longer simply something spoken of, but a deep echo among the workers, an echo which was heard strongest in the first Amalgamated general strike of 1915.</p>
   <p>Well, the 1915 strike did not end as desired. The union was not recognized and wages were not increased. But did the Amalgamated lose its courage then? Did this masterly organization stop beckoning and rousing, organizing and leading Chicago's tailor workmen? Did Sidney Hillman, Frank Rosenbloom, Sam Levin, and other tailor leaders cease their work, even though it annoyed the local manufacturers? And the short 1916 strike?</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Yes, it was a long, long trail from 1915 to 1919. A trail strewn with unfailing strife for organization in the tailoring industry. But finally, the Amalgamated reached its goal, and in the present happy moment one wants only to wish that the workmen should never forget how very dear it is to keep their wonderful union, the Amalgamated.</p>
