   <p>The organization campaign is growing. Shop after shop are organizing, and as it looks, it wont be long before the clothing manufacturers will have to come face to face with Sidney Hillman, the President of the Amalgamated to sign a Union agreement.</p>
   <p>At Alfred Decker &amp; Cohen, one of the largest tailoring concerns nearly all the tailors are union members, from Ederheimer &amp; Stein most of the tailors are members of the Amalgamated. At Hirch Wickweier they speak of nothing else but the Amalgamated, the 44 hour week and the betterment of conditions gained through organizations. At the shop meetings, the workers of Ederheimer &amp; Stein, with the workers of Hirsch Wickweir, those present promised to see that the rest of the tailors in their shops shall join the Union.</p>
   <p>The cutters at Goodman &amp; Harris on the North West side went out on strike for a 44 hour week and the bosses granted that. Then the tailors who worked 52 hours a week followed the example of the cutters and the bosses immediately knocked off 4 hours a week for the tailors, but now they claim that they won't work 48 hours a week for long, they are now organizing to demand a 44 hour week the same as all tailors.</p>

   <p>The Amalgamated sent out to all shops in Chicago an appeal in the different languages spoken by the tailors, to all in the needle trade to join the Amalgamated with headquarters at 409 S. Halsted Street, 1579 Milwaukee Ave. and 2343 S. Kedzie Ave. where information will be given to those, willing to help in bettering conditions for all the tailors.</p>
