   <p>They Want To Unite All Unions Into One Large Union. by Ben Israel.</p>
   <p>The delegates, of the United Hebrew Trades, of Chicago, have at their last meeting begun discussing the issue of amalgamation, the uniting of various international unions of one industry, into one great union, which shall be organically bound by one general executive board, one treasury and shall have power and authority to execute decisions in the entire industrial union.</p>
   <p>What is meant by amalgamation, can be illustrated by the needle industry. The plan of amalgamation in the needle industry, signifies that the men workers (and women) of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and International Ladies Garment Workers, the fur workers, the cap makers, the journeymen tailors, and the United Garment Makers who control the overall workers and the other needle trades, as shirt makers, should belong to one industrial alliance under the control of one general executive board. At the same time, these separate <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>international unions should have local autonomy in questions relating directly to their interests and their technical questions of trade.</p>
   <p>The amalgamation, the uniting of these various trades into one industry is requisite for the purpose of exposing a united front against the employers, to carry on strikes together in order to support each other in time of struggle. Agreements shall be drafted for all trades, and in time, when certain employers attack one union, the others shall have the opportunity, if necessary, to defend the assailed division or to improve the condition of the workers in general. This in brief, is the theory of amalgamation. It strives to eliminate the vicissitudes which inhere in the industry proper. The revolutions in the various trades and industries have culminated to the degree that there is no longer any striking difference between the trades that rally under one industry; and employers, of various trades, are organized in associations protecting one another when a struggle occurs in one part of the industry between the bosses and workers.</p>

   <p>The idea or plan of amalgamation is not new. The word is used in lieu of industrialism and the world amalgamation is not a novelty in the labor movement. Many trade unions bear the name "Amalgamated" in many international unions.</p>
   <p>In 1905 an organization was formed bearing the name "The Industrial Workers of The World," with the very same object of the amalgamationists and due to the very same reasons - that unions in one industry should work in harmony, support each other, struggle together and if one union of a certain industry strikes, the other unions should not remain working in order to help the bosses win the strike - as it happened in the recent railroad strike.</p>
   <p>The difference between the present amalgamationists and the former industrialists is that amalgamationists remained within, not abandoning the existing conservative unions, but working inside and trying to change the form of organization. The Industrial Workers of The World or I. W. W. attempts to organize opposition unions in the same trade, where conservative workers can <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>be found and to carry on a struggle to destroy the old American Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>Those who preach amalgamation in the unions, from this standpoint are better than those who preach destroying the old union and reconstructing new radical unions. The question is, however, what methods those who are for amalgamation want to apply, to carry through their idealogy, and bring about a change in the form of organization. The methods which they seek to apply are in many respects as detrimental as the methods of those who openly preach to break away from the unions. In what way will those, who are for amalgamation, introduce their idea in the unions?</p>
   <p>The amalgamationists have organized themselves into a special organization called the Trade Union Educational League. A very beautiful and innocent name against which, no one can complain. This Trade Union Educational League organizes groups and various unions whose members believe in amalgamation. The group conducts meetings for itself, besides the meetings of the unions to which it belongs. At these special meetings are transacted and determined <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>what the members should do in the union of their trades, then these groups come, organized and disciplined by their Educational League and attempt to carry through their policies and plans in the locals. They have, in this manner, an organization within an organization, a union within a union, a government within a government and this method, of working within the unions, leads to violent disputes, discords and swindles, which will not benefit the unions.</p>
   <p>The amalgamationists are, everywhere, a small minority. The majority is not, as yet, convinced of the necessity for amalgamation or industrial unionism. Many are against it, aside from practical and tactical reasons. As soon as the amalgamationists introduce their idea to the members, one can see them speak in behalf of an organized group, who have a disciplined influence upon them, and they speak not only of the principle and economic necessity, but they also make the issues into a personal struggle, a struggle against the officers, leaders, old workers, against everyone who does not agree with their methods and ways of introducing a new idea into the union. The result is a <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>bitter brotherhood struggle which is carried on from both sides and the result is: The unions suffer, whereas the employers profit, because the organization becomes weakened and demoralized and the work, which must be done for the organization itself is neglected. To sanction this procedure, one must consider what is now happening in the large Jewish unions. One must witness how the amalgamationists carry on a struggle against those disagreeing with them and be convinced that their methods and tactics are harmful to the organized labor movement.</p>
   <p>The spirit of the amalgamation movement started when they began the organized attacks on those who do not agree with them.</p>
