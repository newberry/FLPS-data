   <p>The Cooperative Workers Society of Douglas Park was forced to declare itself bankrupt. The Cooperative restaurant has been closed and it will be sold at auction.</p>
   <p>A group of friends are willing to purchase the restaurant and maintain it as a Cooperative place. Today at 8:00 P. M. there will be a meeting of all friends of this plan to save the Cooperative movement from destruction.</p>
