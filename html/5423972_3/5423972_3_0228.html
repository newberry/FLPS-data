   <p>The jewelry workers of Chicago struck and won, quietly, without turmoil, without a strike in the fullest sense of the word strike. They introduced a forty-four hour week and gained the respect of their employers. It may seem to several, as a contradiction that the jewelry workers have struck without a strike, and triumphed. However, it is a fact, which will interest the workers upon understanding what occurred in the jewelry trade of Chicago for the last few years.</p>
   <p>The gold workers, who are artists at their trade and who handle gold constantly, are in the very same condition as other workers of other trades, who see not a bit of gold before their eyes. "Not everything is gold that glitters" seems to be true, when considering the gold workers and the conditions under which they worked until they formed a union. They worked long hours, being unorganized, for small wages and were afraid to discuss their conditions with their employers. With the entire skill and specialty, which every jewelry worker possesses, they were all slaves because they were divided and not organized. A quiet protest was carried on between the workers, much dissatisfaction reigned against the helplessness of the gold workers and when a few <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the more aggressive workers attempted to bring these workers into an organization, they encountered success and in August of 1917, a union was formed, consisting of 650 members, demanding forty-four hours of work a week and a twenty per cent raise in wages. The bosses, at that time made a lockout and the workers suffered for eighteen weeks and lost the struggle.</p>
   <p>The reasons why the jewelry workers lost are simple. The war, and the discontinuation of trade with gold and the government's position, that platinum must be used for war purposes only, paralyzed the jewelry industry and the workers lost their strike. Fifty members remained of the entire union of local 4, who have not given up their belief and ideal for the future. This condition continued throughout the year 1918. January of 1919, started a new life in the history of local 4. The union became powerful through the aggressive work of Vice-President Sokolow. The workers came back and created plans to shorten the working hours and to regain their demands, which were not considered for eighteen months. Business improved and the workers' demands grew. A new campaign was revived for a forty-four hour week and a plan was constructed to strike on the job; that is to strike but not to strike. A. Greenstein, general treasurer, participated in the issue suggesting to <span class="page-break">\3</span>declare a strike (that is) a condition of a strike, but not to leave the shops; they should strike while working. It was decided to declare this peculiar strike February 18, 1919. The local executive received full power to call a strike at any time necessary. But the workers must remain on the job. A shop committee was appointed, who has the authority to inspect the work in order that the work should be par excellent, regardless of how much time it requires. The employers felt the "condition of a strike." They did not want to lockout the workers because it would harm their own business. So they introduced a forty-four hour week on their own accord. The jewelry workers had a great victory through their new strike method. The jewelry workers of Chicago are now in a fine position. Everyone is organized. The wages are fair and the hours are shorter.</p>
   <p>Much credit for this condition is due to A. Greenstein who contrived this strikeless strike. Local 4 has its union headquarters at 117 N. Dearborn St. Comrade Sokolow is organizer. The union is making preparations to greet the workers of the International Jewelry Workers Union, at the fourth convention which will be held in Chicago, June 7-8-9, at the Morrison Hotel. This convention will be an unusual one due to the fact that five delegates will be here from France, England, and Sweden.</p>
