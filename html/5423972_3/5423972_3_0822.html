   <p>How does the Jewish saying go? It is a pleasure to whip an arrogant, boastful man. It is a pleasure to see the whipped one boasting of his powers yet occasionally touching with his hand that part of his body that hurts.</p>
   <p>We observe now a similar spectacle. There was a strike against the "Ford-Ward" on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. It is very seldom that a strike is as magnificently successful as this one. It is even unnecessary to talk <span class="page-break">2</span>about it. The "Ford-Ward," however, claims that there was no strike.</p>
   <p>This is not a bluff. If a person who has been beaten up until he is black and blue, stands before you and claims that nothing has happened to him, you won't call him a liar. Either you will pity him or you will say that he fully deserves the beating he received. Both reactions are aroused by the "Ford-Ward" strike.</p>
   <p>It was very amusing to look at yesterday's issue of the "Ford-Ward". On the front page there was a big announcement that Sunday's issue was distributed yesterday to all the newspaper stands. The "Ford-Ward" thus admits that the strike was so successful that the "Ford-Ward" was compelled to sell the Sunday issue on Tuesday. This is the first time in the history of daily newspapers that such a thing has happened. It hurts, but what can one do about it?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>It seems, however, that the implications of that statement were not lost upon the "Ford-Ward". To offset that implication, the "Ford-Ward" declares that its Sunday issue was sold so fast that it had to reprint it on Tuesday. Is that so? This is very interesting. Why then was that edition reprinted on Tuesday and not on Monday? Was it because on Monday the strike was still on? Then you admit that there was a strike, then how could the Sunday edition be sold out? This is very funny.</p>
   <p>Another thing: Greetings to the "Ford-Ward" jubilee from its own staff were printed on the first page of the Sunday edition, which we obtained only yesterday. The same greetings were reprinted in yesterday's, Tuesday's, edition. It is easy to understand why this was done. Nobody had seen the Sunday edition, and, of course, nobody will buy a Sunday edition on Tuesday. That is why the "Ford-Ward" had to reprint on Tuesday what it had already printed on Sunday.</p>

   <p>The "Ford-Ward" answers by declaring that the strike was an unsuccessful conspiracy against the labor movement. "Today," proudly declares the "Ford-Ward", "the Forward will be again on sale at all the stands." It granted the strikers everything they demanded, so it is again on the stands. What, therefore, is there to be triumphant about?</p>
   <p>There is another element, besides comedy, present here. The "Ford-Ward" always liked to shroud itself in the mantle of the labor movement. Even when it accepted the Ford advertisements, it had in mind the labor movement. Very likely, it has some peculiar ideas about the labor movement. We will talk about that later. But in the present case, in the strike of the newsboys union against the "Ford-Ward", it is simply idiotic to drag in the labor movement. Will the poor news dealers, who need bread for themselves and their families, break the labor movement? Will they break the labor movement by striking against the Forward, whose treatment of them is worse than that of a bad boss? The contrary would seem to be true.</p>

   <p>However, one should not be too severe with the "Ford-Ward". Everything is far from well with it. First of all, the shame of it: a strike has been declared against it, a "socialist" newspaper, and it has had to employ scabs. Second, the damage: for three full days no one would buy it and even scabs did not help. Third, there was the even greater wound that it had to give in to the demands of the strikers. One, therefore, should be indulgent with the "Ford-Ward" when it tries to throw dust into the public eye, and thereby makes itself the laughingstock of the people whom it has always regarded as fools. Everybody in Chicago understands the situation now: the strike was conducted by poor workers who slave twelve or fifteen hours a day in all kinds of bad weather; they conducted the strike against the "Ford-Ward" leaders, who are as opulent as though they were the directors of a very rich corporation. The strike was declared by a legal union, which has a charter from the American Federation of Labor. To say under these circumstances that some people wanted to use the strike to break the labor movement, is the height of idiocy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Who represents the labor movement if not the unions? Well, did the newsboys union conspire against itself?</p>
   <p>It is now clear to everybody that had the corpulent bosses of the "socialist" newspaper granted the few pennies' raise demanded by its poor workers, there would have been no attempt made to "break the labor movement". The entire dispute was only with regard to the few pennies' raise, and the "Ford-Ward" by its idle chatter about conspiracy and intrigues just makes a fool of itself.</p>
   <p>The "Ford-Ward" has a peculiar conception of what the labor movement is and this explains the whole situation. In its silly statement of yesterday, the "Ford-Ward" says: "The Chicago labor leaders met the attack," and so on. Here you have the root of all the trouble! The "Ford-Ward" doesn't mean the workers, but the leaders of the workers, particularly the leaders who are on its payroll, or lick its boots. This is what the "Ford-Ward" calls the labor <span class="page-break">7</span>movement! This explains everything! The "Ford-Ward" knows that the workers themselves, the tailors, the cloakmakers, the dressmakers, drove away the scabs who tried to sell the "Ford-Ward". It knows that it did not receive one bit of help from the workers themselves.</p>
