   <p>Chicago Cloakmakers will remain with all the Union conditions. There will be no reduction of wages in the cloak trade of Chicago and no standard of production.</p>
   <p>The above was announced by Benjamin Schlesinger, President of the I.L.G.W. Union, after a conference which was held by the Chicago Cloakmakers and representatives of the Chicago Cloak Manufacturers Association.</p>
   <p>Another demand that the Union won was that no employer is able to discharge a worker.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the Union and of the Manufacturers Association agreed upon calling another conference in about five months from now, to consider the condition of the industry.</p>
   <p>The American Federation of Labor extended congratulations to the I.L.G.W.U. for their victory.</p>
