   <p>At last night's session of the American Federation of Labor's convention, a resolution was recommended to unite the Cap-Makers' Union with the Hatters' Union. The committee to determine the dispute abandoned this resolution and recommended to completely suspend the cap-makers from the Federation because they did not follow out the resolution of the Federation by not accepting the straw-hat workers in their union. The delegates have unanimously adopted this resolution.</p>
   <p>The dispute concerning the straw-hat workers has been dragging for about two years; since the cap-makers have organized the millinery and straw-hat workers, the hatters took up measures against the Cap-Makers' Union. The leaders of the A. F. of L. did not want to listen to the pleas of the cap-makers, who organized several thousand millinery workers. Now when the cap-makers have given their time, energy, and money, and have built a strong union, the hatters, with the aid of Samuel Gompers and his machine, compel the cap-makers, by force, to give up the jurisdiction over the workers whom they have organized.</p>
