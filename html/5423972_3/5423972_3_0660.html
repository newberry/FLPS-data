   <p>There is no cheerful news among the organized Jewish workers. The time of prosperity during which they had enough work and were able to earn a living, has slowly disappeared and a dark cloud has spread over the workers' environment and, little by little, unemployment has crept stealthily in and, like a poisonous snake, enveloped the workers' body, sucking out, drop by drop, the blood which accumulated during the time of prosperity.</p>
   <p>Hardest hit of all by unemployment were the Jewish workers employed in the needle industry, where unemployment is now at its worst.</p>
   <p>It is no secret that a good sixty per cent of all the cloakmakers in Chicago are now idle, while the other forty per cent are working but half, or even a <span class="page-break">2</span>third, of the regular time. The unemployment in the men's clothing industry is not on a small scale either. Approximately fifty per cent of all the Amalgamated members of Chicago are now unemployed, and the other fifty per cent are not working full time. A similar condition prevails in the Capmakers' Union.</p>
   <p>The momentous problem for these unions, consequently, is how to overcome the present industrial crisis, for which they were not responsible, and which they were unable to prevent.</p>
   <p>No one doubts that these unions will be strong enough to live through this crisis, because they have devoted much courage and energy, during the time of prosperity, to the development of class-consciousness in their members and to forming them into a gigantic and disciplined army that could withstand an attack of the enemy during bad times and defend their positions for which they so tirelessly fought.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The main problem is how to help the members who are in need of help, and how to aid these unemployed so that the hunger whip may be prevented from driving them into the camp of their enemy.</p>
   <p>An answer to this was given this week by five hundred employees of the Nash Clothing Company of Cincinnati, who have decided to turn over their jobs, in January or February, to their unemployed colleagues of other shops. This example should serve as a sacred example in the needle industry, for the more fortunate workers who are employed to imitate.</p>
   <p>The Jewish baker-bosses, who were compelled to reduce the prices on bread, after they have conducted an energetic campaign against the high cost of bread, have decided, that the reduction should not come out of their pockets, but from the pockets of their workers.</p>
   <p>Upon the inquiry of the writer of these lines, whether the baker-bosses are about ready to conduct a campaign for smaller wages with the Bakers' Union, <span class="page-break">4</span>Mr. Isaac Cohn, organizer of the baker-bosses association, replied, "We have reduced the price on bread and now are compelled to seek means to cover this deficit."</p>
   <p>Why only the Union is to be the scapegoat to cover the deficits of the bosses is a very important question, but first of all there is the question whether they really have a deficit. Is it really impossible to sell bread at ten cents a pound? This the baker-bosses will have to prove clearly, before they can begin a struggle with the Union, a struggle which can be successful only when they win the sympathy of the general public.</p>
   <p>In the meantime the dry facts are against them. Flour has fallen from thirteen or fourteen dollars a barrel to nine dollars a barrel; sugar has been reduced from thirty-one cents a pound to nine cents a pound; oil and other materials necessary for baking bread and rolls have been reduced in price, and, consequently, the price of bread and rolls must also be reduced.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The best proof that the baker-bosses are in a position to sell bread at ten cents a pound, and make a legitimate profit at that, is in the fact that many baker-bosses on the West Side have sold bread this week at nine cents a pound, and others at a still lower price. One even sold bread at seven and one-half cents a pound.</p>
   <p>The truth is that bread was sold at these prices because of competition among the baker-bosses, but if it is possible to sell bread at seven and one-half cents a pound because of competition, why is it not possible to sell the same bread in normal times at ten cents a pound, and make a legitimate profit at that?</p>
   <p>The fact is that the baker-bosses would never have thought of beginning a struggle for smaller wages with the Union if they had not been instigated by the so-called labor leaders, who, in a three-column statement, declared that the Union made an important step to assist the baker-bosses to reduce the price <span class="page-break">6</span>of bread by abolishing the rule that the bosses themselves cannot work.</p>
   <p>This statement, which was a clear hint that the high cost of bread was forced by the Union, and will be abolished when the bosses themselves work, gave them the thought of starting a fight with the Union for smaller wages.</p>
   <p>To accuse these "labor leaders" of dishonesty would perhaps be exaggerated, but there is reason to accuse them of ignorance and irresponsibility. How true the saying is: "God protect me from my 'friends'; from my enemies I shall protect myself". Yet this ridiculous, irresponsible statement, issued voluntarily by these "friends," the baker-bosses will be unable to use, they will also be unable to use the pretense that they have large surpluses of flour which they have bought at high prices.</p>
   <p>If the baker-bosses should start a fight with the Union, they should remember that the general public has no surpluses of flour at the old prices, but can <span class="page-break">7</span>buy flour now at nine dollars a barrel, and that the Jewish women will bake their own bread.</p>
   <p>The large fund which the baker-bosses' Association has decided to collect, in order to fight the Union, as the writer of these lines has learned from reliable sources, will have to be used for a far better purpose. Perhaps it would be advisable for them to give it to the hungry, suffering Jews across the sea. Let them consider it well.</p>
