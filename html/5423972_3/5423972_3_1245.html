   <p>At the second annual meeting of the Community Council of the J. C., Dr. Hollender introduced Harry L. Hopkins, who spoke on the subject of "This Business of Relief".</p>
   <p>In his talk he showed the necessity of warding off starvation for the millions who through no fault of their own, but because of the faults of the modern economic system had been deprived of the opportunity of obtaining employment. He believed that the relief problem was too vast to be coped with by local communities and he stressed the significance of permanently relieving the relief situation.</p>
