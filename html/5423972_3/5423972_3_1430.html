   <p>From the office of Ford's Dearborn Independent, there was given out today, advance copies of the next issue of the anti-Semitic rag, in which there is an article entitled "an open letter to the Jews about the Jewish problem".</p>
   <p>In this article, Ford asks the "great intellectual" Jews to help him create a new financial system for the world. "The Jews," says Ford, "have created the present gold system which was a good thing in its time, but which has now become the cause of all the crises. The Jews, therefore, are best fitted to create a new financial system that will abolish unemployment."</p>
   <p>According to Ford's new crazy idea, the Jewish problem and the world economic problem are one and the same thing. Ford, at the same time, assures us again that he is not an anti-Semite. He only aims in his articles to "open the eyes" of the Jews.</p>
