   <p>Henry Ford has again entered the game of anti-Semitic propaganda, despite his promise that he would let the Jews alone and would concern himself with automobiles only. In the last issue of the Dearborn Independent, the American Jewish Committee was again attacked because it is not fully convinced of Captain Rosenblum's guilt and demands an impartial investigation of the entire case. Mr. Ford cannot tolerate this. Why should Jews meddle with this affair, and what business is it of theirs whether Rosenblum is guilty or not? If the American Jewish Committee did not interfere, and Rosenblum became the victim of an anti-Semitic conspiracy, Henry Ford would be among the first to claim that Jews are murderers! In order to avert such accusations by Henry Ford, the American Jewish Committee must intervene in this affair. This will not suit Henry Ford, but nowhere is it written that Jews must act according to the will of Henry Ford.</p>

   <p>At the present time, newspapers are full of stories about dope [traffic]. They report shocking detail's of young men and especially young artists who have been ruined by dope. Movie stars are frequently victims of morphine and opium. I do not believe that true artists indulge in morphine or opium, because a true artist does not need any stimulant to express his art. The true artist is a strong person. He has three or four times as much energy as the average person. All of his senses are more highly developed than those of the average person. He possesses so much natural vitality and natural pep, that he does not need to become intoxicated in order to strengthen his vitality and the power of his expression. I am very skeptical about the art of even the greatest movie stars. Not only are they overpaid for their work, but they are also overrated as stars. I have my doubts as to whether the word artist can be applied to them at all. Inarticulate mimicry is not art, but is rather some form of subtle expression. The American public admires the movie stars too much and therein lies the whole trouble. We have made idols out of a group of mediocre people and when mediocre people become idols, they also become crazy and make others crazy. The movie industry provides many with a livelihood; but <span class="page-break">\3</span>movie "art" drives many to their graves. If movie "artists" received the consideration and salary of intelligent workers, they would not become crazy nor would the dope-plague become so widespread. Taking dope is a vogue which comes from Hollywood.</p>
