   <p>On the request of the editor to observe the locality where the sweat shops are located, I took a stroll on 12th street between Canal and Jefferson street, only two blocks. We see to our sorrow, in these two blocks, pools of sweat and blood; human lives are sacrificed on the altar of profit.</p>
   <p>What do we find there? In the first block on Canal street, we find only tailor shops, with long rows of machines, that are driven by electric; the noise, the hum, the turmoil, the beating and tapping must disturb the minds of those working in these shops. Lined up in rows like soldiers, you can see the workers seated at their machines; above the heads of the workers all you could see was pants-overalls, vests and boys' pants, flying in the air, the workers chasing the work as though it was running away from them. That is the manner in which the workers pass the time, in these sweat shops, at their work. They cannot speak to one another, they cannot sing at their work, they cannot do as they would like to, they cannot move around, they must do only what their machine commands. This tailoring industry went through a revolution. From a hand trade, it became a great industry, driven by electric power. The dividing of the work made each worker only <span class="page-break">\2</span>a part of the trade. The installing of electric is a driving power that has enslaved the worker, so, that his ego, his individuality is completely forfeited. They are seen in their undershirts, their faces sunken in, pale protruding cheek bones, their thin and slender hands can be seen pushing the materials, and swinging it back and forth as it is mostly piece work, and here is where the hustle and bustle - the self exploitation begins. This piece work is one of the modern slaveries that blindfold and gradually murders the workers. Living pictures describing the results of the piece work system, you can see in this block on 12th street, from Canal to Clinton streets.</p>
   <p>They don't belong to a union, it was said. What do they need a union for? Don't the bosses give them big bundles? Don't he give them a chance to rush themselves to death in order to turn out more work? Sure, they get all these "Privileges." All the noise and turmoil while at work goes to their heads that their minds are too much exerted to think, and when the workers come home late at night, they have not sufficient strength left in themselves to think or read a book about himself, and for that reason hundreds of workers, employed in these sweat shops and city factories and stores are <span class="page-break">\3</span>considered slaves.</p>
   <p>The health of these sweat shop workers is very poor. The dust in these shops is so dense, the materials piled up so high, the workers sitting so close together, that their sweat running down each one, everybody's perspiration is condensed in the air, mixed with the dust, and each worker breathes everyone's perspiration into his lungs and possibly for that reason they are all slaves in the same manner and with the same opinion.</p>
