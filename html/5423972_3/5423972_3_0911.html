   <p>The 1910 and 1911 strike in the Chicago tailoring industry will, undoubtedly, remain in the history of organized labor as one of the important struggles which American labor has conducted. Its chief importance consists in the fact that a foundation was laid to organize the tailors in Chicago, and afterward in other cities, out of which the Amalgamated Clothing Workers was born--the pride of American organized labor.</p>
   <p>Is anyone, however, in a position to evaluate the bitter suffering, hunger, and cold, which tens of thousands of Chicago strikers had to endure throughout the bitter struggle which lasted several months? Who can grasp the deep anguish of the leaders of the strike, who were forced to observe the agony of their brave strikers, and could not see a single ray of hope that the strike might be won?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Who is big enough to feel the bitter anxiety of the unfortunate women and children, whose husbands and fathers were murdered by the hired thugs, spies, and sluggers of the manufacturers? To obtain something of an idea of what this important struggle in the needle trades industry was about, it is sufficient to describe the results of the strike:</p>
   <p>The struggle began on October 1, 1910, and lasted until February 3, 1911, when the strike leaders were compelled to give up the struggle. The loss in wages was estimated at three million dollars, while the expenses of the manufacturers for private detectives, sluggers, and strikebreakers, reached the sum of half a million dollars. The manufacturers' loss was estimated at four million dollars. The maintenance of the strikers cost $154,000. Forty-five thousand strikers and about two hundred and fifty tailoring firms participated in the struggle. Five persons were killed, in addition to the loss of five million dollars. In order to refresh the memory of our readers, we will relate the history of this struggle, which played such an important role in the organizing <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the needle trades industry in America.</p>
   <p>The beginning of the strike took place on October 1, 1910; several hundred workers in the pants shop of Hart, Schaffner, and Marx walked out when the firm attempted to cut their wages. This action of the firm kindled a spark among the ranks of their dissatisfied workers, who worked under a system of slavery. The workers had to endure all sorts of insults and slander from the foremen, managers, superintendents, and all the other hirelings of the manufacturers, who had only one purpose, i. e., to squeeze another drop of blood, a little extra work from the unfortunate tailor. What is more, the workers were forced to pay all sorts of fines out of their own pockets; they had to pay for various trivial things, like oil cans, belts, etc.</p>
   <p>At that time, it was almost impossible to organize these unfortunate slaves because of the introduction of the rule in the shop, whereby the workers were <span class="page-break">\4</span>forbidden to talk to one another; conversation was strictly prohibited during working hours, and it was further arranged that two workers of the same nationality never sat together. When the exploitation had reached its height, the time for conversation was past. The oppressed workers instinctively felt that an end to their slavery had to come, and they rose against their oppressors. The strike at once spread to other shops of Hart, Schaffner, and Marx and to other firms, and soon embraced the whole men's clothing industry in Chicago.</p>
   <p>An important event took place on November 5, when the thousands of strikers suddenly realized that President Rickert of the United Garment Workers had, without their knowledge, settled the strike with the firm of Hart, Schaffner, and Marx, and had closed an agreement, whereby the workers repudiated the closed shop. With the swiftness of lightning the news spread among the thousands of strikers, and they immediately held protest meetings in various parts of the city, where they accused their International president of treason.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The most important of these meetings was held late in the evening at the Schwartz Hall at 12th and Johnson Streets. This meeting was called by a part of the executive committee of the Union, which remained loyal to the strikers. The result of this meeting was an appeal to the strikers not to abide by the agreement which President Rickert had closed, and not to return to work. A delegation of four active strike leaders, Abrahms, Libin, Sam Levin, and Mrs. Raymond Robins, was elected to appeal to the Chicago Federation of Labor to take over the leadership of the strike.</p>
   <p>During this period, Rickert left Chicago, declaring that under the circumstances, he had settled the strike as best he could, and that there was nothing further for him to do here. Rickert's disgraceful agreement with Hart,Schaffner, and Marx read, literally, as follows:</p>
   <p>"The president of the United Garment Workers of America agrees to recommend that all former workers of Hart, Schaffner, and Marx shall return to work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>According to this understanding between him and the representatives of the above-named firm, one person shall be selected by the firm, another by the United Garment Workers of America, and these two shall select a third; these three shall take up all the grievances of the workers against the firm, and shall find ways and means of avoiding similar difficulties in the future.</p>
   <p>"The firm of Hart, Schaffner,and Marx agrees not to penalize its workers for belonging to the United Garment Workers of America.</p>
   <p>"This agreement shall not be considered as a recognition of the Union, and the questions of the union, the open shop, or any shop organization shall not be proposed, or accepted by the committee, which will be appointed through this agreement; also the question of the open shop shall not be considered as a grievance of the workers of Hart, Schaffner, and Marx.</p>

   <p>The Chicago Federation of Labor took up the struggle and chose John Fitzpatrick and Ed. Nockels, president and secretary of the Federation as leaders, together with Mrs. Raymond Robins, and four representatives of the strikers themselves. This committee of seven took over the leadership of the strike and held it to the end, until the hunger and suffering of the strikers compelled them to give up the struggle after a bitter torment of twenty-two long weeks.</p>
   <p>Daily Jewish Courier, Nov. 26, 1920.</p>
   <p>When the new general strike committee took over the leadership of the great tailor strike, which had already entered its sixth week, the main problem which confronted it was how to raise financial aid for the strikers and provide bread and coal for their suffering families so that hunger and cold would not force them to yield. A strong movement was immediately organized to help the strikers <span class="page-break">\8</span>financially. Labor unions, various societies, lodges, vereins, and private business people responded to the appeal of the strike leaders to help their suffering army.</p>
   <p>Jewish Chicago responded generously to the appeal and helped raise financial support for the tens of thousands of strikers. This movement among the Chicago Jews was led by the Jewish Courier, which contributed whole columns every Sunday to the strike, and collected financial aid for the needy and suffering strikes. During the period of the strike, more than five thousand dollars was received by the office of the Courier for the strikers.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Sheltering Home also responded in its own way, and assisted the needy and suffering strikers. On November 11, the directors of the Hebrew Sheltering Home held a meeting and decided to give free meals to the strikers. This work was carried out thanks to the initiative of Mrs. Raymond Robins. About three hundred strikers, took advantage of the hospitality of this institution each <span class="page-break">\9</span>day, between the hours of 11 A. M. and 2 P. M.</p>
   <p>On Monday, November 14, the Jewish Aid Committee was organized, made up of prominent civic leaders and businessmen. B. Horwich was chairman, Harry Lipsky, general manager of the Courier, secretary and B. J. Schiff, treasurer. The committee consisted of Congressman [A. J.] Sabath, Samuel Phillipson, B. Bogarden, A. Margules, H. Horwitz, and H. Friedlen. This committee raised a substantial sum of money for the strikers. The most active work was done by Harry Lipsky, who was not only active in raising financial aid, but also in the leadership of the strike.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the general strike committee proceeded with its work, and thanks to its untiring activity, an agreement was concluded with Hart, Schaffner, and Marx on January 14, 1911. This agreement was signed by John Fitzpatrick, Ed. Nockels, Margaret Robbins, H. Harris, and Hart, Schaffner, and Marx. According to this agreement, all disputes between the workers and the firm were supposed <span class="page-break">\10</span>to be settled by a committee representing both sides. All strikers were to get their jobs back within a period of ten days, and not a single striker was to be penalized for belonging to the Union.</p>
   <p>As soon as this agreement was approved by the workers, the firm began to carry out the clauses of the agreement. On January 15, three thousand strikers of Hart, Schaffner, and Marx returned to work. Two days later, the firm called back another three thousand workers, and within the designated ten days, called back all the rest of its strikers.</p>
   <p>The other large tailoring firms, which were organized into two associations stood firm, and refused to give in to the strikers. They hoped that hunger would finally compel the strikers to yield, and, eventually, the strikers did give in. The sufferings of the strikers from hunger and cold became unbearable. The terribly cold winter of 1911 was another whip that lashed the strikers and <span class="page-break">\11</span>compelled them to give up the struggle. The financial assitance was not large enough to feed indefinitely the unemployed army of tens of thousands.</p>
   <p>On Friday, February 3, the strike committee held a meeting at 275 La Salle Street, to which they invited President Rickert. They asked him whether the Union would consider the strikers scabs, should they return to work. The International president replied that there could be no question about it because the strikers were compelled through hunger and want to give up the strike.</p>
   <p>At this meeting it was decided to end the strike after a twenty-two-week struggle, and to send the tens of thousands of starving workers back to work. In anguish and despair, the strike committee announced the sad news to the starving strikers, who were dismayed at the decision. Defeated, miserable, and hungry, tens of thousands of strikers returned to the shops; they had only one ray of hope, that their suffering would not have been in vain, that sometime later, when they regained their strength, they would begin a new struggle, in which they would be victorious.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>Indeed, this struggle was not in vain; it laid the cornerstone for the organization of the whole needle trades industry, and brought about the birth of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union, which today numbers in its ranks a glorious army of two hundred thousand class-conscious members.</p>
   <p>The important role played by the Courier in helping to raise financial aid and to keep up the courage of the strikers, was properly acknowledged by the thousands of Jewish strikers and their leaders, who expressed their thanks for this noble work. The Courier adopted the same policy toward the Jewish workers and played the same part throughout the general strike of 1915, which was then conducted by the newly founded Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated, at that time, thanked the Courier in a letter for this work, and expressed the sentiment of all the Jewish tailors in Chicago. Mr. Hillman's letter was written in Yiddish and reads as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>"Chicago, December 23, 1915.</p>
   <p>"To the editorial office of the Jewish Courier.</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen: The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America considers it its duty to express its gratitude to your newspaper for the assistance given us during the period of our long and drawn-out strike. The Courier has, undoubtedly, done much to encourage the thousands of strikers, who have for many weeks fought for better working conditions.</p>
   <p>"The news about the strike in your newspaper has, unquestionably, surpassed all our expectations; you have reported our cause favorably, and now, at the end of the strike, we want to assure you, in the name of all the tailors in Chicago, that we know how to appreciate your valuable assistance, and we hope that in <span class="page-break">\14</span>the future, we may receive the same co-operation from the Courier as in the past.</p>
   <p>"With the utmost respect,</p>
   <p>"Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America,</p>
   <p>"Sidney Hillman, president."</p>
