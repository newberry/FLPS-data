   <p>By a vote of sixty-six to six, the members of Local 195, Retail Clerks Union, expressed their confidence in their business agent, Leon Green, whose expulsion from office the United Hebrew Trades had recommended. At the same meeting, which was held Monday evening in the Auditorium, the members also decided not to have any further representation in the United Hebrew Trades, but to remain with the American Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>By this resolution and vote of confidence, the members of the Retail Clerks Union rejected the decision of the impartial committee which found Mr. Green guilty of the charges brought against him by the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   <p>Rumors are spreading to the effect that the United Hebrew Trades will organize a union in opposition to Local 195, and that the west Side storekeepers whose agreements with Local 195 expire next month, will then have an excuse to refuse to sign new contracts with the old union.</p>
