   <p>If one enters the headquarters of the Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, 409 South Halsted Street, he can witness the work of the tradesmen in reconstructing the halls for an employment bureau, which the Amalgamated is preparing for members.</p>
   <p>The new employment bureau will be under the direction of Roy Stuart, who promises much to the workers of the Clothing Industry in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The question of unemployment does not leave the Amalgamated and the organization, always, attempts to provide some solution. The problem under the present circumstances is to ease conditions; to provide more members with work; to establish a system of dividing the work among all members, so that all may have some. When the problem was discussed by representatives of the locals, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and officers of the Joint Board, it was affirmed that, if the manufacturers would become interested in the problem, a great deal could be accomplished to regulate unemployment.</p>
   <p>Realizing that the manufacturers are not concerned with the life of the workers, and are not interested in the problem of unemployment from an industrial standpoint, the Amalgamated of Chicago has, therefore, determined to carry through the following plan : Each business agent will make a record of how many workers are employed in the shops over which he has charge; how many are employed at full time and how many at part time. A number of workers will be transferred from slack shops to shops where business and over time work prevail. In the course of time the work will be so regulated that too much work will not be concentrated in one factory and too little in another.</p>
   <p>This is the sole method of regulating the work, under existing circumstances, in order that some workers shall not remain idle, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>or work part time, when in other factories there is much work.</p>
   <p>The same plan will be carried through in the beginning of the season. When a big concern receives a large order and starts employing hundreds of new workers, while in other factories members are waiting for work, the big concern will not be permitted to employ new workers. Instead, workers will leave other firms that do not provide them a living to be transferred to busy shops, so that no surplus of workers may be created in the industry. Not urally this will take place possible within the Union's control. There is no doubt that this plan will require the cooperation of those controlling the factories. It will, also, require the good will of the workers, who are to be transferred from one shop to another. It is but natural that several workers will not be contented for leaving their shops where they are accustomed to work, as they will fear that they may not profit by the change.</p>
   <p>"These difficulties" said Sam Levin, "must be expected". But, as mentioned, it will adjust itself in time. In the first season,-when this system is functioning, it will be difficult to satisfy everybody, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>but in time the dissatisfaction will vanish because the workers will become convinced it is being done to their advantage.</p>
   <p>For the workers of the Amalgamated in Chicago it is important to explain this system of regulating the work that, by applying the law of average, all employees will work more regularly.</p>
   <p>To accompany this plan the employment office will lend its aid. The division of work, in general, will be carried on in a systematic and scientific manner by knowing, each day, how many workers are needed in factories; how many are unemployed and in what sections, or trades, workers are required, in order that any workman, who will be sent somewhere, should know that he is being sent where he is most needed.</p>
   <p>Besides this, one will accurately know the condition of the industry. It will be known at any time, by the registration of the unemployed. How many people are without work; which factories remain idle; factories having a lot of work; factories having very little work; in such a <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>manner the problem of the unemployed can be thoroughly studied with good results.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the important task, which the Amalgamated is now undertaking, should be regulated by the Union, without expectations of having the government, or bosses solve the problem as it is under our present system.</p>
