   <p>You cannot cast your vote in the coming election, November 5, if you have not registered. If you did register ten days ago, on the last registration day, October 5, well and good, but if not, you must do so tomorrow, Tuesday, October 15. It is only by registering that you may have a voice in the decision of important issues, and in the election of officials whom you think suitable to represent you in the national, state, and local governments.</p>
   <p>In addition to the election of officials to represent you in the above-mentioned offices, there are four issues to ballot on: The calling of a convention for the revision of the old constitution of this state; the problem of good roads; the problem of an adequate banking law, and for Chicago--the traction question.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The citizen who neglects to place his name in the new registration books (the old ones are all destroyed) cannot vote on November 5; and when he does not vote, then he fails in his duty.</p>
   <p>The citizen who neglects to register is a slacker.</p>
   <p>Who of you, Jewish citizens, wants to be stamped as a slacker? No one, we believe. Then see to it that you are registered!</p>
   <p>The polls will be opened from 8 A.M., to 9 P.M.</p>
   <p>Remember, tomorrow is the last day that you can become eligible as a voter, by answering a few questions to the clerk of the polling place.</p>
   <p>You don't have to write; you have to answer only a few questions which the clerk of the polling place will ask you: Your name, address, how long at <span class="page-break">\3</span>present address, and how long you have been a citizen. The clerks mark it all down, and you become a voter--a voter who has a say on November 5 as to which candidate should be elected to this or that office, whether this or that issue has your approval or not.</p>
   <p>The female citizens should also register; they can vote for some very important offices.</p>
   <p>Jewish citizens have a twofold reason to register; several Jewish candidates are in the race, and with your aid they will be elected. The Jewish candidates need your vote, must have your vote; they cannot be successful on November 5 without your full support.</p>
   <p>They need and must have your support: Congressman Adolph S. Sabath, in the <span class="page-break">\4</span>Fifth Congressional District; Judge Henry Horner, for the probate court; Judge Harry M. Fisher, for the municipal court; Charles Krutchkoff, for assessor; George Mayer, for congress in the First District; Leo S. Lebousky, in the Second District; Samuel A. Ettelson, for state senator, Third Senatorial District; George P. Marks, Fifth Senatorial District; Samuel A. Weinshenker, for state representative, Second Senatorial District; Sidney Lyon, Fifth District, Jacob W. Epstein, Seventeenth District; Solomon P. Roderick, Nineteenth District. Every non-Jewish candidate, honest and suitable, who runs for office, whether on the Democratic or Republican ticket, deserves your full support also.</p>
   <p>On account of the local election laws, all of you were not able to vote in the last primary election for Sabath, Horner, Fisher, and various other candidates. In the coming election, all of you will be able to vote for them.</p>
   <p>You will not be able to vote if you do not register. If you didn't do so last <span class="page-break">\5</span>Saturday, tomorrow is the day; tomorrow you can become a full-fledged voter, a voter who will be able to elect, on November 5, the candidates best suited for the offices, and help in solving, the above-mentioned four problems, particularly the traction problem in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow is Registration Day! Remember!</p>
