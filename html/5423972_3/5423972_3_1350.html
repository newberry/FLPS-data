   <p>A Chicago Jew is responsible for the inception of a unique activity whose title, "The American Ideal Campaign", explains itself. Mr. E. Philip Rosenthal is the organizer, and it is helping to convert our own citizens to the ideals of Americanism and through them spread these ideals to other lands and people.</p>
   <p>Here is the declaration of principles formulated by Mr. Rosenthal and his followers:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"We hold these truths to be self evident:</p>
   <p>1. That the standard by which the greatness of a people is its ideals; that the ideal is the rook upon which character must be built.</p>
   <p>2. That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. (This is the ideal upon which the American nation was established).</p>
   <p>3. That the American ideal broadcasts the seed of good will to all men.</p>
   <p>4. That the ideal testifies that the Creator gave to man the right to the earth and its fullness in his sojourn through this world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>5. That the ideal reveals to man his true relationship to the world and to his neighbor.</p>
   <p>6. That society is an organism of which all men are parts; that the welfare of society depends upon the well-being of its parts.</p>
   <p>7. That the command, "Love Thy Neighbor As Thyself", is fulfilled by recognizing the sacred rights of others and honoring men.</p>
   <p>8. That truth is not confined by national boundaries; that American ideals, a self-evident truth, is available for the world.</p>
   <p>9. That when the world accepts the American ideals as its standard, and all men have the opportunity to exercise their inherent rights.</p>
   <p>10. That America, our America, because of its all inclusive ideal, is destined to lead the world into light, order, and peace.</p>
   <p>"Let us therefore prepare for the work that is before us and make the <span class="page-break">\4</span>"ideal the ideal of Americans.</p>
   <p>"In view of the un-American views andpractices exhibited by masses of our citizenry throughout the country, it is a good guess that Mr. Rosenthal has a man's size job if he confines himself to our own beloved United States.</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless, it is a very valuable thought that Mr. Rosenthal is spreading and we are glad that it is a Jew who is doing it. It deserves the co-operation of all good Americans, even if they are not idealistic, as he is.</p>
