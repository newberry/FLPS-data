   <p>It seems that the United Garment Workers Union have at last determined to organize all Jewish tailors and workers. In case the work is neglected, it will mean that conditions of the Jewish workers will not improve. It is up to all Jewish trade unions to get together and organize all Jewish industrial workers into one United Workers Alliance.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we are in hopes that our advice will be accepted. We wish you success in the new undertaking to get all Jewish industrial workers so well organized that it will bear fruitful results for the masses of Jewish workers.</p>
