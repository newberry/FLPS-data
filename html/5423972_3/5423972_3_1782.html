   <p>Before the primaries, we called attention of our rabbis and leaders that they should become interested in the most important problems of our country, and that they should, in their pulpits and platforms, allow their voices to be heard on the chief issues pending in the national, state, and city campaign.</p>
   <p>We know that as soon as we advocate anything like this, a great many will think that an election is merely a matter of dollars and cents; they will plead that such matters as the tariff question, high cost of living, and other questions should not enter such a sacred place as a synagogue. To these people the question of the American future is a question of extracting a few dollars from the politicians at election time. It is, therefore, not surprising that when they become aware that impartial rabbis, responsible Jewish leaders, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will discuss campaign issues and political candidates for the benefit of the country, they fear that they will be robbed of a few dollars.</p>
   <p>Since the primaries, the thought apparently prevails that we should have free political platforms to discuss political issues.</p>
   <p>The Jewish people are in need of an educational committee, where principles come first and personalities second. We must have speakers whom the public shall have faith in. We must have a platform, where current issues shall be discussed from the standpoint of issues, not from the standpoint of people.</p>

   <p>We are now standing in a period when our morale is changing, our manner of living, our thinking, and our conditions are changing. What was decent a few years ago is probably considered as a criminal act today.....And we must not be backward.</p>
   <p>True, that the many years of exile, severe inquisitions, the enslavement of the Jewish soul effected us so that we acquired no other interest than the Jewish religion. We were driven from world affairs and driven into ghettos where our discussions were limited to Judaism and, naturally, our synagogues became the meeting place of Jewish interests only - which meant to lament the destruction of the Jewish race.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Now we are not only emancipated from the physical ghetto but also from the spiritual; we now have general interests as well as specific Jewish interests. In addition to religious and charitable institutions, we should become interested in civil matters - the tariff question, high cost of living, trusts, immigration, recognition of American passports in foreign countries, the money question, initiative, recall and referendum questions, the civil service question, the conservation question, increasing the army and naval powers, and scores of other national problems.</p>
   <p>City, county and state problems should interest us as citizens. The rabbis ought to introduce these problems to the great Jewish masses, and discuss them in the synagogues where they should treat these problems as they understand them.</p>
