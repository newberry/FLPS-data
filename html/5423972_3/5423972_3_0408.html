   <p>For years and years now there have been struggles in the Illinois Federation of Labor, which had the outward appearance of a fight for official positions. But everyone knew that this was only part truth, this aiming for offices of president or other high officials, the main quarrels being for the policy and control of the Organized Workmen of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Two elements were herein concerned. One, a Progressive with Socialistic tendencies, and the other a Conservative of Gomper's State Union. With each flare-up, the enmity between the two became greater and greater. Of course, the official positions of the Workmen's Party are of great importance in this struggle since it is up to the officials to administer methods and regulations which are progressive or conservative, as the case may be.</p>

   <p>The last election of the Illinois State Federation of Labor was a turning point for the party, a Progressive victory. John D. Wolker, of the Illinois Mine Workers Union, was elected president, defeating Mr. Edward R. Light who has held that position for the past seven years and is one of the foremost reactionary trade union men. Mr. Wolker is a progressive young man who for many years has been at the head of the Miners' Union.</p>
   <p>It is believed that this change in policy will have a great bearing on the Chicago Federation of Labor, where the strife has been in process for many years.</p>
