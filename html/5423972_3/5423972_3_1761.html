   <p>Our opinion expressed here about Jews goes likewise for other nationalities, even the so-called pure American. Theoretically, we can reason that America is a "melting pot" into which is cast, by way of Ellis Island, Jews, Italians, Poles, Swedes, Germans, Russians, et al, and from it [melting pot] emerge "pure" Americans. But in reality people do not fuse like metals. And for a long time every nationality remains isolated. America is still too young to have the power to affect vitally these groups in the process of fusion. Even the so-called pure Americans, who are mostly of English descent, think and feel like the English. It will take a great number of years before a unique American way of thinking is developed.</p>
   <p>Each individual national group is more or less bound together by ties of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>friendship and devotion. An Irishman will always be more friendly to a McCarthy than to a Cohen, just as a Jew will more readily sympathize with a Levy than with a Czyncziewski, and Fritz will always be the favorite of Germans. These are cold facts, and all theoretical sophistry as to how it should be and why it is so, has nothing to do with this matter. This natural affinity is inherent among the members of one and the same nationality, Jews or non-Jews. From this affinity originate the so-called aristocratic clubs that bar Jews because the clubs are composed of "pure" American members. Thus there are such special clubs among the individual nationalities, in which members of other nationalities are not admitted.</p>
   <p>In ordinary, everyday life, when people encounter one another in the struggle for existence, the boundaries between the various nationalities are not so sharply drawn. But when it comes to doing certain favors, when one feels that they can be done at public expense, then preference will always be given to a fellow national. This is true among Jews as among non-Jews, and when we speak here of the Jewish vote in politics, we feel that it is similarly true for the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>non-Jewish vote, such as the Polish, German or Irish. We are writing, however, for Jews, and we shall speak only of the Jewish vote in politics.</p>
   <p>And we say with firm assurance that there certainly is a special Jewish vote. This means that the Jewish citizen will more readily vote for a Jewish candidate than for a non-Jewish one, even though the Jewish candidate may not belong to the political faction in which the citizen has more confidence. This does not necessarily mean that all Jewish citizens will vote for each and every Jewish candidate. It simply means that the Jewish citizen will be more inclined to vote for a Jewish candidate. The percentage of Jewish voters who vote for a Jewish candidate depends largely upon the character, competency, and suitability of the Jewish candidate. It is a well-known fact that Congressman A. J. Sabath, when he runs in the primaries, polls a large number of votes from Jewish voters affiliated with the political faction opposed to him. On election day almost ninety per cent of the Jewish Republicans, as well as the Jewish Socialists, vote for him. This is due to his competency, suitability, and devotion to his <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>work in behalf of free immigration.</p>
   <p>In the election of Judges J. W. Mack, Hugo Pam, Joseph Sabath, Harry M. Fisher, B. David, all Jews remember well that they [these Judges] received nearly ninety per cent of the Jewish vote, which was made up of both Republican and Democratic voters. In this campaign the Jewish vote manifested its complete potentiality. Every Jew, regardless of his personal political and social opinions, felt as though it was his moral obligation to vote for these persons. In every case it can be said that only the Jewish vote and the enthusiasm of the Jews made it possible for the candidate to be elected. Especially was this the case in the election of Judge Mack. He was elected only by the united Jewish vote.</p>
   <p>Actually there are Jews who deny that there is any such thing as a Jewish vote, or they contend that if there is such a "thing", it exists only among the "uncivilized" Jews of the West Side, who come from such despotic lands as <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Russia, Rumania, Galicia, etc., and therefore do not understand the spirit of free American institutions and traditions. Consequently, these Jews fool themselves when they go into the election booth, ferret out on the ballot all the Cohens and then place an X next to their names. But when these Jews, who deny the Jewish vote, run for office they are the first to appear on the West Side to seek this denied vote, knowing in their hearts that they will undoubtedly receive the Jewish vote in any event.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that the longer Jews dwell in a community, the more they become Americanized, and the more they understand the American spirit of political activity, the stronger and more self-expressive becomes the Jewish vote. This results from the fact that the Jewish masses see how the masses of other nationalities conduct themselves politically and then do likewise. It is one of the things which we can say is "a good non-Jewish tradition" that Jews may practice. It is understood that the more the Jewish vote becomes united the more desirable it is for every political group. The political leaders know that <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>when they have a Jewish candidate on their ticket, for whom the Jewish public will indicate enthusiasm, the Jewish masses will not only vote for the Jewish candidate but also for other candidates of the same party who support the Jewish candidate.</p>
   <p>This leads every political faction to place on its ticket the best Jew it can get, because the better the candidate is the more Jewish votes he will draw for himself and for his colleagues, the non-Jewish candidates. And when this Jew is elected to office, he tries to preserve the respect and friendship of his national brothers who gave him the opportunity to attain the position he holds. Many of our Jewish officeholders who were barely known when they were first elected to office, have in time become national Jewish figures, as for example, Judge Mack, Judge Pam, Congressman Sabath and noted local welfare leaders such as Judge Fisher, Commissioner S. D. Rosenblatt and Trustee Harry Lipsky.</p>
   <p>The honor of holding office adds a distinct prestige to the officeholder and <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>gives much weight to his opinions among the masses. If the officeholder possesses fine qualities, he is able to wield his power. The Jewish citizens know all this and they help such people to gain [public] office. Herein lies the great secret of the Jewish vote whose existence some would deny.</p>
