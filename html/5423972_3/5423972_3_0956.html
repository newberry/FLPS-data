   <p>All cleaners and dyers in Chicago, over a thousand workers, stopped work early this morning, beginning a strike for a forty-four hour week, a minimum wage, and recognition of their union.</p>
   <p>The cleaners and dyers are well-organized under the supervision of the Gewerkschaften (United Hebrew Trades). They, therefore, feel certain of victory.</p>
   <p>Five firms, among them Molter of the Northwest Side, one of the most prominent in Chicago, have already settled with the union. It is believed that the strike will not last long, for the rest of the manufacturers will certainly follow the example set by the five that settled.</p>
