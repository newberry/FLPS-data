   <p>To all Butchers of Chicago! A special meeting has been called today, Monday evening, In Douglas Park Auditorium, Room 10. Every butcher must attend so as to sign the contract with the (Butchers) union; if he will not sign, he will not be able to obtain any shochet (orthodox slaughterer).</p>
   <p>With regards</p>
   <p>Chicago Hebrew Butchers Association.</p>
