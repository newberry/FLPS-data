   <p>The United Jewish Gewerkschaften is celebrating its first anniversary and has truly earned the right to make a fuse over it. Its accomplishments thus far have been notable and its plans for the immediate future have all the earmarks of complete success.</p>
   <p>In spite of their accomplishments, it is tragic to see that in such a large city with a large Jewish working population, more workers have not sought organization under the Gewerkschaften Banner.</p>
   <p>It is highly desirable that unorganized workers be present at the United Gewerschaften Celebration and see for themselves the value of thorough and effective organization.</p>
   <p>Speaking of the Labor Movement we understand that the United Jewish Gewerschaften are planning to organize an International Tailors Union. We wish them success in their very worth-while endeavors in the interests of the most exploited trade in the world.</p>
