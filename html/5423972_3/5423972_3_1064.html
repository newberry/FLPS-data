   <p>The Chicago-Jewish newsdealers have declared a strike against the delivery company which delivers the New York Jewish dailies: Tageblatt, Morgen Journal, Tag, and Wahrheit. They refuse to sell these papers contending that the delivery company is striking against them by refusing to permit them to sell certain Russian newspapers and a couple of weeklies. In short they have answered a strike with a strike--which goes into effect today.</p>
   <p>The strike committee of the Newspaper Dealers Union consists of Morris Maraz, Joseph Sacks, J. Tabachnikov, and H. Feldman.</p>
