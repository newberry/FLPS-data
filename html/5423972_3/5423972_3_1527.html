   <p>The active workers and leaders of the Jewish trade unions will meet this evening to discuss and plan how to protect the different interests of our workers. Our workers are in a sorry plight. We find strikes, lockouts, curtailed wages and worse of all, scarcity of work. The heads of the different industries are constantly looking for all kinds of ways and means to take back what the workers received on account of the war.</p>
   <p>Therefore, now is the opportune time for all Jewish trade unions to get busy and call a conference to study the plight of the workers and decide on a plan of checking and avoiding thie unemployment crisis.</p>
