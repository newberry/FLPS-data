   <p>In the national office of the Socialist Party, at Madison and Halsted Streets, sits - together with Mr. E. B. Bailin, the national financial secretary - the interpreter - secretary of the Jewish Socialist Federation of America and Canada. From this office of the Federation, all dicisions of the Socialist Party are distributed to all Jewish ghettos in every part of the world, and also fron this office flow the united activities carried on by the Jewish Socialist branches.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bailin, being very active in the Jewish Socialist movement, is hopeful that in time, a Jewish Federation will develop in America, with a membership in the tens of thousands.</p>
   <p>Jewish Workers in the Socialist Party</p>
   <p>"But what position are the Jewish workers of the Socialist party taking at present?" I asked.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"As a Federation, the Jews rank third in size among all other Federations, not mentioning the fact that it is the youngest of them all. Although the Jewish Socialists were a little late in establishing a Federation, they have a membership of nearly five thousand, in about ninety branches which extend to all parts of this country," Mr. Bailin declared.</p>
   <p>"But this does not, under any circumstance, limit the role that the Jewish workers play in the Socialist party of this country," said Mr. Bailin. "Many Jewish workers belong to non-Jewish Socialist branches, due to the fact in many small towns the membership is not large enough to permit organization of independent Jewish branches. On the other hand, there are old Socialist branches of Jewish workers in large cities, whose members are under the impression that joining the Federation appears too Nationalistic; therefore, they remain apart. When all this has been taken into consideration, you will find there are about twelve thousand Jewish workers in the Socialist Party.</p>
   <p>"The Jewish workers hold honorable positions among the non-Jewish branches of the Socialist Party," said Mr. Bailin. "They extend their influence to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>all branches of the Party and are always elected as officers. They are secretaries of non-Jewish Federations, state secretaries, and officials of other branches; the secretary of the German Socialist Federation is the Jew, Dreyfus, and the secretary of New York state is the Jew, Solomon."</p>
   <p>Russian-Jewish Revolutionists in the Federation</p>
   <p>"Why is it that the Jewish workers, while in Russia, were such heated revolutionists and such devoted Socialists, but here, they keep so far away from the Socialist Federation?" I asked Mr. Bailin, knowing that everyone is deeply interested in this question.</p>
   <p>"This question is a very important one," admitted Mr. Bailin, "because in Russia there were 50,000 Jewish Socialists in the party who took a very active part in the work. More than half of them have crossed the American border, but the American Socialist Party believed themselves too important to immediately accept them in their ranks. The Party <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>members could not acquaint themselves with the life, the way of thinking, and the psychology of the Jewish workers; the Federation, then, was not yet in existence.</p>
   <p>"The revolutionary Jewish workers themselves came here with all hopes lost, dreams asunder, and lost energy. The party could not understand nor realize, and therefore, could not win them. Coming into a new world, with a new culture and new impressions, it takes quite a long time for the Jewish workers to overcome the changes, and to overcome the trials they have had in life."</p>
   <p>"We must also consider the economic side of the new-comer," said Mr. Bailin. "How much energy does it take to look for a new profession, acquaint yourself with a new life and new conditions; and above all, to learn a new language. All these are reasons for the hesitancy of the Jewish workers to join the Socialist-Federation."</p>
   <p>"What are the prospects of the Jewish Socialist Federation for the near future?" I then asked.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"The prospects are excellent," answered Mr. Bailin. "If the last year had not been one of so much unemployment, unemployment which almost ruined the Jewish industries, the Federation would have developed unusual activities, and would have organized the masses of Jewish workers into the Socialist Party. But it is hoped that the bad times will soon be over, and a magnificent vista will be open to the Federation.</p>
   <p>Of late, many new intellectuals have come to the fore, men who, together with those men already prominent, will help spread the Socialist ideal among the Jewish workers. Such men as Dr. Goldfarb, Olgin, Lituak, and others, will surely elevate the Federation above its present condition regarding membership.</p>
   <p>Traditions such as those the Jewish workers possess, their cheerful struggle, their proportionally higher intelligence and ideals, all will surely be used by the Federation to strengthen the movement among the Jewish workers."</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The Federation and the Jewish Question.</p>
   <p>"What does the Federation do concerning the Jewish question in the Socialist Party?" I asked.</p>
   <p>"In this respect," answered Mr. Bailin, "a great change has taken place recently. The Party authorized its delegates to the International Congress to demand that the Congress adopt a resolution to the effect that when the warring countries agree on peace, the Jews shall be guaranteed equal rights in every country."</p>
   <p>Jewish Socialists in Chicago</p>
   <p>The last question I asked Mr. Bailin was about the condition of the Jewish Socialist branches in Chicago.</p>
   <p>He is also of the opinion that the Chicago branches are doing good work, and that the old branch, from the West Side, is growing rapidly, having <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>many new members. The branch organized a class in the Hebrew Institute, where Socialism is taught from a scientific standpoint; lectures are also arranged there.</p>
   <p>The North Side branch has also increased its membership, and carries on energetic activities during campaigns.</p>
   <p>The young Douglas Park branch is becoming normal. With a larger population in that vicinity, it is anticipated that this branch will have an excellent future.</p>
   <p>All these Socialist branches are united into one central city body that carries on the work of the branches and developed educational activity in the various youth clubs and societies that request lectures and speakers. In this manner, the city central body plays an important part in the lives of Jewish people.</p>
   <p>This body has organized a Socialist Singing Society, whose task it is to <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>bring Jewish melodies and songs into the Jewish homes, thus making the lives of the Jewish workers happier and more enjoyable</p>
