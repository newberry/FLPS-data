   <p>That we are opposed, and strongly so to the idea that women should be soldiers was expressed in this column once before. Still, there are times when we wish that a woman were at the head of every state militia.</p>
   <p>Upon considering the disrespectful, vulgar and arrogant meanness of the commander of the militia in the state of Colorado, we cannot but feel inclined to entertain this desire.</p>
   <p>Why, we ask, did this ignorant commander and wicked man pick on the brave and noble Mother Jones?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Mother Jones is a true mother in America. She is dear to and loved by the workers. She devoted her entire life to the interests of the oppressed classes. She spent her entire life with them, educating, encouraging, supporting, and doing many things in order to improve their condition physically and morally.</p>
   <p>Should a strike break out, particularly among the miners who spend their lives in the cold ground in order to supply other people with fuel, then you can rest assured that Mother can be found there - this gray, old woman with her silver hair, with her pleasant face and lovely smile, with her wise and sensible counsel, to encourage the strikers, to implant in their hearts power and hope, to arrange relief for their families, food for their women and children, and medicine and care for their sick. She is an angel of good will among these people. Can the capitalists tolerate such?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The commander of the militia in Trinidad, Colorado, who is now acting the role of a Russian czar in the entire strike region, decided that Mother Jones cannot step into that vicinity.</p>
   <p>Mother Jones, however, believes that she is in America and not in czardom, and she stands on her constitutional rights to go wherever she pleases. So she went to Trinidad, was instantly arrested by soldiers and held for some time in prison. She was then transferred to Denver, accompanied by a guard. In Denver she was freed, and without wasting any time she caught the first train back to Trinidad, where she was re-arrested. Once again did the commander perform his comedy in order to gain favor in the eyes of the company.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>And free America stands aloof, and without saying one word witnesses how an army officer tramples surreptitiously upon the constitutional rights of an 82-year-old noble woman.</p>
   <p>Is this the highly civilized America? Is the power of money dominating here as it does in all reactionary countries?</p>
   <p>If Mother Jones did commit a crime, she should be taken before a judge, even if judges are not in favor of strikers, so that he may decide her crime and punish her in accordance with the law. If, however, she did not commit a crime, she should be free to go wherever she pleases, because this is her privilege and no one need interfere. Isn't it so?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The commander's brutal treatment is a blotch on this civilized country and a shock to all right thinking and democratic people.</p>
   <p>I, therefore, wish that women might exercise their power in the Army.</p>
