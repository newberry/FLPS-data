   <p>The fifth bi-annual convention of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers [Union] was gloriously opened here yesterday to the strains of the new revolutionary hymn of freedom. The big Ashland Auditorium was overcrowded with hundreds of delegates and thousands of Amalgamated members who declared that day a holiday. They left their shops and went to the convention to greet their guests, the delegates to whom the one hundred and seventy-five thousand members of the Amalgamated had entrusted the task of considering and solving the most important problems of their organization.</p>
   <p>The holiday atmosphere of the convention was further enhanced by the masses of flowers which the various Amalgamated locals had sent to the convention. The large platform of the Ashland Auditorium looked as if it were a bower of flowers and the officials and chief leaders of the Amalgamated who were on the platform looked as if they were sitting in the midst of a magnificent garden of flowers.</p>

   <p>The convention was opened by Mr. Joe Goldman, president of the Chicago Joint Board of the Amalgamated, who introduced Mr. Sam Levin, manager of the Chicago [branch of the] Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>Mr. Levin, in a short speech, greeted the delegates in the name of the Chicago Amalgamated. He reviewed briefly the heroic struggle which the Chicago tailors had undergone before they lived to see the day when the Amalgamated had become a powerful organization, which could protect their interests. Mr. Levin then turned the chair over to Mr. Sidney Hillman, international president of the Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>Sidney Hillman was greeted with the greatest ovation a labor leader has ever received, when he arose to speak. The huge crowd rose from its seats and the rafters of the large hall shook with their applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hillman, in an inspiring speech, described the important struggles which the Amalgamated had undergone. He pointed out the most important problems of the present moment and appealed to the delegates to apply all their forces, energy, <span class="page-break">3</span>and intelligence toward solving those problems in the interests of the Amalgamated and its one hundred and seventy-five thousand members.</p>
   <p>" I greet you, delegates," began Mr. Hillman, "and, through you, the tens of thousands of members whom you represent. I greet you delegates from New York, Boston, and Baltimore. Not long ago, your seventy-five thousand members underwent a bitter seven-month fight for the existence of the Union. Tell them that we hope that in the future they will also defend the principles and ideals of our organization with the same steadfastness and devotion.</p>
   <p>"I greet you delegates of the ten thousand members in Rochester, a city that has always been known as the 'scab' center of the needle industry. I greet you delegates and forty thousand members of Chicago, where the slightest victory has been gained through rivers of blood, tears, and martyrdom.</p>
   <p>"During these times of industrial crisis," continued Mr. Hillman, "when all the dark forces are conducting a campaign of destruction against organized</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>labor, we must always stand on guard to repulse those forces. These dark forces are seeking to destroy the freedom of organized labor and also the freedom of the entire country. It is, therefore, our sacred duty to defend the freedom of the United States."</p>
   <p>Mr. Hillman then gave a short review of the last great Amalgamated struggle in the East, where the Union was sued for four million dollars in damages, where forty-nine injunctions were issued against the Union, and where the fight cost the Union nearly two million dollars.</p>
   <p>"Despite that and the other fights which we have had recently," said Mr. Hillman in concluding his speech, "we are now in a much stronger position than we ever were before. We have more members, more money in our treasury, and--most important of all--we have more solidarity and unity in our ranks."</p>
   <p>The convention began its practical work immediately after Mr. Hillman's speech. It elected a credentials committee of the following delegates: Joe Shea of local 9, New York; J. Levin of local 209, Montreal; Montague of local 145, Minneapolis; <span class="page-break">5</span>B. Goldman, local 15, Baltimore; Phillip Locastro, local 200, Rochester; S. Smith, local 39, Chicago; L. Foersting, local 115, Cincinnati.</p>
   <p>Speeches of welcome were then delivered by Mrs. Raymond Robins, president of the Women's Trade Union League, and by William Cuneo and Clarence Darrow, the attorneys for the Amalgamated who helped the strikers a great deal in their fight of 1910-1911.</p>
   <p>Schlossberg Receives Stormy Ovation</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Schlossberg, general secretary of the Amalgamated, was introduced following the speeches of welcome. A wave of enthusiasm swept over the audience when his name was mentioned. The stormy ovation, which had greeted Mr. Hillman, was repeated. The audience of many thousands of people arose from their seats. The thunderous applause lasted for many minutes. The representatives of the one hundred and seventy-five thousand Amalgamated members expressed by this ovation the love and respect which they felt toward their leader.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schlossberg, an intellectual labor leader, pointed out, in a beautiful and <span class="page-break">6</span>flowery speech, the most important problems facing the Amalgamated at this moment.</p>
   <p>"Chicago is the Bunker Hill of the Amalgamated," began Mr. Schlossberg, "and I am happy to be here. The beautiful music that you have prepared, the mountains of flowers that you have brought here, will for a long time remain as a sweet memory with us and a source of inspiration because we know that the music was played by the Amalgamated band and the flowers were bought by the Amalgamated wage workers."</p>
   <p>Mr. Schlossberg then pointed out the various tendencies that are to be found in the Amalgamated and expressed the hope that the unity which reigns now in the Amalgamated would reign forever.</p>
   <p>"After every storm," said Mr. Schlossberg, "a rainbow of various hues appears. The Amalgamated is the rainbow of American labor, which promises it a brilliant future. We have members of many tendencies, as varied as the colors of a rainbow, but we all unite upon one, upon the platform of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers."</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Mr. Schlossberg concluded his speech by reading a telegram of greeting to the convention which had been received from the Soviet government. The telegram was sent by the Russian Red Cross and was signed by its president, Solouiev. A verbatim translation of the telegram read as follows: "The Russian Red Cross sends its greetings to the Amalgamated convention in the name of the thirty-six thousand hunger sufferers whose lives were saved by the Amalgamated. We thank the true comrades in America who, in a period of personal difficulty, did not forget to help us. We have not yet ended our fight against hunger, but the Russian comrades received new courage from your brotherly support."</p>
   <p>The first session of the convention came to an end when Mr. Schlossberg finished his speech. The credentials committee was asked to get to work at once and to report to today's session, which will begin at nine-thirty this evening at the Oriental Consistory, 919 North Dearborn Street. All other sessions of the convention will also be held at that address.</p>
   <p>All the delegates spent the evening at various entertainments, concerts, banquets, and balls, which the various Chicago locals had arranged for them.</p>
