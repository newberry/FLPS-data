   <p>The editor of the American Hebrew, in an open letter to Henry Ford, asks the Detroit automobile magnate and the financier of the pogrom-propaganda in this country, a few pertinent questions, which we are sure Mr. Henry Ford is unable to answer, not because he is an ignoramus on general principles, but because the plain facts are against him. Mr. Ford is invited to answer the following questions:</p>
   <p>"(1). Did you know that these so-called Protocols were peddled about in Paris in an effort to blackmail the Jews into purchasing them for the sum of $10,000, and that otherwise they will be published?</p>
   <p>"(2). Did you know that the word 'Jewish' preceding the word 'free masons' on page three of the English edition, which you are constantly quoting, does not <span class="page-break">\2</span>occur in the original Russian; that it was inserted in the English translation by those who foisted this pamphlet around the anti-Semitic public from anti-Semitic motives?</p>
   <p>"(3). Did you know that the reference to England as that it contributed to the destruction and transformation of every country in Europe, and to Orthodox and autocratic Russia as represented in the Russian autocrat, as it only survived the defense against the anti-Christ?</p>
   <p>"(4). If you were aware that the word 'Jewish' referred to above was not in the original Russian, why did you abuse the Jews only as the alleged authors of the 'Protocols' and not of the 'free masons'?</p>
   <p>"(5). Did you know that upon the publication of these facts, the English publishers stopped the sale of the pamphlet, and that even such anti-Semitic papers as the Morning Post and G. K. Chesterton's Witness, dropped the allegation as to the origin of the 'Protocols'?"</p>

   <p>There are many more questions of the same nature, which Mr. Henry Ford and his agents could not answer because Mr. Ford and his pogromists-agents are not concerned with the facts, but are moreover concerned with creating a pogrom-atmosphere in this country. They do it not because they hate the Jews so much, but because they are afraid of the high tide of radicalism and make the Jew a scapegoat. Mr. Ford and his agents are intentionally, deliberately, and consciously spreading lies and slanders against our people to attain a sinister aim. But we take consolation in the fact that the pogrom-propagandists in Detroit are not the only scoundrels who seek refuge in anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism was always the refuge of scoundrels, for reactionaries, and political charlatans, and though they often endanger the lives of large groups of our people by their anti-Semitic propaganda and by their pogrom-preparedness, they have never impressed themselves upon the public for a long time. Mr. Ford and his pogrom-propagandists in Detroit may succeed in confusing the mind of the public for a short time, but in the end, they will be recognized as political charlatans, for they cannot fool all the people all the time. The Jews have only one thing to do--to nail down every lie of Henry Ford and his pen bandits, to <span class="page-break">\4</span>bottle them up with the slanders and criminal libels and idiotic allegations, and to paralyze the effects of their anti-Semitic propaganda. Then when the public will recognize Ford as a man who attempted to create a pogrom atmosphere in this country, he himself will find out that his job is an ungrateful one, and will give it up.</p>
