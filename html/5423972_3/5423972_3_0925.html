   <p>Some of the compositors of the Courier and other Jewish newspapers went on strike yesterday, demanding much higher wages than are received by the compositors of the Tribune and other English newspapers. The Courier demanded that the dispute be arbitrated, in accordance with the Union contract, but the compositors refused.</p>
   <p>The present wages paid by the Courier are $1.57 per hour for night work, and $1.30 per hour for day work, while the Tribune and other English language newspapers pay $1.25 per hour for night work, and $1.15 per hour for day work.</p>
   <p>The president of the Typographical Union, Mr. S. Kenn, was present at yesterday's meeting, at which the strike vote was taken. Mr. Kenn warned the compositors that the Union has signed an international contract with the Courier; that their stand is a violation of the rules of their Union, and that they are allowed to strike only at the order of the officials of the Union. Mr. Kenn told them <span class="page-break">2</span>that the officials of the Union were opposed to the strike.</p>
   <p>As you see, the Courier has appeared without the aid of these few compositors. It was composed and printed by union members who respect union rules. The union label printed above testifies to our statement.</p>
   <p>The Courier is the only Jewish newspaper in Chicago that employs only union members in all departments, from the compositors to the drivers who deliver the newspaper.</p>
