   <p>Meyer Perlstein, vice-president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union and leader of the Chicago strike, said yesterday that twenty-five large dressmaking firms have severed connections with the association, and have settled with the Union granting all of its demands. The demands of the Union which the manufacturers granted, were: A ten per cent raise, a forty-hour work week, and a closed shop.</p>
   <p>The usual number of arrests and riots took place yesterday in the strike area, and, as usual, the arrested strikers were freed under a bond of four hundred dollars each.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Federation of Labor has undertaken to investigate Mr. Perlstein's complaints against the office of States Attorney Crowe, whom the Union accuses of helping the bosses break the strike.</p>
