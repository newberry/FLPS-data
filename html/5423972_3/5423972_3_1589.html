   <p>Young America Branch Arbeiter Ring.</p>
   <p>About two months ago the Young America Branch of the Arbeiter Ring was organized by several members of the Institute Educational League and their fellow workers. The branch is having a steady and healthy growth and promises to be a valuable factor in the Chicago division. At present it is the only English-speaking branch in the city. Greater stress will be placed on the educational and instructive feature of the organization, leaving the routine work more in the background. At the special open meeting held on July 24, in the Reception Room, Mr. Philip L. Seaman delivered an address on the purposes and value of the Arbeiter Ring.</p>
