   <p>Is the present agreement of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers a victory or a defeat for the organization? Does it show the strength or the weakness of the Amalgamated? These questions are of interest not only to the forty-four thousand Chicago members of the Amalgamated, or the two hundred thousand Amalgamated members all over the country, but to the entire organized labor movement.</p>
   <p>When one considers the deplorable conditions whch exist in industry today, when capital has organized, and is waging a relentless struggle against organized labor, the results of every struggle are of great significance to both sides, because they may have a serious effect upon other industrial <span class="page-break">2</span>struggles. It is, therefore, no wonder that the attention of the whole organized labor movement was focused upon the struggle of the Amalgamated, the strongest Jewish labor body. Had this mighty labor organization lost in the present struggle with the manufacturers, this defeat would, undoubtedly, have been considered a big loss to the entire organized labor movement. On the other hand, a victory for the Amalgamated can be considered a victory for all of organized labor.</p>
   <p>When the manufacturers, a few months ago, proposed a new agreement, to take the place of the old one which expires on May first, they presented their now historic, twelve demands. The chief demands were: a reduction of twenty-five per cent in wages, an increase in the work week from forty-four to forty-eight hours, exclusive right to hire and fire workers, and sole right to divide the work in slack times.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to enumerate the other points, because these four points <span class="page-break">3</span>alone are sufficient to give a clear picture of the nature of the other demands of the manufacturers. Needless to say,if the bosses had won their demands, the Amalgamated would have been dealt a death blow from which it would never have recovered.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, the writer of these lines, discussing the situation in the Courier, said that the only point which the representatives of the Amalgamated could discuss at a conference with the representatives of the manufacturers, would be the question of wages. When an argument revolves around dollars and cents, there is room for negotiation, bargaining, and compromise. The other points of the agreement, which have to do with principles, with the soul of the organization, cannot be discussed because one does not trade with principles, one does not bargain or compromise with principles. When an organization sells its soul and principles to the devil it is dead, spiritually dead, although its body may continue to lead an indolent and dishonorable life.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Amalgamated came out of this dispute with clean soul and principles. It compromised only on the question of dollars and cents, and, therefore, such an outcome must be considered a priceless victory, not only for the Amalgamated but for all of organized labor.</p>
   <p>This victory gains in importance when one considers the present critical industrial conditions. Mr. Sidney Hillman, international president of the Amalgamated, in explaining to the members of the Amalgamated the importance, of the present agreement, said: "Do not forget that six hundred coal miners are now on strike because their bosses have refused even to negotiate an agreement with them; tens of thousands of steel workers are slaving for twenty-eight cents an hour at the present time, and, therefore, the agreement which we have obtained is the best one possible under the circumstances."</p>
   <p>Tens of thousands of Amalgamated members in Chicago agree with Mr. Hillman's <span class="page-break">5</span>statement, and almost unanimously,they approved the action of their representatives who negotiated this agreement. Only a few workers from a certain section were dissatisfied with this agreement because no minimum wage scale had been established for them as yet.</p>
   <p>It is not a question of certain sections but of the Amalgamated as a whole, however, as Mr. Hillman has explained. If this powerful Union remains healthy and strong, one can be sure that sooner or later the workers of that section will be satisfied and that a minimum wage scale will someday be extablished for them.</p>
   <p>Considering the Amalgamated agreement as a whole, we see that it is a great victory for the Union, which means that it is a great victory for all of organized labor. This victory was made possible thanks to the solidarity of the two hundred thousand Amalgamated members, thanks to their class consciousness, <span class="page-break">6</span>their discipline and their devotion to their organization. The manufacturers took these factors into consideration.</p>
   <p>This agreement is to run for a period of three years. One of the important clauses of this agreement gives both parties the right to bring up the question of wages every year and, if no agreement is reached, either party has the right to break the agreement. The importance of this clause for the Amalgamated lies in the fact that in case industrial conditions are better next year, the Amalgamated will be able to win back for its members the few dollars wage reduction which they had to take now. This clause gives added weight to the victory of the Amalgamated, a victory which all of organized labor should welcome.</p>
