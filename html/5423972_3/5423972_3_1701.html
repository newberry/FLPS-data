   <p>A few weeks ago, we received a letter from Mr. Oscar Strauss, the former American ambassador to Constantinople, in which he tries to explain the attitude of Senator Harding to Louis D. Brandeis, when his confirmation by the Senate came up for vote. We also received a letter from a Reform rabbi of a minor congregation in the state of Iowa, in which he also assures us that Senator Harding is by no means hostile to the Jews, and that his voting against Brandeis has nothing to do with his attitude to the Jewish people. The rabbi goes on to say that since Senator Harding is rather a conservative man, and opposed to radicalism, he is opposed to Louis D. Brandeis because of his alleged radicalism.</p>
   <p>We understand that Senator Harding only recently confirmed this interpretation <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of his action in an interview granted to a Jewish woman, a most active worker in the Republican camp. But lately, we had occasion to learn the full story about Louis D. Brandeis' confirmation. We are informed by the most reliable source that Senator Harding, while speaking against the confirmation of Brandeis, had not even touched the question of his radicalism, but simply went on to say that he must vote against Brandeis because Brandeis is a Jew, and because as a Jew he would degrade and disgrace the United States Supreme Court. Senator Harding made the bold assertion that Jews are not fit for office because they commercialize it, and he was very much afraid lest Louis D. Brandeis should commercialize his high office too, by giving away the secrets of the Supreme Court. This is actually what Senator Harding had stated in the Senate Judiciary Committee about Brandeis and the Jews. Of course the Democratic Senators took issue with him and one of them said to Senator Harding that a United States Senator had no right to speak that way about the American Jews who are loyal to the country and government, and are law-abiding citizens.</p>

   <p>We are informed by a man whom we have no reason to doubt in his truthfulness and correctness of his confirmation. He was present in the Senate Judiciary Committee when Senator Harding made his great statement about Louis D. Brandeis and the Jews. This being the case, the Jews in the United States, whether bound up with the Democratic or the Republican party, face a very serious situation.</p>
   <p>We do not say that Senator Harding is an anti-Semitic propagandist, but if he holds such views on the Jews as he held five years ago--and we do not know that he has undergone a change of mind and heart in the meanwhile--it could not be said that he is a friend of the Jewish people. More than that--if he has not changed his mind, then he is an anti-Semite pure and simple. And no Jewish voter, whether liberal-minded or conservative, can possibly cast his ballot for an anti-Semitic candidate.</p>
   <p>America is the only hope for the Jewish people in all the countries of the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Diaspora. If the American government should be hostile to the Jews too, then all the people in Europe will be deprived of its only great friend and protector.</p>
   <p>In days to come we will need the sympathy and help of the American government. We may need its diplomatic help and moral help. However, if the chief magistrate of this mighty republic is hostile to the Jews, then its help cannot be forthcoming.</p>
   <p>We have also to bear in mind that a wave of anti-Semitism is rapidly spreading in this country. The only powerful agency to check it is the government. But if the head of the government is hostile to the Jews, no steps will be taken by the authorities in Washington to counteract the anti-Semitic movement in this country.</p>
   <p>One can thus readily see the dangers ahead of us if a man who has been outspoken <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>in his hostility to the Jews should become the president of the United States. Nor will American interests be served by an anti-Semitic president. What America needs most is a term of peace and rest to recuperate from the war, and to settle down to normal conditions. Anti-Semitism, however, is not checked in this restlessness and excitement all around.</p>
   <p>Of course, people will ask, "If it be true that Senator Harding is hostile to the Jews, why do such men as Oscar Strauss and Louis Marshall support him?" It may be that these men do not know what Senator Harding has actually said about the Jews, and about Louis D. Brandeis, and accept his explanation of the incident as the correct one. But it is also possible that they think that not much importance should be attached to such an utterance in a moment of excitement. Or it may be that they believe that while president, Senator Harding will be more conscientious and will do nothing that will hurt Jews. But why should we take chances when there is so much at stake?</p>

   <p>We know what President Wilson has done for the Jews. There isn't a Jew in the world who has not a reason to be grateful to President Wilson for what he has done for our people. We know that ninety per cent of all the Jews in Ohio voted for Governor Cox, and we know that they will all line up now for Governor Cox because of his outspoken friendliness to the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>We do not want to tell our readers how to vote, but a Jewish paper has a right and a duty to tell its readers the facts concerning the attitude of a candidate to the Jewish people. We leave it to the wisdom and consciousness of our readers to act as they please. We can only say again and again, since American interests are not at stake because Governor Cox is as much of a patriot as Senator Harding, that the Jews have a right to demand that the man whom we may help come in power, should not, at least, be hostile to the Jewish people. And since Senator Harding expressed his contempt for the Jewish people by asserting that they are not fit for office, we do not see how a Jew with a glimmer of Jewish intelligence can vote for him.</p>
