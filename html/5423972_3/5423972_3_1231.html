   <p>At a meeting of the board of directors of the Workers Cooperative Society, which operates two restaurants, the manager of one restaurant appeared demanding a raise of $2.00 per week for all workers, and $5.00 for himself, plus two weeks vacation. He threatened with a strike, if these demands meet refusal.</p>
   <p>The board of directors are not in favor of a strike, although they cannot pay more than their income permits. Nevertheless, a meeting will be held Saturday evening where a committee of the union to which the workers belong will be expected.</p>
