   <p>The Jewish market peddlers of Chicago are organizing an association to better their conditions.</p>
   <p>Of late they have had considerable trouble with merchants selling them potatoes and who, the peddlers claim, have been giving them short weight. When the peddlers protested, the owners of the potato markets refused to sell them merchandise.</p>
   <p>The market peddlers will meet Thursday evening, at the Jewish Institute, in order to adopt precautionary measures. They will attempt to buy their potatoes wholesale by carload. This will give them a cheaper price and they will, therefore, be able to sell their stock at a lower rate to their customers.</p>
