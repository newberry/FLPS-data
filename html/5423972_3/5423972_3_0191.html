   <p>The attention of the members of the Local 237, (Bakery Union), is called to the recently passed resolution that no member can work overtime, nor begin before the regular hour. This is to allow unemployed members of the Union to earn several days wages before the High Holidays. Any member disobeying the above regulations will be fined one day's wages, the money to go to the unemployed.</p>
