   <p>The last meeting of the United Jewish Alliance was very interesting even though there was a noticeable lack of delegate attendance.</p>
   <p>At this time we wish to call to the attention of the sixteen Jewish Trade Unions which are members here that their duty is to see that their representatives attend the meetings regularly and become interested in participating in all our work. It is desirable that each union put on its points of order for the evening, a special note regarding the Alliance. We believe that this is the most interesting, serious and important point that there is and in so doing your delegates will of necessity attend the meetings of the Alliance.</p>

   <p>Moreover, it is especially to the interests of every union belonging to the Alliance, to discuss each question, decision and activity of the Alliance, since each question is either a principle or a practical trade union subject, touching the needs of every union sooner or later.</p>
   <p>As previously mentioned, the meeting was very interesting. It appears that at no time has there been such a need for an Alliance as at the present time. We regret the lack of forces to carry on the work and tasks that are so necessary to be woven into the practice of our lives. For this reason alone it is important that each union sees to it that its delegate attend our meetings and take an active part in our work.</p>
   <p>On the agenda of the Alliance, (that means work that must be done), there is, besides the organizing of the tailoring workers and helping to strengthen the already existing unions, the quarrels to be settled between the Independent Painters Union and the Brotherhood Painters Union, and those between the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Progressive Cigar Makers' Union and the International Cigar Makers' Union that must sooner or later be given our utmost attention. Now there is more trouble between the United Boot and Shoe Workers' Union and the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union. The former is an independent order, an opposing union to the latter which is affiliated with the Federation of Labor. Then again there is the strengthening of the Weavers and Fur Makers' Unions that were founded by the Alliance which feels it is duty bound to support them. Then there is the Barbers' Union also founded by the Alliance, which is having trouble in securing a charter from the International body. The Jewish Barbers, also ask the Alliance if they should, for instance, place signs in all union barber shops to help them gain their stand with the bosses, etc. This is all work that must be done. Then there is the trouble in the Bakers' Union concerning a bakery. There is a strike, but even worse than <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the strike and its lengthy duration, is that this bakery boss from the Douglas Park neighborhood, has a scab shop and puts false labels on his wares. The Alliance is doing everything in its power to do away with this.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to mention everything being done by the Alliance. Every point is interesting and important. The only thing lacking is more energy in every sense of the word. The delegates must attend meetings and participate in the activities.</p>
