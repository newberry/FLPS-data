   <p>Last night, at a huge mass meeting in Schoenhoffens Hall, the Chicago cloakmakers unanimously accepted the new agreement that the four locals of the cloakmakers union had made with the manufacturers' association. Few changes were made in this new agreement. The cloakmakers, however, will receive a substantial raise in wages.</p>
   <p>According to this new agreement, which goes into effect July 1, all classes of cutters will get a raise of four dollars per week. According to this scale, the minimum wages of a cutter will be $31.50 a week, and the maximum wages, $34.50 per week.</p>
   <p>Trimmers, class A, will receive a raise of three dollars and fifty cents a week; trimmers, class B, will get a raise of two-fifty; and sample makers and button-hook sewers will also receive a raise of two-fifty a week.</p>

   <p>Finishers will get five cents more per hour than they received last season. Jacket makers will get ten cents more per bundle, which will amount to a raise of about four dollars and ninety cents per week.</p>
   <p>Under pressers [pressers of linings, pockets, etc.] and skirt pressers will get five cents more per hour. The working hours remained as they were--forty-nine hours per week.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ben Schlessinger, president of the International Ladies Garment Workers of America, read the points of the agreement. He declared that this was the best agreement that he had ever concluded with any manufacturers, especially when one considers the proportionately large wage increase that the workers are receiving, and the fact that both sides were able to reach an agreement without having recourse to an arbitration committee.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: This article was translated because the clothing industry, <span class="page-break">3</span>especially at that time, was almost wholly in the hands of Jews, both as regards the manufacturers and workers. It could almost have been called a Jewish national trade, in America.]</p>
