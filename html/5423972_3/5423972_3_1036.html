   <p>The [Hebrew school] of the [Marks Nathan] Orphan Home has settled its strike with the union, and has granted the union all of its demands--even the demand that the teachers be paid back wages for the period of the strike. [This settlement is expecially significant] in view of the fact that three presidents of Hebrew schools [that are now engaged in a strike with the teachers' union] are very influential in the Agudah [the rabbinical association of Orthodox rabbis], which, through its president and secretary, controls the affairs of the [orphan home]. By "conquering this fortress," upon which the three presidents placed their chief hopes [of preventing a union victory], the union broke through the enemy front lines. Undoubtedly, other "forts" will be captured in quick succession.</p>
   <p>We understand that the Winchester school is making an arrangement with the union to settle [the strike]. Furthermore, the shameful mistreatment of the teachers by the presidents has been stopped through the intervention of the parents.</p>
   
   <p>They, together with several prominent rabbis, have called a protest meeting at the Educational Alliance. The parents and the rabbis object to the attitude of the presidents who keep the Hebrew schools closed because they refuse to raise the salaries of the teachers.</p>
   <p>The stand taken by the [Jewish] Federation of Orthodox Charities on this labor issue was discussed at the last meeting of the [teachers'] union. The teachers concluded that, if the charities continued to support the presidents' position, the union would be able to secure the withdrawal of many affiliated organizations of the federation from the charities.</p>
