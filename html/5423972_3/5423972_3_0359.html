   <p>There is much disturbance and discontent in the ranks of the tailor industry, especially among the pressers.</p>
   <p>The pressers all of a sudden woke up to the realization that they are the real princes of the tailor trade. It may be piece goods of a cheap quality or it may please the operator to do his work on a garment to suit himself, but the pressing of a suit must be done in a first-class manner. Pressing is the brightest piece of work on a suit, so that the beautifying of the garment lies in the hands of the presser. So, he asks this fair question: Why should he be the tail-end of the tailor trade and be treated differently from any other worker in the trade? When he gets burned with a hot iron, it is his hard luck, but why is his pay less than other workers in the same trade? So the pressers are determined not to let this pass them up, and that no such further treatment will be tolerated. There is a movement on foot among the pressers to the effect that, at the next agreement with the bosses, <span class="page-break">\2</span>they will demand pay by the week instead of piece work. With this in view, eighty pressers have met and discussed plans on how to better their living conditions. At the end of the meeting, it was decided to organize an amalgamated presser's club. The object of this club is to discuss ways and means, and plans whereby to formulate new ideas and accomplishments for the good of this branch of the tailor trade. The leaders of this new organization intend to get to work at once and, most of all, to inform its members of the necessity of a club or local of this kind. We urge every presser in the new local to be present at all meetings so that we may discuss our problems. There is no doubt that the organization will be a success, for, when the pressers begin to work and do something, everything will be pressed out accordingly.</p>
