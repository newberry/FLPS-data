   <p>The Golden Lodge, No. 44, Order Knights of Joseph, at its last meeting, unanimously endorsed Jacob M. Arvey for alderman of the Twenty-fourth Ward. Mr. Arvey is an active member of the Lodge, a young Jewish man with many qualifications that make him the most suitable man for the office which he seeks. We expect all of our members, as well as every Jewish citizen of the Twenty-fourth Ward, to vote for him and to induce their friends to do likewise.</p>
