   <p>Since the war broke out and immigration into this country ceased, we have begun to feel a shortage of labor. In all branches of industry, and particularly in agriculture this shortage has been felt. The railroads are simply crippled for lack of help. Farmers have been struggling with the problem of whether or not to increase their production of crops fearing that during harvest [time] they will be unable to obtain enough help and the crops will rot. Factories, munition plants, and shipyards, constantly keep crying that they are short of help.</p>
   <p>Yet, despite this labor shortage, there are tens of thousands of people parading the streets of our cities without jobs. How can this be explained? Why are there so many idle workers at a time when there is a scarcity of labor?</p>
   <p>Perhaps it can be explained by the irregularity of employment, by the fact that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>workers roam from one industry to another because of ill treatment [at the hands of the employers]. Such treatment has robbed many workers of the ambition and energy to work to such a degree that they would rather do nothing than work for an employer.</p>
   <p>Capital has deeply humiliated Labor; has robbed it of its soul, and has made of the worker an insignificant cog in the machine. It is now beginning to realize its error and is looking for ways and means to rectify it. However it is always difficult to correct an error at the last moment, and so mere repentance at this time will do little good. At the present time this country is sorely in need of skilled labor. But the question arises: What has Capital done to encourage one to become a skilled worker? Quite to the contrary, King Capital has held sway in such a manner as never to permit the subordinate, in order to drain him of his last ounce of strength, and then to cast him away like a useless husk.</p>

   <p>In Europe, Capitalism was not as well developed and Labor was not robbed of its soul. Hence a great number of the working class developed into skilled workers. And when these skilled workers came to our shores and built up our great industries, it was not they who received the credit, but their employers, those rich idlers who enjoy all the luxuries, all the blessings of the land at the expense of their workers. But no more workers are coming here from Europe. And so we have suddenly begun to realize our predicament. Our industries are dependent mainly upon workers from Europe.</p>
   <p>The hundreds of thousands of American workers are of so low a caliber that the employers prefer to draw upon the immigrants. The reason for such a low standard of skill among the American worker is that he has not been reared in the spirit of labor, and in the field of work in which he was employed, the American worker was but a cog in the machine; in other words, he did only one part of the job but had no idea about the rest of it. This evidently instilled in him no love for his work, nor any loyalty to it. On the contrary, it <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>developed in him a dislike for it, and even a sense of nausea. And at the first opportunity he would leave the factory entirely.</p>
   <p>And the American worker who remains in the factory usually strives to become a foreman, or a straw boss, a slave driver. And, thanks to his knowledge of the English language, he usually succeeds. But the time has now come when the American worker has been put to the test. The country is in need not of slave drivers, but skilled workers who understand the spirit of their work. We need now producers not parasites, people who shall be able to work themselves in such time of need.</p>
   <p>This is probably one of the most important problems of the day. We cannot depend on immigration from Europe. We must bear in mind the fact that after the war, Europe will be in need of skilled workers. And aside from the high wages and respect that labor will receive there, the respective governments will apply the most stringent regulations to prevent the emigration of labor.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Nor can we rely on miracles. We must therefore develop a generation of skilled workers in the various fields of labor. Then this country will need fear no scarcity of labor in time of need. No vagrancy laws will be needed, for there will probably be very few vagrants.</p>
