   <p>When discussing the West Side wards, we must begin with the Twentieth. The Twentieth Ward, as it is today, is by no means the privileged ward it used to be. The number of its voters is the smallest of all wards, and the quality of the voters is not held in as high esteem, shall we say, as that of the average voter on the West Side.</p>
   <p>Moreover, the Twentieth Ward is no longer what it was formerly called--the Jewish ward. The fact is that there are more Jewish voters in each of the wards which are designated as the Tenth, the Fifteenth, the Eighteenth, and the Thirty-fourth. Nevertheless, the Twentieth Ward still lives up to its past reputation. Especially when they want to give it a swift kick, do they dub the Twentieth a Jewish ward.</p>
   
   <p>And in this Twentieth Ward, politics is carried on in the old-fashioned way. The candidates appeal to the emotions of the voters in such a manner as to nauseate a sophisticated person. But in the Twentieth Ward there are no sophisticated people, and the politicians always run wild.</p>
   <p>In this election, in which that old veteran alderman and politician of the Twentieth Ward, Henry L. Fick is running for office, the campaign is beind conducted in the identical manner of eighteen years ago. They [the politicians] promise each voter all sorts of jobs--the possible and the impossible kind--for either himself or his relatives; they promise the owners of the cafes that they will be allowed to operate twenty-four hours a day; they promise the saloon keepers that they can always keep wide open; they promise the peddlers that will not have to buy a license; and the storekeepers that they will not need to pay any taxes. If Henry L. Fick should be elected, them no citizen of the Twentieth Ward need worry about earning a livelihood. The city will take care of that. His fellow candidate, Franz Mat, is running on the same big-hearted platform. Promises are not being skimped.</p>
   <p>By the will of God, a young Jewish lawyer is running against these two candidates, and it goes without saying that whenever a Jewish candidate runs, his opponents--the non-Jewish candidates--always have plenty of material about which to speak. Let our aristocrats agitate against internationalism as much as they please; the fact remains that every time a Jewish candidate runs for office his non-Jewish opponent is in the habit of dragging the Jewish question into the political arena. "I licked the sheenie to a frazzle," exclaimed a non-Jewish candidate to his wife over the telephone, after he had been elected alderman over his Jewish opponent. But when a campaign reaches the boiling point, then the Jewish candidate must justify his candidacy, not only because his ancestors "crucified" God's only Son but also because Bailes was not found guilty in Kiev.</p>
   
   <p>The present campaign in the Twentieth Ward differs not at all from previous campaigns. Halls are rented, and speeches are made in which it is shouted: "Do you want to turn Chicago into a Jerusalem? Do you want to surrender the City Hall to Jewish Candidates who will serve Kosher meals there?" And there are other similar foul jokes which please the average non-Jewish voter of the Twentieth Ward.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that such arguments are advanced only in the non-Jewish districts. In the Jewish districts, however, the arguments take on quite a different character. The non-Jewish candidate defends the glory of the Jews, and brands the Jewish candidate who does not observe Judaism as a goy [literally, Gentile; here used as reproach to irreligious Jew]. To elect such a person, he says, would be a disgrace to world Jewry; Jewish voters should bury this sort of Jewish candidate under such a tremendous avalanche of votes that he not only would be unable to arise on the day of Resurrection but also would never again have the insolence to run for office.</p>
   <p>What does the Jewish candidate do in such circumstances? Like a child who is attacked by a mad dog, he seeks refuge behind his mother's apron. He realizes that his mother is too weak to stave off the mad dog, yet his heart tells him that his mother will at least do everything within her power to save him, if that is at all possible. The Jewish candidate knows that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the Christian appeals to his "brethren" to vote against the "Christ-killer", the Jewish candidate appeals to his "brethren" to vote against the "Jew-baiter", and the result is that a political campaign is transformed into a controversy between Jew and Christian over religion and nationalism. It is an abominable result, but this is a campaign in the Twentieth Ward.</p>
   <p>In the present aldermanic campaign in the Twentieth Ward, a young Jewish lawyer, Abe Kretsky, is running for alderman, and he is now the target at which all arrows are being aimed. Although his Judaism is not as strict as that of orthodox Jews for his non-Jewish apponents to taunt him with all the sins committed by Jews, beginning with the sin of the golden calf. And on account of him, his fellow candidate on the aldermanic ticket, Hugo L. Pitta, who is not a Jew, also suffers.</p>
   
   <p>He is called a worthless Christian because he is running with a Jew, against a bona fide Christian. And another thing: Last year he helped to elect a Jew running for the office of alderman against a non-Jew.</p>
   <p>The Jewish candidate has the characteristics of his race, and say what you will, these young Jewish men, born and brought up in America, who think that as Americans they need not be Jews, find out when they come in contact with Americans that they are Jews; consequently, they return to the fold. Mr. Abe Kretsky has just found out what thousands before him have learned and what thousands after him will discover. As a candidate, he opened his campaign in true Jewish fashion by donating a large sum to the Moes Chitim [a fund for the needy], and prevailed upon his colleague, Hugo L. Pitta, also to contribute to Moes Chitim. He [the Jewish candidate] becomes interested in conditions in the Jewish neighborhoods, and holds on tight to his mother's apron-strings.</p>
   <p>This is campaigning in the Twentieth Ward. A little farther west, in the Tenth Ward three candidates are running: a Democrat, James McNichols; a Republican, Albert Russ; and an independent, Joseph V. Cermak. The ward is strongly Democratic, and as they say in the lingo of politics, the Republicans don't stand a chance. The real battle is between Mr. McNichols and Mr. Cermak.</p>
   <p>Mr. McNichols is a "Northerner" and Mr. Cermak is a "Southerner," that is to say, Mr. McNichols has lived, for a number of years in the northern part of the ward and Mr. Cermak in the southern part of the ward. Thus we have a new war between the "North" and the "South".</p>
   <p>Jews are want to believe that only among themselves do there exist rival camps, such as are formed by the Jews of the West Side and the Jews of the South Side. Actually, however, such divisions are also to be found among the Christians.</p>
   <p>For a number of years Mr. McNichols was secretary to Judge Tom Scully, and he devoted his time to doing favors to every resident in his ward. By and large, he was, like Judge Tom Scully, a "good boy". He was always being called on for help, and whether it was day or night, hot or cold, he was immediately on the spot to render his services.</p>
   <p>Among his neighbors his name is sacred and dear. His friends say that if Jim now becomes alderman the office will be a pleasing reward for the favors that he has been doing gratis to everybody for such a long time, and that as alderman he will have more influence and do more favors.</p>
   <p>The inhabitants of the north side of the ward have another favorite argument. Their contention is that since every ward is represented by two aldermen one of these should be chosen from the southern part and the other from the northern part. Therefore Jim McNichols should be elected in order to represent the northern part.</p>
   <p>We must also not forget that the northern part is mostly populated by Jews.</p>
   
   <p>Now when a Jew from the Tenth Ward needs something at the City Hall, he goes to Jim McNichols, and Jim has to take him to the [Jewish] alderman on the south side. But if Jim is elected, all this trouble will be avoided.</p>
   <p>These are the most pertinent questions of the day, which are outstanding in the campaign in the Tenth and Twentieth wards.</p>
