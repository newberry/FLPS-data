   <p>The ladies hat frame makers will meet today to organize a union in their trade. The meeting will take place at 1145 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
   <p>Operators, wirers, and pressers are called upon to come to this meeting as the conditions in this trade are unbearable. The seasons are short and the wages are small, so it is about time to organize the trade. Organizer Schneid will address this meeting and help in the organizing work.</p>
   <p>Every worker in the trade---Please come on time.</p>
