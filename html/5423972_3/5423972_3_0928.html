   <p>Ladies Tailors are on Strike at Mme. Marguerite's Shop.</p>
   <p>Ladies Tailors Union, Local 104, a strike is in progress in Mme. Marguerite's ladies tailoring shop at 618 S. Michigan Ave. because this concern refused to employ 3 lady members of the union.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago a short strike took place at this shop, to force the owner to employ the 3 girls who are members of the union. She granted that request. After the girls started to work she made every possible effort to make conditions miserable for them until it was unbearable. The union was then forced to call a second strike in the shop.</p>
   <p>This same Mme. has two more shops which employ many women who are not union members. The union is striking to force the owner to put these three girls back to work.</p>
