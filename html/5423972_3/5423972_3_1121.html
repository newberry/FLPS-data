   <p>The Progressive Cigar Makers Union, which developed strong forces in unorganized shops, is now maintaining strikes in the following three places:</p>
   <p>Peter, Wall, and Comstock, Madison and Laflin Streets, where the workers are demanding higher wages and improved conditions; Jupiter Cigar Factory, or Richman Brothers, Lake and Paulina Streets, where the demands are the same; and Bennett and Martenetz, 335 W. Madison Street, where the requirements are of another nature, such as the reinstatement of twenty-five workers whose sole offense lie in the fact that they were good union members.</p>
