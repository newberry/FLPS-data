   <p>Yesterday the Jewish Bakers Local 237 proved its power. Yesterday the Union demonstrated to all the bakers that sincerity and solidarity are the foundations of a Labor organization.</p>
   <p>The Bakers Union notified the bosses through the Forward that the workers will stop working if the Union-agreement will not be signed. As soon as this decision reached the bosses, they came to the Union-office and signed the agreement, with the exception of a few small bosses, who will sign today. The agreement was signed with all conditions demanded by the Union and the same wages as the last agreement that expired at 12-midnight. The Jewish Bakers Union deserve congratulations for their unity. The big bosses as well as the small bosses who belong to the Association have seen that they cannot take up any battle with the Jewish-Bakers Local. Therefore, they picked the best way out and signed the Union-Agreement, and saved themselves a lot of grief and trouble.</p>
