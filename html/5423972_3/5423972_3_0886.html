   <p>Fifty butcher-workers, members of Local 484 of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher-Workers of America, went out on strike yesterday at the Kosher Star Sausage Company, 1006 Maxwell Street.</p>
   <p>The reason for this strike was that the Kosher bosses cut 20% of the Workers' wages.</p>
   <p>A short time ago the bosses of the Kosher Star Company notified their Workers that they will cut 10% of their pay. The Workers considered this and decided to grant the bosses this request, until times would change, and then they would demand the original wages again; but the bosses, clever business people, instead of cutting 10% from the dollar, took off 10 cents from every hour, which amounts to 18% to 20% from the dollar. This, the workers refused to accept, as it would be impossible to get along on such small pay. The Amalgamated Meat Cutters therefore declared a strike and asked all right-thinking people to <span class="page-break">2</span>help the striking butcher workers, and buy meats and sausages from firms employing Union-labor.</p>
