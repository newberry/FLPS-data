   <p>With great enthusiasm, thousands of members of the Amalgamated yesterday responded to the call of its leaders, and with great pride, adopted resolutions calling for the raising of a large defense fund.</p>
   <p>On one day's notice, fifteen hundred cutters assembled yesterday in the large West Side Auditorium, and with many cheers for their organization, pledged $25000 for the defense fund of the organization.</p>
   <p>President Reese, of local 61, opened the meeting and explained the object of the gathering. He then introduced the speakers: S. Rissman, Sam Levin, and Frank Rosenbloom. The Amalgamated speakers did not have to do much agitating to evoke a response from the cutters, for they came to notify the organization that they are ready and willing to contribute whatever is necessary for the protection of the organization.</p>
   <p>The recommendation of the $25,000 assessment of the members was accepted with</p>
   
   <p>great applause.</p>
   <p>It was also reported at this meeting that the cutters of Ederheimer and Stein did not wish to wait for yesterday's meeting and had already paid their assessment.</p>
   <p>The cutters cannot take credit for contacting the tailors, for the simple reason that the tailors at Hart, Schaffner and Marx, paid in $1300 for the fund a day before the resolution was passed at the meeting in the Ashland Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The tailors had assembled in the same large Auditorium. Sidney Rissman was chairman. He explained to the workers that they are called upon to determine the question of the raising of the defense fund, and that everyone should contribute according to his weekly earnings. The first speaker was Comrade Krisitski, the general organizer of the Amalgamated. He by his strong appeal, so inspired the audience that the applause lasted several minutes.</p>
   <p>Comrade Levine, manager of the joint board, gave the audience a short talk in</p>
   
   <p>which he explained that it is needless to tell the members of the importance of protecting the interests of the organization, for they already know the value of organization protection.</p>
   <p>When Sidney Hillman entered the hall, the members greeted him with a thunderous ovation showing the utmost respect for him.</p>
   <p>After the members rendered their decision, by accepting the recommendation of the assessment for the defense fund, the chairman introduced Mr. Hillman, who delivered a short address. He said that he hoped the manufacturers are at last convinced that hereafter, the tailors will have the right to organize and that the 44 hour work-week will stand. This was a second positive statement which the listeners applauded with great pride, realizing the importance of protection.</p>
   <p>In conclusion he expressed his hopes that all members will stand organized, and united with the officers, who are handling the affairs of the organization to the best interests of its members.</p>
