   <p>Yesterday's sessions of the Amalgamated [Clothing Workers Union] convention showed the true spirit of the Amalgamated, its belief in its own strength, its proud realization of the fact that as an independent, powerful organization, it would not permit any reactionary forces to control it.</p>
   <p>The spirit of the Amalgamated delegates was shown in their attitude to the Forward, which, not so long ago, played the role of a traitor in the Harry Cohen affair in New York, an affair which nearly brought a civil war to the Union. The members of the Amalgamated also remembered the shameful behavior of the Forward in conducting a "boycott of silence" against Joseph Schlossberg, general secretary of the Union and one of its chief pillars. The spirit <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>animating the delegates was shown when the Forward editor, Abe Cahan, arrived at the convention to deliver a speech of greeting. A few delegates who remained true to the Forward machine, made an attempt to create a demonstration for Mr. Cahan when he ascended the platform, but their attempt was unsuccessful. Those delegates jumped up from their seats and began to applaud frantically, but the remaining hundreds of delegates remained calmly in their seats.</p>
   <p>Abe Cahan defends himself</p>
   <p>Sidney Hillman, international president of the Amalgamated, introduced Mr. Cahan as the editor of a newspaper that "once upon a time" helped the Amalgamated. Mr. Cahan tried to defend himself and to justify the shameful attitude that he and his newspaper had assumed in the Harry Cohen affair. Mr. Cahan claimed that the position taken was in the interests of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Amalgamated, although he admitted that he could not explain how it was in the interests of the Amalgamated. Mr. Cahan did not say anything about the "boycott of silence" which his newspaper is conducting against Mr. Schlossberg. Mr. Cahan concluded his speech by saying that the Forward had always helped the Amalgamated to carry out its union rules and that it would continue to do so in the future. When Mr. Cahan concluded his speech, Mr. Hillman made the following brief declaration: "Not only are we willing and able to execute our own laws, but we also have the power to do so." The delegates greeted this declaration with prolonged and stormy applause, which indicated that they fully agreed with the statement of their president.</p>
   <p>The convention actually became organized yesterday when the credentials committee turned in its report on the number of delegates at the convention and its recommendations. According to the report, which was delivered by Mr. Jacob Patowsky, assistant general secretary-treasurer of the Union, two <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>hundred and sixty-five delegates were present at the convention, all of whom were approved, with the exception of two delegates, Bernstein of local and Jacob Cohen of local 162. The recommendation of the committee was adopted unanimously and the convention started to organize the various committees which will be entrusted with the whole work of the convention.</p>
   <p>The following committees were organized: an educational committee, chaired by D. Genis of the Minneapolis-St. Paul Joint Board; a committee on rules, with M. McKay of Chicago as chairman and Samuel Rudin of Baltimore as secretary; an organizational committee with Morris Weinstein of New York as chairman and Morris Kozlowsky of Philadelphia as secretary; a committee on official reports--Joseph Gold of New York, chairman and Reuben Block of Chicago, secretary; a resolutions committee--Jacob Krall of Chicago, chairman and Morris Brown of Chicago, secretary; a committee on various affairs--David Wolf of Montreal, chairman.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>About a hundred resolutions were brought to the convention and all were turned over to the resolutions committee. The most important resolutions demand the recognition by the United States of the Soviet government, the freeing of all political prisoners, unity in the needle trades industry, and the establishment of [a system of] unemployment insurance.</p>
   <p>Schlossberg's Report Applauded</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Schlossberg's report to the convention dealt with the activities of the Amalgamated for the past two years, since the Boston convention. The delegates gave Mr. Schlossberg a stormy ovation as a demonstration of their love, devotion, and appreciation. Mr. Schlossberg, in his report, spoke of the great general strike which the Amalgamated had recently conducted. He pointed out the fact that the Union had issued a call for a million dollar strike fund and had received two million thirty-six thousand dollars.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Mr. Schlossberg declared that after a long, drawn-out fight the Union was compelled to agree to a wage reduction, but it did not surrender its principles, which won for it the approval of the organized labor movement of America. Even the Bolshevik government sent a greeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schlossberg told about the building activities of the Amalgamated, about the temples it was erecting, and the banks it was planning to establish. He congratulated the Chicago Amalgamated members, who will be the first in the history of this powerful organization to own their own bank.</p>
   <p>Milwaukee's Mayor Greets Convention</p>
   <p>Daniel Hoan, the mayor of Milwaukee, who came specially to greet the convention, received a stormy ovation at yesterday's session. "We expected you to hold <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>your convention in Milwaukee, but since you disappointed us, I have come to you," said Mr. Hoan. "I greet you in the name of the city of Milwaukee and invite you all to come and visit us. I assure you that everything which Milwaukee has, will be at your service. As mayor of Milwaukee I invite you to come to visit me at the city hall, where you will be truly welcome guests."</p>
   <p>Speeches of greeting were given by Captain Paxton Hibben, American representative of the Russian Red Cross, E. Nickels, secretary of the Chicago Federation of Labor, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, in the name of the Sacco and Vanzetti Defense League, and Miss [Lillian] Herstein, of the Chicago Teachers' Federation.</p>
   <p>The convention unanimously decided to send a telegram of greeting to the convention of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, now being held in Cleveland.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Mr. Olgin, editor of the Freiheit, will greet the convention at this morning's session.</p>
   <p>Last night, all the delegates were the guests of the Chicago Amalgamated, which had arranged a brilliant ball at the Municipal Pier.</p>
