   <p>After all negotiations for a peaceful settlement materialized into hot air, four hundred Jewish bakers walked out of the shops yesterday and began the fight for an eight-hour working day, the recognition of bakers' helpers, and other demands which are stated in the agreement.</p>
   <p>The master bakers agreed to submit to a decision handed down by an arbitration committee about the hours and bakers' helpers. The union however, was forced to reject the plan, because an arbitration board will not justify the demands of the helpers, who are considered the essence of a union.</p>
   <p>It is said that the bread drivers endorse the strike. Their agreement terminates tomorrow.</p>
