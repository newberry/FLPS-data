   <p>The strike of the workers in the tailoring concern of Kupenheimer &amp; Co. was settled at a conference by representatives of the Amalgamated Union and the company.</p>
   <p>The workmen have secured almost everything they demanded; the recognition of shop committees, the prices they set in different sections, and a forty-four hour working week.</p>
   <p>"The strike lasted a long time but the workmen are returning to their labors victorious," said Frank Rosenblum, the chief organizer of the Amalgamated in Chicago. "We were certain of victory, because never have we been so strongly united as at the present time. This in itself explains why we conquered such strong fortresses as Kupenheimer; Alfred, Decker, and Cohen; and others."</p>
