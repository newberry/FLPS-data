   <p>It will be good tidings to many friends of the co-operative movement, to hear about the success of the Co-operative Labor Society. The Co-operative house and restaurant at 1129 Ashland boulevard now stands on a secure foundation. Some time ago, the Board of Directors worked up a plan, which was approved at the general membership meeting. The Society will now open a second restaurant in the center of the Douglas Park district, at 3450 W. Roosevelt Road. The Board of Directors, at their last meeting, also adopted a plan to open grocery stations, where families will be able to purchase products at wholesale prices. It is planned to open this grocery the latter part of the month.</p>
   <p>The belief in wide co-operative activity is strong among the active workers of the society. It is necessary now that all workers who believe in the co-operative movement become members of the society. Five dollars is the price of one share. There are no other payments to be made.</p>
