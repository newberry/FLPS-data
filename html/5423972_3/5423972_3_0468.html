   <p>This building is the accomplishment of the last 18 years, declared Hillman, since the foundation for this beautiful temple was laid and it is a challenge to all enemies and the greatest symbol to all friends of the amalgamated. The building is built not only of brick, lime, and cement, but of the will struggle, and devotion of the members who sacrificed themselves for their organization.</p>
   <p>President Hillman expressed the wish that the members will accept this center, not only as their home, but will make this their spiritual and cultural center by means of which to spread their ideals in the Amalgamated spirit to help all workers in their struggles.</p>
