   <p>There is a lively discussion going on among the Chicago tailors and officials of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union about the surprising new development of last week. Last week the Chicago clothing manufacturers who are organized in an association and some of the bigger independent firms, like Kuppenheimer, Hart, Schaffner and Marx, notified in writing the Chicago Amalgamated Joint Board that they intend to demand a revision of the agreement regarding wages and other matters, which is a burden too difficult for them to bear and go on with clothing production.</p>
   <p>The present agreement between the Amalgamated and the Chicago clothing manufactures expires on May 1. Each party to it has the right, according to a legal clause in it to demand a revision of certain clauses in the agreement, by giving a written notice to the other party sixty days before the expiration <span class="page-break">2</span>of the agreement. The manufacturers were the first, in this case, to present a demand for a change in the agreement.</p>
   <p>The demand of the manufacturers will cause a strife between them and the Union. Among the clothing workers in Chicago the possibility of a strike in May is being seriously discussed. The workers cannot cope with the high cost of living at their present wages. They, therefore, not only oppose the lowering of their present wages but demand an increase.</p>
   <p>Among the workers there is a silent dissatisfaction with the leaders of the Amalgamated for being slow, for not being the first to present to the bosses demands of the workers for an improvement in their working conditions, for letting the bosses beat them to it in the presentation of demands. The workers, despite the heated discussions in which they engage and a slight dissatisfaction with their leaders, believe in the Union and have full confidence that their leaders will fight the demands of the manufacturers and will faithfully defend the interests of the thirty-three thousand <span class="page-break">3</span>tailors who are engaged in the clothing industry of Chicago.</p>
