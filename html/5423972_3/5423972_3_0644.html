   <p>The Joint Board of the Cloak-Makers Union signed an agreement, yesterday, for local 100, dress and skirt makers, with Philip Klafter, 229 Monroe St., skirt and dress manufacturers.</p>
   <p>The agreement was signed after J. Ginsberg,organizer of the Joint Board, negotiated with Mr. Klafter for a period of four weeks. Mr. Klafter agreed to a 44 hour week and a union scale. The reason for Mr. Klafter's signing a contract is that he was convinced that it does not pay to fight organized labor.</p>
   <p>The Joint Board is now carrying on a campaign to organize all dress and skirt workers and it is expected that within a few days, more contracts will be signed.</p>
