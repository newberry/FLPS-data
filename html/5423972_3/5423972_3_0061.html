   <p>Every Jewish union member should bear in mind the question of citizenship, and become an American citizen. It is a fact that the majority of Jewish union members have no citizenship papers. Thousands of Jewish workers, who have been here for years, have not found it important to become citizens; they just simply had no time to consider the value and importance of their political right in relation to other American citizens.</p>
   <p>The new laws with reference to immigration and naturalization have a direct bearing on labor unions. It may happen that in case of a strike a worker, arrested for picketing under a false accusation, is liable to raise the question as to whether his status as a citizen entitles him to be a union man. When a person obtains naturalization papers, the benefit is not only for himself but also for his family and his union.</p>
