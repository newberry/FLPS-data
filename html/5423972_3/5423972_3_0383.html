   <p>The Ice Peddlers Union of Douglas Park District held a meeting yesterday in Mr. Weiss' office, 12th and Halsted streets. Members of the Association of Ice Peddlers who observe the Sabbath were present. Following a lengthy discussion, it was decided that one union should embrace all ice peddlers, and should protect the peddlers who observed Sabbath by permitting them to work on Sunday.</p>
