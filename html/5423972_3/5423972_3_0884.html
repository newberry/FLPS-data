   <p>The Chicago Granite Cutters Union, which belongs to the Jewish Tomb-Stone Engravers Union, declared a strike against several employers who reduced their wages and who want to force the employees to work under the Landis'es Agreement.</p>
   <p>The Union urges anyone ordering monuments in Forest Park to inquire if Union help is employed there. If not, it is their duty to submit orders to a firm which engages Union workers.</p>
