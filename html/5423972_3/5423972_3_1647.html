   <p>Governor Jno. P. Altgeld, has deemed it prudent as well as equitable to pardon Fielding, Schwab, and Neebe. This act has taken many people by surprise, but it brought comfort and joy to the condemned families and their friends. The Governor has stated his reasons plainly even if he had to overhaul some of judiciary, bailiffs, jurors, and so forth, procedures. Whatever the motive may have been for the official act of pardoning the men, we believe that it is humane, and that the cause of justice will in no way suffer thereby.</p>
   <p>It has been sufficiently demonstrated that the United States is no field for anarchism. The laborers, workingmen, and proletariates have it in their power to change the policies, officers, and incumbents at stated elections. The laws of the land must be maintained!</p>
