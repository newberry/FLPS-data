   <p>In stormy and turbulent times, in times of crises, revolutions, and great upheavals, many people are inclined to tend toward radicalism--toward the radicalism of the left and the radicalism of the right. In stormy times almost everyone is an extremist. Such a situation is understandable. Yet if the two extremes were permitted to fight it out, and those who think calmly and are not hysterical, should refuse to interfere, then the struggle between the two extremes would lead to only on thing: to despotism and dark reaction. Should the extreme right triumph, reaction would gain control; should the extreme left triumph, anarchy and chaos would prevail. Anyone who wants to prevent such a tragic result of the struggle between the two extremes, must take the middle road, the road of liberalism and democracy.</p>
   <p>This year's election battle is not so much a struggle between Republicans <span class="page-break">2</span>and Democrats as it is a battle between reactionary bosses and radical ringleaders--a struggle between "black and red". The real opponents of Senator Harding are not the Democrats but the red and pseudo radicals. The bosses who stand behind Senators Harding, Penrose, Lodge, and Moses, represent reaction; they wish to establish the "good old order" of the good old days, when a clique of reactionary Senators dominated the administration in Congress and ruled as it pleased.</p>
   <p>The radicals of all shades are defending political doctrines and principles for which America is not ripe, and for which there will never be a place in America because the country will always be self-sufficient. Only in countries where industry destroys the farm, where agriculture is reduced to a minimum, and where it is necessary to import food, is there a possibility of radical economic changes. But in a country like America, that produces so much grain and which possesses so much raw material, there is no place for radical economic upheavals. Radicalism in America, where it is identified with Bolshevism and similar catastrophes, is an unhealthy <span class="page-break">3</span>phenomenon, just as the reactionary tendencies of the Republican bosses are unhealthy, because it is impossible to turn the wheel of history back. The unrest of the times, the urgency of the present moment make such unhealthy phenomena possible, but the calm, thinking citizens must not stand aloof and permit the extremist parties to rule the [political] field.</p>
   <p>Whereas the radicals of the right and of the left are grouped around the Republican bosses and the extreme leftists, of all sorts, the calm, thinking, and liberal citizens are grouped around the Democratic party with Governor Cox at the head. The Democratic party is the only party in America that represents the policy of the middle road. It is neither reactionary nor radical, and its program is evolutionary and progressive development, instead of reaction and revolution.</p>
   <p>The Democratic party wants to bring the ship of state into calm waters. It wants to prevent upheavals, which must lead to catastrophes; therefore, <span class="page-break">4</span>all calm, thinking citizens, who are not affected by hysteria, must rally around the Democratic party and help it win on November 2.</p>
   <p>Those who are following the trend of the present campaign have probably noticed that both extremist parties, instead of fighting one another, are concentrating their attack on the Democratic party because they know that only a victory of the Democratic party will destroy their reactionary or revolutionary plans. Never in the political history of America has the Democratic party been exposed to such a cross fire, as now. Never have such venomous arrows been hurled at the Democratic party as now, because it is, at the present time, the only party that represents the middle road. It stands in the way of both extremist parties, and is the only obstacle in the path of reaction or revolution.</p>
   <p>If either of the extremist parties should gain power, then the America government would cease to be a government of the people and for the people, and would become a government of a class and for a class. With <span class="page-break">5</span>the Republicans in power would come also the trust barons, the industrial magnates, and the great financiers. They would let the middle and working classes pay the taxes; they would throw all the burdens upon the poor people, and they themselves would be able to carry on a profiteering policy without hindrance.</p>
   <p>Should the radicals gain power, then only one class would rule--the "reds," which is not the working class. Of the millions of workers in Soviet Russia, only a quarter of a million are members of the Communist party.</p>
   <p>Only the Democratic party is willing and able to uphold the traditional America policy of a government of the people and for the people. Therefore, every calm, thinking citizen must go to the polls on November 2 and cast his vote for the Democratic candidate for president. He must vote for Governor Cox, who is the candidate of the middle road against reaction and revolution.</p>
