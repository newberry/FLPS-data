   <p>Very few people, would believe that at the present time, there is still a trade in which the workers are employed for 13 hours a day of labor for which they only earn starvation wages. The bushelmen's trade is in a very distressful condition. The clothing bushelman worker works from 8 in the morning until 9 in the evening, and his wages are hardly enough to keep body and soul together. The bushelman could manage to better his living conditions, providing he could get organized. Most of the energetic bushelmen have finally organized under the name of Clothing Bushelmen's Association. Isaac Diamond is the secretary of the new union. Its meetings are being held in the Workers' Institute. We hope that all non-union bushelmen will wake up from their slumber and join the union,and, being united and organized, they will not have any trouble, in elevating themselves to better living conditions.</p>
