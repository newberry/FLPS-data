   <p>At the Friday evening meeting of the Chicago Joint Board, Cloak, Suit, and Dress Workers Union, International Ladies Garment Workers Union, a resolution was adopted unanimously to condemn the Daily Jewish Courier for the lies that it published about the Union. The resolution reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Irresponsible and totally false statements were recently published in the Daily Jewish Courier; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We find it absolutely useless to protest against the action of this paper, and against the impudent conduct of its labor reporter because this newspaper is, and always was, as far as its general policy is concerned, against the interests of the workers; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We are certain that not one of our members or officers did, or will, give any statement to this reactionary paper; be it, therefore,</p>
   <p>"Resolved, By the Chicago Joint Board, Cloak, Suit, and Dress Workers Union, that we accuse this periodical of spreading false and irresponsible statements about our Union; and be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, To urge all our members not only not to make any statements to the reporter of this newspaper, but also to avoid any discussion in his presence.</p>
   <p>"Chicago Joint Board,</p>
   <p>"Cloak, Skirt, and Dress Workers Union,</p>

   <p>"Press committee,</p>
