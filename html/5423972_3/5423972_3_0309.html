   <p>At a meeting yesterday of the United Hebrew Trades, a cheerful report was listened to by a few unions. The delegates of the Brush Makers' Union reported that the bosses granted, without any struggle, their demands for a three or four dollar a week raise, sanitary conditions and the recognition of the union. The Shoe-Repairers reported about their well elaborated plan to ignore the Bosses Association and to negotiate with the bosses individually and most of the bosses have already signed a new agreement with a two dollars a week raise and shorter hours. The delegates urged the union to hasten the work of uniting with the Boot and Shoe Workers International Union. The delegates of the Rain-coat Makers' Union, Local 54, told how easy it was for them to negotiate a new agreement with the manufacturers for a raise of three or four dollars a week and shorter hours.</p>
