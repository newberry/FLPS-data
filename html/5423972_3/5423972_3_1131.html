   <p>Twenty-five thousand persons in Philadelphia and St. Louis wait with outstretched arms for your help, Chicago Jewish Workmen. It is 18 weeks now since about 5,000 cloak makers went on strike in Philadelphia and 11 weeks since about 4,000 cloak makers went on strike in St. Louis, and these together with their wives and children total about twenty-five thousand souls that hunger, freeze and suffer want, and appeal to the Chicago Jewish Workmen for aid.</p>
   <p>They appeal to you, not that you gather to make fine oratory, or offer sympathy; they need immediate succor, bread to quiet their hunger, coal to warm their freezing children and rent so that they might not be evicted.</p>

   <p>The Chicago United Jewish Alliance at their last meeting decided to appeal to the 16 unions represented by them as well as to all other workmen's organizations for this emergency relief. The Alliance has also prepared arrangements for a house-to-house collection. And now, all depends on you, the Jewish workmen, to heed this call voiced by 25,000 souls.</p>
   <p>Let each union, each workmen's organization and every individual answer by sending or bringing their due share to the Alliance. Every cent will be forwarded to the strikers. Every cent will go for this cause. This is guaranteed by the United Alliance.</p>
   <p>The unions, organizations and individuals who wish to participate in the work of this collection for Philadelphia and St. Louis strikers are asked to come each evening to the office of the Alliance, 1125 Blue Island Ave.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The house-to-house collection will take place Sunday, Nov. 23rd. We must have hundreds of persons for the committee. It is the duty of everyone to help in this task.</p>
   <p>We have received from the Barbers' Union a call to all barbers working in Chicago. We print this request with the hope that the barbers will see the necessity for uniting their common interests. Their position is a sad one and we cannot see why they do not organize, which would be the best way of improving their trade.</p>
   <p>For the Jewish Barber Workers the groundwork for a barbers' union has already been laid; it is only required that each barber come to render his aid.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Unfortunately, it is a grievous fact that the workman himself lives under the poorest circumstances and yet does not feel the need of awakening, the call to protest against his unnatural condition. He waits for others to accomplish these for him. Who could know or feel most the sad conditions of a barber's life? Could it be any worse? Just imagine, they must work 14 hours of the day. According to my knowledge it is not 14 hours but 24 hours, their entire lives are in slavery. When they reach home at 9 or sometimes 10 in the evening, where could they then go? They need rest and must soon go to bed so as to be able to work again the following day. Well, for example: Should a barber wish to belong to any cultural group whatsoever, would he be able to attend? Of course not. Not for nothing does the word circulate that a barber "is no sort of a person." But is the barber so cursed that he must so live all his years without any <span class="page-break">5</span>improvement? Or is the barber really so incapable that it is impossible to improve his condition one iota? No. We barbers are people like other workmen. We have the same forces as other workmen, we use the same combat methods as other workmen use but one thing was lacking. The awakening. That is what we needed.</p>
   <p>Unity - is might! That is our combat method by which we may secure better standards. Each person for himself is like the weak straw of the broom that even the weakest person can break. But when all the straws make up the broom? Then the strongest man cannot simply break them. - Thus every workman for himself is a weak being. But when he unites he is the strongest force in the world. And we barber workmen must also use this method. We must unite, not only on paper but in a strong united union that will be able at any time to defend our interests. We must have a union that will give us direct contact with the bosses, and shall indicate the conditions under which we shall work. Then, I am certain, we shall improve our trade, and show that even we barbers have become men.'</p>
   <p>Sincerely</p>
