   <p>The present garment workers strike not only has interested the Jewish West and North Sides of Chicago, but the entire Jewish element of the city is considerably wrought up over the strike situation. The public is very much in sympathy with the unfortunate strikers and is doing all it possibly can to help them and help their cause.</p>
   <p>On this coming Sunday, December 18th, the Lyric Theater will furnish a concert at 2 P. M. for the benefit of the strikers, which is being sponsored by the Garment Strikers Aid Society. Some of the most outstanding talented musicians will assist in making the benefit concert a success.</p>

   <p>A Northwest Side physician promised to donate double the amount of the intake of this concert. We think that it is the duty of every Jewish person, who knows the conditions and the plight of these needy workers to help all he possibly can and to induce the West Side physicians to do the same charitable act that this doctor on the Northwest Side did.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute is also planning to give a concert at 3 p. m. Sunday for the benefit of the needy striking workers. The number of distressed families will run into the thousands and it will take a large fund to help them all.</p>
