   <p>Those refugees who would not accept the work provided for them by the Relief Committee were asked to seek their quarters on Thursday. Those who were ejected collected about the building, and sought to effect an extrance by violence. The clamor became so great that the police were called on two occasions to clear the streets.</p>
   <p>All those that we were forced to eject have been with us between three and four weeks and they have made absolutely no move in spite of our appeals to them to help themselves. If those that we ejected show any disposition to accept employment or to help themselves we will be only too glad to give them all the assistance in our power.</p>
   <p>The disturbance occurred at the Relief Committee headquarters at 152 W. Twelfth Street.</p>
