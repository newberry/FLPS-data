   <p>In the present careful deliberations now going on between clothing workers and Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx, everyone hopes that it will be settled eventually without a strike; that the Joint Board of the various locals, as well as the representatives of the great clothing firm, will transact all disputes in a manner satisfactory to both, employers and employees. Both parties know that a strike is like a knife sharpened at both ends and regardless of how it is used, it must harm those who utilize it as a weapon.</p>
   <p>It stands to reason that this does not imply that the workers should, in order to avoid a strike, bow their heads and allow themselves to be trampled upon. This does not mean that they should surrender their justified demands to improve their lot in accordance with the development of industry in general - especially the clothing industry. One of the union demands, the minimum scale of nine dollars a week, is so <span class="page-break">\2</span>natural that it is unbelievable that the firm Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx will oppose it. The movement for a minimum scale of wages throughout the entire land is not a movement by labor only. It is a general movement and the employer who places himself in opposition to such a demand thereby stands outside of this stream of progress. He will not have the sympathy of the masses. And a strike against such an employer, without any question, should be called. Such an employer must go out of business; the sooner it happens, the better it will be for society as a whole.</p>
   <p>The tailors also demand that the Arbitration Committee should have more authority in matters concerning higher prices on section work. It should be understood that the Arbitration does not consist of people wanting to ruin the clothing industry in Chicago. And when the heads of the firm will convene with the Joint Board they will see the justification for this demand by the workers; this clause will certainly not be the cause of a strike.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The question of working hours can certainly be arbitrated. The workers are not robbers and only the question of recognizing the union remains. This is the only barrier between both parties. But it is of the utmost importance that this question be treated with cold, calm, and logical deliberation.</p>
   <p>The tailors are fortunate. The present Joint Board consists of people who are honest, devoted, and who understand the trade thoroughly. The clothing workers can rely entirely upon the Board to do their best under the prevailing circumstances. What the clothing workers should do is give their utmost loyalty to the leaders. The unanimous decision that the Joint Board has the full right to negotiate with Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx, and even to declare a strike is the first step on the right path. But it is merely one step.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The faith in the Joint Board should be so great, that not only should they be obeyed when declaring a strike, but also when summoning the employees back to work. The labor-struggle is war and woe unto the army that does not obey the commands of the officers.</p>
   <p>In the negotiations between Hart, Schaffner and Marx, many heated debates will take place and obstinacy will be present.</p>
   <p>The great masses will learn about everything taking place. And to our disgrace, we must confess that there will be irresponsible people who will seek to incite, disrupt, and speak with empty phrases in behalf of the workers. This is inevitable. This arrogant clique derives its livelihood from labor conflicts, but the worker should be aware of it and should not allow themselves to be misled. Their guide is one - the Joint Board. All eyes should be centered upon the Board and sooner or later, the Board will carry out the demands of the workers - and a living for them and their families will be assured.</p>
