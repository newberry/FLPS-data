   <p>The young Jewish Baker Drivers Union, won a victory without a strike. It is only a few months since the Jewish bakery drivers have organized. They have already scored a victory and deserve to be in line with the aggressive trade unions. When they presented their demands to the employers, it was thought that it would result in a strike, but the employers, as it appears, realized that the workers presented just demands, and they signed an agreement with the union, with the following conditions:</p>
   <p>1. Recognition of the Union.</p>
   <p>2. A raise in pay of 20 per cent.</p>
   <p>3. A six (6) day working week, excluding Saturday.</p>
   <p>4. No work Labor Day or May 1st.</p>
   <p>5. Pay for all Jewish Holy days.</p>
   <p>The Bakers Drivers Union deserve congratulations from all organized workers on their speedy victory.</p>
