   <p>Two more Hebrew Schools settling with the Teachers Union.</p>
   <p>The two large Montifiore Hebrew Schools on Miller and on Winchester St. have settled with the Union, granting all the demands of the teachers. This success ensures a final victory for the Union since these schools were the headquarters of the foes of the Union. Mr. Greenberg, the principal of the schools, is responsible for the delay in settling the strike. The methods which he used to do this were not very ethical. On the one hand, he would tell the presidents of the various boards that they should maintain the strike as long as possible in the certainty that the Union would be smashed; on the other hand, he would tell the teachers to go on striking and that the boards would be compelled to surrender to the Union.</p>
   <p>He also told the teachers to attack the scabs, which would have turned public opinion against them, but the teachers realized his partisanship and refused his advice. The principal, Mr. Greenberg received a twofold setback. First, the teachers know his character and hate him for it, and their devotion to their Union has strengthened; secondly, the presidents and the educational boards of the various Hebrew Schools are extremely angry with him for having dragged out the strike, and the damage the strike did.</p>
   <p>Some schools are still on strike. The parents of the affected children will stop paying to the Federated Charities unless they settle with the Union; the answer has been that the Charities don't care if the entire Northwest Side will stop their payments. But this attitude certainly will change when the directors of the Charities discover that they are losing in membership. This will force them to compel the schools, even the Grenshaw School, to settle.</p>
