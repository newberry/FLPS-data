   <p>Mr. Weitzman, proprietor of a building at 1509 S. Lawndale, Ave., demanded a $5.00 raise per month of each tenant. The tenants united and declared a strike. All agreed upon either facing eviction or paying the regular monthly rent.</p>
   <p>During this strike, the legislature passed a bill which was not too amicable to the landlords. (bill not mentioned here) Therefore Mr. Weitzman decided to drop the $5.00 raise and remain on friendly terms with the tenants as before.</p>
