   <p>In accordance with a decision made at its last meeting, the United Hebrew Trades will not succor the unemployed. We would probably not comment on this decision because the United Hebrew Trades has practically done nothing anyway in regard to the unemployed. It has neither raised money nor permitted anyone to cooperate with the committee (except Mr. Shapiro, secretary). So naturally, there is nothing new in its attitude. Nevertheless, we maintain that it is unwise of the United Hebrew Trades to remove this matter from its agenda. It is true that at present it can do very little, but it certainly could do something for the future. The United Hebrew Trades could have introduced this question to the unions which are represented there, and make it a part of a trades union question.</p>
   <p>If a union defends the interests of the workers against their employers, why should it not also protect them in slack time? Is unemployment less important to workers than a strike? Why shouldn't the unions have unemployment funds just as they have strike funds? It would naturally involve more dues, but if the workers would realize that this would alleviate their conditions in slack time, they would gladly pay such assessments.</p>
   <p>If the unions would do this, union men would be much better off; at least they would not have to stand the humiliation of appealing to the public. The question is of utmost importance and should be given serious thought by the unions.</p>
