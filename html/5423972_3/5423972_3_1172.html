   <p>Notice: To all Jewish Painters of Chicago Local 521. No Jewish Painters should go to work for any boss who has not signed the new agreement with the conference committee.</p>
   <p>We also announce that all the locals in the brotherhood are united in striking for 60 cents an hour. Steer clear of all shops that are out on strike, and avoid paying the penalty. Local 521 has established head quarters at 732 Madison St. where all members of this local are asked to report. Those who are not working can get jobs by applying at our head quarters.</p>
