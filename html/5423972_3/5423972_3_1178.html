   <p>When life answers perplexing questions. - The injunction against the parquet workers. - How they reacted to it.</p>
   <p>It happens very often when an important communal problem arises and calls forth differentiations and debates regarding that problem, something else happens, in a different place, although on a smaller scale, and clearly answers or solves the first problem and proves at the same time how necessity answers, sometimes, puzzling problems of great importance, without plunging into difficult theories of one sort or another. The problem is thus crystalized and is immediately solved in such manner that anybody can then point his finger at it and recognize it.</p>
   <p>Such an answer was given, the other day, on the question of injunctions against workers in Chicago. The injunction was given at the same time when Messrs. Gompers, Mitchel, Morrison, and other leaders held a conference with President Taft about the same question on injunctions. They presented their grievances before the President, and when they got through, the President replied that he can only do as much as it would not interfere with the general interests of the country, or antagonize one group against the other. But life answers all problems, no matter how difficult they should be, very easily and effectively.</p>
   <p>Our readers know perhaps by now that a strike among the parquet workers has been going on for almost two months. The strike has been bitterly waged and met with stiff resistance. The bosses hired enough scabs to seriously threaten the strikers. Some scabs were slugged and beaten up, but these tactics were not taken seriously, and were ascribed to the strike situation. Finally the bosses became annoyed and decided to use the greatest weapon at their command, - the injunction. They got such an injunction from Judge Mack, not only against the striking workers themselves, but it was also against the entire building trade union, friends and sympathizers.</p>
   <p>According to the injunction, no strikers and their sympathizers were to be permitted to come near to buildings where scabs were working. They were also not allowed to see or enter the homes where scabs lived, or to influence them in any way, outside the home, through peaceful methods or intimidation, to quit work, or detain anyone of becoming a scab. The injunction contained everything against the striking workers. It was designed to break the backbone of the strike, and thus frighten the union leaders to such an extent as to whip them into line for a favorable argument. But what was the result of this maneuver?</p>
   <p>Quietly the bosses called the leaders of the strikers to their office for a conference, and waving the injunction before the eyes of the strike leaders, they demanded an immediate end to the strike, and to sign an agreement on their terms. But the strike leaders were unperturbed. They laughed at the scrap of paper, and again presented their terms. Well, when the conference was over, an agreement between the bosses and the union leaders was quietly signed for three years. In it was stipulated that only union men are to be employed; scabs to betaken off the jobs immediately; that the newly obtained injunction to be withdrawn; and above all, granting the union demands regarding hours and wages.</p>
   <p>Such was the reply of the parquet workers to the question of injunctions. They did not even bother to come to court when the judge listened to the demands of the bosses to grant them an injunction against the strikers. They didn't have to go to court to fight against the demands of the bosses, and as the union expressed it: "They knew it in advance that the bosses wouldn't go far with their injunction. They didn't care to appeal to the higher courts, and to the President against it. They knew that it would take too long to accomplish anything, through legal proceedings. But they knew that they were well organized, and unanimous in their demands. And thus, in spite of the strong injunction, the bosses were forced to capitulate, and complied to the demands of the union.</p>
   <p>It seems to us now that life has given the best answer to the serious question of injunctions. Now it simmers down to the following: In order to accomplish anything, workers must be experienced in their trade, just like the parquet workers are, for half-baked tradesmen, like most of our Jewish workers are, would never get anywhere. Workers must be well organized. They must not weaken or waver in their demands. They must not listen to outsiders, or expect aid from them. They must not seek the help of politicians who are only out for their own interests.</p>
   <p>No matter how great Mr. Gomper's knowledge and practical experience in labor problems may be, he ought to learn something from the parquet workers of Chicago.</p>
