   <p>The Chicago Branches of the Jewish Socialist Federation are not in harmony regarding the question of splitting with the Socialist Party.</p>
   <p>The North-West Side Branch voted to accept the recommendation of the Executive of the Federation to leave the Socialist Party. The vote, however, was very small, 13 for it and 10 opposed.</p>
   <p>On the other hand the Douglas Park Branch, voted to remain with the Party, but again by a very small total vote. 14 voted to split, 19 to remain with the Party.</p>
