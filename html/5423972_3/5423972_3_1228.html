   <p>Workers Cooperative Society close up one restaurant and move the second. It was agreed upon at a meeting of the shareholders to sell restaurant No. 1, on Ashland Blvd. Restaurant No. 2, at 12th St. and St. Louis Ave. had to be closed as the landlord refused to give a lease. Therefore we bought another place on Roosevelt Rd., corner Albany Ave. directly across Douglas Park.</p>
   <p>Arrangements are being made to open the new place within a few days, under a new manager who will see that everything will be in the best of order.</p>
