   <p>Which Is More Important a Business Agent or a Union?</p>
   <p>This question is being discussed in the United Leather Workers International Local 12 - because something has developed that will lead to them having either a business agent or a union, if they carry on as they did. Local 12 was a big strong union with good conditions, but the sudden rise - the high cost of living - caused them to demand a raise in pay - being refused by the bosses, they were forced to strike; that was combatted by the bosses, with injunctions, police and sluggers - causing the strike to continue for sixteen weeks. Losing the conditions they had, that naturally weakened the union. The International during that time helped Local 12 as much as possible. The members of Local 12 should have no complaints against the International, yet there is a group of members with a business agent at their head, agitating against belonging to the International, so they can save the per capita and be able to pay the business agent, which means, to have a business agent and not have a union. Many of the members realize that this body - the International helped all during the strike and before with thousands of dollars - in sick benefit - death benefit and strike benefit. Consider that the International has done her share, more than could be expected.</p>
   <p>This group with the business agent have separated from the International, but no doubt they will soon realize that it is not a good thing to be alone, not belonging to the labor movement. The leather workers know what the miners and other unions have done for Local 12 - during the time of the strike - about $12,000 from the unions of the A. F. of L. For a small organization of leather workers to exist alone, just to have a business agent, is childish and detrimental to their union.</p>
   <p>The International will do all in their power to help Local 12 get on their feet again, and will give her organizers, to help organize and improve the conditions of the leather workers, in spite of the few members who are under the impression that the International does not need them.</p>
   
   <p>The non-union cigar-makers in the small factories.</p>
   <p>In the last few years there has developed a number of small factories where bunch makers and rollers are working under very poor conditions, and very little pay, that those organized working in union shops and receiving union wages and under good conditions, are in danger, for fear of losing that which they have gained in their struggle.</p>
   <p>The organized workers understand their interests; they try to keep the good conditions, through their union and try to combat every effort the bosses make to reduce their wages, or to change any of their conditions. But what are the bunch makers and rollers doing, that work in small shops on the West Side and other communities, not to let themselves be enslaved? The question is how do they get along with the wages they get for their work? As we hear, the bunchmakers and rollers get such small pay that it is impossible for them to support their families. It therefore becomes their interest to organize - and together with those organized, to better their conditions, get more pay and work less hours.</p>
   
   <p>This cannot be done unless the bunch makers and rollers will join the Amalgamated Cigar Makers Union whose office is at 1145 Blue Island Ave. The Union office is open every night in the week and all day Saturday. The initiation fee is only $1.00.</p>
   <p>Jewish branch of Waiters Union Local 7 - organized for the purpose of starting an organizing campaign in the Jewish districts where there are Jewish restaurants and lunch rooms, had a well attended meeting in their new headquarters, 1126 Blue Island Ave., and elected officers. The delegates to the United Hebrew Trades are Garfield and M. Richter. This branch has a big task - to organize the unorganized waiters of the restaurants and lunch rooms whose customers are Jewish, or other sympathizers of unions, but it is the duty of all organized workers, to help them in the work, to improve the situation. With the help of all Jewish organizations, we can in a short time have one hundred per cent union waiters in Chicago.</p>
