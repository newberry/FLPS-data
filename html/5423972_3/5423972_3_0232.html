   <p>It was quite lively among the local cloak-and waist-makers yesterday. Mr. Benjamin Shlessinger, president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, is here to aid in the renewing of the agreement with cloak manufacturers and also lead the battle of the waist-makers.</p>
   <p>In the evening, Mr. Shlessinger participated in the meeting of the Joint Board. He discussed demands that the union will present July 1, the date of the renewal of their agreement with the Association. It appears that the Chicago cloak-makers are definitely set on obtaining the same conditions as those gained by their New York brothers, the principal demands being a 44-hour-work week and work by the week instead of piece-work.</p>

   <p>Today, at 8 in the evening, Mr. Shlessinger will address a special meeting of the cutters' Local 100, at 180 W. Washington St. It is quite possible that in the few days he remains here, Mr. Shlessinger will hold a conference with the cloak manufacturers.</p>
