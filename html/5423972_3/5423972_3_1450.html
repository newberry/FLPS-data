   <p>Reverend Dr. Emil [G.] Hirsch spoke yesterday at Chicago Sinai Congregation. He answered the accusations made against the Jews by the cheap anti-Semite, Henry Ford. Among other things he said: "Jews do not wish to lead any people; they only wish to work together for world progress. This certainly is not against the teachings of other religions."</p>
