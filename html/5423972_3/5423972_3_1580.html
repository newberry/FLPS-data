   <p>Attorney Jacob S. Le Bassky has resigned his membership in the Chicago Hebrew Institute, because the institute closed its doors to Alexander Berkman, who was supposed to speak for the Labor Defence League.</p>
   <p>Mr. Le Bassky claims that through this action, the institute wrecked the principle of free speech. In his letter of resignation, Mr. Le Bassky states, that he attended the same meeting, which, refused by the institute, was held at the West Side Auditorium. Between 400 and 500 men and women attended this meeting. The crowd was orderly in every respect, and no unpatriotic utterances were made against the American flag. Mr. Le Bassky declares, that generally he didn't see there anything, except the educational worth of the meeting for the public.</p>
