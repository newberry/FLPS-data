   <p>The Knitters Union received a telegram from New York yesterday stating that the Amalgamated Textile Workers of America are ready to aid the Chicago sweater workers in their anticipated struggle for better working conditions.</p>
   <p>The Union is awaiting the bosses' reply to their demands before this Saturday, when their final strike preparations will be completed if the bosses refuse a peaceful settlement.</p>
   <p>News that the Amalgamated Textile Workers have promised aid brought forth great joy among the sweater workers since the former have already demonstrated the significance of their promise in the Patterson strike. The Knitters Union knows that aid from this organization means the victory of their strike.</p>
   <p>Saturday morning the Knitters Union will hold a special meeting in the hall at 1145 Blue Island Avenue to designate the day of the strike.</p>
