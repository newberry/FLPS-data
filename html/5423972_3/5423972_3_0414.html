   <p>The presser is an exception in the tailoring trade. It can be said that they are a trade of their own, except that they work together with the tailors and are therefore considered to be in the tailoring sphere.</p>
   <p>Many tailors think that pressers are prosperous, since they have more pride and consider themselves as experts. In many places they organize the various activities of the shop. But this does not make their livelihood any easier. If one should observe closely the life of a presser one would have to admit they earn their bread with sweat and hard labor.</p>

   <p>A presser stands all day and sweats at his hot-press iron. This iron is operated by gas which simply ruins one's health. It dries the marrow of one's bones and sets one's head reeling. Besides, his work as quite a responsibility. He's the one that finishes the coat or the trousers. Should there be the slightest wrinkle or a (heavy) press of the iron then there is trouble galore.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago old time pressers called a mass meeting of all the pressers in Chicago for the purpose of organizing a union. A leaflet was printed and distributed. We extract from the circular the following, which speaks for itself:</p>

   <p>"To you Mr. Presser and underpresser, we now come with the request that you ask of yourselves, 'what has become of us?' The one time proud presser whom even the boss respected, to whom fellow workers come with their difficulties, the same presser stands today in a dark corner as if he were an extra person at the shop and must take all the abuse from his boss as well as from the rest of the workers. The boss demands the best coat pressed for the least price. The workman, on the other hand, in the rush to complete his work is none too careful, relying on the presser to press the coat straight.</p>
   <p>"Everyone from trimmer to finisher relies on the presser to press the garment into shape. As a result, after the garment is pressed it must be returned to be fixed. Thus it must again be pressed. The blame is affixed naturally on the presser. And how many times does it happens that the same coat is pressed three or four times for the same price.</p>

   <p>"Have you asked yourself, Mr. Presser, "why is this so?' How does it happen, that from the once proud presser there is now only a small person who permits himself to be ragged by everyone in the shop?</p>
   <p>"The answer is: At one time the presser was an independent man. He met with his fellow pressers to discuss their common business. Then there was a strong pressers union which stood firmly behind each member at all times. Therefore, when the presser first entered the shop the boss and the workers showed respect for him. Today he is classed and rated equally with a bastings puller and thus considered as one."</p>
   <p>It would be a noteworthy act of the United Jewish Trades to organize a pressers' union. Let those pressers who called this mass meeting call at the Federation at 1125 Blue Island Ave. and speak with its executives.</p>
