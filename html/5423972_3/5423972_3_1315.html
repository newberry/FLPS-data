   <p>The trial of the Jewish organizer of farm co-operatives, Aaron Sapiro, against the great automobile magnate, Henry Ford, is now being held. It is a suit for libel. Aaron Sapiro, being a prominent personality in America, is, evidently, on the list of American Jews who were attacked by Ford's newspaper, Dearborn Independent, in a series of articles a few years ago.</p>
   <p>Ford, at that time, sought to explain in these articles that the Jewish capitalists throughout the world had conspired together to seize everything. Sapiro was the alleged leader of the conspiracy--better still, the agent of the conspirators. The Jewish millionaires, Baruch, Otto Kahn, and [Julius] Rosenwald, organized farm co-operatives with the help of Mr.Sapiro.He was supposed to have controlled the co-operatives in the interest of the capitalists and the national, Jewish bankers.</p>
   <p>We do not believe that more than a handful of the thousands of readers of the Dearborn Independent believed the assertions regarding the Jewish plot at the time the anti-Semitic attacks were published. The paper was distributed in large numbers as a propaganda device--not because the people wanted to read it. The small number of individuals who sincerely believed the charges made by the newspaper, had no love for the Jews before the [articles were published]. They were always prepared to believe all plausible and implausible accusations against the Jews. Ford merely supplies them with new lies about the Jewish race.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, do not think that it is necessary to engage in a trial against Ford. It is doubtful whether the Jews will gain any satisfaction from such a trial. Ford will, most naturally, attempt to defend himself through various technicalities. He has great lawyers, is very influential, and is popular among the masses. It is, therefore, difficult to imagine that a judge and a jury can be found that will hand down a verdict against Ford-that will brand him as a liar and deceiver. Any other verdict will be worthless. It will leave the whole affair in the same condition as it is now--as it was prior to the time it appeared in court.</p>
   <p>We must also bear in mind the actual trial. It will be one of the most sensational trials--sensational because the entire Jewish race and the most popular man in America, Henry Ford, are involved. The papers will print chiefly the most sensational things told by the witnesses. These things will not be favorable to Jews. Wild exaggerations concerning Jewish wealth and Jewish power--and several false stories about "secret Jewish connections" in various countries--will be published. The wilder, the more foolish, and the more disgraceful the lies told by Ford's witness are, the more publicity will Ford receive in the newspapers throughout the country.</p>
   <p>We doubt very much whether the evidence against Ford will receive one tenth of the amount of publicity that the evidence for Ford will receive. [Why?] Merely because the evidence against Ford will not be sensational and will be in the nature of a defense, whereas the evidence for Ford will be in the nature of an attack. The trial, [according to the newspapers], will signify that Ford is fighting for justice and for the interest of the great masses from a terrible clique of thieves.</p>
   <p>The fact, however, remains that the trial is in progress. Let us hope that it will not last a long time. The wave of anti-Semitism that had arisen before the World War, at the time when the Klan flourished, is now receding. The Ku Klux Klan is not as powerful now as it was, and the Klan was the source of the anti-Semitic plague. The sooner the anti-Semitic campaign of Ford is allowed to disappear, the better it will be for the Jews in America and in the entire world.</p>
