   <p>A committee of the Retail Clerks Union, Local 226, appeared at the meeting of the United Hebrew Trades, who related the condition of the strike at the Boston Store and asked the United Hebrew Trades to help them acquaint the masses of the Jewish districts with the fact that the Boston Store workers are striking for the right of belonging to a union.</p>
   <p>The delegate stated that the employees of the Boston Store receive $3.00 a week and commission, a system which is detrimental to the majority of workers.</p>
   <p>The delegates of the United Hebrew Trades decided to appoint a committee, who will contact the strike committee and the larger unions, such as the Amalgamated and Cloak-Makers, in order to carry on, together, a great publicity campaign in all the three Jewish districts of the city, concerning the strike at the Boston Store.</p>
