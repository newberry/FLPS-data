   <p>New Agreement Between the Amalgamated and Clothing Manufacturers Approved at Four Meetings.</p>
   <p>The new contract was read to 12,000 members of the Amalgamated and was accepted. Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated, addressed the members about the changes in the agreement with the manufacturers and the reasons why he and other officers recommended the members to accept the agreement. He described the industrial conditions of the country. He annihilated the demands of the manufacturers, which, if they were accepted would mean destruction to the organization. "Under present conditions," said Hillman, "I consider this the great accomplishment of our organization."</p>
   <p>Hillman pointed out that, under present conditions, every member should be satisfied that a strike was avoided and wait for better times to get back their reduced wages.</p>

   <p>Many members expressed dissatisfaction over a ten per cent cut in wages, but the vast majority applauded and voted in favor of the agreement.</p>
   <p>Similar meetings were held at the Lawndale Hall, Carnegie's Hall, and on the South Side, where Sam Levin, Frank Rosenblum and others spoke about the agreement. The agreement was unanimously approved.</p>
   <p>The Agreement between the Amalgamated and the Manufacturers:</p>
   <p>1 - This agreement for collective bargaining between the Clothing Manufacturers of Chicago and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America was signed (with the qualifications of section 3) for three years commencing May 1, 1922 until May 1, 1925.</p>
   <p>2 - Hours of Work. (a) The hours of work are 44 a week, 8 working hours throughout the week days and Saturday until noon. (b) Overtime. For work exceeding regular time, the piece workers shall be paid 50% in addition to the regular price per piece, and time and a half for workers on weekly salaries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>3 - (a) The standards of wages, which were established in the agreement shall not be altered, unless one or both parties is convinced that it is necessary to change the standards and is notified three months before the day concluding a year of the agreement's existence and calls a conference to make such changes. If such changes are approved, they shall become effective May 1 of each year under the contract. If another thorough investigation proves that the parties are unable to agree for the first of May, either side may break the agreement. (b) Prices for piece work shall be fixed through collective bargaining by a price committee. This committee shall consist of a labor manager or any other qualified representative of the management and a representative of the union, appointed by the organized group for this purpose. (c) When at times, certain operations are needed to be placed under piece work or changes in the existing prices, the question shall be given over to the price committee, which is obligated to set a price. If the price committee can not agree, the question shall be given to the trade board. (d) The wages of the cutters, who work under the standards, which <span class="page-break">\4</span>were accepted by a decision April 21, shall be as follows: Group a - $47, group b - $45, group c - $43, group d - $41, group e - $39. If there are cutters whose production is so unusual that it excludes the qualification as mentioned above, then both parties shall agree to set a price and to hand the case over to the trade board if they can not agree.</p>
   <p>4 - It was approved that the principle of the preferential shop shall be continued and applied in the following manner: Preference shall be given to union workers, in hiring and discharging. When an employer is in need of workers, he will turn to the Union, indicating the amount needed and if the Union can not supply them, for some reason, he has the privilege to obtain workers in open markets. The Union undertakes to cooperate with the employers in working out rules and regulations for sending workers on jobs and to organize an effective employment bureau. The principle of a preferential shop shall be employed upon discharging a worker. If there is need for lay-offs, the non-union members are to be discharged first.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>(b) The rules for the preference of union members demand that the doors of the Union shall be open to accept non-union workers. Admission fees and dues shall be moderate and every applicant shall be admitted, if he did not commit a crime against the Union.</p>
   <p>5 - (a) The full power of discipline and discharge is within the jurisdiction of the employers. It was agreed upon that this power shall be utilized justly, and in consideration of the right of the workers. The power to fire shall be carried through only by those authorized. If the Union, after an investigation finds that the worker was discharged without a just reason and that the dispute can not be settled between the representative and the management, the Union may bring this case before the trade board and unless it appeals to the board of arbitration, the decision of the trade board remains in effect. (b) This agreement asserts that all disputes shall be settled in a fair way and there is no reason for direct action.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Stoppages are, therefore, forbidden; when a stoppage occurs because he, who has authority, refuses to let the workers keep their jobs. he shall immediately be ordered to put them back to work and in case they refuse, in one hour after the order they may be disciplined. (c) The work should be divided equally among the workers during dull periods.</p>
   <p>The other parts of the agreement are related to the obligations of the deputies, shop chairman, impartial boards and the board of arbitration, specifying their duties and privileges. The same machinery as of the aforementioned, was accepted to settle complaints.</p>
   <p>The tailors, bushelmen and examiners have, in this agreement, a fixed minimum scale of $35 per week, a salary which they never had until now. The cutters wages were reduced two dollars per week and the minimum is $39.</p>
