   <p>A Maxwell Street businessman waited in vain, early yesterday morning, at Kedzie [Avenue] and Twelfth Street, for a friend or acquaintance who was driving a car, so that he could open his store on time.</p>
   <p>The man started to walk when he saw that it was getting late and he walked until he reached California Avenue. At California Avenue, he looked around--nary a friend or acquaintance [in sight]. Anyone who had a vacant place in his automobile, jitney, truck, or express wagon, wanted money, and our businessman did not wish to pay.</p>
   
   <p>Our businessman, seeing that it was getting later, continued walking until he reached Ogden Avenue. He stood there for a while waiting for a friend or acquaintance to show up, but no one came. Anyone who had a vacant place in his auto, jitney, truck, or express wagon, wanted money and our friend did not want to pay.</p>
   <p>The Maxwell Street businessman, to make the story brief, continued to walk, and he walked all the way to his store. He opened his store on Maxwell Street at eleven forty-three.</p>
   <p>The busybody of the editorial office is responsible for this true or false story.</p>
   <p>It seems that even a streetcar strike has some good in it. A Jew who can seldom afford to ride a taxi, got three different automobile rides to work, and one of them was in a beautiful electric car.</p>
   
   <p>It happened this way: a Jew left his house and started to walk. What else could he do? After a while, it occurred to him that there wasn't much sense to his walking. He would try to stop an automobile and ask for a ride. He stands at a corner and waits. Presently an auto approaches--the Jew waves his hand, the auto stops, and he is told: "I would like to take you with me but I am only going two blocks." Our hero thinks that two blocks is better than nothing. He gets in, rides two blocks, then walks about ten blocks until perspiring, tired, and breathing hard, he decides to stop another auto. He stops, waves his hand until a passing autoist picks him up. The autoist, unfortunately, drives east one block, and then turns north, while our hero's route is straight east and then south. He rides for a block, gets off, and then walks about thirty blocks. When he is a block from his destination, an acquaintance of his drives up and picks him up. Our hero struts into his shop and boasts of his three automobile rides.</p>
