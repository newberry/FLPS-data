   <p>The massmeeting yesterday afternoon, of the striking cloak makers at the Ashland Auditorium, was a wonderful demonstration of sincerity and devotion in the battle against slavery and bondage.</p>
   <p>The speakers representing various branches of the labor movement spoke inspiringly of this battle of the cloakmakers and of other workers, and in the name of their organizations they faithfully promised all the help that would be needed. The second happy event was the appearance of the formen and their position. They dealt like brave, proud men and class conscious proletarians. The formen's actions should be recognized by all the workers; and they will surely earn a big share in the victory of the brave cloakmakers.</p>
