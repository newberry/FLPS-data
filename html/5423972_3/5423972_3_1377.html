   <p>At the three days conference of the Jewish Socialist Alliance five Chicago members of the Actions Committee were present: Louis Schaffer, Dr. Z. Lorber, Morris Ziskind, Morris Blumin, and M. Weinrib.</p>
   <p>The first task of the Actions Committee will be to create a fund of ten-thousand dollars to carry through the program mapped out for them by the conference. There is no doubt that sum will be raised, because every city must contribute its share.</p>
   <p>The cities represented at this conference were:</p>
   <p>L. Schaffer, Chicago</p>
   <p>F. Chizin, Sioux City</p>
   <p>D. Shure, Minneapolis</p>
   <p>H. Berkovitz, Kansas City</p>
   <p>H. Katz, Cleveland</p>
   <p>S. Ziebleman, Milwaukee</p>
   <p>A. Levitt, Detroit</p>
   <p>D. Gilbert, St. Louis</p>
   <p>Mr. Gillman, South Bend</p>
   <p>An activities program for the middle west was formulated as follows:</p>
   <p>1. To spread Socialistic teachings through speeches, literature, and practice.</p>
   <p>2. To participate in the attempts to organize a labor-party in America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>3. To assist in the work of the Peoples' Relief.</p>
   <p>4. To spread Socialistic propaganda in the form of pluggers.</p>
   <p>5. To aid the work of The Veker (The Arouser), the official organ of the Jewish Socialist Alliance.</p>
   <p>All these resolutions were adopted after interesting debates which took place at all the three sessions of the conference that lasted from Saturday night until late Sunday afternoon and ended with a magnificent banquet at the Socialist Center, 1224 South Albany Avenue.</p>
   <p>Comrade Alexander Kahn, one of the leaders of the Verband came to Chicago especially for the conference and took an active part in the debates. He is in favor of a new labor party which is to be formed through the union of the Farmer-Labor Party and the Socialist Party. His explanations proved of great importance for the conference.</p>
