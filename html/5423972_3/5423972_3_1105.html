   <p>On Maxwell street near Wolpert's bakery where the workers are on strike, it was very lively last night. Mr. Wolpert who hired scab bakers to take the places of his strikers, felt very uneasy about the pickets gathered about his shop and called the police. Just at that time the strikers held an open meeting on the corner, just two doors away from Wolpert's shop, told the crowd that a strike is being conducted in three shops, and appealed to everyone to buy bread bearing the union label only.</p>
   <p>The police could not find any disorder, therefore, made no arrests. The shops where the strike is being conducted are as follows: Wolpert's, 703 Maxwell street, where eight workers are on strike; Neiman and Shapiro, 921 Maxwell street, where six men are on strike; and Sam Levin, Polk and Laflin streets, where also six men are on strike.</p>

   <p>This strike was called, because of the expiration of the old agreement, and the bosses' association's refusal to renew the agreement with the union. It is said that the association has, for the beginning of a lock-out, picked these three shops to work with scabs, as a tryout, and if successful, the others will follow this example.</p>
   <p>"But," say the union men, "it will not reach that point, as the public is in sympathy with us strikers, and that is an assurance of a quick victory."</p>
