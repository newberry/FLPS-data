   <p>There was a time when people found pleasure in work and worked for the sake of personal satisfaction. This sounds incredible nowadays. Yet, it is true that at one time people sang hymns not only when carrying their sheafs to the sheds, but also while plowing and sowing the fields. Trades were then governments by themselves, which were strongly fortified against famine and death.</p>
   <p>Those gay times have long become a dream of vanished times which a great number of people refuse to believe ever existed. The worker, who was then king in his own trade, has been held a captive for many generations. He is bound in fetters by an unjust social system; he is driven to his toilsome work by the whip of hunger and want; he is fed with deceitful promises and intriguing hopes until he loses his strength and vigor as a victim on the alter of the Golden Calf, which can never become overgorged.</p>
   
   <p>And when tens of thousands are languishing, a voice is heard: "There must always be poor people." But at times a prophet like Zechariah arises, whose blood eventually commingles with the blood of the victims, and does not stop boiling at promises. And in the short period between his first appearance and condemnation, he antagonizes the victims and transforms sheep into leopards and oxen into lions. At that particular time it is rather dangerous to enrage the victims. Even the cynic, with all his deviltry, crawls into his rat-hole and remains silent, lest he lose his life. But no sooner a chance appears than one of the high priests succeeds in framing a new promise and depicts a picture of the prosperity which awaits the hungry masses if they were only to step over the dead body of the condemned prophet, who is thus forced to cover his face in disgrace, and the duped sheep and oxen remain still weaker and more helpless than ever before.</p>
   <p>In the category of deceitful promises belongs the promise made recently by the Detroit millionaire Henry Ford, who promised to share his wealth with his workers. He will distribute ten million dollars, and each worker will receive in due time a portion, according to his personal initiative.</p>
   <p>The whip of hunger on which is carved the promise of ten million dollars, moves constantly before the eyes of Mr. Ford's slaves. Forty-five thousand additional slaves have applied with the following plea: "Dear Mr. Ford, may we also share some of your promises. We will work for low wages and with as much subjectivity as you desire."</p>
   <p>Thus, the whip cracks over the land. Oxen and jackasses are plentiful, and Mr. Ford is highly pleased with his successful joke, which brings upon him honor and eminence during life, and immortality in the history of human ignorance post-obit.</p>
