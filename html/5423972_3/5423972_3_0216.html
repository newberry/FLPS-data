   <p>More than six hundred waist and dressmakers, delegated from the four thousand workers of all shops in the local dress industry, assembled yesterday evening at the Wicker Park Hall, Robey near Milwaukee. They enthusiastically decided to authorize the International President, Benjamin Schlessinger, to negotiate with the manufacturers regarding uniform working hours, a minimum wage, in keeping with the present high cost of living, sanitary [working] conditions and collective bargaining, expressing at the same time their determination to strike if the bosses refuse a peaceful settlement.</p>
   <p>President Schlessinger explained that he did not believe that the manufacturers would dare to permit the reoccurrence of the events of two years ago when the bitter fight lasted many long weeks. He felt that they knew well that such action would spell ruin for them. If they dared to repeat their earlier action, they would become aware of the union's complete preparedness to go on strike.</p>

   <p>The speaker assured the audience, most of whom were women, that he would employ all possible methods to arrive at a peaceful settlement.</p>
   <p>"I have not come here," he said, "to fight, but to secure better conditions for you. I do not want to witness a strike and again afford Judge Baldwin the opportunity of issuing an injunction. Neither do I want the Chicago police to show their ability to arrest brave strikers."</p>
   <p>It was affirmed at the meeting that the Arthur Weis firm, 318 West Adams Street, whose cutters and pressers have again gone on strike because two were discharged for union activities, has tried recently to secure scabs among former soldiers and sailors who in turn refused to accept the strikers' jobs.</p>
   <p>It is said that certain bosses, though themselves Jewish, are spreading rumors among non-Jewish workers that the union is Jewish and that they, therefore, need not belong to such an organization. The meeting contemptuously repudiated such methods of fighting, a method which seeks to create race hatred among <span class="page-break">3</span>workers. The reply to this prevarication was the unity displayed by the men and women assembled, among whom were Jews, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians, Bohemians, Germans, Irishmen, Italians, and even Negro girls.</p>
   <p>Agnes Astor, president of the women's Trade Union League, addressed the meeting and promised complete aid from the union, Local 100, in the forthcoming strike. The editor of the local Polish workers' newspaper, Dziennik Ludowy, also spoke.</p>
   <p>It is expected that in the course of the next few days the facts will become known as to whether the manufacturers are willing to confer with the union thus avoiding a strike, or whether the strike will take place shortly.</p>
