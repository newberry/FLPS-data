   <p>The Jewish bakers of Chicago ended their strike last night when their employers came to an agreement with the Jewish Baker's Union.</p>
   <p>It was decided by the committee of the employers to accept the terms of the Bakers Union and settle the strike.</p>
   <p>The strike lasted three and a half weeks. The' baker bosses" had decided to combat the union on all fronts. They demanded the union to reduce six dollars a week from the prevailing wages, no pay for holidays, no extra pay for night work, and to be at liberty in hiring extra helpers.</p>
   <p>The union rejected all these demands and withdrew the demand of a five dollar raise in order to keep the bosses from complaining to the public that they are paying the union bakers too high wages.</p>
