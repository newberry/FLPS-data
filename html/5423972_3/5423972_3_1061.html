   <p>The Havana American Cigar Company, a trust factory, employing 600 men and women who are members of the Progressive cigar-makers union, has determined to break up the union, for no reason other than the fact that it is organized. The manager of the factory forbade the collections of dues from the members of the union. When the shop committee refused to comply with the order they were fired. A strike followed. Police and detectives were stationed in front of the factory watching the pickets. A half dozen scabs were inside the factory and they threw black pepper on the pickets.</p>
   <p>It is the aim of the Jewish workers to do all in their power to assist the 600 strikers in the way of funds for food, clothes etc. The organized workers are determined not to let the trust factory break them, after building up the organization through much hard work, energy and sacrifices.</p>
