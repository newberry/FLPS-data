   <p>The Democratic candidate for governor, Senator [James Hamilton] Lewis, is a very talented person; he is a clever politician, he has a sharp mind and a sound intellect. He is a linguist and a distinguished jurist; an able administrator and a witty, brilliant orator, who can keep his audience spellbound. His popularity among the masses is due to his natural and captivating friendliness. He is good-natured and has a friendly word for everyone who turns to him.</p>
   <p>If Senator Lewis had entered the diplomatic service, he would undoubtedly have become the most famous American diplomat of his time, because he possesses the art of getting around people. This characteristic is common only among people who themselves are good-natured and friendly.</p>
   
   <p>Every statesman and civic leader of high degree has one basic characteristic--and the basic characteristic of Senator Lewis is his sincere and natural affability. Everyone who knows Senator Lewis personally, respects and admires him because he never says an abusive word.</p>
   <p>In contrast, however, to diplomats, Senator Lewis is a person of outspoken and firm convictions. To him democracy is not only a party matter--it is a matter of world-wide significance. He is well acquainted with the mechanism of the state and he knows and is convinced that the state mechanism can function properly only when the power of the state rests upon the will of the people, and is divided according to the verdict of the people. Senator Lewis, as a genuine democrat, does not believe that in the interests of the state, it is good to have one person remain too long at the head of the government. He, therefore, has informed the public that if he is elected governor, he will serve only one term, and will never be a candidate for another term. The state mechanism needs new strength and new blood, otherwise it cannot function smoothly, and, therefore, the Democratic candidate for governor is a one-term man.</p>
   <p>Senator Lewis is a statesman with an international reputation. For many years he was the party whip in the United States Senate and was naturally very popular with the administration. He was also very popular in the Senate, and was admired by political friends and foes. He exerted a great deal of influence upon Senate resolutions. During the war, Senator Lewis went to France on an important political mission, and carried it out to the complete satisfaction of the government. His tact and friendly behavior increased the deep respect and admiration that France holds for the United States. Simple and distinguished in his manner, he soon won the hearts of those Frenchmen who came in contact with him.</p>
   <p>As a person of diversified political and administrative experiences, and as a gifted man, Senator Lewis will certainly prove to be a splendid governor of Illinois. Under his administration, Illionis will become even better known that it is now, and the democracy of Illinois will become a prominent factor in the whole of American democracy.</p>
   <p>We Jews certainly have some excellent reasons for voting for Senator Lewis on November 2. We are an ancient and cultured people, and we appreciate wisdom, erudition, and noble qualities. Senator Lewis is also a sincere friend of the Jewish people, and whenever he has an opportunity to help a Jew, he does so gladly. He is proud of the fact that Jewish blood flows in his veins.</p>
   <p>A Jewish journalist in New York recently declared that the Jews of America have two great friends--Arthur Brisbane and Senator Lewis. It may be that there are more than two honest and influential friends of the Jews, in America. In any event, Senator James Hamilton Lewis is one of our sincerest and truest friends. Every Jewish voter who goes to the polls on November 2, should bear this in mind.</p>
