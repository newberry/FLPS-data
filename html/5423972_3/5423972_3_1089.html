   <p>All hope of peace in the clothing industry vanished yesterday, when the attorney for the Wholesale Clothing Association, Martin J. Isaacs, openly declared that the bosses do not want arbitration and that the workers have nothing to strike for. According to the lawyer's acquaintance with conditions and wages, the workers have no ground for complaint, and in his opinion the workers would be happy except that a few leaders are trying to stir up all this trouble.</p>
   <p>The officials of the union stated, that Mr. Isaacs expressed nothing new and that this alibi has been used by the bosses for a long time. Though the union is hopeful of a peaceful settlement yet it has organized the entire trade, and when the call to strike is sounded, then the bosses will realize their mistake.</p>
   <p>"Under no circumstances will we recognize the union," Mr. Isaacs declared. "The strike movement is only a threat, and the manufacturers are not taking it seriously. Should the workers actually declare a strike, they will have to return to work under the old conditions, for we are determined not to recognize the union, its officials, or their demands."</p>
   <p>The union in its appeal to the workers indicated, that the critical hour in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>history of Chicago's needle industry has now arrived. The terrible conditions prevailing in the shops must be changed, by all means, for their continuance is impossible. The demands of the union are absolutely just. But if the bosses ignore the workers and refuse to confer with the union's representatives, then there is only one thing left open for the great army of the tailors and that is a battle. The appeal also requests every worker to do his duty to the union.</p>
   <p>In answer to the manufacturers' declaration, Mr. Sidney Hillman, international president of the Amalgamated, stated, that the bosses' position did not surprise him, that he really expected it. For just as in New York, where 60,000 workers live now under more decent conditions than here, the manufacturers were also reluctant at first to yield to the workers' demands, but in the end became convinced and finally signed an agreement with the union. And the same results are also awaited here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hillman is a firm believer in the organization of the Chicago tailors, and he is confident that should the strike be declared, the Amalgamated will bring it to a successful end, for the $100,000 which is on hand in the union's treasury, is the best weapon to combat the bosses' stubbornness.</p>
