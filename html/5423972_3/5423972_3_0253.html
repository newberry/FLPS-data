   <p>Yesterday at three in the afternoon it started.</p>
   <p>Between Van Buren and Jackson on Franklin, Market, and neighboring streets, the tailoring vein in Chicago, there were circles of vivacious young men and women whose features shone with the happiness of victory. They spoke among themselves, waved to the workers in the shops, who returned the salute in the same fashion.</p>
   <p>Half an hour later, a signal was given. As per arrangement with the bosses, workers left the shops of the clothing manufacturers belonging to the Association to declare a holiday and celebrate their victory. Also, to ratify the new agreement that the Association bosses finally decided to accept from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union.</p>
   <p>Men and women of the needle industry, Lithuanians, Poles, Italians, Ruthenians, <span class="page-break">2</span>and many sons of Israel formed ranks and marched en masse to the meeting point in the huge Ashland Auditorium, where the celebration and ratification of the peace agreement in Chicago needle industry was to take place.</p>
   <p>From the high clear heaven, a warm Spring sun shone down upon a happy international army. Over 6,000 filled the immense auditorium and as many more had to be sent to other halls.</p>
   <p>The holiday spirit that reigned in the auditorium is indescribable. A storm of applause greeted the entrance to the stage of the Amalgamated Union's own orchestra, which played The Star Spangled Banner, The Russian Freedom Hymn, The Marseillaise, and several other numbers.</p>
   <p>Sam Risman opened the meeting with a short address, in which he stated that this was the happiest moment of his life, when the object of their aims for ten long years had finally been fulfilled. He recalled the wages of former workers at Hart-Schaffner and Marx shops; also the martyrs of former strikes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Then he presented the first speaker, Frank Rosenbloom.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenbloom told how hard it was for him to speak and subdued his bursts of joy. "Bosses have become good and friendly, not because of change of heart," he said, "but because they tried to test the might of organized union workers and sought victory over unity. The impossible happened. The Association bosses put aside their differences and agreed to recognize their workers as a body."</p>
   <p>He announced the names of the firms that signed the agreement: Kuppenheimer; Alfred, Decker and Cohn; Hirsch Wickver; Charles Kaufman; K. Nathan and Fisher; Ederheimer and Stein; Shehan, Cohen and Co.; Meyer Bros.; Leopold Solomon and Eisendrath; Stein, Spiegelglass and Berman; Ebt and Sons, and all members of the Association, except two firms, The Scotch Woolen Mills and Rosenwald. Because, - will wonders never cease! - the Association decided to expell them for not signing the agreement.</p>
   <p>Some speakers spoke in Lithuanian, Polish, Italian, and English. Sam Levin <span class="page-break">4</span>spoke both in Jewish and in English. The last speaker was Sidney Hilman, general president of the Amalgamated, whose appearance roused the audience to the heights of enthusiasm. In short, concise words he stated the significance of this, the most tremendous victory in the history of the Amalgamated Union. He set up the most important points of the agreement.</p>
   <p>The workmen present unanimously ratified the proposed agreement and also accepted a resolution to thank the workingmen's organizations in those newspapers of Chicago that aided them in their struggle.</p>
   <p>The agreement between the Amalgamated Union and the Clothiers Association of Chicago is as follows:</p>
   <p>1. A preferencial union shop.</p>
   <p>Should the members of the Association need workers, they must come to the union as long as the union has union workmen to place.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>2. A board of arbitration.</p>
   <p>To have a trade board and board of arbitration to settle disputes.</p>
   <p>When a workman is discharged, his case comes before the trade board, which is empowered to re-employ him.</p>
   <p>3. Complaints of workmen.</p>
   <p>All workmen's complaints will be taken up with agents of the union and immediate work superiors.</p>
   <p>4. Increase in wages.</p>
   <p>The matter of wage increase will be handled by agents of the union and the bosses. But, should they fail to come to any agreement, the question will be placed for arbitration.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The increase will become effective June 1, 1919. Even if more time should be required in this matter, increases will still be effective as of June 1.</p>
   <p>5. A 44-hour week.</p>
   <p>Working time is to be 44 hours a week. The first five days, eight hours; Saturday four hours. Work done after regular hours is considered overtime and must pay time and a half, to weekly workers as well as to piece workers.</p>
   <p>6. Regarding strikes or lockouts.</p>
