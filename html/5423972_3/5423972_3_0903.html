   <p>The organized Ladies' Tailors Employers have carried through their plan. They informed their employers that they must accept a wage-cut, and must permit the abrogation of the other union rules. The union had decided not to sign any individual agreements. When the employees were ordered to sign the agreement allowing a wage-cut and acknowledging the abrogation of their union conditions, they refused. With the exception of Jacob Lowitz, 405--7 East 43rd Street, all employers who had agreed to break the Union have locked out their employees.</p>
