   <p>Before his departure, Morris Sigman, president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, who visited Chicago in the interests of the cloak and dressmakers, told a reporter that the International will open a branch office in Chicago to do the necessary organizing of the Middle Western states.</p>
   <p>Sigman attended meetings of the local unions and a session of the Joint Board. He is very pleased with the fact that divergent opinions among the members regarding politics have ceased. Mr. Sigman believes that the plan of opening a branch office will help the good work of the local Joint Board a great deal.</p>
   <p>Chicago cloakmakers are sure that such a branch office will add to the prestige of their movement and will help in their work of organizing nonunion shops, provided that the branch office is run by one whom all the workers respect, and in whom they have confidence.</p>
