   <p>The Cap Makers Union will finally investigate the condition of the trade. The committee of the Cap Makers Union, together with the president Max Zaretzky, have given a report about the transactions with the bosses concerning the question of establishing, in the trade, a standard of production.</p>
   <p>The business agent, Brother Skolvick, reported that the executive discussed the report by President Max Zaretsky in his transactions with the bosses and recommended that the Union should agree to the plan, that the bosses brought forth. That is - to make a thorough investigation about the condition of the trade in order to find out what sort of a standard of production can be introduced in the cap trade.</p>
   <p>The manufacturers requirements for a standard of production are five dozen caps a day per work at a minimum wage of $44 a week. The Union decided to give the executive the authority to enter an alliance with the manufacturers in the investigation of the trade, which may clarify the question of introducing a standard of production.</p>
