   <p>The City Central Committee of the Workmen's Circle has taken up the issue of helping to raise funds for the brave railroad shop strikers and unanimously adopted the following resolutions:</p>
   <p>Upon considering that the 400,000 railroad shop workers have already been on strike for more than two months to defend their rights against drastic reduction in their wages, and upon considering that the railroad strikers are close to victory and the government has undertaken to break the strikes through the power of the courts and injunctions and even forbids their union to help them financially with the money that was collected by the women and children of the strikers; be it therefore resolved that the City Central Committee of the Workmen's Circle extends the fullest sympathy to the strikers and urges all the branches and individual members to support these strikers to the greatest extent. The branches and members must take prompt action in raising funds for these workers and bring the money to the office of the City Central Committee, where M. Golden, secretary-treasurer, will immediately send the money to the office of the strikers.</p>
