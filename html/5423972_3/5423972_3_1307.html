   <p>Eventually the Ford-Sapiro trial will be over.Eventually the twelve Michiganders who constitute the jury will finally agree or disagree on a verdict. The long-drawn-out legal wrangle will come to a close. What will be the significance of the verdict.</p>
   <p>I am inclined to think that, apart from the question whether Mr. Sapiro will get any of Ford's money, the trial will serve to "debunk" Mr. Ford--in part, at least. The billionaire automobile worker will emerge an unheroic figure. His lawyer may succeed in establishing the legal fiction that Ford was personally unaware of what the Dearborn Independent printed about Sapiro; that, in fact, Ford never read a single issue of his privately-owned magazine and never wrote any of the numerous articles which bear his name. The lawyer, technically, may prove all this and more, and persuade a jury that Ford's editors, secretaries, and press agents are responsible for his anti-Semitic <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>activities; before the bar of American public opinion, however, he will have lost [the trial]. He will have lost because he is hiding himself behind the backs of his editors and secretaries. The more his lawyers employ legal technicalities to keep him from answering embarrassing questions, the greater will be his embarrassment in the public eye. It is probably too much to expect that anti-Semitism will be destroyed in America as a result of this trial. It is fair to assume, however, that Ford's personal brand of Jew-baiting will have received a death-blow.</p>
   <p>The court has ruled that the Jewish question is not involved in the present trial. And there is a famous court ruling that a whole race cannot be libeled. This may be good law, but it does not make good sense. For every intelligent layman knows that, try as you may, you cannot really keep the Jewish issue out of this case. Moreover, every right-thinking person feels that a whole race can most assuredly be libeled.</p>
   <p>The tortuous processes of lawyers and judges are wondrous to behold! The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>logic of the court bears but slight resemblance to the logic of the man in the street. Hence a court ruling may be perfectly legal without being, in the least, either just or sensible. It is fatuous to argue, as Ford does at the trial, that in calling Aaron Sapiro a Jew he was no more offensive than had he called attention to the fact that Chief Justice Taft is a Unitarian. Ford did very much more than simply call Sapiro a Jew. He specifically and repeatedly made the charge that Sapiro was part and parcel of an international, Jewish conspiracy to cheat, rob, and exploit the American farmers in the interest of his "gang".</p>
   <p>I have before me, as I write this article, a copy of the Jews' Activities in the United States, the second volume of The International Jew, which is a reprint of a select number of articles appearing in the Dearborn Independent from October 9, 1920 to March 19, 1921. In the preface we are informed that the first volume dealt with content of the Jewish "world program". The present volume gives a general view of some of the evidence which illustrates and substantiates that program. The articles thus far printed remain unanswered. Some of the chapter headings are as follows: "How Jews in the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>United States Conceal their Strength"; "Jew versus non-Jew in New York Finance"; "Disraeli of America--a Jew of Super Power"; "The Scope of Jewish Dictatorship in the United States"; "Jewish Control of the American Theater"; "The Jewish Aspect of the Movie Problem"; "Rule of Jewish Kehillah Grips New York"; "When Editors were Independent of Jews"; and "Jews Use the Peace Conference to Bind Poland".</p>
   <p>It would be idle and beneath the Jew's dignity to attempt to refute the numerous charges made by Ford. Here are a few of these charges which have remained unanswered: "Jewry emerged from the war more strongly entrenched in power than it ever was before--even in the United States" (page 56)."A Jew is President of France". "Morris Guest....is not a producer, of course, although he is a great panderer to the least credible tastes of a public whose tastes he has debased to no small degree" (page 108). On page 245 we read: "About eight months ago the Dearborn Independent began series of studies on the Jewish question. It was an attempt to state the facts upon which the Jewish question is based. It was not in the beginning, nor has it since <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>developed, into an attack on Jews as Jews. Its purpose was enlightenment; and if it secretly indulged in a hope, it was this--that the leaders of American Jewry had a genuine modus operandi, not of toleration, but of reconciliation. The proof that these articles contained facts, and only facts, is found in the failure of the Jewish spokesmen to show any one of them to be false. The record stands that way. Not one disproof! It is quite well known what the position of Jewish leaders is today. It is one of fear. For once they themselves are possessed by the fear of the unknown. Mark this: all the anti-Semitism that exists in the United States today is the deliberate creation of the Jewish leaders and is a great creation.The Jewish leaders want anti-Sematism here. Unable to create it among non-Jews, they are seeking to create it among the Jews by telling them that it exists. The Jewish leaders of the United States have done everything possible to keep the Dearborn Independent away from the Jews, to prevent them from reading it and learning the fact that no attack is being made upon them as Jews."</p>
   <p>In all seriousness, how should such attacks be met by the Jews? Argue with Ford? Get "mad" at him? Call him names? Plead with him to stop disseminating <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>this propaganda? Ignore him? Poke fun at him? Pyschoanalyze him?</p>
   <p>The "Jewish leaders" of whom the Dearborn Independent speaks, have been at a loss to know how to meet the Ford attack. There are phases in the answer which would be very amusing, and to deal with them seriously would be unthinkable. If Ford were not the wealthiest and, in many respects, the most typical as well as the most unique citizen in America--if he were not enormously popular and tremendously influential, the soundest tactics would be to leave him alone. I myself was inclined toward this view. But the situation is by no means a simple one. Ford's indubitable mechanical genius, his undreamed of riches, and the power which his money gives him for good or ill, makes him a terribly dangerous man to combat. His mere possession of such wealth automatically gives wide circulation to any imbecility he pleases to emit, and gives him access to sources of publicity for ideas that, coming from anyone else, would be laughed at. Not Ford's ideas, but the tremendous publicity his wealth can give to dangerous and ridiculous misstatements is dangerous.</p>
   <p>To accept Ford's accusation lying down is impossible. It is unthinkable. It <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>is suicidal. Our very near future in the United States depends, in a measure, on the manner in which we resent the Ford anti-Semitic propaganda. We cannot ignore it, for you cannot ignore the personality of Henry Ford. In many respects it is a winning personality. His popularity is by no means undeserved. But precisely because he possesses many admirable traits and is the typical American in the eyes of America, his inexplicable and entirely unfounded attacks must be dealt with in the most effective way possible.</p>
   <p>To remain silent about this would be a degenerating influence on our own character. We stand in danger of losing our self-respect. Eternal vigilance is the price of self-respect. We American Jews owe it to ourselves and to our children who will come after us to insist on being treated on an equal basis with other American citizens. We should be dignified without being arrogant. It is not part of our business to search the mind of every gentile for possible traces of anti-Jewish sentiment. We cannot compel men to love us. An inadvertent statement awakening an anti-Jewish sentiment should be ignored. But our attitude to an organized, anti-Jewish movement is another thing altogether.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>With Ford, his anti-Jewish propaganda is no inadvertance, no slip of the tongue, and no accident. It is well-organized and well-financed.</p>
   <p>Aaron Sapiro claims to have been libeled by Ford as a man and as a Jew. He sued Ford; and after two years he finally succeeded to bringing the automobile manufacturer into court. Ford's conduct at the trial has been a diverting spectacle. Gone is the heroic attitude of the man who charged the Jewish leaders with cowardice. His own conduct has been anything but heroic. The victory belongs to the Jews, even though the jury may fail to award Sapiro the customary damages of six cents.</p>
