   <p>The executive board of the International Association of Retail Clerks issued a statement yesterday to the effect that it will no longer be affiliated with nor recognize Local 195, due to the disclosures of an investigation of its business agent, Leon Green.</p>
   <p>The main officials of the international organization say that as long as Green is business agent or has any connection whatsoever with the aforementioned local, the International will not accept per capita tax, and literally withdraws the charter from Local 195.</p>
