   <p>All the workers of the Continental shops, Jackson Blvd. and Desplaines Street, walked out on strike yesterday. The workers have strongly complained against the poor conditions and the continual wage cuts. Yet they hoped that the bosses would realize their maltreatment and do something to bring about peace and satisfaction among their workers.</p>
   <p>Instead, conditions became worse. Two of the workers were discharged in that shop, yesterday, for being active in organizational work. This brought about a protest - the workers demanded that the two discharged workers be put back to work. The bosses refused this demand, and the 250 workers of that shop went out on strike.</p>

   <p>"We are prepared and determined to carry this strike to a victorious end," says Mr. Frank Rosenbloom of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. "The bosses are forcing us to strike, and if we have no other way to ameliorate our deplorable conditions, we must take the only alternative that workers have, and that is through a strike."</p>
   <p>This morning the workers of all the Continental shops will be called out on strike and with united strength demand that the bosses put the two discharged workers back to work.</p>
   <p>The atmosphere is full of strike in tailoring circles, and it is looked upon as the beginning of a general strike. Trouble is expected in the shops of Hirsh Wikweir, where it is said that "ready-made" garments made by scabs, were received from Boston, where the tailor workers are also on strike. The Chicago workers will demand that this scab work be returned to Boston.</p>
