   <p>The bakery workers of Chicago are going to strike against night work. The strike will occur the 26th of April. The officials of the bakery workers brought in a resolution to the American Federation of Labor, asking to help them morally and financially, and asked the bakery owners to come to a conference with the Bakers Union, in which they will be able to settle matters with them, but the owners refused. There was no other way to settle this night-work question, but to strike. They were not to return to work until they have won their rights and the owners have recognized the demands of the union.</p>
