   <p>In many industrial centers in America unemployment is increasing day by day. Hundreds of thousands of workers are going around idle and a severe winter stands before them. The number of unemployed is increasing, whereas the demand for commodities has not decreased. America is still the chief source of supplies for all of Europe, and should the Russian trade be opened to America tomorrow, there wouldn't be enough workers in this country to produce the commodities which America would be able to sell. If the high cost of living is caused by a lag in production, then why do the manufacturers permit hundreds of thousands of workers to go around idle?</p>
   <p>The truth is that the sudden rise of unemployment, which is particularly felt in the East, is not a natural one; it is not the result of overproduction, it is an artificial rise, just as the high price of coal and sugar is not natural but artificial.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>If there is a lag in production in this country which causes the high cost of living, it is not because there is no market for commodities, but because the captains of industry want to produce a scarcity in order to maintain the high prices of their commodities. Thus, for instance, the cotton barons of the South decided to reduce the production of cotton sixty per cent in order to maintain the high prices. Many large industries are purposely not producing enough commodities because from the standpoint of their profits, it pays them to sell less at a greater profit than to sell more at a smaller profit. This tactic is not only a conspiracy on the part of the profiteers against the working class, which suffers terribly from the production lag, but against the middle class as well. But the lag in production caused by these profiteering motives still does not explain the growing unemployment.</p>
   <p>There is still another reason for the increase in the number of unemployed. Many manufacturers, especially those who are able to take the risk, are now seeking by various tricks to compel the workers to accept today the wages of 1914, and thus nullify the economic progress of the workers for the past six <span class="page-break">3</span>years. In order to promote their reactionary plan, they are employing the method of an economic holdup. They say to the worker: "Either you accept the wages of 1914, or we shall close the factory, because otherwise we will be unable to keep our factories open!" The worker is then given the choice: Either he and his family must go hungry or he must accept lower wages.</p>
   <p>In many small industries the workers have already yielded, because the unions were not strong enough to carry on the struggle. In the larger industries the struggle is being quietly carried on. The workers, realizing what such a capitulation would mean for their future, refuse to yield. The manufacturers are not making an issue out of it--they simply close the factories. They do not say that the workers are not entitled to their present scale of wages. On the contrary, they make a pious face and state that they even sympathize with the workers, but unfortunately they are compelled to close their factories, and--they stick to their word.</p>
   <p>Should the workers yield, then the whole effort of organized labor for the past <span class="page-break">4</span>six years to elevate the standard of living of the workers, would be lost. What is more, should the workers yield now, they will be selling themselves, body and soul, to the bosses forever. Tomorrow, or a day after, the bosses can think the matter over again and propose to the workers that they either accept lower wages or the factories will be closed.</p>
   <p>The unemployment prevailing at present indicates that a quiet struggle is going on between capital and labor. The struggle is dangerous for both factions, for capital and for labor. When the struggle is an open one, then a third faction--the public--can emerge and exercise its powerful influence, and can force capital and labor to settle their dispute. In all the large strikes of recent years, the broad masses have been in sympathy with the workers. But when the struggle is a quiet one, the public does not have the opportunity of exercising its influence and the poor worker must suffer in silence.</p>
   <p>This quiet struggle is more dangerous to capital than to labor, because destructive elements crop out in such a struggle, and if the representatives of <span class="page-break">5</span>capitalism think that they will restrain the development of radicalism by quietly choking the workers, they are again proving their shortsightedness. [Such a policy] shows that they have learned nothing from the events of the past three years. The Bolsheviks in Russia would never have attained power if the despotic government, in alliance with capital, had not quietly suppressed the workers.</p>
   <p>Where the worker is given a free hand to fight out his economic struggle openly, Bolshevism is a stillborn child. This can be seen in Italy, where strong groups of workers seized whole industries and attempted to establish factory soviets. The Italian Government did not lose its head; it did not shoot down the radical workers, but left them to experiment in peace. The result was that the Italian Government succeeded in mediating between both factions and establishing order without bloodshed.</p>
   <p>Only where capital attempts to suppress labor quietly do destructive elements creep in, and then capital suffers the most. The method being used by the bosses <span class="page-break">6</span>to make the workers submissive--starvation wages or a lockout--is a criminally shortsighted tactic which will soon punish itself. To use an old axiom: [It is] not the possession of power, but its misuse that creates trouble in the world.</p>
