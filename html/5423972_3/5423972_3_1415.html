   <p>North West Side Branch Opens Wide Campaign For Members.</p>
   <p>The comrades of the North West Side approached the work of renewing the activities for the coming Winter, at a meeting Wednesday evening in the Socialist Institute.</p>
   <p>The meeting was well attended and new members were enrolled. Among the new recruits in our ranks, are, now, counted the vice-president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and one of the well known Cloak-Makers leaders, Hyman Schulman, also Rudin and other leaders. They were for some time, with heart and soul, Socialists, but until now they were merely sympathizers. Now, they have stepped into our movement and will become active members, and we can expect much from them.</p>
   <p>With their joining our movement, they have only made the beginning of the campaign, which will soon be undertaken in order to get the masses <span class="page-break">\2</span>of cloakmakers into our party. At present a campaign is carried on among the members of the Workmen's Circls.</p>
   <p>A similar campaign will be carried on, later, among the Amalgamated members and the other organized and non-organized Jewish workers of Chicago.</p>
