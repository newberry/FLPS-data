   <p>Mr. Herman H. Newberger, owner of the Royal Knitting Mills, 846 West Jackson Boulevard, whose workers have been on strike for over three weeks, signed an agreement with the union yesterday and immediately regretted having done so.</p>
   <p>This bit of news was related by Mr. M. Rappaport, leader of the union which negotiated the settlement with Mr. Newberger. The sweater workers who are on strike, will fight until they have achieved a final victory.</p>
   <p>Strikers of the Royal Knitting Mills will leave their picket lines at nine o'clock in the morning, and will gather at union headquarters; at three o'clock in the afternoon, they are to hold a mass meeting of all the strikers in the hall at 1145 Blue Island Avenue. Important problems will be discussed.</p>
