   <p>Miss Fannie Cohen, organizer and one of the leaders of a strike of workers at Steinberg and Sopkin, has related a story as to how two bosses used certain ugly methods against the strikers. Some time ago a certain young woman, a Miss Stella Fiesco, who was out on a strike, turned scab and took out a warrant for the arrest of Harry Feferman, Bessie Sneider and Sarah Langer. When the case against Feferman came up for trial, Stella Fiesco failed to appear in court and of course the innocent defendant was released. The cases against the two girls were put off for the next day. Miss Cohen believes that these arrests were made for the purpose of scaring the strikers. But the bosses are very much mistaken, for the strikers are determined to fight their battle to the last ditch, and the union will prefer charges against Stella Fiesco for false arrest of the innocent Feferman and the two girls.</p>
   
   <p>Another warrant of arrest was served yesterday on Anna Margolis for picketing in front of the shop. The strikers will get financial assistance from the International and also from other unions in all Chicago. The Milk Drivers Union has already contributed $200 to the strikers' fund for the girls of Steinberg and Sopkin's shop. A mass meeting is being held today by all the strikers at the headquarters hall, where the report is being read of conditions in the strike against Steinberg and Sopkin.</p>
