   <p>The representatives of the organized Jewish workers of Chicago have undertaken the raising of a large fund for cooperative enterprise. The plan is as follows: Every labor organization, trade union, workmen's circle branch or other organization which is affiliated with the United Cooperatives will give a dollar for each of its members, to the cooperation fund.</p>
   <p>Each organization has the right to its own method for recieving its money from the membership. The fund must be raised within five weeks. Organizations which cannot advance the money from its own treasuries can collect it in small installments from its membership. This should be completed within four weeks.</p>
   <p>Delegates of a membership of 25,000 were present at this conference and the delegates of an equal number were absent. Each organization which contributes $1.00 per member will receive shares for its contribution. If an organization has 100 members, it will receive 10 shares and it will be entitled to one delegate per share to the conference of the United Cooperative. The greater the membership, the greater the contribution, therefore the greater its number of shares, the the greater its number of delegates, and the greater its voice in the determination of the cooperative policy.</p>
