   <p>The strike now going on at Byron Bros., manufacturers of the High Sovereign Cigar, will probably be settled today, through the efforts of Comrade Rosenthal, who sold Byron Bros. cigars before the strike, and the Secretary of the United Hebrew Trades, who succeeded in bringing together Mr. Byron of Byron Brothers and a Committee of the striking Cigarmakers in his shop.</p>
   <p>Mr. Byron agreed to meet a Committee of his workers and a representative of the United Hebrew Trades at two o'clock this afternoon in Rosenthal's Restaurant, and try to end this strike, which has been in progress for a few weeks.</p>
   <p>The Byron Brothers Cigar Company can gain the friendship of all the Workers, and will, itself, surely not be a loser by ending the strike with the Amalgamated Cigarmakers' Union.</p>
