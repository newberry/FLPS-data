   <p>Skirt makers call a mass meeting to organize their trade. - Cigar makers still out on strike. - Significance of their present strike to their trade. - Four thousand painters strike.</p>
   <p>The skirt and cloak makers union has made rapid stride in the organization of their trade. Various sub-locals have been organized and are functioning admirably. It is hoped that they shall be a separate local with their own charter.</p>
   <p>The cigar makers are now in their fourth week in their strike to gain their demands. In spite of the hardships inflicted upon the strikers by the bosses and by the police who stand by the bosses, and in spite of the fact that the union is a poor one with very little financial backing, the strikers have carried on nobly and bravely. With such spirit that they have displayed, they will surely win their strike. This strike is very significant to the whole cigar making industry <span class="page-break">2</span>in that it is the first strike of the Progressive Cigar Makers Union, carried on in such a large factory and in which so many workers are taking part.</p>
   <p>If the strike is won, it will no doubt have an influence upon the entire industry in both large and small shops. The demand now is for the recognition of the union, a very important step for the workers.</p>
   <p>4,000 painters and decorators declared a strike last Friday evening in Chicago. The reason for the strike is the expiration of the agreement on April 1st, between the workers and the bosses and contractors. The workers also demand a raise from 55 to 60 cents per hour. Many bosses have signed the new agreement for 60 cents an hour and it is expected that this demand will be universally met in a short time. Many bosses fear that if they do not consent to the new demands they will have trouble with the building trades workers who are prepared to go out on a sympathy strike. There is much work in the painters and <span class="page-break">3</span>decorators trade at this time, and since the workers are very strongly organized we see a speedy victory and settlement of the strike for the workers.</p>
