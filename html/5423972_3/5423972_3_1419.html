   <p>A large intelligent audience assembled at Rosenthal's Restaurant, at an affair given by the Ladies Auxiliary for the Tool Campaign, last Saturday night. In the audience, many familiar faces could be seen, belonging to Jewish radical social workers.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Ehrenreich was Chairman of the evening. After explaining the purpose of the meeting, he introduced Mr. I. Yokelson, who recently returned from Europe, and who spoke on conditions affecting Jews in Russia and Poland. He ended with an appeal for the Tool Campaign for the people.</p>
   <p>A very touching speech was made by Comrade Dr. Z. Lorber, explaining that it was our duty, as human beings, an obligation as Jews, for us to help in this noble work. This appeal influenced about thirty of the guests to become members of the campaign committee. This almost completed the campaign committee of the first one-hundred members, the chairman announced.</p>

   <p>A speech full of humor, but deeply earnest was delivered by Mr. Flentcher, who succeeded in having each one of this committee pledge at least three hours each day for the Tool campaign. The evening ended after a rendering of a few musical and literary numbers. Miss Mary Tubin, violinist, accompanied by Gertrude Sabin at the piano, played several selections and were highly applauded. The recitation of B. Gordon and M. Mason aroused much enthusiasm. Mr. Mathews sang some beautiful songs, accompanied by his brother, at the piano. Before the entertainment ended, the suggestion of Comrade S. P. Cramer was approved, that such affairs as this should be arranged for every two weeks through the Tool Campaign.</p>
   <p>The conference for the election of delegates to the National Convention of the Peoples Relief will be held Sunday, July 30. All organizations combined with the Peoples Relief are invited to send two delegates each. The conference will have to determine what stand the Chicago Peoples Relief shall take in this, the most important question that the convention will have to decide.</p>
