   <p>One of the most difficult problems now facing the organized workers, is that of organizing the salesmen of the furniture stores, the inside workers, the salesmen of the big department stores, the grocery stores, the fruit stores, the butter and egg stores, the salesmen of the shoe stores, Gents Furnishings stores, and all other different workers, like office workers, stenographers, and bookkeepers of the above mention stores.</p>
   <p>This is one of the most difficult problems, which the organized workers, soon or later, must answer. Thousands of workers are busy in the above mention stores, in all the three districts: Northwest Side, Lawndale district, and what is called the West Side, which extends from Canal to Robey Street.</p>
   
   <p>Regardless of the difficulties of the problem, it can be solved, if the existing unions of the salesmen, the retail clerks, the furniture salesmen, the new small union of furniture store workers, the United Hebrew Trade, and the larger unions like the Amalgamated and Cloak Makers, would get together and to work out a general organized plan, beginning in one district with oral, and written propaganda, till they succeed, and then report the same procedure in the second and third districts.</p>
   <p>The individual unions of these trades, at best, are not strong enough to organize the sales people in these trades. It requires a great propaganda campaign to make the Jewish people alert, and to awaken the white collar men, and the sales-ladies, who do not think about their own condition. The organized Jewish workers are able to effect the organization of the workers in every store.</p>
