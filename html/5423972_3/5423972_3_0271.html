   <p>Jewish Teachers are Sending Demands.</p>
   <p>The wages received by the Jewish teachers in Chicago are not sufficiently in accord with the high cost of living, and are also much lower than those of the Jewish teachers of other cities.</p>
   <p>After thoroughly discussing this question, the Aguda (Teachers Union) have reached a decision to send out the following demands to all the Talmud Torahs: 1. A raise of $20.00 per month for each teacher. 2. A minimum of $90.00 per month for those who teach and translate, and $120.00 per month for those teaching Hebrew exclusively. 3. New teachers, also teachers not belonging to the Union, shall receive the minimum. 4. Saturday shall be a day of rest for every teacher. 5. No boys shall take the place of a teacher.</p>
   <p>The Talmud Torahs are to answer on these demands not later than April 8th. It was also passed that no member of the Union, shall teach in a Talmud Torah or school where strike breakers are hired.</p>
   <p>In the Name of the Union.</p>
