   <p>Apollo Hall, 262 Blue Island Avenue, was filled last night by representatives of the old Jewish socialistic societies to protest against the action of Adolph Kraus and other members of the committee who asked the intercession of M. Witte in behalf of the Jews in Russia, and to condemn the officers of the Anshe Kanesses Israel Synagogue for the occurrences in that house on Sunday, September 24.</p>
   <p>A resolution was adopted protesting against "the disgraceful action of the congregation" and certain English papers of Chicago "that circulated false and fanatic rumors against the Jews of Chicago regarding the affair in the Synagogue."</p>
   <p>The resolution also expressed the heartiest sympathy for Russian Jews and tendered hopes for success in the fight for liberty against the bureaucracy. Among the speakers were John H. Copland, Philip Rabinoditz, A. Litman, Morris Siskind, and L. Albert.</p>
