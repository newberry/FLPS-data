   <p>The holiday mood that prevailed at the opening of the fifth bi-annual convention of the Amalgamated, kept up at yesterday's session that was devoted mainly to various greetings. The most important of those greetings was the one received from Eugene V. Debs, who expressed his regret that he could not personally attend the convention because of his poor health. The audience received Mr. Debs' greeting enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>Speeches of greeting were delivered by Charles Irving, editor of the New York Call, Robert Minor, contributor to the Liberator, Peter Zussman, attorney for the Amalgamated, and Benjamin Gitlow, who has just been freed from the [Federal] penitentiary where he was incarcerated for two-and-a-half years on the charge of disloyalty.</p>
   <p>Robert Minor, in his usual oratorical manner, brought greetings from Bolshevik Russia, where he spent considerable time studying the local political and economic life. He told about the protests that the Russian workers have staged against the American government for putting Mooney and Billings into prison, how they demanded the release of Eugene V. Debs, and how they were fighting now for the freedom of the two Italian labor leaders, Sacco and Vanzetti, who are now in prison under a death sentence.</p>
   <p>"The Russian workers have always been interested in our struggles," declared Mr. Minor, "and now, when they find themselves in such a terrible economic condition, it is our sacred duty to help them as much as our means will permit."</p>
   <p>Benjamin Gitlow spoke in the name of the "Political Defense League". He appealed to the convention for financial help to keep up the struggle for the freeing of the one hundred and fourteen political prisoners who are still incarcerated in various Federal penitentiaries.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gitlow's speech was warmly applauded by the delegates. Mr. Sidney Hillman, international president of the Amalgamated, announced that Mr. Gitlow's appeal would be turned over to the finance committee.</p>
   <p>A demonstration that made a deep impression took place at yesterday's session. The demonstration was to honor the memory of the Chicago members of the Amalgamated who had lost their lives in the heoric struggle of 1910-1911. Mr. Joseph Schlossberg, the general secretary of the Amalgamated, spoke a few serious, and moving words about this. All the delegates and several hundred guests arose from their seats and with bowed heads, expressed their sorrow at the death of their comrades. A large band played a funeral march, which heightened the impression that the demonstration made.</p>
   <p>A storm of applause, similar to the one which took place at the opening session of the convention, broke out when Mr. Schlossberg was introduced to the convention. All the delegates and guests arose again from their places, and applauded heartily for a long time, thereby expressing their love and respect for their great leader. Their applause served also as an expression of their strong protest against the dark powers which are leading a boycott against Mr. Schlossberg.</p>
   <p>Another impressive scene, of an entirely different nature, took place yesterday at the convention. A demonstration of greeting was staged by the cutters and trimmers of Hart, Schaffner and Marx, many of whom had experienced the great struggle of 1910. This group of workers marched into the hall with a huge floral stand, which they presented to the convention. Frank Rosenbloom, former organizer of this union local, spoke about the devotion, willingness to sacrifice, and sense of solidarity which the workers had shown during that historic fight, and introduced the first chairman of that local, Mr. Mike Rose.</p>
   <p>The credentials committee then turned in its report, recommending the recognition of all the delegates with the exception of three, against whom objections had been made and whose cases the committee would consider later.</p>
   <p>A "rules committee" was then elected, consisting of the following persons:</p>
   
   <p>Alfred Boden of Boston, Ben Herman of Cincinnati, Louis Stein of New York, J. Soborin of Montreal, Max Lukman of Baltimore, Isaac Kessler of Philadelphia, F. Roso of Rochester, and V. Wisocky and Michael Rini of New York.</p>
   <p>There was no session in the afternoon. All the delegates were guests of the Chicago Amalgamated which had arranged an extraordinary and varied program of entertainment for them. The delegates had dinner at the Oriental Consistory where the convention is taking place. Then they took a walk to Lincoln Park, which is only a few blocks from the convention hall. Pictures of the delegates were taken at Lincoln Park. From there they went on an automobile ride to Whiting, Indiana, where an elaborate supper was served to them. Then the delegates went home, in a happy mood.</p>
   <p>Today's session of the convention will open at nine-thirty in the morning and will last till twelve noon. The second session will last from one-thirty till five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
