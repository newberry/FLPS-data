   <p>At a special session Friday, June 20, the City Central Committee of the Jewish Socialist Branches of Chicago decided to reorganize a few party branches. After hearing the report of the last meetings of the West Side, Douglas Park, Karl Marx, and Karl Liebrecht branches, the Central Committee found no other expedient than reconstructing the organization on a sound party basis. The branches decided: (1). That the comrades belonging to the left wing do not want to resign from their organization, but they want to continue submitting to the discipline of an organization foreign to the party and to the Federation. (2). Such a condition makes the work of the City Central Socialist Party impossible and creates hatred, disorganization, and inactivity in our branches and among our members.</p>
   <p>The City Central Committee proposed a resolution permitting the branches to agitate and propagandize the various principles, opinions of the party in a few ranks and in the press. But at the same time, the City Central Committee demands that no one should belong to any other faction and should not attend other caucus meetings, which exclude the possibility of party discussions and mutual agreements.</p>
   
   <p>The "left wing" voted the proposal down and opposed the discipline of the Federation and the spirit of the Socialist Party. If the Central Committee would permit these conditions to prevail the Jewish Socialist movement would be demoralized and torn asunder. Therefore it is necessary to reorganize the Jewish party branches.</p>
   <p>The following terms are the basis of reorganizing the branches and the Federation: No member is permitted to belong to the left wing movement. No member is permitted to denounce the platform of the Socialist Party, which is now in force; and is not to indorse any platform, which is recognized by the left wing. Every member who wants to belong to the branches and Federation must pledge himself to support the referendum recognizing the Boston Convention of the Federation. All those, who are willing to uphold these clauses, will remain members of the branches and Federation. All those, who will not support these clauses, are expelled from the Federation and may not attend meetings of the reorganized branches. The Central Committee appointed the following reorganization committee: Schneid Backal, Ziskind, Gallant and John Mill, translating secretary of the Federation. This committee will have the right to call meetings and reorganize the branches.</p>
