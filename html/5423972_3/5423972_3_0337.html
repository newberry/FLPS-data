   <p>The Jewish turners met last Sunday and organized a union of their trade. They immediately elected officers to conduct the organization's activities.</p>
   <p>As in all other unorganized trades, the workers in this trade have labored under bad conditions. But now they realize that in a short time their union will be in a position to improve their [working] conditions and to insure their getting better treatment from the bosses.</p>
   <p>Jewish turners of Chicago will hold a meeting next Sunday at 1144 South Halsted Street.</p>
