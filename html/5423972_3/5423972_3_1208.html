   <p>The Jewish Co-Operative Press of Chicago Divides $1500</p>
   <p>Profit Among Labor Organizations - By Morris Ziskind</p>
   <p>It is two and one-half years that not a word has been said in the Forward about the Labor World Press, the printing-shop which was donated by the Forward to the Workmen's Circle, the United Hebrew Trades, and the Socialist Party branches.</p>
   <p>Two and one-half years ago the Press was worth a few thousand dollars. It has grown in value, and today it is valued as between seven and eight thousand dollars. This has arisen from the profit which the press has made during this period.</p>
   <p>The years 1920 was a very good one for the the Press. New machinery has been purchased and more work was done. The profit was $3,000.</p>
   <p>The printing committee which is composed of delegates from the three central labor-bodies, has decided to give each body $500 of the profit, and $1500 is to remain in the business.</p>
