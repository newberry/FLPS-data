   <p>We, the officers of the Shockets' Union, Local 508, state that we have not received any invitation from the rabbis, to a Conference. Our Union is not a hidden organization, and it is at all times ready to acquaint all classes of the local population with its activities and its program.</p>
   <p>If the rabbis wish to meet us and discuss the Kashrath (Dietary Food Laws) we will be ready at any time to meet with them, as soon as we will be summoned.</p>
