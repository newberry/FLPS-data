   <p>The United Hebrew Trades was officially extablished last Sunday (August 3, 1913). It is composed of trade unions in order to carry on trade union work among the Jewish laboring masses of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Eleven trade unions were represented at the first organizational meeting, i.e., three quarters of the existing unions. Those present according to the roll call were: Independent Painters Union, Bakers Local 337, Garment Workers Local 39, Garment Workers Local 193, Garment Workers Local 197, Ladies Tailor Local 71, Furriers Union, Progressive Cigar Makers Union, Cloak Makers Union 44, Cap Makers Union Local 504.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy discussion on the necessity of a Jewish united body, it was unanimously noted that such a body should be established. They elected a secretary - treasurer, Mr. Kaufman, and a committee of seven to elaborate the by-laws for the functioning of that body.</p>
   <p>The committee will give a report at the next meeting, Sunday, August 10, in the office of the Ladies Tailor Union, 1125 Blue Island Avenue, where, it is expected that all Jewish unions will be represented, and practical work will begin.</p>

   <p>In the discussion, at the last meeting, several delegates of the unions, who are, so to speak, new faces, fell into the error of thinking that the United Hebrew Trades is an antagonistic body to the Chicago Federation of Labor. On the contrary, a United Hebrew Trades is a means of strengthening the existing unions composing the Federation and for building up new unions for the Federation.</p>
   <p>A United Hebrew Trades is a necessity for the interests of the Jewish workers. Nothing can so successfully reach the thousands of Jewish workers, whether organized or unorganized, as a united body of Jewish unions. And no one can feel the dreadful condition of the Jewish worker other than the Jewish worker himself. A body which understands and adapts itself to the psychology, conditions, and languages of the Jewish toiling masses, can successfully carry out the necessary organizational work to help improve and strengthen the ranks of the Jewish toilers.</p>
   <p>In the organized trade unions of the building trades, it is simply part of their life's enjoyment to insult, sneer, ridicule and even beat their Jewish "brothers".</p>
   <p>But much to our regret, our International becomes angered if we point out such Jew-baiting. They will point out, with facts, that such sort of treatment is a product of ignorance.</p>
   <p>How much blood and tears are shed by Jewish workers daily in all parts of the <span class="page-break">3</span>country from their gentile brothers? Need the Jewish workers actually tolerate this? Where is the human self-respect? Where is it written that we should be a tool in the hands of drunkards and ignorant ruffians?</p>
