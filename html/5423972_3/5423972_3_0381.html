   <p>At last night's meeting of the United Hebrew Trades, which represents all Jewish unions in Chicago, a mighty protest was expressed against a certain Pole who is running for congressman in the 5th Congressional District against the popular Jewish candidate, Congressman Adolph J. Sabath.</p>
   <p>Mr. Donkawscy has shown himself to be a man of very weak principles. It is an accepted maxim that even the most reactionary person detests a scab. However, Donkawscy apparently loves a scab and uses "campaign literature" printed in a scab printing shop without a union label.</p>
   
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades fulfilled its obligation as a body of Jewish organized workers. They revealed to the public that Donkawscy is a great admirer of scabs and scabbery. That alone, among many other reasons, is sufficient for a Jewish voter not to cast his vote for a man who disbelieves in progress and is an ardent supporter of everything reactionary and vile.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades determined to send out letters enclosing samples of the Donkawscy literature, calling attention to the names appearing on scab letters. The Jewish public will fully know who Congressman Sabath's opponent is. It would be desirable if Jewish business men, using circulars and letter heads, should demand the union label and thereby assist the United Hebrew Trades, which protects the interests of the Jewish workers.</p>
