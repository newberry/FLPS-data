   <p>The conference which was called by the United Hebrew trades, concerning the organizational campaign for the unorganized workers, was held yesterday at the Workmen's Circle Lyceum, where many Unions were represented by delegates and officers. Comrade Lerner, of the Jewish compositors, was appointed chairman.</p>
   <p>Morris Zeskind of the United Hebrew Trades Organization Committee, explained the purpose of the conference. He related the condition of the working class, enumerating the causes that weakened the strong unions and broke the small unions. He showed the necessity for all workers, organized or unorganized, to carry on intensive agitation, or organization among the Jewish working masses. Many representatives of unions partook in the discussions concerning this issue. Several criticized the present form of organization in the Unions, which hinders them in protecting the unions that are on strike, because their international unions are organized on the basis of craft unions. They proposed that the United Hebrew Trades carry on an educational-campaign, to the effect that the Unions of industries should not oppose each other, but cooperate solidly against the common enemy.</p>
