   <p>A union of the following trades was organized for the first time in Chicago. It comprised the ladies waist workers, dresses, white goods, kimonos, petticoats, and children dresses.</p>
   <p>This occurred last Thursday evening at a huge mass meeting of workers of these trades. Many responded to the speakers declarations that the sole way to better their condition was through uniting into a union. They paid their admission fee and organized the Ladies Waist and Underwear Union, in affiliation with the International Ladies Garment Workers.</p>
   
   <p>The installation of officers will take place, Friday evening, in the Palace Opera Building, Blue Island Avenue at 12th Street, in Hall B, second floor. At this meeting a charter will be given to the Union and election of officers will take place.</p>
