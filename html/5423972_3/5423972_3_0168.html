   <p>The Cap-makers of Chicago will receive a 10% cut in their pay envelope, commencing June 27th. That was the decision of the impartial chairman, James Mullenbauch, Chairman of the Board of Arbitration. The Chicago cap-manufacturers demanded a reduction of 25% in wages, but president Zaretsky, representative of the Union, defended the workers by opposing. Mr. Mullenbauch opposed the standard of production.</p>
   <p>This 10% cut will not effect the operators, who earn $35 a week or less, cutters and blockers, who earn $40 a week or less, lining makers and trimmers, who earn $23 a week or less.</p>
