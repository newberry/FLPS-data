   <p>Sister and brother overall makers! Do not be mislead by those seeking to mislead you. Sister and brother workers! We were suffering constantly at work in a twofold manner; not only from our employers but also from our opposing union, the United Garment Workers. True, we were always discontented, but we were unable to do anything because we had no outlet to better our conditions and were forced to work under unbearable conditions. Several of our brothers died prematurely of tuberculosis. Why? Because we were helpless against our twofold enemy, and whenever one of us dared to demand better and humane treatment he was discharged from the shop. Since we had nobody to turn to for support, we broke our pride and returned to the same shop, where we felt so humiliated and insulted.</p>
   <p>The result was that the employers together with the scab agency, the United Garment Workers, attained their object. They deprived us from our most prized possession, our consciousness. We formed a slave psychology at work and we believed that the best thing for us was to be submissive and even thankful to the boss, who grants us a living. And in such manner <span class="page-break">2</span>we worked a couple of decades under the worst conditions.</p>
   <p>Through an evolutionary process, the overall workers awoke and considered our conditions from various angles. We have seen that in time a union developed of the workers and for the workers, and that is - the Amalgamated - and the Amalgamated does not permit any discharging of workers from the shops and demands Saturday shops for the workers. The question arose, if the Amalgamated can do that, why can't the United Garment Workers?</p>
   <p>New disputes were created, when the workers showed dissatisfaction with the present order. But the employers and the United Garment Union silenced the voices of our few revolutionists and thus began new trouble. The employers discharged the workers from the shops. The United Garment Workers did not spoil us by fining our workers $25.00 and more than a few were pardoned with charges of $5.00 This occurred in 1915, when the great tailor strike, under the Amalgamated banner, took place and the scab agency, the United Garment Workers, sent out scabs to break the strike. Then, for the first time, our workers stepped out as a class-conscious body in a protest against violations of our opposing union leaders. Since then the hope of <span class="page-break">3</span>our workers was to enroll in the Amalgamated Union, a union that represents the workers and not the bosses. Finally our dream materialized. Nothing could withhold the will of the overall workers. And now three weeks have passed since the workers went on strike under the banner of the Amalgamated Workers of Chicago. No bosses nor scab agencies will break our strike and our strike will be written to the many victories of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, because all workers are determined to fight under the banner of the Amalgamated to a victorious end.</p>
   <p>With workers respect,</p>
   <p>A Group of Strikers.</p>
