   <p>Not every reader could understand the Rabbi Jacobson's article "Every Pious Jew Must Be A Socialist," in yesterday's issue of the Daily World. But everyone is interested in the phenomena that there is found in Chicago a Jewish rabbi who declares himself publicly as a Socialist.</p>
   <p>We have had until now, political rabbis, or bootblacks to the worst sort of social leaders. But we never had a rabbi, here, who could have the courage to declare to young and old that, "Every Pious Jew Must Be A Socialist." In Chicago we see rabbis open their synagogues to the lowest types of politicians.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, pleasant to see that there are also pious Jews in Chicago, who cling to the ancient Jewish law of Moses and the Prophets. We trust that the pious Jews will from now on, spread their socialism in the synagogues, Hebrew schools, and theological colleges, and will also win the respect of free thinkers.</p>
