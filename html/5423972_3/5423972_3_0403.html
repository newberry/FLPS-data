   <p>Mr. Kogut, the manager of the New York theater union, known as the "White Rats," has been successful in his mission. He has united the local theaters, sections two and three, into one union. To thank him for his good work, the new United Actors' Union gave a banquet in his honor yesterday evening at Arkin's Hall. Among the guest were Madam Liptzen, Mr. Ellius Rothstone, Jacob Cohen and many other actors from section one.</p>
