The purpose of these meetings is to protest against the recognition of Kolchak by the Allies, to demand that the allied army be called back from Russia and Hungary, to stop the blockade of revolutionary countries in Europe, and to demand the freedom of Eugene V. Debs, Kate Richard, Tom Mooney, Heywood Broun, and all other individual, political and war prisoners.</p>
