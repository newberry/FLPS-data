   <p>The Shochtim, the Kosher animal and fowl slaughterers, are organizing a union.</p>
   <p>The more additional trade workers organize among our Jewish people in Chicago, the more work there will be for the United Jewish Trade Union.</p>
   <p>There are two important things necessary to make a union organization a success: One is, the loyalty of the members and the energetic activities of its delegates; the other is a permanent paid secretary and organizer who knows the art of organizing, for he, is the life and existence of the organization. Last Sunday's meeting of the United Trade Union passed off as usual, very pleasantly. Many important questions came up for discussion <span class="page-break">\2</span>and quite a number of different resolutions were passed and carried. A committee of the Kosher animal and fowl slaughterers appealed to the United Trade Union to assist them in organizing their union, so that they will get higher wages, shorter work days and better treatment from the bosses of the Jewish butcher shops.</p>
   <p>Living conditions among the Jewish Kosher butchers are most appalling. The Jewish butcher shops are well organized and all they pay the butcher for killing a fowl is from two to three cents a head and in addition to the killing the fowl, they have to do the feather picking also all for the same pay.</p>
   <p>They also have other grievances against the Kosher butcher shop operators, and by organizing in a trade union, they will, without fail, get their wages raised, shorter work days and better treatment.</p>
