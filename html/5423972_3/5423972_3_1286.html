   <p>One of the immediate results of the Haymarket Riot was the formation of a Jewish Workingmen's Educational Club, with its headquarters on Canal street, between Banker and De Koven streets. It was there that the Jewish labor and radical movements of Chicago were born, and where Jewish socialism first instilled spiritual impulses in the lives of the new immigrants.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Workingmen's Educational Club collected a modest library, mainly composed of books on political economy, and of outstanding philosophers, in German, French and English.</p>
   <p>The leading members of the group were Peter Sissman, a prominent lawyer of this city, Dr. Nahin, Abraham Bisno, and Dr. Knopfnagel. The J. W. E. C. did not stay together very long, and two opposite currents of thought soon developed, with two factions springing up. The second faction withdrew its membership from the club and occupied itself with the organization of trade unions.</p>
