   <p>The Ladies Tailors' Union opened a strike against Mr. Jacob Lewitz, 405 E. 43d Street. The cause of the strike was Mr. Lewitz's unwillingness to distribute the work amongst his employees, and his release of four lady-tailors. The Union demanded that he distribute the work amongst the workers in accordance with the Union-rules. When the Union sent back two workers, Mr. Lewitz refused to give them any work. The Union has acknowledged by this that the employers' intentions are to eject the four members from work and force the Union to call a strike.</p>
