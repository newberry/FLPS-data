   <p>The Cap-Makers Association declared a lock-out yesterday in eleven shops, which employ 135 union members. The reason of this look-out was that two manufacturers wanted to introduce section work in their shops paying no attention to the contract with the union, which does not permit it. But the well organized workers of those shops demonstrated their unity and solidarity and stopped working.</p>
   <p>This did not please the employers and they set an ultimatum to the workers - that if they will not return to work within twenty-four hours, the manufacturers of the association will expel all workers employed by them. And that is what was done. They discharged 135 from their eleven shops.</p>
   <p>The Cap-Makers Union naturally raised the banner of war against their employers. All discharged workers stand courageous in their common battle and are assured that the obstinacy of the bosses will break and that they will be victorious.</p>
