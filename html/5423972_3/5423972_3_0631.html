   <p>Ladies' Tailors are victors over their bosses who wanted to break the Union. The bosses, after handing their ultimatum to the Union, forcing them to strike, came to the Union one at a time and signed an agreement.</p>
   <p>The association has disbanded and the ladies' tailors are starting to work Monday under Union conditions which the bosses had hoped to take away from them.</p>
   <p>As soon as Blum &amp; Jacks broke away from the association and signed an agreement with the Union, Rothschild and Blackstone did not waste much time, and also signed an agreement.</p>
   <p>The others, the smaller shops, could't help themselves; they had to sign with the Union.</p>
   <p>The Ladies' tailors were holding a meeting when this news was brought to them.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm was great. The ladies' tailors now realize more than ever before the power of unity.</p>
   <p>They see now what the bosses would have done to them were they not organized.</p>

   <p>Their wages would have been cut, the Union-Shops would have been converted into open shops, and the slavery would have been the same as before their Union was organized.</p>
