   <p>Last Saturday the bakery employer at 517 S. Halsted locked out his Jewish bakers because they demanded a ten-hour day. The workers, indeed, would have won the strike, had not the industrialists stepped in and helped the boss against the strikers. Without a union label, the boss knows very well bread will not be sold, but the industrialists gave him their label. The Jewish bakers in that shop are on strike, and Poles are scabbing there, taking the places of the Jewish union workers.</p>
   <p>We are positive that the boss fooled himself. The public will soon notice that the labels on his bread are of an organization seeking to destroy old unions and its workers when on strike. This will soon force the boss to call back his workers and grant their just demands.</p>
