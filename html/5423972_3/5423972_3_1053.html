   <p>After the cutters of Brier &amp; Dugowski were organized and joined The Amalgamated, they immediately had a desire for a raise in pay. A committee of the workers negotiated with the bosses for a three dollar a week raise.</p>
   <p>The bosses flatly refused this raise. All the cutters, 35 in number, went on strike and after a day and a half, the bosses gave them the raise.</p>
   <p>One of the bosses of this firm is the treasurer of the Tailoring Manufacturer's Association, which is strongly in favor of a blacklist against unionmen, offered $100.00 towards organizing a club for the workers to join instead of belonging to the Amalgamated.</p>
