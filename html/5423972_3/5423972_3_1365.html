   <p>Mr. Clark, the man who helped organize the Ku Klux Klan, sent a letter to President Coolidge, in which he declared that the Klan is a menace for the nation because it practices terror. The spirit prevailing in the Klan is the spirit of criminals and gangsters. It is therefore the duty of the government either to purge or to destroy it entirely.</p>
   <p>Mr. Simons, who was the originator and was also the first "Dictator" or king of the Klan, endorsed all that Mr. Clark stated in his letter, which proves that he admits that the Klan is a criminal organization and a menace to America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Some time ago, there was a split in the Ku Klux Klan. All the original organizers were put out of the way, and their places taken by other people. Those forced out are now carrying on a fight to grasp the organization back into their clutches. In various places in America both factions appeared in court, graft, swindle and corruption is charged against them.</p>
   <p>We do not know which of the two factions is right, but we do know that the open acts of the Klan were the same, when it was in its infancy, and Mr. Clark and Mr. Simons were the bosses, as they are at present, after Clark and Simons lost their control.</p>
   <p>The Klan has, since its first day of existence, preached hatred and terror against Negroes, Jews, Catholics and immigrants, and never has a week passed, since its inception, without a new <span class="page-break">\3</span>terroristic scandal. People were beaten, slugged, crippled, and murdered by the Klan rioters when Simons and Clark were at the head, the same as people are being tortured and murdered at the present time, by the same band of rioters, while others are at the head of the organization.</p>
   <p>Clark, who pretends he is a "Saint," now demands the eradication of the Klan, claiming that he entered this organization from a clean business standpoint. He was formerly an advertising agent, he showed ability in building organizations and business firms that were in difficulties. He accomplished a good deal through various advertising tricks, and Simons invited him to build up the Klan, since the Klan failed to make any progress the first year, and Simons was positive that only through advertising <span class="page-break">\4</span>schemes could the Klan be saved from destruction. Clark received a commission for every member that joined the Klan. It was said that Clark made a fortune during the short time he served as advertising man for the Klan. Experienced publishers, entirely impartial, after thoroughly investigating the history of the Klan, report that the Klan has Clark to be thankful to for its present existence.</p>
   <p>The Klan became popular through his methods, which are the same methods used to make patent medicines popular, i.e., false statements, and fake promises.</p>
   <p>The fights now going on in the Klan are not for a principle, but just for material interests. The Klan has two million members who <span class="page-break">\5</span>pay high dues. This money is being used to pay high salaries to officials and to buy certain uniforms, which are used in organizing various campaigns to help political candidates. Of course, it is understood that anyone who handles a great deal of money is bound to have some of it stick to his fingers. The fact is that every one who was, for any length of time, an executive of that organization, got his share. The members themselves, who pay ten dollars for admission fee, various taxes, assessments, and monthly dues, are not entitled to any benefits whatsoever from the Klan. They are being told that the money is being used to propagandize high ideals. They are also led to believe that they should feel highly honored to have the organization accept their money. The fact is that the millions of dollars coming into that organization is being divided among the officials, the leaders, and their lieutenants.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Yet it appears that Clark's open statements were of vital importance. If anyone does know the true facts of the Klan, it is Clark. If there is anyone that can expose ugly, loathsome and disgraceful secrets of the Klan, it is Clark. But he has only begun to talk. The letter to President Coolidge was perhaps planned as a threat to the gang that forced him out of the organization, and he hopes that they will fear this threat and welcome him back to their clique; but we hope for the contrary, that the present leaders of the Klan will remain stubborn and not fear the threat. This will lead Clark to continue his attacks and he will start bringing evidence to prove all the accusations in his letter. He will present facts that will have some influence on some of the better people who were lured into the Klan, and who were foolish enough to believe that the Klan was actually as innocent and as idealistic as it claimed to be.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>In his letter, Clark claims that the better class of people is deserting the Klan. He also declared that now, more and more wicked people are attracted to the Klan and become members. This process had prevailed in the Klan for a long time. The advertising agents, the boosters, were successful in inducing loyal citizens, especially in small towns, to join the Klan, But these members did not stay in the Klan very long. As soon as they learned the true character of the organization and its activities, they left the Klan, The truth of the role of the Ku Klux Klan was exposed by these very people who left the Klan and took it upon themselves as a duty to warn other loyal citizens to eschew this organization.</p>
