   <p>The local cap-makers, who are now on strike for quite sometime, will soon possess one of the strongest weapons to combat the bosses. They will, namely, be the owners of a cooperative cap shop.</p>
   <p>A plan was drawn up, at the meeting of Cap Makers Local #5, Thursday, for the opening of a cooperative shop. Attorneys Fishbein and Sussman were present and they adjusted the legal side of the great enterprise.</p>
   <p>For the success of this enterprise, a sum of $50,000 is required; $20,000 was raised at the meeting which confirms the assurance that this enterprise will be crowned with great success. Thirty thousand ($30,000) dollars are expected in two weeks.</p>
