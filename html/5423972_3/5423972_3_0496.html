   <p>Eleven-hundred stockholders, members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, assembled in the West Masonic Temple, where they transacted their business and listened to the financial report of the first six months since the bank opened, and elected the board of directors for the year 1923.</p>
   <p>It was most interesting to witness how a mass of workers - union members and bankers came to a meeting to transact the accounts of their own bank, which is a million and a half dollar institution, owned and controlled by themselves. Mr. R. L. Redefer, president of the bank, showed in his report that a profit was being made in the first six months, after paying all expenses for establishing the bank.</p>
   <p>Following the financial report, the stockholders appointed the board of directors. Mr. Redefer was reelected president of the bank; Comrade Sam Levin, manager of the Joint Board, was appointed chairman of the board of directors; Comrade A. Cuneo was appointed as a member of the board of directors. The board of directors consists of the following members:</p>

   <p>Sidney Hillman, Joseph Schossberg, Sam Levin, Frank Rosenblum, W. D. Mariampattao, Sidney Reisman, Sephen Skala, Wm. A. Cuneo, Peter Sussman, J. Kroll and R. L. Redefer.</p>
   <p>The present condition of the bank is very good, considering the short time of its existence. The following accounts show how rapidly the bank is growing: Commercial deposits - $244,932.95; Savings deposits - $727,447.66. The resources of the bank amount to $1,475,377.64.</p>
   <p>Starting this week, the members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers will organize savings clubs in the small tailoring shops. The members will collect the deposits each week in the shops and one will act as a committee in transferring the money to the bank and receiving saving books for all.</p>
