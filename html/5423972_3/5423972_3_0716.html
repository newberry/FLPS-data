   <p>A beginning has been made. The victory won by the organized workers at Alfred Decker and Cohn has opened a new chapter for the garment-workers in Chicago. The time is not so very distant when Chicago will have a permanent organization of garmentworkers under the exclusive control of the Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>There isn't any excuse for the garmentworkers not to organize, and it would be a crime to neglect such a favorable moment. When was there such a time before, when the nation was permeated with such democratic and just feelings, as it is now? When was there ever such a friendly government to labor?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The War has created an atmosphere between the government and the working class, wherein the government has practically reached the realization that when fighting for the democracy of the world it is imperative, first of all, to introduce democracy into your own country. Where industrial autocracy reigns, where the employers have the dominating power over their workers, designating the wage scale, working hours, and the treatment of the workers--this is in contradiction to the War principles, for which millions of young lives are being placed in jeopardy.</p>
   <p>Just as the nation under war conditions is beginning to get acquainted with the idea of industrial democracy, so are reforms, little by little, penetrating into the industries of the country, thanks to the appointment and the organizing by the government of the National War Labor Board, which does commendable work in connection with the settlement of disputes between labor and capital. It also means that they have proclaimed and established <span class="page-break">\3</span>the principle that the workers, who are the real producers, should have at least some voice regarding their life and welfare, as well as in conditions of shop and factory.</p>
   <p>In the last four and a half months, since the existence of this Labor Board, hundreds of disputes were settled, involving hundreds of thousands of workers, both men and women. In every instance where collective transactions with workers had been refused until now, a new ruling was ordered by the Board. This ruling must be followed, because it is a government order.</p>
   <p>Therefore, there is no time more suitable and convenient than now for Chicago tailors to join in the strongly organized tailor union, the Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated Clothing Workers' Union calls and appeals to all clothing workers to join the Union. Since this influential Union was organized, it <span class="page-break">\4</span>did not cease to waken and call the tailors to organize and unite, thereby improving their conditions; but now, since the Amalgamated has shown its strength for so many years in the huge Hart, Schaffner and Marx shops, and at present, at Alfred Decker and Cohn, a stubborn shop of the Association, the last fiery appeal to the clothing workers is being made.</p>
   <p>Next Thursday evening, October 3, a gigantic mass meeting will be held at Harrison and Halsted, where the gifted president of the Amalgamated, Sidney Hillman, will be the main speaker and local speakers like Samuel Levin, Mariampetru, Rissman, Kaminsky, all devoted leaders of the Amalgamated, will speak. Everybody must come to this meeting; do not fear any spying by the bosses; they are already realizing their weakness in the eyes of the nation and the government. Democracy is now the battle cry! Free yourself! Do not be enslaved and persecuted!</p>
   <p>The Chicago cloakmakers under the leadership of the Joint Board of the <span class="page-break">\5</span>Cloakmakers' Unions, which includes Locals 44, 18, and 81, and also with the assistance of other locals of the International like the Raincoat Makers' Union, Ladies Tailors' Union, and Local 100 of the Dress and Skirtmakers' Union, will shortly realize their long dream of having their own headquarters.</p>
   <p>According to the explanation of the special building committee, which administers the fund and directs the activity of erecting the building, the desirable lots will soon be purchased. The sum of sixty-seven thousand dollars, derived from the special two-dollar tax, together with the fifteen-hundred-dollar profit from the picnic, will be enough to purchase the lots.</p>
   <p>While no referendum vote has been taken as yet to determine the location of the building, it seems that it will be located on the Northwest Side, because, under the circumstances, it is the most convenient neighborhood, especially for the cloakmakers. The plans call for the most beautiful and perfect labor institution in the country, a center of education, enlightenment, and personal <span class="page-break">\6</span>comfort for the workers. This building will be the institution not only for the cloakmakers, but for the entire Jewish laboring class of Chicago.</p>
   <p>According to the plan of the committee, courses and classes of elementary education, a gymnasium for body exercises, dental parlors, a dispensary and a reading hall, will be established there. It is to be hoped that the large membership of the cloakmakers' organization in Chicago, as well as all other Jewish workers will assist to the best of their ability in the realization of this beautiful undertaking, which is a necessity to Jewish workers.</p>
