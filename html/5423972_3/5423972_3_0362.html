   <p>They are holding their regular meetings every Friday, and have elected Mr. H. Holtzman, as their temporary secretary.</p>
   <p>A committee of five, elected at the last meeting, has applied to the International before which body they presented their grievances and grounds for a charter for a new local, and although the International was in sympathy with the committee's report, the International could not grant the charter, on account of not desiring to get mixed up in the controversy. So, after receiving the report of the committee, the bakers have decided to lay the matter before the general executive board. They will not leave a stone unturned until they obtain their desired charter. It is unofficially reported that although the International has refused them a new charter, it had to refrain from complying with the committee's request mostly because they were afraid to mix too much in affairs of the locals. Among the Jewish bakers you can find many workers in the large bakeries on the North Side, who also are working in the bakeries of Rosen, Petikon and Himelstein.</p>
