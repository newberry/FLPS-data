   <p>For the first time in the history of the Chicago-Jewish workers' movement, the local Jewish unions are arranging a large picnic. It will take place next Sunday, June 23, at Koltze's Electric Park. The picnic, the committee assures us, will be the finest that Chicago has ever witnessed. Besides the fact that the people will be adequately amused, the Jewish workers will demonstrate the power of the organized workers' movement. It is therefore expected that no Jewish worker--organized or unorganized--will fail to attend this extraordinary workers' holiday. All the proceeds will be used to organize the unorganized workers.</p>
