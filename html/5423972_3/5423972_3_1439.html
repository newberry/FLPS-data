   <p>The Chicago Relief Conference for Soviet Russia, voted, yesterday, to affiliate itself in the recently organized multi-national conference called "Friends of Soviet Russia".</p>
   <p>A Committee had come to the Executive of the Conference, requesting that it join the "Friends of Soviet Russia" and that it transmit all relief monies through that organization. This proposal was brought to the general meeting.</p>
   <p>A discussion was then held, and with the exception of delegate Lurie of the People's Relief, who proposed that all monies should be transmitted through the People's Relief, the delegates held that this matter should not be considered as purely Jewish, and that all money must be sent directly to the Soviet Government.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of this discussion, a financial report was held. A total of $799.50 was announced as the result of this meeting.</p>
