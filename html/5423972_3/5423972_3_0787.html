   <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers Union has taxed its one hundred and fifty thousand members in the country to help the striking dressmakers of Chicago. The tax, for the present, is one dollar but it will be raised if necessary. The locals of the International will collect the money from their members and turn it over to the headquarters of the International, which will send it to the Chicago strikers.</p>
   <p>This news was brought yesterday by Meyer Perlstein, leader of the strike and vice-president of the International, who returned yesterday from New York, where he was present at the meetings of the executive board.</p>
