   <p>The United Jewish Trades has organized a union of sweater workers. A large number have joined this union which is continually increasing its membership. The following proclamation was issued:</p>
   <p>"In order to give every worker of this trade, man or woman, the opportunity to join this union the fee was reduced, by the Knitters Union, to fifty cents for a limited time. Knitters do not miss this opportunity.</p>
   <p>"The long hours, the small wages, the inhuman treatment should be your best lesson to point out the fact that something must be done to improve conditions. Who will sponsor your cause if you do not.....</p>
   <p>"The Union meets every Friday evening in Rosens Hall, 1125 Blue Island Ave. New members are welcome."</p>
