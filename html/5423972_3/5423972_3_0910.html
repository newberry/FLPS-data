   <p>The Amalgamated, Local 441, which controls the West Side pants shops, was forced to call a strike in the pants shop, 1031 W. Roosevelt Rd., and at Berry and Benson, Roosevelt and Halsted. At the former, the owner broke the contract with the Union and demanded that employees work below scale. Berry and Benson Co. distributes its work to contractors and its own employees remain idle.</p>
