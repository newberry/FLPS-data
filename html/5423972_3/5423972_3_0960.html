   <p>We learned yesterday that about ten more small dress manufacturers signed agreements with the union, immediately after a strike was called at the various shops throughout the day.</p>
   <p>The union is expected to call a strike today in several other shops, whose bosses are still "holding out". The strike at Philip Klapter and Sobel is now in full swing.</p>
