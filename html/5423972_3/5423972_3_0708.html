   <p>Ever/since the 44 hour week went into effect at the Hart Schaffner &amp; Marks shops, the amalgamated,received many calls of small organizations, from such small towns where no one would think that an organization exists.</p>
   <p>Comrades Schlossberg and Sidney Hillman are traveling to those places and organizing, and are sending special organizers to Chicago, to help the officials in the hard work.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated seeing, that this is the opportune time to organize Chicago, 100 per cent, are taking that advantage, and are doing their duty for the tailors. The tailors are realizing that this is the organization where they belong, if they want to be free from the old form of slavery that still exists in the unorganized shops.</p>
