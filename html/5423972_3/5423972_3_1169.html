The theaters are giving special performances, the profits of which go for the benefit of the strikers. Next Thursday, the 12th Street Theater will contribute the entire in-take of that day to the cause of the strikers.</p>
   <p>The Grand Theater on 14th &amp; Halsted streets, is also giving an extra performance for the strikers benefit, and in addition the management of the theater is making additional collections, aside from the sale of the tickets. Many other Jewish theaters are following and arranging special plays for the benefit of the strikers. In other words the entire Jewish element in Chicago is wide awake in answering the call of the oppressed strikers. They are all in sympathy with the striking workers and there is no doubt, that with this kind of encouragement, victory is sure to come soon.</p>
