   <p>Following the call of the Knitters Union, Chicago sweater workers, yesterday morning, at ten o'clock, put aside their work and demanded the recognition of their union and an improvement in their working conditions. Hundreds of strikers surrounded the headquarters at 1145 Blue Island Avenue yesterday where all were to register.</p>
   <p>Then began the task of picketing the shops. This was enthusiastically undertaken by the young men and women strikers who kept watching so that no one should take their places while they called to those still at work to join the strike.</p>
   <p>About twenty-five shops are affected by this strike. The most important of these are: Royal Knitting Mills, 846 West Jackson Boulevard; Anik, 419 South Clinton Street; Lorens, Belmont Avenue; Western, 1140 Blue Island Avenue; Spat, 4156 Irving Park Boulevard; O'Shea, 2408 West Chicago Avenue; Blue Bird, 1943 Irving Park; and Delson Knitting Mills, 1517 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   
   <p>Besides recognition of their Union, the strikers demand a forty-four hour work-week, a raise of twenty per cent for piece work and three dollars for week work; time and a half for overtime, and pay for seven legal holidays, including the first of May.</p>
   <p>The strike leaders say that several manufacturers already seek a settlement and that agreements will soon be signed.</p>
