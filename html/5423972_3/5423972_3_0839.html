   <p>The Midland Tailoring Co., 322 W. Washington St., tried to ignore the Amalgamated Union and operate their shop with non-union help.</p>
   <p>The officials of the Joint Board had an eye on this shop and yesterday a strike was declared and the workers were called out from that shop.</p>
   <p>All clothing workers - Remember This Shop!</p>
