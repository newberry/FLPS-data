   <p>The Butcher and Schochet's Union, local 598, held a very important meeting last night, where a report was given about an attempt which is being made by reactionary cliques, to destroy the union. The union will ruin the plans of the reactionary group, because it is sure to have the sympathy of the general public of Chicago.</p>
   <p>At the meeting yesterday, it was decided to appropriate twenty-thousand dollars for a special fund to fight all enemies who seek to undermine their union.</p>
   <p>The Rabbis and Presidents of the synagogues also held a meeting at the Grenshaw St. Talmud Torah under the leadership of certain elements, who cling to them,and adopted a resolution to destroy the Schochet and Butcher's Union, and they established a "Vaad" (Board) to carry through their detrimental conclusion.</p>
