   <p>The Jewish baker employees of Local 237, who signed a contract with the employers for day work, held a special meeting yesterday afternoon, concerning the question whether they should alter that clause of the contract or not.</p>
   <p>Rumors spread that the Jewish baker employees are planning to demand that the union retract the agreement of day work. Because of this, a special general meeting was called.</p>
   <p>Practically all members of the union attended this meeting and all refused to do back to work under the old system. They wanted to remain working as now, from 5 P.M. until 11 P.M.</p>
   <p>A motion was carried unanimously to keep the agreement as it was accepted, and no member is permitted to work any other hours than the agreement with the bosses allots. The member who violates that law will be punished severely by the union.</p>
