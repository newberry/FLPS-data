   <p>The question before the Chicago cloakmakers is how to organize the entire trade of women's clothing workers. The cloakmakers feel that Chicago must be thoroughly organized if they wish to keep what they have gained in the last few years.</p>
   <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers Union have promised in the near future to start a strong campaign to organize all waist, dress, and kimono makers of Chicago. Comrade Schlessinger, the president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, on his visit last Friday, promised the Chicago executives of the locals that this important work will be started. Comrade Schlessinger also gave a report on the entire condition of the great Cloakmakers' Union and all the plans that will be submitted to the convention in Philadelphia, opening on October 16.</p>
