   <p>The American Wet and Dry Laundry gave a banquet for its Jewish drivers and their families in recognition and in appreciation of their good work on Saturday evening, February 17, 1923, in Gwirts's Restaurant, Roosevelt Road and Kedzie Avenue. Good speaker addressed the gathering. The principal speakers were Mr. Abraham Schaffner, president of the American Wet and Dry Laudry, and Mr. Isaac Becker, treasurer of the Laundry. Mr. Frank Gostomelesky greeted the firm on behalf of the workers for its co-operation when other laundries wanted to suppress them. Even though the other bosses criticized the Jewish drivers, the American Wet and Dry Laundry continued employing Jewish drivers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gostomelesky then made an appeal for the Chicago Consumptive Aid Society. A sum of $35 was collected. The money was given to a committee consisting of Mr. Harry Baratz, Mr. Sam Chester, and Mr. Gostomelesky who will transmit the donation to the Society.</p>
   <p>[The following resolution was adopted by the workers at their meeting]: "We, the Jewish drivers, thank the following officials of the American Wet and Dry Laundry--Mr. Abraham Schaffner, president; Mr. Nathan Levin, vice-president; and Mr. Isadore Becker, treasurer--for the bonus they have presented to the Jewish drivers."</p>
   <p>In the name of the committee:</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Gostomelesky,</p>
   <p>Mr. Harry Baratz,</p>
   <p>Mr. Sam Chester.</p>
