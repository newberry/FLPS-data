   <p>The Agreement of the Chicago Clothiers Association and Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>After a long nine year struggle, the Clothiers Association finally signed a union agreement with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. For several days, Sidney Hillman, general president of the Amalgamated, Frank Rosenblum, manager of the Organizational Drive, and Sam Levin, met in Peter Sussman's office where negotiations were carried on.</p>
   <p>After a great deal of discussion, both sides came to an understanding and agreed on the following main conditions: 1. A Preferential Union Shop. When any shop in the Association needs employees, it must notify the Union who will fill the vacancies. 2. A Board of Arbitration, the establishment of a trade board and a board of arbitration to settle disputes. If a worker is fired, the case goes before the trade board which has the right to put the fired worker back on the job. 3. Complaints of Workers. All complaints will be taken up by the union official and the employers.</p>
