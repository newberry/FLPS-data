   <p>The Jews of Chicago are to blame, if, up until now, they have not been adequately represented in the state and county offices, in the city offices, and on the Municipal court benches. The Jews were not sufficiently interested to show their power at a primary election; they did not vote.</p>
   <p>This mistake can be corrected; then we can hope for a larger representation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>To realize this,huge numbers of Jewish citizens must vote. The leaders of the political parties will have to take this vote into consideration. Then we can expect, in the near future, to have more Jewish representatives in the state, city and county governments.</p>
   <p>The Jewish citizens should vote in the coming primaries. Let them vote for the candidates of the party to which they belong. They have an extraordinarily large vote in this community. By voting they will obtain both representation and power. In the coming primaries the Jewish vote will help to nominate [candidates], and in many cases will decide the nomination. The Jewish vote will especially help to decide the nomination in the cases of the Jewish candidates. Therefore, do not forget to vote!</p>
   <p>If a person voted two years ago, at a primary, the Republican ticket, let us say, and since then did not vote in any primary, he can now vote, if he wants <span class="page-break">\3</span>to, the Democratic ticket, and vice versa. The primary law is binding for two years and everyone can change his party affiliation after that period. An individual has to vote, however, the ticket for which he voted at any primary during the last two years; a Republican cannot vote for a Democrat and a Democrat cannot vote for a Republican. Bear this in mind.</p>
   <p>The primary elections will be on Tuesday, April 11, four weeks from today. Do not forget the day and the date. The polling places will be open from six o'clock in the morning until five o'clock in the evening. Remember this. If you are a Republican, ask in your polling place for a Republican ballot--the color is green; if you are a Democrat, ask for a Democratic ballot--the color is pink.</p>
   <p>Use the pencil that you will find in the booth of the polling place. Do not take any other pencil. Do not mark on the ballot any sign other than an X <span class="page-break">\4</span>and do not be in a hurry when you vote. Take your time in selecting the candidates for whom you want to vote, and mark an X in front of their names. If you think that you have spoiled your ballot, or that you have made a mistake and did not vote the way you wanted to, you can demand a new ballot. Be careful to vote right. You will not find a circle on top of the primary ballot where you can mark an X. Primaries are not general elections.</p>
   <p>Do not vote for more candidates than are necessary. Read over how many are to be nominated and mark your ballot accordingly. Your vote is secret. Nobody knows for whom you voted. You can, therefore, vote as your conscience dictates.</p>
   <p>You have to register in order to vote. Registration day is Tuesday, March 21. Remember the date. This is the only opportunity you will have to register for the primary elections, if you are not registered. You cannot vote <span class="page-break">\5</span>unless you are registered and it is too late to "complain" that you were negligent after the registration books are closed. Nothing in the world, except sickness, should prevent a citizen from registering. If you plan to leave town, you should see to it that you are registered. If you are registered you can vote and you can help nominate those whom you want to see nominated; later you can help elect those whom you want to see elected. Put business aside, put pleasure aside--register if you are not properly registered; if you have moved since the last election into another precinct or another ward, register again.</p>
   <p>Women citizens have an equal right [of suffrage] in the primaries and in the elections. They should let themselves be heard. They can help to nominate and to elect.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish citizen should feel the responsibility, the power, and the privilege that the ballot gives him. He should use this power and privilege in an <span class="page-break">\6</span>intelligent way and vote for those who, he believes, will serve the people best. We say the same to the women voters.</p>
   <p>The Jewish voters should remember the Jews who are candidates for various offices. They should also bear in mind those by whose efforts the Jews are put forward as candidates; they should give them their entire support.</p>
   <p>There are many Jewish candidates for the various public offices. Not all the candidates have been officially announced as yet. Not all factions are ready with their slates and therefore, we do not know, as yet, the exact composition of the ballot that will be handed out to the voters at the polls on Tuesday, April 11. We will mention here only those Jewish candidates whom we are sure are going to be candidates. They expect your support.</p>
   <p>On the Democratic ticket: Judge Henry Horner is running for renomination as <span class="page-break">\7</span>judge of the Probate Court, Judge Michael Rosenberg, for nomination to the Sanitary Board, Julius Schwartz, for member of the Board of Review, and Samuel Weinshenker, Samuel Pincus, and Isidore Brown for nomination to the Municipal Court.</p>
   <p>On the Republican ticket: Sol P. Roderick is running for nomination as candidate for the Sanitary Board, Emanuel Eller, Municipal Court, Robert Blumenfeld, County Commissioner.</p>
   <p>Jacob Epstein in the seventeenth district, Harry I Weisbrod in the nineteenth district, Sidney Lyons in the fifth district, H. S. Ginsburg in the tenth didtrict--are all running for nomination to the [State] Legislature. There are many more Jews, whose names we do not have on hand, who are running for office. All their names will be announced in the Courier and you are urgently requested to look out for those announcements.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Vote for the candidates of both parties and remember that the Jewish candidates depend a great deal upon your vote: first, to secure their nomination and election, and second, to prevent malicious people from saying the Jews do not avail themselves of the opportunity given to them in this country, and that, though citizens, they do not care who runs their civic affairs for them.</p>
   <p>It is un-American, it is not a good Jewish policy to vote only for Jewish candidates. Voting for Jewish candidates only can do us harm; the non-Jewish citizen will vote for non-Jews only and the public will think that the Jews are estranging themselves, that they do not work together with the rest for the welfare of the general community.</p>
   <p>Once more: see that you are registered properly and do not forget to vote in the primary elections.</p>
