   <p>There are two versions to the story of the strike at the White Palace Bakery, 4242 Roosevelt Road, where the workers have walked out on their jobs at the call of their union. The first version is as follows: The bosses, Wonsowsky, Jacobs, Massberg, and Kaplan, claim that the strike was called only because they had started to sell bread at a lower price. They claim that the whole thing is illegal because the union agreement says that no strike can be called without the sanction of the International, and it so happens that the International knows nothing about this strike.</p>
   <p>The bosses stress the fact that when they were the first to sign the new agreement for a seven-hour work day, it was expressly understood that in case the other bakeries did not agree to a seven-hour work-day, they would not be held to their agreement. Whereas in all other bakeries an eight or nine-hour day prevails, the White Palace Bakery is compelled to adhere to the terms of the new agreement which calls for a seven-hour day. The bosses point out that they cannot exist under these conditions, and that they are willing to open their books before any union representative to prove the truth of their statement. They say they would be willing to arbitrate the whole dispute.</p>
   <p>The second version of the strike is the explanation of Mr. H. Lipkin, representative of the Union, who states that the strike has nothing to do with the price of bread, but that it was declared for the following reasons:</p>
   <p>First, the bosses do not adhere to the terms of the contract which specifies that all the workers in the bakery must be union members, as for instance bread-feeders and assistants to the foreman, etc. Second, the bosses are violating the agreement by working themselves. According to the contract, owners of bakeries with more than three ovens are forbidden to work themselves and the White Palace Bakery has four ovens. The result is that instead of seventeen workers, as were previously employed, only seven are now employed, which means that the bosses are taking away the jobs of the workers. The demand of the Union, therefore, is a guarantee that all the clauses of the agreement will be upheld.</p>
