   <p>The Amalgamated Clothing Workers, in the last few years, have established libraries for the benefit of their membership. I believe the present aggregate membership of the Amalgamated throughout the United States is over 200,000. There are about 40,000 here in Chicago. The libraries are in charge of trained librarians. The Chicago Amalgamated is looking forward eagerly to housing its library in most spacious quarters, in connection with a million dollar center that it has in contemplation.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Amalgamated has also, during the past few years, conducted splendid lecture courses, and has, every Sunday afternoon, concerts by picked men from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</p>
