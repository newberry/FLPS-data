   <p>The United Jewish Trades of Chicago are calling a conference. To call a conference, in labor parlance, is as calling a councilium of physicians for a very ill person. It is quite appropriate that those who are interested in the person ailing to see to it that the specialists who are called in understand the sickness. In a councilium as this, personalities play no role, neither do personal opinions. The most important matter is to know and to thoroughly understand the case.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades of Chicago is ill, dreadfully ill. Their meetings are not attended; their work is not fruitful. During the time of their existence they have organized all sorts of International Worker's Organizations. Each time a union was organized, there was plenty of noise. They made an alarm, boasted and bluffed that all these International Unions are really doing wonders. But now they are dead and buried...without as much as a monument on the graves. The delegates who call themselves "The United Hebrew Trades," represent no one but themselves and their interests. They come there when they have personal problems, which they hope may be solved to their benefit. There is hardly a union which sends a proper representative of the trades, whose job is to represent <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>any body of workers in any branch. There is no delegate in the Trades who would make an honest effort to study and know the proper methods of organizing Jewish Trade Unions. There is little wonder why The United Jewish Trades has had no success, hence they are calling a conference. There is no doubt that Chicago workers are in need of the United Hebrew Trades. If there is any hope of organizing Jewish Trade Unions and maintaining then, it will be accomplished only by a united effort of all Jewish Trade Unions.</p>
   <p>A Jewish Bakers' Union, a Jewish Carpenters' Union, etc., cannot exist as a Jewish Union unless it has the sympathy and support of the Jews. Only then can they exist as a specific Jewish Union, when they are conducted in accordance with the Jewish spirit, Jewish customs and manners, or else they might as well join the general Trade Union Movement. The fact that Jewish workers of Chicago prefer being in Jewish Unions, reveals that they have individual interests, individual problems and individual reasons why there should be separate Jewish Unions.</p>
   <p>A Jewish Trade Union should do two things. As a Trade Union they should be a part of a general Federation; as a Jewish Union they should be in a Jewish <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>organization. Therefore, when a Jewish organization of this type is planned, it should be remembered that the organizers must be Trade Unionists. It is a very sad experience for our Jewish workers, when their unions are founded and built by persons who are not workers.</p>
   <p>We would like to say here that our intellectuals, who are usually radical and who deem it their mission to guide every worker's movement, always come as teachers or professors to every conference of workers. They take up a lot of time with scientific speeches. Being better speakers and debaters than the ordinary workers, they make motions, speak on the motions and pass the motions, regardless of whether or not the workers who are in these unions, and who are obliged to support them, like it or not. The ordinary worker, who can not make a speech and theoretically explain his needs, feels ashamed to express his practical opinion at meetings, he loses interest and stops coming to meetings. When, however, the time for action arrives, instead of speeches, there is no one to act.</p>
   <p>We fully recognize the moral support which our radical element can give to a workers' union, when agitation is needed, when good speakers and writers are needed. Should they come to our rescue at such time, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>We regret, however, that our radicals are so narrow-minded, that a Poale Zion will not move when a Socialist speaks at a union; a Socialist will condemn the workers' movement should a Democrat participate, and collectively they would actually sabotage a union, should an Anarchist attempt to devote his time and effort in building up a Trade Union Movement.</p>
   <p>Our advice to those who are interested in the United Jewish Trades is to see to it that the conference consists only of workers from the various trades - not radicals or intellectuals. That a delegate from a Bakers' Union should be a baker; from a Barbers' Union, a barber, etc. Let all workers come to an open meeting, let them express their opinions in their own words, let them come to the conclusion that a united body of workers must consist of workers and no other people. Let them lead their own struggle and they will win!</p>
   <p>If radicals and intellectuals like to assist the unions, let them organize themselves into "Emergency Bodies" and be ready to help, when it is needed, to agitate for the Union Label, to demand articles with the Union Label, etc. This should be the work of the intellectuals, and then Jewish Unions will surely exist and flourish in Chicago.</p>
