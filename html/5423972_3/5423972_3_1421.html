   <p>"I never felt," says Shylock, when Tubal, rubbing it in, tells him of the prodigality of Jessica. A personal pain makes you sympathetic to the pain of others. There are lots of Jews in this country who walk the streets proudly and cannot be made to feel that the sufferings of their own race elsewhere mean anything real to them. They contribute to a relief fund under pressure of a campaign or an aroused public opinion, but as a rule they hold themselves aloof. They are not exactly snobs, but they feel as if they are standing upon a mountain and all other Jews are struggling to reach the top to stand with them. They are individuals, you might say, or egotists. Reports are numerous of a change in the disposition of these folk, since the Harvard University incident and since the advent of the Ku-Klux-Klan. They are astounded that such an un-American should classify Jews among undesirable [sic]. They feel that the Ku-Klux-Klan means them, and not only the other fellows who have been raising such a racket about Jewish causes and Jewish interests and who have been speaking of Jewish solidarity and intruding with <span class="page-break">2</span>Zionism. The Ku Klux Klan is an arm raised against them; they resent it, and with a vehement assumption of Simon--pure American indignation they become vocal. They are joining the Independent Order B'nai Brith. They affiliate with the anti-Defamation League. They write away letters to the press. They call upon Jews to organize to fight this menace. Why should they be so excited? There is enough sturdy Americanism in the United States to eject the poisonous influence of an organization that is ashamed to show its face, that works in the dark, and that has become a rallying place for diseased minds. But it must be admitted that the Hooded Knights are making better propaganda for an awakening of a Jewish consciousness than all other sorts of propaganda put together. Running from one fear, these Jews who separate their interest from general Jewish interests overcome another. Taking arms against a dark sea of anti-Semitism, they forget their fears of Jewish association. They are moving out of the rut of self-complacency.</p>
