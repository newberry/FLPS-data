   <p>Ladies Waist and Dressmakers, are Victors of a 44 Hour Week, and a 10% Raise.</p>
   <p>The Ladies Waist-makers Union, local 100, marked another victory in their great battle for bettering their conditions.</p>
   <p>All the union bosses and 15 of the unorganized manufacturers, granted the demands, a 44 hour working week and a 10 per cent raise in wages. Some of the bosses of the ladies waist and dress manufacturers, who have previously promised to grant the 44 hour week by April 1st, have changed their mind and told their workers, yesterday, to start a 44 hour week beginning today.</p>
   <p>The ladies waist-makers and dress-makers, who are working in shops, where their bosses are members of the manufacturer's association, must come to the union and inform the organizer what their bosses think regarding the 44 hour week, also of the letter sent to them by the union. Now is the time for all ladies dress and waist-makers, who can realize what it means to be organized, to come and join the union.</p>
