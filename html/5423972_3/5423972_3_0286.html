   <p>An important meeting of the Jewish stock-yard workers will be held 2 P.M. Sunday, in the Jewish Federation Hall, 1145 Blue Island Ave.</p>
   <p>The Jewish workers of the stock-yards have organized and it is gratifying to note how rapidly the work is progressing.</p>
   <p>Over 2,000 Jewish workers are employed in the stock-yards and it is hoped that in the near future we can figure on a complete Jewish workers organization in the Chicago stock-yards.</p>
