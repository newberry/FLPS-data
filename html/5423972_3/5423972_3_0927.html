   <p>The Jewish Bakers, Local 237, was forced to call a strike against Julius Levensen, 1336 W. 14th St. and at 1253 S. Kedzie Ave. The proprietors did not follow the union rule, forbidding them to work. This rule was made to give unemployed bakers, at least some work during the week.</p>
   <p>The majority of the bakeries have accepted this rule, recognizing the demand of the union as just. However, some employers have set themselves against any such proposal.</p>
   <p>The strike in Waldman's shop, 1114 N. Ashland Ave. still continues.</p>
