   <p>The workers of the following five shops: Gambiner Bros., Smolin &amp; Berger, Clark Bros., J. Frishman's Shop, and Sloff Bros., walked out on strike after the employers refused to grant a 15 per cent raise.</p>
   <p>The negotiations, which lasted one week between the firms mentioned and the representatives of the United Hebrew Trades, together with a committee of the Horse Hair Dressers Union, have convinced the workers that the employers do not consider the fact that the cost of living has increased 15 per cent since last year, and that even with the raise the worker will earn less than what they have earned up to now.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades is carrying on the strike and, there is no doubt, that the manufacturers will soon be convinced that it does not pay to be obstinate.</p>
