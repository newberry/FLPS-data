   <p>The mass meeting held last night at the Nat Herwood Hall for the benefit of the Jewish candidates was very successful. The Hall was packed with many Jewish voters and everyone was very enthusiastic about the future of the Jewish officers. The speakers with their eloquent addresses, held the crowd spellbound and showed the audience the importance for the Jewish citizens to elect Jewish representatives in the different branches of our government.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jacob M. Cantor acted as chairman of the meeting. The main speakers of the evening were as follows: Samuel Alschuler, Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, candidate for re-election; his brother, the lawyer Joseph Sabath, candidate for judge of the Municipal Court, and George Sultan, candidate for member of the Board of County Commissioners.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Alschuler in his address showed the importance of the Jewish population in this country taking an active interest in the government problems of our land, first as a citizen and secondly as a Jew, in other words, whereas in most of the European countries, Where the Jew is degraded and persecuted, he has no voice in that government, but in this country, even though the Jew plays a very small role politically, there can never be much anti-Semitism in this land of freedom. In order to keep it so we Jews must get active in politics and see that we have representation in all the branches of our government. In conclusion one of the speakers appealed to all the Jews in Chicago to cast their votes for the three Jewish candidates.</p>
