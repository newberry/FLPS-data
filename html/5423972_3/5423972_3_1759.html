   <p>Mr. Philip P. Bregstone, assistant judge of the Probate Court, is a candidate on the Democratic ticket for judge of the Municipal Court. Judge Bregstone showed his ability to adapt himself to legal work while he held his responsible position in the Probate Court. He is recognized by the lawyers of Chicago as an authority on real-estate laws which are often involved in inheritance and will cases. The Democratic party has accorded him recognition by placing him in an honorable position on the primary ballot, viz., the fifth from the top on the list of candidates for municipal judges.</p>
   <p>Judge Bregstone, however, also deserves recognition from the Chicago Jewry. In the course of years, he has taken a warm interest in the Jewish national movement. He has given his time and energy freely, addressing Jewish meetings in Chicago, as well as in other cities, whenever he was called.</p>

   <p>It would be appropriate for the Jews to reciprocate by becoming interested in him, and by giving him full recognition on the day of the primary election--the thirteenth of September.</p>
