   <p>As a result of a number of conferences held these past two weeks between representatives of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the manufacturers, President Sidney Hillman comes today to tell the thirty thousand Chicago garment workers the results of the negotiations and the details of the raise which all workers will now receive. Four great mass meetings in the city were arranged for today. The first will be the cutters who meet directly after working hours, about five o'clock in the evening at the Empire Theater, Madison near Halsted Street. They will there be informed of their raise. Later, at about seven o'clock in the evening all garment workers will meet at the following meeting halls: The Empire Theater, Wicker Park Hall, North Avenue, corner Robey, and Sokol Hall, 2343 South Kedzie Avenue.</p>
   <p>Besides President Hillman, the meetings will be addressed by Frank Rosenbloom, Sam Levin, and I. Mariempetro, all of whom composed the delegation which negotiated with the manufacturers' association and the firm of Hart, Schaffner and Marx, [negotiations] resulting in a considerable wage increase for the workers, which is identical with that obtained by New York tailors.</p>
   <p>Although no details are as yet known, it is expected that the sum total of the present raise will amount to about six million dollars a year. This increase is in addition to all previous regular ones received by tailors.</p>
   <p>The raise is effective as of June 1 for "ready-made" workers and as of July 1 for "special-order" workers which means that all tailors will receive the back pay to which they are entitled. Naturally, independent manufacturers will have to follow this example and grant to their workers the same raise the associated bosses have now agreed to.</p>
   <p>Sentiment among the garment workers, gathered together, ran very high yesterday. Although no details were known it was apparent to everyone that the Amalgamated had certainly obtained the best results possible under the circumstances. In every shop one could see preparations for today's holiday--the holiday of an increased "pay envelope".</p>
