   <p>All the bakers of Chicago came to an understanding that once and for all they must make a uniform contract with all the bosses, and not allow each local to make separate demands. After much deliberation a new agreement is now being sent out, as the old ones expire April 30th, 1919.</p>
   <p>The most important of the new demands are: to establish day work instead of night work - and also the eight hour working day - and where machinery is used exclusively for production the working day shall by seven hours. It is understood that wages, are also included. The minimum shall be $33.00 per week.</p>
   <p>The bakers are confident of winning these just demands.</p>
   <p>These demands mean that they will be able to live like men, and see more of their family and friends. That can be accomplished only by working days.</p>
   <p>The bakers will this time as in the past hare the full sympathy of all organized workers and their friends.</p>
   <p>As to the retail clerks union, local 195 is for behind. They are demanding a fifty-four hour working week when nearly all other trades already work only forty-four hours and are preparing demands for shorter hours. As to wages, they are also mighty small. Most of the clerks are working for twenty-two a week, others are working for less. It is understood the small wages are accompanied by long hours on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday nights. They work three additional hours after working a ten hour day.</p>
   <p>The retail clerks work Sundays as well, but let us not worry. They are organizing and moving stop by step, until they will get there. It is hoped that the retail clerks will soon reach the goal. Their demands are that the work be divided so that they will have a few evenings for themselves, and a raise of $5.00 per week in their pay.</p>
   <p>The mattress makers union local 5 sent their demands to the bosses this week, for an eight hour working day and a few dollars more in their pay envelopes. Their agreement expires April first. The mattress makers have learned a good deal since they began organizing. Their conditions are such better now; they are realizing the necessity of being organized. Now they have a strong organization, and it is hoped that their fair demands will not cause a strike and even if it comes to that, they are prepared and can take it.</p>
   <p>The shoerepairer's union is ready to demand an eight hour working day and a raise in pay. The shoerepairer's union is composed of a real lively and loyal element, and all indications are that they will win these just demands. Their meetings are well attended, and they are striving for 100 percent union. They are earnestly working for the betterment of the shoerepairing industry. There is a feeling in the trade union movement which proves that through united and energates efforts one can accomplish a good deal.</p>
   <p>All those aforementioned organizations, are worth being supported, because they work for the interest of the union, and answer the call for the needy of their members.</p>
   <p>To these who stand aside and say to themselves," let them do it, and when it will be done, then I'll come in", we say that it is a crime, to stand aside and let the others pave the way for you. All the workers join the union, go to the meetings, partake in conferences, help making clear demands in the interest of all workers, then and only then the union can win.</p>
