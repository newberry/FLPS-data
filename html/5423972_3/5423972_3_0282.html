   <p>Striking Ladies Tailors Full Of Enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, it is the first time that the aristocratic ladies tailors have declared a general strike. All is quiet in the shops, no noise of machines, or shears, everything at a standstill.</p>
   <p>In checking up at their meeting, they find that all their members have obeyed the orders and went out on strike. State St. and Wabash Ave. are full of strikers. In front of all the stores are pickets, full of hopes to win their human demands. Many bosses called the union for settlement. The strike was well planned, now there are thousands of suits in the shops and no one to finish them. The ladies tailors are organized 100%. Strikers headquarters is at 180 Washington St. and everything is under control.</p>
