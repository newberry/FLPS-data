   <p>Union Decides to be With The Bakers Alliance and Not to Permit An Undesirable Person to Become The Boss of The Bakers' Local</p>
   <p>Representatives of all Jewish unions allied with the Federation, after a meeting held yesterday in the Labor Lyceum, unanimously agreed to apply all necessary measures in order to remain with the International Bakers Union. Another resolution is not to permit Mr. Braverman's getting into the union to become the boss over the bakers and their transactions.</p>
   <p>The resolution was accepted after the delegates of the bakers' local 237 and the organizer of the Federation of Jewish Unions gave their reports on the situation of the bakers' union.</p>
   <p>According to the reports given by the representatives of the union, Mr. Braverman appointed himself delegate of local 237.</p>

   <p>The officers of the International have instructed their Secretaries that action is to be taken immediately to check Mr. Braverman's leadership by informing the members who permitted him to become a delegate, which is against the constitution, [of the action taken].</p>
   <p>It was the unanimous opinion of the delegates that the bakery workers be informed that the Federation of Jewish Unions will go hand in hand with the International Bakers' Union and do everything in its power not to permit Mr. Braverman to have any connection with the union whatsoever.</p>
   <p>The Federation, and the International are against him. Under no circumstances will organized labor movement have any business with a man of a questionable reputation.</p>
   <p>In case any union will have any business with Braverman, the whole labor movement will condemn that union.</p>

   <p>The Federation has also elected a committee of five delegates who will come to a meeting of Bakers Local 237 to deliver the decision of the delegations of the unions.</p>
