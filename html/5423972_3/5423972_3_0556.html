   <p>The wildest enthusiasm prevailed at yesterday's session of the Amalgamated when the question of Soviet Russia was considered. It was unanimously resolved that a million dollar corporation for establishing factories in the workers' republic should be created to help the constructive work in that country. The Amalgamated, according to the decision of the convention, will subscribe for fifty thousand dollars' [worth of capital stock] and will contribute ten thousand dollars to cover the expenses of organizing the corporation. This decision of the convention was adopted after Mr. Sidney Hillman, international president of the Amalgamated, delivered a long and illuminating report about Soviet Russia. Mr. Hillman was sent by this organization to Soviet Russia to study the economic conditions there. In his report, he described the terrible condition of the people, who are living through the most difficult period in the reconstruction of the country. Mr. Hillman denied all the shameful lies that are being spread about Soviet Russia. He painted, in bright colors, the sincerity, devotion and willingness to sacrifice of the government leaders there, who are ready to sacrifice their lives for the happiness and well-being of the country.</p>
   <p>"Russia will, without any doubt, survive the present difficult times and the economic life there will soon assume a normal character," said Mr. Hillman, "but this cannot happen without our help. It is our sacred duty to help them. Up to now we have done our duty; let us continue to do it. The best way to help them is through constructive work."</p>
   <p>Mr. Hillman said that when he was in Russia, Lenin proposed concessions to him, to establish factories in Russia, which would be of the greatest possible benefit to the suffering workers of Russia because such factories would offer employment. He said that when he came to America, he had worked out a plan toward this end, which he was submitting to the convention. This is the plan: The Amalgamated shall establish a million dollar corporation; each share shall sell for ten dollars; shares shall be sold to the members of the Amalgamated, to workers of other organizations, and to all friends of Soviet Russia; the Amalgamated shall subscribe for fifty thousand dollars' worth of shares and shall contribute ten thousand dollars towards organizational expenses.</p>
   <p>A stormy ovation broke out in the convention hall when Mr. Hillman concluded his speech. All the delegates and the hundreds of guests arose from their seats and the big convention hall shook with their applause and yells. An orchestra played the Russian "Hymn of Freedom" and the "Marseillaise," which made the demonstration still livelier. This ovation lasted for fully fifteen minutes. A resolution on Hillman's plan was then proposed and unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>How Olgin Was Welcomed by the Convention</p>
   <p>A second stormy ovation, which lasted for about five minutes, broke out at yesterday's session when Mr. Moissaye Olgin, one of the editors of the Freiheit, was introduced to the convention. A great many delegates arose from their seats, showered the guest with flowers, and gave him an ovation that only a few guests have been fortunate enough to receive.</p>
   <p>"The Forward," said some delegates from New York, "will try to belittle the ovation given to Olgin, just as it exaggerated the weak, scattered applause its editor, Abe Cahan, received when he appeared before the convention, into the statement: 'Abe Cahan greeted with stormy applause at the Amalgamated convention.' "</p>
   <p>Mr. Olgin greeted the delegates in the name of the Freiheit. He said that he represented a radical organization whose radicalism was not confined to theory alone but extended to practical work.</p>
   <p>"I want to commend this convention," said Mr. Olgin in concluding his speech, "for the spirit of internationalism which reigns here, which you have proved by your decision to extend constructive help to Russia, where millions of people are so greatly in need of it. Let this important work of yours serve as an example to organized labor in America and give it courage and enthusiasm to do its duty as honestly and bravely as you have done yours."</p>
   <p>The Convention's Practical Work</p>
   <p>The convention, at its session yesterday, not only listened to enthusiastic greetings and speeches, but also accomplished a great deal of routine work. Dozens of resolutions, most of them dealing with internal, organizational matters, were read and adopted. The most important resolution, besides that about Soviet Russia, was the one about unity in the needle trades industry. This resolution was adopted after serious discussion. At least a dozen resolutions, dealing with this question, were brought in. The resolutions committee combined them all into one to the effect that the convention should declare itself in favor of unity in the needle trades industry, and one executive board. The next general executive board should be instructed to negotiate with the other organizations in the needle trades industry for the purpose of calling a joint convention to unite all the unions into one organization.</p>
   <p>The Waist Makers Demonstrate</p>
   <p>An impressive demonstration was staged yesterday, at one of the sessions of the convention, by a group of waist makers who marched into the convention hall to the strains of music, carrying a large floral stand which represented on one side the slavery of 1910, and on the other side, the freedom of 1922. Mr. Glickman, organizer of this local, delivered a speech in the name of these workers and told about their devotion and sacrifice in the historic fight of 1910 and later in 1915.</p>
   <p>All the delegates and thousands of Amalgamated members were entertained last night at various musical affairs which the Chicago arrangements committee had prepared for them.</p>
   
   <p>Today's session of the convention will open at 9:30 A. M. All the delegates will be taken in the evening to the Cort Theater to see the performance of Eugene O'Neil's drama "Anna Christie," with Pauline Lord in the role of Anna.</p>
   <p>The whole Cort Theater has been rented out by the Amalgamated for this purpose.</p>
