   <p>How the Organization Set-Up will serve the Tailors.</p>
   <p>The clean sweep made by the tailor workers, in winning the entire industry, made it necessary for the controlling Amalgamated to form a new management. It is true that the plan of a Joint Board is not new to Chicago. In 1915 this plan was attempted but for one reason or another the Joint Board failed to function.</p>
   <p>Having organized the entire tailoring industry and having signed agreements with the various associations which call for various matters to be straightened out, the Amalgamated must have further appropriations to carry on its work. As the tailoring industry is composed of a number of different types of work, it is necessary that all the various sections should be represented in a central body. The Joint Board will be their central body. How will the Joint Board be organized? The answer is quite simple. Every local will send <span class="page-break">\2</span>delegates according to its numerical strength. The number of delegates from each local will vary from one to ten. (The maximum of ten is to prevent the Large locals from being controlled by their Joint Board delegates and to enable the smaller unions to have a good representation in the Board, capable of opposing the large locals.) The Joint Board will consist of seventy-five members, from which a Board of Directors, consisting of eleven persons will be chosen. This Board of Directors will consist of representatives from every trade in the union.</p>
   <p>The duties and rights of the Joint Board will be as follows: All the protocols will be sent to the locals for approval or rejection of the activities of the Board. The duties of the Board are to pay all the employees, take up all complaints, pay the hall rent for union, board, and arbitration board rooms, and to transact all other business problems of the local Amalgamated.</p>

   <p>The election of all officers and trade representatives, general manager, and secretary-treasurer, will be effected through general membership vote. For example: the coat makers will vote for their trade representatives, and the other locals will follow suit, but the general manager and the secretary-treasurer will be elected by a general membership election. National or language representatives will be elected by the various locals which are composed of one nationality or tongue.</p>
   <p>How many locals will there be? There are six locals in existence at present and two more locals will soon be organized. The two new locals will be a Bohemian and an Italian local exclusively. These two will increase the number of locals to eight, and with the establishment of a Joint Board, the union members will be able to join any local they wish without creating any jealousy.</p>
   <p>With the establishment of the two language locals, the different nationalities will have the opportunity to participate in the activities of the organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It gives the opportunity to those who don't understand English, to be active in their own locals. Those who do not have the special language privilege are the Jews, but it seems that the Jews will have their own local for the other nationalities will undoubtedly drop out of the locals and enter their own language group. Thus will a Jewish local be established.</p>
   <p>The problems of the Amalgamated are many, yet sooner or later they will be solved. The will is there and the spirit is rich. The only thing lacking is experience and this cannot be purchased but must be acquired. The members of the Amalgamated must have patience. They must be cool and considerate in their thinking so as to transact their business rightly. They have paid a great price for their union and they must maintain it. We must remember that our victory was a victory of the entire labor movement. If we recall the strike of 1910 and 1915, we see that the Socialist Party gave its active workers, its paper to aid in the fight. We can see the trade union movement growing. The Jewish union especially, aided and are still aiding us with time, energy, and money.</p>
