   <p>We wish to extend sincere congratulations to the Jewish citizens of Chicago for their participation in the election of Judge William E. Dever to the office of mayor. They have shown themselves capable of properly evaluating a candidate for public office, and at the same time, they have manifested their power and influence in the political life of this city.</p>
   <p>The large vote cast by the Jews for Dever was given to the candidate of the Democratic party, which, since 1897, when Carter H. Harrison was elected mayor, has been quite friendly to Jews. The Democratic party here has given us great recognition by appointing Jews to important offices, by placing Jews on their tickets [as candidates] for high offices, and by seeing to it that they were elected. This recognition on the one hand, and the large vote cast by the Jews for Dever on the other hand, should serve as a lesson <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the Republicans of this city who underestimated the strength of the Jewish vote.</p>
   <p>Chicago Jews generally have more confidence in the Democratic leadership than in the haughty Republican. They [the Jews] don't have to approach the Democratic party via the backdoor, nor need they resort to any mediators when they want a favor. This sentiment, i. e., the friendly relationship between the Democratic leaders and the Jews, is expressed in the columns of the Courier throughout the entire year, especially during campaigns.</p>
   <p>The Republican party here has only five Jews in important offices: Hugo Pam and Hugo Friend, Superior Court judges; Morris Eller, member of the Sanitary Board; Emanuel Eller and Joseph Shulman, Municipal Court judges. Only a few other Jews have held small jobs here and there. The Ellers and Shulman need not feel grateful to the Republican party for their offices, but rather to Mayor Thompson and his faction. The governor has not appointed any Jew to any high office. It is doubtful whether there have been three Jews in state jobs, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>during the period that Len Small has been in Springfield. Like Thompson, Small appealed to the Jewish vote before the election, but after the election, he turned his back on the Jews.</p>
   <p>The Democratic party, on the other hand, put into office Joseph B. David, Joseph Sabath, Harry M. Fisher, Superior Court judges; Michael Rosenberg, member of the Sanitary Board; Jacob Lindheimer, assistant county treasurer; Harry A. Lipsky, election commissioner, Henry A. Berger, county attorney; Jacob Arvey, alderman; Max Korshak Fred Bernstein, and Sidney Pollack, masters in chancery; and quite a number of other Jews who work in every city and county office controlled by Democrats. The new mayor will undoubtedly appoint additional Jews to office. Let us not forget our two Federal judges [Julian] Mack and [Samuel] Alshuler; and what about Congressman [A. J.] Sabath? They are all Democrats.</p>
   <p>Dever is a man of great ability. He will be able to do a great deal for our city. He will provide better, cheaper, and more comfortable transportation.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>He will make our public schools the best in the world. He will also provide wider and better streets, cleaner alleys, more playgrounds, swimming pools, better-equipped fire departments, electrified railroad lines; in short, a healthier, cleaner, and safer Chicago. This is Dever's program and he will carry it through.</p>
   <p>All this speaks well for the Democratic party in Chicago, and, therefore, it is no wonder that the Jews of Chicago voted, in the main, for the Democratic party.</p>
