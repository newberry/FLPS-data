   <p>There are two classes in the present social system - the poor and the wealthy. These are divergent in character and whatever is beneficial to one is injurious to the other. Between the two there is a continuous struggle because the rich enslave the poor and dominate them, and the poor struggle against this. Modern social workers seek various means to equalize these two classes. They are the "fire-fighters" who are constantly pouring watery rhetoric into the hearts of the downtrodden masses in order to extinguish within them the wrath which they hold for their oppressors. They are always telling the impoverished masses how good the rich are, how noble their spiritual leaders are, and how their hearts throb with love for suffering humanity, and that they do not cause the scarcity and miseries existing in this world, but the present system, under which we live. On the other hand they influence the wealthy to throw a sop to the miserable and helpless needy so that they should not bellow and grumble so much. When a worker loses an arm in a factory because he was forced by his foreman to accelerate production, he is taken to a free hospital where he is given medical attention until he is discharged and able to go out begging for bread; when a worker gets old and can no longer produce, he will be admitted to some home for the aged. These and other such institutions are created by our social workers in order to make peace between the two classes.</p>
   
   <p>All this does not always stop the mob from grumbling and bellowing. The radical "cranks," who are dissatisfied with the present social order, are forever enlightening the poor, ignorant masses that all the "charity" given by the rich is no more than a bone thrown to the poor, which only intensifies their servile condition.</p>
   <p>John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who is considered a "social worker," has discovered a brand new method for abolishing the classes, and that is through military conscription. The different strata of society can not assimilate, he asserted, unless there is a stronger force than sheer theoretical democracy to keep them together.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Rockefeller, therefore, thinks that conscription is the only way to abolish the different classes, because all are equal on the battlefield, and when a bomb drops and a shot is fired there is no discrimination between the rich and poor. Both stand the same chance to get killed and lie side by side.</p>
   <p>In the final analysis, Mr. Rockefeller philosophizes that there is no divergence in classes among us in this country. He shows an illustration from real life, that class difference is something greatly due to outward appearance, e. g., beautiful clothes.</p>
   <p>"Should a group of average American workers," he says, "step out in fine clothes, tailored on Fifth Avenue, it would be hard to believe that they were not on their way to their country clubs."</p>
   
   <p>This definition is very scholarly and only a modern social worker like Mr. Rockefeller could expound it. This implies, in other words, that the poor American workers are human as well as we (the Rockefellers); the only difference is that they are not clothed as well as we, the rich. They do not have the same luxuries; they leave the factories dirty; at home they have no food; their entire life is a string of troubles; in winter they suffer from cold, in summer from heat; their homes are not palaces, as ours are, but cages, nests of disease and plagues.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rockefeller's explanation of the American workingman coincides with explanations of a radical theory of capitalist and worker. But his opinion that the equalizing of different classes can be brought about by general military conscription, is far from logic. What, for instance, will happen after the military service terminates? The rich man will, then, attire himself in clothes tailored by artistic craftsmen of Fifth Avenue, and the poor man will be forced to buy himself a pair of overalls and look for work in his rich "comrade's" factory, where he will be rewarded with starvation wages.</p>
   <p>We herein do not wish to tell the workers how to improve their lot and how to actually abolish classes, but it is high time to expose the illogic of our money barons, on how they would solve the great Social Question of class-antagonism.</p>
