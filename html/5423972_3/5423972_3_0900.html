   <p>The Call to the Battle of Our Union.</p>
   <p>Today, Thursday December 1, all together as one person, you leave your shops, according to your vote of over a week ago. Today is an historical day for our union. We reject the unheard of insolence in bringing us back to the old sweat shop system of long ago.</p>
   <p>This is the day you leave your shop with the assurance that soon you will all return complete victors. This is the day you begin to seek justice for yourself, your family and your union. Today, exactly at 10 o'clock, not a minute before, nor a minute after, slowly and easily, get your tools together, and all together nicely and dignified, march down from your shops, straight to your union halls.</p>
   <p>Long live the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Long live the Cloakmakers Union.</p>
   <p>The General Strike Committee</p>
   <p>Chicago Cloakmakers Union.</p>
