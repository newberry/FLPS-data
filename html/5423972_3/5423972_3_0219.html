   <p>Beginning next Saturday night, when local Jewish women give the shohet [Translator's note: man who slaughters animals in accordance with Jewish laws. Plural--shohatim] a fowl to slaughter, they will have to pay him eight cents instead of the present six-cent price.</p>
   <p>The Shohatim and Butchers Union, Local 598, found itself forced to increase slaughter fees two cents because of the present high cost of living, which affects the shohatim as much as any other worker. The shohatim have been working for the present price for the past year and a half; they believe, therefore, that they are entitled to a two-cent raise from the local public.</p>
   <p>The union awaits the co-operation of the general public in this modest demand for an eight-cent slaughter fee.</p>
