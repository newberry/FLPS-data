   <p>The Communist leaders of the Joint Board of the Cloak Makers Union locals were severely defeated yesterday. Their plan to seize the finance department of the Joint Board and to re-instate a left manager in charge of the fund fell through by a large majority as 656 members voted against the referendum and 530 in favor. There were 1,186 votes cast.</p>
   <p>The majority of the members, who participated in the referendum, notified the Communists that their rule will not continue for a long time and that no cliques will be permitted to boss the Joint Board and all sub-divisions.</p>

   <p>When the members were called to the office to vote they found detectives watching all members. The news were scattered that the Communist organizer provided detectives from the Detective Bureau in order to intimidate the members. The members protested and the detectives were removed outside.</p>
