   <p>The delegates' meetings of the "Workmen's Circle Cooperative Society" are being held (during the summer months) but once a month. The Board of Directors, however, are as active as ever. Shares continue to be sold and branches are joining. To date 65 branches of the Workmens' circle have joined, besides many individuals members. Over $13,000 in subscriptions have been collected. This latter fact has converted many skeptical branches who did not think $25,000 could be raised to the work of establishing a cooperative bakery.</p>
