   <p>Mr. Pearlman, owner of a dress factory 342 Market St.,conversed with the girls working in his shop, in a very vulgar manner, using profane terms. The girl protested, but Mr. Pearlman paid no attention and continued speaking in the usual way. The business agent, immediately, called Mr. Pearlman's attention to this matter requesting him to address the girls in a more refined manner. Mr. Pearlman told him to leave the shop.</p>
   <p>Brother Ginzberg, the business agent, obeyed but he did not walk out alone, the girls followed him and declared a strike against the immoral language that Mr. Pearlman used in the shop.</p>
   <p>The strike continued for 10 days then the employer settled with the union, agreeing to speak to the girls, as he would to his own daughters.</p>
