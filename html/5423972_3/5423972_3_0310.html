   <p>Thirteen members and leaders of the Progressive Cigar Makers' Union, Local 527, were indicted yesterday by a Grand Jury. They are accused of a series of charges arising from their fight for better Union conditions against the Cigar Companies Lacurba, Landfield and Steele, and Randall Steele, whose factories are in Benton Harbor, Mich.</p>
   <p>The thirteen indicted under specific charges are Rubin Yokelson, financial secretary; Charles Winfield, business agent and member of the executive board; Albert Lingenfelder, David Feldman, Abe Schwartz, Max Lurie, Morris Goldstein, Oscar Rubin, Simon Slutzky, Harry Ackerman, Ruben <span class="gap">[gap]</span>olk, David Ruben, and Jake Bilow.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the union are not a bit surprised about the indictments, being assured that if a certain conspiracy was merely fabricated, those being responsible naturally had no other outlet and were forced to frame the indictments in order to break the union ranks.</p>
   
   <p>The union leaders have also expressed their conviction that the frame-up will be exposed in court, revealing from whom it originated and how it was fabricated.</p>
