   <p>The joint board of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers have engaged a new director for the new employment bureau. The purpose is to establish order and a new system to distribute work to those who report themselves unemployed at the office of the joint board.</p>
   <p>Brice M. Steward was chosen for this position. He has had experience in this capacity, having been in charge of many employment offices of large concerns.</p>
   <p>Immediately upon taking charge Mr. Steward decided to make the following changes in the office, which will soon take effect.</p>
   <p>As it is now, workers of all trades and languages come to one place, a small window where a girl or a young man would attend to the unemployed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Steward will arrange where every one working at certain trades will be registered by a person special for that trade, who will make a record, so that the worker will be sent to the right place to work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Likewise with those speaking foreign languages - they will be sent to register to persons who understand their language, so that they can talk and understand each other.</p>
   <p>From these records Mr. Steward will be able to give out a pamphlet regarding unemployment in the industry at any time anyone wishes to know the conditions of his trade and the industry in general.</p>
   <p>The Activities for the Industrial Corporation</p>
   <p>The main activities the Amalgamated is carrying on besides the daily routine of work in the industry is to create a quota for the Russian American Industrial Corporation. The officers,business agents, joint board delegates and shop chairmen are engaged in this work to make this undertaking a success and to raise a large sum of money in Chicago, through the sales of shares in the industrial corporations, in order that we may possess factories in Russia.</p>
   <p>The Industrial Corporation will control six clothing factories in Petrograd and three factories in Moscow, manufacturing men's clothing, shirts, underwear,caps,gloves, overcoats, etc. Seven-thousand workers will be employed in these factories. The <span class="page-break">\3</span>control of these factories will be in the hands of a common central board consisting of representatives of the Supreme Council of national economy of the Soviet government, and of the Russian American Industrial Corporation; both will have an equal number of representatives.</p>
   <p>The Soviet government guarantees the investment and transfers to the Central Board the factories in Petrograd and Moscow, with all the buildings, machinery, stores of raw materials, and fuel and material that is in the factories at the present time of the transfer.</p>
   <p>Besides all that, the Soviet government guarantees first of all to give the orders for clothing and raw materials to the Central Board, and the stock, now laying in all the departments.</p>
   <p>By this agreement with Soviet government, you can see that the Amalgamated has undertaken an important, safe, and necessary enterprise which deserves the assistance of all friends of Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>The Joint Board now has a drive in progress to sell shares to the members in the factories, also to other organizations that sympathize with Soviet Russia and want <span class="page-break">\4</span>to help in the reconstruction work of the clothing and textile industries of Russia. It is the duty of every person to buy a share or more, to show that they are helping rebuild Russia, not only with sympathy and resolutions but with action that is substantial.</p>
   <p>The Cloakmakers in their Present Task.</p>
   <p>The Cloakmakers have the organization problem staring them in the face. The joint board has earnestly taken up this question and will do all in their power to get rid of these small sweat-shops and the corporation shops that take away the work of the large factories, while the union workers are going around idle.</p>
   <p>This question is the most burning one of the day, for both the Cloakmakers and the the manufacturers, because these shops undermine the Union, and at the same time they are driving the larger manufacturers out of the market through the cheap work that they turn out with the cheap help.</p>
   <p>It is therefore to the interest of every cloak and dress maker to join in the organization campaign and help organize all unorganized workers in the industry and help establish Union conditions in these newly developed shops in Chicago and in the small towns around Chicago.</p>

   <p>The Forward received letters from the Embroidery Workers asking wny nothing is being done to organize them.</p>
   <p>The Embroidery Workers are working under terrible conditions. They are paid the smallest wages for the longest hours, and nobody is doing anything to organize them.</p>
   <p>One letter came from a group of Embroidery Workers appealing that something be done for them, claiming that their season is coming on, and this is time to try and organize them. There are about 600 embroidery workers in Chicago, working in the small shops and many take the work to their homes. They blind their eyes sewing small beads on the dresses and get very little pay for their hard work.</p>
   <p>This question will be taken up this Sunday at the United Hebrew Trades, and it is hoped that the Cloakmakers' delegates will be there and help to organize the Embroidery Workers.</p>

   <p>Butcher-Workers Will Soon Transact the New Agreement With the Bosses</p>
   <p>Local 398 of the Butcher Workers, at their last meeting, have been instructed to work out all the points in their new agreement, which they will present to their bosses before September 1st, when the present agreement expires. The Butcher-Workers are determined to better the conditions for the Workers in the trade.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, the Butcher-Workers and the Shochtim Union organized a Grievance Committee, composed of three members of each Union and three delegates of the United Hebrew Trades. This committee met and determined that all grievances with the bosses must be transacted through this grievance committee, and no strike shall be called in any butcher shop before first having the grievance discussed by the grievance committee.</p>
   <p>Both the Shochtim Union and the Butcher-Workers Union are working in harmony, and there is no doubt that this will improve conditions for the future of both Unions.</p>

   <p>Leather-Workers Preparing To Demand Conditions of Their Bosses</p>
   <p>Another period of three years struggle, waiting and suffering.</p>
   <p>The Suit-Case, Bag-Makers and other novelty workers, determined at their last meeting to present demands to their bosses for a minimum wage of $38.00 per week, and to re-establish the 44-hour week.</p>
   <p>The Leather-Workers Union, Local 12, are now in a better position than they were a while back. The Workers in the shops are agitating strongly in their demand for better conditions. They realize now how dear they have paid for their negligence. They realize that without a Union the bosses can do with the Workers as they please, and the Workers are helpless.</p>
   <p>Now that the season is good, when the bosses need the workers, is the right time to strengthen the organization, and all together demand improvements of conditions and see that these conditions are kept up through the slack seasons of the year.</p>
   <p>The Leather Workers, Suitcase, Bag and Pocketbook Makers who did not come back to the Union, must do so now, so that the new agreement shall have all the <span class="page-break">\8</span>assistance and power of all the leather workers behind it.</p>
   <p>The office of the Leather-Workers Union is 311 S. Ashland Blvd. and the officials are ready to accept every former or new member, as a brother, and together we will battle for better conditions and decent wages.</p>
