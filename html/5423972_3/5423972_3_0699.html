   <p>Sidney Hillman, General President of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, arrived in Chicago today. He came to start negotiations with the Bosses Association and Hart, Schaffner, and Marx, about a raise for all Tailors in Chicago.</p>
   <p>When the Amalgamated Clothing Workers signed a Union-contract with the Ready Made and Special Order Manufacturers Association, a certain clause was inserted in the contract, specifying that the Workers must get a raise and the raise should come to be effective in the Ready-Made Shops the 1st of June, and in the Special Order Houses the 1st of July: and it is believed that a raise will take place in Hart, Schaffner and Marx at the same time as in the Ready-Made Shops, in order that the Ready-Made Shops should work under the same conditions.</p>
