   <p>The proprietors of a clock store on Roosevelt Rd. in the Lawndale district have begun introducing economy in their business. The first thing that they have done, in order to eliminate waste, was to discharge the alteration workers, who were mending and altering women's clothes. Secondly, they cut the wages of the fitters who fit the clothes on the customer.</p>
   <p>One store owner cut $20.00 per week from the salaries of the fitters. Two other store keepers cut wages similarly, and told the fitters to make alterations. After the drastic reduction of wages, the fitters organized into a union, and will attempt, through their solidarity, to win back their previous terms.</p>
   <p>The Ladies Tailors union, of the A. F. of L. and the United Hebrew Trades, will give full support to the fitters union, so that they may earn a living wage.</p>
