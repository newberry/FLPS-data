   <p>In the Amalgamated: All organized workers are interested in knowing what is going on in the Amalgamated because it is the greatest trade union in Chicago. To think what the Chicago tailors have accomplished for themselves and for the tailors in New York, is to admire the power that this young organization possesses.</p>
   <p>Realizing that despite all that the tailors have endured during this slack period, they have been able to contribute nearly $300,000 to help the New York strike, we cannot help but admire the working spirit within that organization.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated is preparing to build a Temple that will be a pride and an example for the entire American labor movement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Friends of the Amalgamated will read with pleasure that conditions in the industry are getting better, work is increasing daily, the list of unemployed is decreasing, and according to the manager of the joint board, Comrade Sam Levin, all indications in the trade for Chicago and vicinity are very good.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of the shop chairman last Monday night at the Auditorium, Comrade Levin, on the basis of information received from the deputies, the union employment bureau, and the manufacturers, stated that the tailors will in the near future, be employed as in normal times. It is to be noticed that there are not many workers complaining about their bosses as in previous times.</p>
   <p>The ladies' garment workers who belong to the Dress and Waist Makers' Union, Local 100, are going through a slack period.</p>
   <p>In some unions, various members are blaming their organization for their unemployment, but that is not the case in Local 100. There the members <span class="page-break">\3</span>realize that the present conditions in the trade are no different from the conditions prevailing throughout the country.</p>
   <p>The fact that the union has control of most of the shops in the trade, prevents an unequal distribution of work. Thus, there are none who are entirely unemployed and none who work more than the next. This keeps peace in the union's ranks.</p>
   <p>Prices are being kept up, and salaries also, and above all, the 44-hour week, which is the standard in the union shops of Local 100, still prevails.</p>
   <p>The minimum scale for a union cutter was $39, and the union brought the scale up to $45.50, and even as high as $55 a week. In non-union shops, the cutters still get $30 to $35 per week.</p>
   <p>The same is true of the operators, finishers, and drapers. They get from $28 to $35 per week, where, in the non-union shops they pay only $14 to $18 per <span class="page-break">\4</span>week.</p>
   <p>This is the best example of the difference between a union and a non-union shop.</p>
   <p>Shorter hours, higher wages, a division of work in slack seasons, and the right to arrange working conditions, are the four cornerstones of the trade union movement.</p>
   <p>The members of Local 100 realize all these facts and this realization keeps them united.</p>
   <p>The unorganized dressmakers and waist-makers thought that prosperity during the time of war and the promises of their bosses in those days, and their present 44-hour week would last for a long time, but it ended exactly as the union had told them. When a boss gives you something free willingly, he is bound to take it back, but when workers get something through their power, <span class="page-break">\5</span>they never give back.</p>
   <p>Local 100 realizes these conditions and is preparing for a drive to organize the workers in the shops where the bosses are showing their true characters as profiteers who want the hide off their workers who are slaving and giving their sweat and blood to make their bosses rich.</p>
   <p>The Ladies' Tailors Union is suffering, perhaps, more than all other unions, due to the capricious styles and seasons.</p>
   <p>They work 44 hours a week and their minimum scale is $55 per week. The bosses tried to bring this minimum down but the union called strikes in those shops, and in a short time the bosses learned that it was impossible to reduce the $55 scale, so long as the union exists.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Ladies' Tailors Union the question of conditions and the attempt of the bosses to cut down the $55 minimum was discussed, <span class="page-break">\6</span>and they decided to create a defense fund, and to be prepared to defend the interests of the organization and the workers in case the bosses try to combat the union. It was unanimously agreed at their meeting that each member shall be taxed $10 for a special fund, to be used only in the defense of the union in case of strike.</p>
