   <p>Chicago greets the delegates to the fifth biennial convention of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers [Union] today. The Amalgamated is not a specifically Jewish Organization and the Jews do not even constitute a majority in the organization, but a vast number of Jews in America who are employed in the men's clothing industry are, in the majority of cases, members of the Amalgamated. For this reason the activities of the Amalgamated are generally of interest to Jews, especially when one considers the fact that the leaders of the Union are Jews, who are guided in their activity by their Jewish temperament and Jewish feeling.The Amalgamated is considered on the Jewish street as a Jewish organization because thousands of Jews belong to it and because it is led by Jewish brains.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated is a driving and decisive force in the needle trades industry of America, and though officially it is not a Jewish organization, its influence is definitely recognized in the Jewish life of America. When great Jewish problems <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of general importance arise, during the course of events, one listens to the opinion of Mr. Hillman and Mr. Schlossberg, the two capable leaders of this mighty labor organization because they are trusted by tens of thousands of Jewish workers, which gives them the right to speak about these problems in the name of those workers. That is why the great masses of American Jews are interested in the fate and the development of the Amalgamated, and follow with the greatest interest everything that happens within its ranks.</p>
   <p>The first four conventions of the Amalgamated were devoted to problems of organization and consolidation of forces and opportunities. The fifth convention, which opens today in Chicago, will devote itself not only to the problem of organization, but also to great economic and political problems which are of great importance not only to the Amalgamated but to the entire labor movement. The most important of these problems is [the question of] the workers' bank, with a capital of three hundred thousand dollars, which the Amalgamated wants to establish in Chicago.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The bank will be more than a savings bank. It will be a great weapon in the hands of the workers in their struggle against capitalism. If this undertaking is successful, similar financial institutions will arise in every great industrial center, and the workers will, at least, have the satisfaction of knowing that the capitalists do not use the money of the workers in their fight against labor. There is no ground to suppose this undertaking will not be successful. Many unions have millions in their treasury--they can guarantee the existence of a bank--and if the workers' bank should also participate in industries in association with the co-operative societies, they may yet become mighty financial institutions. But, entirely apart from these broad possibilities, the projected bank will be a great help to the workers' organization in a period of crisis. A capitalist bank will not loan any money to a workers' organization in a period of crisis or a strike, but a workers' bank, knowing the financial condition of this or that union, will certainly do so. In this way, the workers will obtain new and mighty support in their struggle against the pressure of big capital.</p>
   <p>To judge by the projects and perspectives which the bank has, it will develop much <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>faster than a private bank. In the ranks of the Amalgamated they say that within the first year of its existence the bank will have five million dollars in deposits, because many unions have promised to deposit their money in a workers' bank.</p>
   <p>This bank project alone indicates the important plans and problems which the Amalgamated is facing at its fifth biennial convention and shows the great significance of the convention in the history of the labor movement in America.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Amalgamated know how strong and solid their organization is, and that now they can consider great constructive plans, which will have a bearing upon their future development.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Amalgamated also know that as long as chaos reigns in Europe, the economic equilibrium there will be destroyed. They also know that as long as the economic equilibrium in Europe is destroyed, Europe will not be able to buy <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>from America, and America will not produce because it will lack markets for the disposal of its products. The first sufferers from such a state of affairs, will be the American workers.</p>
   <p>To help Europe overcome its economic chaos means, first of all, to help Russia adjust itself economically. Whatever the Amalgamated, which is the greatest labor organization in the needle trade industry, can do for Russia on the economic field--on the political field it cannot and it will not do anything--it will certainly do. It will seek to help the Russian worker, it will make a sincere effort to obtain tools for the Russian worker, and it will do everything within its power to fulfill its duty in this respect.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Amalgamated will come to the convention with some constructive proposals and the delegates to the convention will consider those proposals seriously. The convention will also take up the problem of the education of its members and the problem of organization.</p>
   <p>All in all, the fifth biennial convention of the Amalgamated promises to be a <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>constructive and epoch-making one. As for as we are concerned, we can only wish it good luck and success in its work.</p>
