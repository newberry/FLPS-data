   <p>They (the left) claim that our platform (of the Socialist Party) is worthless because it contains demands for immediate reforms and immediate social legislation, all of which are concerned only with the present. This claim is fallacious. The (Socialist) Party cannot do otherwise than demand immediate reforms, if it wishes to function as the representative of the economic interests of the working class. You cannot interest the workers in vague futures, with promises for some distant time. They can be interested in political activity only through their demands for immediate results.</p>
   <p>The Socialist Party must have a twofold program: a minimum and a maximum. The minimum program is for the present - for the period in which the Party exerts its efforts to organize the masses into a political unit. While attempting this organizational work in the various cities and states throughout the country, we must use as our primary weapon of agitation, a program that can be enacted into legislation, immediately our leaders are elected to office.</p>
   <p>Our party must acquaint itself, therefore, with the interests and demands of the organized worker; the party must declare itself against child labor, <span class="page-break">2</span>against the labor injunction, and against the exploitation of women; the party must proclaim itself for women's suffrage and for factory and mine legislation. In fact, all these problems created by the present system must be faced by a law abiding group and solved in a lawful manner, until the majority of the working class will become convinced of the truth of our socialist principles. Then they will use their political organization (built during the agitation period) to obtain control of the government which will then become the weapon for the destruction of the present capitalism. Until that time the Socialist Party must demand immediate legislation.</p>
   <p>It is possible for a political party to exist with a maximum program only, but by contenting itself merely with voicing repeated demands for revolution, they allow themselves to degenerate into a mere group of fanatical partisans. We have had such sects; we have had and still have the S. L. P. and the anarchists; we can see the fruitlessness of their work.</p>
   <p>No leftist can deny that under their program, an elected socialist, if he were to remain consistent, would merely sit peacefully in his seat and await the <span class="page-break">3</span>coming of the revolution. But in reality, the leftist would be forced to oppose all evil law, to protect all favorable legislation, and to propose new legislation which would be favorable to the working class.</p>
   <p>Should the leftist, in office, refuse to participate in such activities he would be consistent. Then and then only would they have the right to declare unnecessary a program containing immediate demands. But they do not go so far. They want the world to believe them to be socialists and not syndicalists. If they are socialists then there is but one way. A Socialist Party desirous of functioning must have a program, must voice the demands of labor, must put these demands in writing so that capitalist leaders may read and learn therefrom. Our leaders and elected officials must know the wishes of the rank and file. The elected person must be acquainted with the tactics and platform of our party.</p>
   <p>To say that you believe in political action, but to deny the necessity for a platform voicing our demands for immediate concessions from the capitalist society and government is equal to saying that workers should unionize themselves, <span class="page-break">4</span>but should not demand sanitary factories, higher wages, better treatment, and union recognition. It is equal to our saying that we demand a soviet government and the nationalization of factors, but until the time we secure these goals, we have no other desires. Every union that would voice any demand for reform would be condemned as bourgeois and counter-revolutionary.</p>
   <p>The same logic applicable to unions can be applied to a political party. By its temporal demands the Socialist Party compels the capitalist class to grant better working conditions and to acknowledge that workers have certain interests. If, however, the party were to remain only a theorizing group with no function in life, it would present no attraction which would cause the masses to join. But if the party identifies itself with the masses, and works in its interests they then give the workers a clear picture of the significance of a worker's party for their class.</p>
