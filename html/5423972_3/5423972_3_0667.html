   <p>An important problem facing the officials of the Cloakmakers Union is the question of reorganization, which the Chicago cloak manufacturers have suddenly taken up with great enthusiasm. The importance of this problem consists in the fact that legally the manufacturers have a right to reorganize their business, i. e., legally from the Union's standpoint. Just as any law can be interpreted in many different ways, so the manufacturers interpret this legal privilege in their own interests, and are using it during the present period of unemployment to obtain better conditions for themselves.</p>
   <p>....According to the Union contract, the employer has the right to reorganize his factory in any manner he thinks best. He has the right to reduce the number of workers when his interests demand it, and he also has the right to retain the workers that he desires. The manufacturers, however, take advantage of this privilege and reorganize their factories over and over again. At the same time they dismiss those workers whom they wish to get rid of, and retain those whom they like and from whom they can derive more profit. The importance of this problem was clearly revealed in an interview between your reporter and Mr. Schoolman, secretary of the Chicago Cloakmakers Union and vice-president of the International.</p>
   <p>"The trouble with this reorganization privilege," said Mr. Schoolman, "is that it was made in normal times, when the Union could not foresee the fact that the manufacturers would sometimes use it for their own interests. When a manufacturer honestly wants to reorganize his shop, he should have that privilege. But when he takes advantage of it and uses it in his own interests, then it becomes a lash with which to flog the Union. It is not easy for a manufacturer to discharge a worker when the employer has to convince the Union that he has good reasons for discharging him. If the Union recognizes those reasons, then the manufacturer can discharge the worker; but when the manufacturer uses his reorganization privilege, then he can suddenly reduce the number of his employees, and can discharge dozens of workers at a time.</p>
   <p>"This sort of operation is very profitable to the manufacturers because it is worth a lot more to them to pay a few additional dollars for a skilled worker, than to employ an ordinary worker."</p>
   <p>This explanation threw a great deal of clarity upon the situation; we could understand why the manufacturers have become so enthusiastic about the reorganization business, and why this problem is so significant to the Cloakmakers Union.</p>
   <p>The Union has one important argument with regard to this problem. Their argument is that if reorganization is to take place, it should be done at the beginning of the season, when a worker has a chance to get another job, or to decide what he wants to do, if he is unable to get a job. At the present time, the representatives of the Cloakmakers Union are actually negotiating this important problem [with the manufacturers], and are seeking the best and most effective way to solve it.</p>
   <p>The capmakers, who are only one section of the needle trades, are undergoing the same crisis that has affected the whole industry. They, like all other workers in the industry, are suffering from the unemployment situation. The Capmakers Union, as a part of the needle trades industry, not only obtained better working conditions and higher wages for its members, but it also gave them spiritual guidance; it developed class consciousness in them, and made them into a powerful, disciplined army, which is now able to withstand this critical situation. The Union is strong enough to prevent its members from becoming the victims of the unemployment crisis.</p>
   <p>The capmakers know that at the present time when unemployment is on the increase, it is more imperative than ever before to strengthen their ranks and to stand solid against their enemies, who can attack them at any time, and can take advantage of their miserable conditions.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the attendance at meetings of the Capmakers Union is larger today than ever before. The members are taking a greater interest in the meetings, and in general there is a closer unity between the members and the Union officials. The membership has remained loyal to the Union which, they know, will be able to accomplish a great deal when the industrial situation of the country improves. At the same time, the Union protects the gains which the workers have won after a hard struggle.</p>
   <p>The work of Chicago's progressive cigar makers, who recently broke away from the International Cigar Makers Union, was crowned with even more success than the greatest optimists ever expected. Despite the great disappointment of the cigar makers, when, after long years of trying to build the Progressive Cigar Makers Union, they themselves were compelled to destroy it, nevertheless, they have joined the new union, The Amalgamated Tobacco Workers, and are working enthusiastically to develop and strengthen it. During the short time that the new union has been in existence, many hundreds of new members have joined it, and others are continuing to come into its ranks.</p>
   <p>The cigar makers, who have attained a prominent place in the ranks of the intelligent groups of enlightened workers, have shown by this achievement that they deserve that place. The success of the new union is the best proof thereof. A meeting of this union will be held this evening and it is expected that many cigar makers who, thus far, have refrained from becoming members, will do so at tonight's meeting.</p>
   <p>Not long ago, the Courier reported that a new sort of union had been organized in Chicago. The news was sent to us by the Leather Workers Union, whose members were dismissed from their jobs as a result of a lockout twenty weeks ago, and are still unemployed. According to the Union's statement, the firm of Morris Mann and Bailey, 111 South Wells Street, manufacturers of leather goods, have organized a company union for their workers. Through this union, the workers receive sick benefits and also have something to say about the management of the shop through their shop committee. The employees' committee collaborates with a committee representing the employers in determining the wage scale and in settling disputes which may arise between the workers and the management.</p>
   <p>As soon as the news appeared in the Courier, the firm declared that they had a grievance, that something was not just right [about the report], and asked for an investigation. Your reporter undertook to investigate the matter; he visited the factory, spoke to the manager of the firm and to the workers, and promised to publish the result of this investigation. The result can be stated briefly: the news item in the Courier about the company union was reported accurately.</p>
   
   <p>The truth is that even the manager of the firm did not claim that we had misrepresented facts; he simply wanted a write-up about his union. Under the best of circumstances, we cannot fulfill a request like that because we have very little faith or confidence in company unions. The workers themselves do not believe in them, but are forced to join, as some of the more intelligent workers personally told us.</p>
