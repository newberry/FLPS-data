   <p>SHEAF WORKERS WIN STRIKE</p>
   <p>The local sheaf workers, who have recently begun organizing, have already scored a victory over their bosses. The 125 workers of I. Irvin and Co., 1055. Division Street, who walked out on strike last Monday, demanding a one dollar raise, a nine day, and time a half for overtime, have returned to their work Friday after winning all demands. The strike was carried on with the aid of the Chicago Federation of Labor.</p>
