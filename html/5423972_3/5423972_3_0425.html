   <p>Thanks is due the Bakers' Union, Local 237, for their written and oral agitation which made possible for the large Jewish public the use of union bread. It is hard to find a Jewish home that does not use the bread with the union label. And it is this hearty and willing sympathy of the Jewish masses which lifted the standards of hundreds and hundreds of Jewish bakers to a better economic level.</p>
   <p>Yet there are bosses who seek to sell in the Jewish market bread from non-union shops and non-union workmen. But such shops have thus far come to an untimely end. At present there is one such boss who recently opened a non-union bakery and is trying to sell his wares in the Lawndale district in which he is located. The union, naturally, took all peaceful means to keep the public from buying this non-union bread. Local #237 held open air meetings, circulated pamphlets, etc. It appeared to be of no avail since this boss thought he would teach the union a thing or two. He began to use various vile and violent methods to break the union, until one day he had some union workers arrested who had been standing on a corner appealing to the public to refrain from buying any bread which did not bear the union label. Naturally, when the trial came up in the Maxwell Street Station the Jewish Judge Fisher freed the workmen and warned this boss, "Remember, America is not Russia and free speech is permitted here".</p>
   <p>The Bakers' Union should create a strong agitation in the neigborhood of this <span class="page-break">2</span>non-union shop by going from house to house, store to store, and appeal to everyone both through print and speech in favor of union bread.</p>
   <p>Not only does bread with a union label mean that it was baked by union men who receive better wages, have shorter hours, and better working conditions but it also indicates that the bread was baked in a sanitary shop, where the men are not overworked.</p>
   <p>The large Jewish public knows what a task it is to stand and bake bread. The workmen stay in the roasting heat all night when everyone else is sleeping and resting. At home he does not have much time with his family since he must sleep through the day to work again at night. The large public that understands this will sympathize with five hundred Jewish families who draw their subsistance by baking bread, and will certainly buy only such bread as carries the union label.</p>
