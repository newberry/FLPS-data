   <p>At a meeting of the unemployed last night at Singer's Hall, a committee of ten was appointed, with Mr. M. Gold as chairman, and invested with the power to contact some reliable persons who are in a position to create employment and open a free soup kitchen. The plans to open the free kitchen will be completed today.</p>
   <p>This committee will contact the radical relief committee demanding that to establish relief for the unemployed here in Chicago is as much a necessity as to send relief to the unfortunate Jews in Europe.</p>
