   <p>A committee will go from door to door, Sunday, March 2, for the purpose of collecting money for the striking tailors of New York. The committee will be under the supervision of the Relief Conference for the New York tailors.</p>
   <p>No one will refuse to contribute something in order to help the thousands of tailors, who are heroically fighting the struggle for better conditions.</p>
   <p>The Relief Conference consists of several organizations and unions devoting their time and energy in raising money for the New York strikers. They have already forwarded money to the strikers and trust that the Chicago Jewry will contribute their human aid to the thousands of strikers who together with their wives and children are exposed to hunger, shelter, and want.</p>

   <p>Help as much as you can! It is a humane debt.</p>
   <p>(Editors note: This strike proved successful and established the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. It is noteworthy also in having drawn Louis D. Brandeis into the controversy as arbitrator. It is from this event that the latter's interest in internal Jewish affairs is dated. See Jewish Frontier, Vol. III, No. 10, Nov. 1936.)</p>
