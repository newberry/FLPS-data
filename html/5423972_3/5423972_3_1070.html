   <p>The Jewish Bakery Drivers Union, at their meeting yesterday evening at Arkin's Hall, decided to give the bosses time until next Saturday. The drivers have altered their demands. They demand now: $25 a week for delivering merchandise valued up to four hundred dollars during a week; $26 a week for delivering merchandise values at between four hundred and six hundred dollars a week, and $28 for those who deliver merchandise above the six hundred dollar mark.</p>
   <p>These new demands were taken by the bosses under advisement. The bosses also asked the Union to extend the time, for a decision until Saturday. At any rate, should the demands meet with any opposition from the bosses, the drivers by that time will have received from the International the necessary permission to walk out in a strike, which will be declared as soon as the bosses refuse to grand the demand of a raise in wages.</p>
