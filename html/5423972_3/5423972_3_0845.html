   <p>At a meeting of the United Hebrew Trades, Sunday morning September 5, a proposal was made to appoint a committee in order to carry on work in collecting money for the striking train-shop workers.</p>
   <p>Several delegates spoke in favor of the motion and stated that the United Hebrew Trades must be independent, without calling conferences where unnecessary disputes arise concerning issues which have no relation to the organized labor movement. It was unanimously determined at this meeting that the most important work for the unions, now, is to support the brave striking train-shop workers, who appeal for aid for their women and children. A committee of five delegates was appointed, which will meet today in the office of the United Hebrew Trades to designate a plan as how to raise money for the strikers.</p>
   <p>The representative of the Los Angeles Sanitorium, Mr. Flantzer, gave a report of his work in the unions and appealed for support in his important work.</p>

   <p>The United Hebrew Trades, determined to appeal to all the unions that they should rule that each member should contribute a dollar a year to this important institution, where human lives are being saved. Mr. Flantzer reported that the Joint Board of the Cloak Makers Union determined to recommend to all Locals that each member should be assessed fifty cents and obtain a sanitorium stamp on the dues book.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades appeals to all unions that they should follow that example and join in a membership campaign with a definite sum to every member for one year.</p>
