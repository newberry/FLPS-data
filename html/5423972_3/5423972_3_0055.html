   <p>The demands of the Jewish Bakery Workers Union, Local 237, are founded upon justice and are appropriate to the conditions of the trade. The cry raised by the bakery bosses is intended to throw dust into the eyes of the Jewish public. The truth is that the Jewish bakery bosses want to imitate the "big fifteen" of the Gentile bakeries and want to break our Union, our only defense against long hours and starvation wages.</p>
   <p>What do we demand? Only a wage increase of five dollars a week. Is this such a big demand that it will ruin the bosses? Their outcry is intended <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>only to confuse the public. The few dollars that we demand to make it easier for us to meet the high cost of everything do not mean much to the bosses. They just want to give a death blow to the Bakery Workers Union. They have been preparing themselves for this for a long time and this costs them much more than the raise we demand would amount to.</p>
   <p>The Jewish bakery bosses think, it seems, that the Jewish masses will let themselves be confused. To confuse them, they tell a fairy tale about the Gentile bakery workers. They seek to arouse pity for themselves by these fairy tales. The truth is this: The Gentile bakery workers work with machinery. Most of them are not mechanics. Labor is divided in their bakeries. First of all, their work is much easier than the work of the Jewish bakery workers, and, secondly, one does not have to be an expert workman to be a Gentile bakery worker. Their wages are, in spite of all this, fifty-one dollars a week.</p>
   <p>The Gentile bakery workers always receive extra pay for night work. They <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>receive pay, on the average, for four more hours of night work than do the Jewish bakery workers.</p>
   <p>We wish to remind the bakery bosses, while speaking about extra pay for night work, that the Bakery Workers Union wants to abolish night work entirely and would forego with much satisfaction the extra pay for this kind of work. The bosses themselves, however, request that we should work at night. They have agreed to pay more for night work, because this is being done in all other trades.</p>
   <p>Why do not the bosses tell that the Jewish bakery workers have to work three times as hard as the Gentile bakery workers? We have to do everything with our hands. We do not work in such convenient and modern bakeries as the Gentiles do, but in spite of that we turn out more and better work than the Gentiles with their machinery.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Why do not the bosses tell that we the Jewish bakery workers give a day's wages every week to the unemployed? This means less wages for a week's work to the Jewish bakery workers. We are the only workers in the country who voluntarily perform such an idealistic, brotherly act.</p>
   <p>Why do not the bosses tell that the extra pay for night work is not regular but accidental and that one can never depend upon it?</p>
   <p>The bakery bosses also say that the first and second hands receive big wages. This is not true. The truth is that the average bakery worker receives only ten dollars and fifty cents for a night's work. There are a few individuals who receive more, but they do not get it for their good looks. They receive more pay because they work harder. Sometimes they have to take care of four ovens. The bakery bosses, referring to the few better paid workers, want to convince the public that the bakery workers are receiving <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>high wages and they thus want to justify the ugly deeds they do now to break the Jewish Bakery Workers Union.</p>
   <p>There are no helpers in the Jewish bakery trade. Everyone who bakes is a worker. The bosses employ helpers whom they pay twenty-five dollars a week, but these helpers are not bakery workers, they are not members of the Jewish Bakery Workers Union.</p>
   <p>Our jobs are absolutely insecure; the bosses can fire us without any notice. The bosses come out with a cry about high wages. There are only a few lucky individuals who receive in full the demanded wages. Most of the Jewish bakery workers hardly earn a living. They work very hard under very unfavorable working conditions.</p>
   <p>We believe that the Jewish public which has always sided with the bakery workers, will not let itself be deceived by the false claims of the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>bakery bosses. We strike for a just cause and we are ready at any time to negotiate with the bosses in a decent, just way.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Jewish Bakery Workers Union, Local 237 of the International Bakery and Confectionery Workers' Union of America.</p>
   <p>Buy bread with the union label! Watch for the true union label!</p>
