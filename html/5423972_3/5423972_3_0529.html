   <p>Thirty-four members of locals thirty-nine and sixty-one of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America left last night for Russia. They bade farewell to their families and friends at a banquet given in their honor at the Labor Lyceum last night.</p>
   <p>This group will unite with several other groups of tailors from New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and they will all leave together for Russia on August twenty-ninth, on the "Berengaria". The group is taking enough machinery, beds, and bedding, and sufficient food to last the whole group for a year.</p>
   <p>This group will be employed in factory number thirty-six in Moscow. The Soviet government guarantees every cent of the investment. The group will work on a co-operative basis. Everyone will receive a certain amount [of money] each week as wages and whatever remains, over the cost of production, will belong to the Soviet government.</p>
   <p>The Chicago group was given a warm farewell by the representatives of the Chicago Union, at a banquet last night. Local thirty-nine gave the departing group a check for five hundred dollars, which the group will use in its splendid task of helping to develop the clothing industry of Russia.</p>
