   <p>The Communist International has issued an order to the communists of America to organize an open Communist party in America. This would be a very logical order--if there were a large number of communists in America and if the American people and government were willing to tolerate such a party. But there aren't enough communists in America to build a party, and that is why the order of the Communist International will remain a paper order.</p>
   <p>The handful of communist generals in America--there are no privates among communists--should not delude themselves that Americans are simpletons. After Communist Russia has abolished communism and officially introduced private property and free trade, the communists need not think that they can sell their communist merchandise to America. If communism was neither good nor suitable for Russia, then it is certainly neither good nor suitable for America. Why, therefore, do the communists prate about a Communist party in America?</p>
