   <p>The Chicago Lodge No. 437, A. F. and A. M., was instituted in 1864. While we cannot designate this Masonic lodge as an exclusively Jewish institution, yet Jews, in the main, were instrumental in its establishment.</p>
   <p>The first master of this lodge was Charles Cohen, who continued in office during the years of 1866 and 1867, and was again elected in 1878 and 1882.</p>
   <p>For many years, Mr. Nathan Hefter has been the secretary of the Chicago Lodge. Many of our leading Jews in Chicago are now permanent members.</p>
   <p>This institution has built up through the many years of its existence a bright record of noble deeds for charity.</p>
