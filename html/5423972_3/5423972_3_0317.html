   <p>The organized Jewish workers of Chicago deserve to be criticized for their negligence and lack of interest in the fate of the thousands of organized Jewish workers and in the tasks of the United Hebrew Trades of Chicago. From all sides you can hear the cries of the unorganized - "Help us organize into unions." It is needless to say that this is the opportune time to agitate strongly toward organizing new unions. The unorganized feel the effect of the high cost of living and their helplessness against the employers. The organized workers have at least a protective remedy, their union. They can demand improved conditions. They possess the mechanism that can express its power against employers. Now, when so many new unions have been organized through the United Hebrew Trades, and so many more trades are asking to be organized, the question arises - who is to help in this work if not the already organized workers who should be interested in seeing all workers organized.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades should call a conference of delegates of all trade unions and of the Workmen's Circle, so that the question can be laid before <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the delegates. There is no doubt that a way will be found to establish methods whereby the United Hebrew Trades will be able to fulfil the task.</p>
   <p>Now is the time to help the new weak unions to exist, and to grow.</p>
