   <p>The Jewish bakery drivers who have recently organized themselves into a union, Local 734 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have finally completed their demands which they will present to the bosses in the near future. If all the demands of the workers are not granted by October 1, then a general strike will definitely be declared by all Jewish bakery drivers.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the bakery drivers have acted sensibly when they refused to follow a few individuals who, discouraged by their unbearable working conditions, wanted to call a strike at a time when the organization was still young. Why should a strike be called when all the drivers were not yet properly organized?</p>
   <p>At that time, a strike could not have had a good chance of being successful, and apart from the fact that no one could, at that time, guarantee support from all the drivers, the organized working class [in other trades] would have been <span class="page-break">\2</span>unable to co-operate with drivers in any struggle for the simple reason that the latter were not affiliated with any organization.</p>
   <p>But things are quite different now. The bakery drivers are now in a different position and regardless of from what angle we may look at their coming struggle, one thing, however, is certain, viz., the workers will certainly win. And the drivers will win because first, they are now well organized; second, they are no longer alone but are united with the Brotherhood of Teamsters; third, the local organized working class will undoubtedly support them and will co-operate in every way so that the strike will culminate in a complete victory.</p>
   <p>Among the most important demands drawn up by the bakery drivers union are the following:</p>
   <p>1. All bosses shall employ only members of the union.</p>
   <p>2. The wage scale shall be seventeen dollars a week for those who collect up to $200 on their weekly routes; nineteen dollars on routes from $200 to $300; <span class="page-break">\3</span>twenty-one dollars on routes from $300 to $400; those who collect more than $400 per week should be given three per cent commission on all sales.</p>
   <p>3. No driver shall work on Sunday.</p>
   <p>4. Drivers shall not make more than one trip on the following days, May 1, Memorial Day, July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years.</p>
   <p>5. The workers shall be required to give the bosses one week's notice if they intend to quit the job. Likewise the bosses shall be required to give the workers a weeks notice before dismissing anyone.</p>
   <p>6. An adjustment committee, consisting of two representative from each group (employers and union) plus an impartial chairman, shall be organized for the purpose of ironing out all disputes that may eventually arise over questions which are, at the present time, overlooked in the agreement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The bosses are beginning to hold meetings frequently. Judging, however, from opinions prevailing among them, it is practically certain that upon receiving the demands [of the workers] tomorrow or the next day, they will immediately sign the agreement and thereby simply avoid unnecessary trouble.</p>
