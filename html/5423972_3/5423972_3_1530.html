   <p>Mr. Victor Berger, the socialist leader in Milwaukee who is being tried for seditious propaganda against our participation in the war, has been on the witness stand for several days, being quizzed by the District Attorney.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berger stated on the stand, that he bought many Liberty Bonds and contributed much money to the Red Cross. He explained that the socialists of Germany, France and Italy were against the war before war was declared. Mr. Berger also spoke of his meeting Dictator Lenin twice at two international congresses.</p>
   <p>He never did agree with Lenin in his political policies and surely is not with him politically now. "I am not a Bolshevik", he declared.</p>
