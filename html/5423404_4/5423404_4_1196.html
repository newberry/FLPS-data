   <p>As soon as some prominent persons arrive in America from Sweden, and let it be known on their arrival in New York, that they bring special, official greetings from "Mother Svea," they are always honored by their countrymen here.</p>
   <p>The Swedish National Society has now invited the Swedish Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency Herman Lagerevantz, to the Swedish Midsummer festival at Elliott's Park. He is also going to be honored with a banquet at the Auditorium here, in Chicago. We greet His Excellency, and we bid him welcome to us. We respect him because he mingles with the common people.</p>
