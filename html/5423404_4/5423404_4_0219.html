   <p>Whenever the labor market is undergoing a crisis, as at the present time, proposals for the establishment of free employment agencies are sure to be put forth, and it is rightfully claimed that such agencies could be of great service, not only in actually providing jobs, but also as a source of information in the study of the unemployment problem. So far, these proposals have not progressed beyond the discussion stage, and when the crisis has passed interest in them wanes. The fact is that free employment agencies are just as much needed in good as in bad times.</p>
   <p>Most of the employment agencies which are being patronized by job seekers are private business undertakings, operated for the benefit of the owners, <span class="page-break">2</span>and they obtain their profits by charging fees as high as the trade will stand. Many of them even employ actually crooked methods. It is, for instance, not unusual for them to have an understanding with foremen in the places of employment to which they send their clients. They will split the fee with these foremen, who, quite naturally, make it their business to see that the labor turnover in their departments is as great as possible. The newly hired employee is, therefore, fired on the slightest pretext, making room for a new applicant with another fee to be split. In many cases the agency will make a job appear much more attractive than it really is, and it even frequently happens that when the client has paid the fee, often with his last money, and arrives at the supposed place of employment to apply for the job he finds that it has already been filled by somebody else. The agency then tells him to wait for another opening, and, likely as not, sends him out on a wild-goose chase several times. When he finally gets tired and demands his money back he is lucky if he gets it.</p>
   <p>Even though all private employment agencies do not belong to the class <span class="page-break">3</span>described above, few job seekers can afford to pay the fee which is charged, regardless of how reasonable it may be. Chances are that the client needs it for food. As a rule, when a worker is discharged from a job he first tries to find another one through his own efforts, and only after they have failed does he seek the aid of an employment agency. By that time his monetary reserves are pretty well exhausted, and even if he manages to pay the fee, he is likely to need the money so badly to buy food that he has to ask for a refund before the hoped for job materializes, and his chance of getting a job through the agency is gone.</p>
   <p>Senator Wagner, of New York, has introduced three bills in the Senate, proposing measures for the alleviation of unemployment during the present crisis, and prevention of similar situations in the future. The senator proposes, among other things, the establishment of a federal system of free employment agencies, and William Green, president of the American Federation <span class="page-break">4</span>of Labor, supported the plan when he recently testified before the Senate Commerce Commission. On that occasion he also stated that unemployment among the Federation's members was greater last winter than it has ever been in the past.</p>
   <p>Certain signs indicate that the present crisis in the labor market will be a long one, and there is no telling when conditions will return to what we are accustomed to consider normal. It is, therefore, highly desirable that free employment bureaus be established throughout the country. They will be a great aid to those who are seeking employment, and bring renewed hope to millions of people.</p>
