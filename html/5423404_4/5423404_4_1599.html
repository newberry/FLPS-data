   <p>The "national origin" principle in immigration legislation has been generally condemned in all quarters, even by those who take only an academic interest in the problem. All impartial persons who have studied the intricate question of immigration agree that it is impractical and inconvenient to use national origin figures as a basis for quota computations.</p>
   <p>In the issue of March 13, the Nation makes fun of those who advocate this procedure because they are so anxious to maintain in our population the same nationality proportions that prevailed in colonial times. As our readers already know, quota allocations, according to the national origin principle, will be determined on the basis of the census of 1790. The Nation declares that at that time immigration into this country had barely started, and that the nature of America's population has undergone a great change during the <span class="page-break">2</span>last 140 years. Furthermore, the 1790 census was incomplete and unreliable. But with their usual inability to grasp the realities of life, these advocates of limited and selective immigration are acting as if the census of 1790 represent a divine standard by which the population in this country is always to be measured, and according to which America is to grow in the future.</p>
   <p>The periodical goes on to say that Congressman Albert Johnson, chairman of the Immigration Committee, and his followers have gone too far in their effort to preserve America for the descendants of those that came over on the "Mayflower". For not only are Great Britain and, to a small extent, the Netherlands favored by the new regulations, but even Bolshevik Russia and countries where Bolshevik tendencies may be suspected, such as Lithuania, Greece, and Portugal, are seeing their quotas increased considerably.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the quotas of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, where the Nordic race has been preserved in its purest form have been drastically reduced. The Nation asks if this is not a mistake, and adds sarcastically, "For a long <span class="page-break">3</span>time the immigrants from Northern Europe have been hailed as forming the backbone of our nation. Are these highly valued Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes now going to be thrown aside to make room for Lithuanians and long-bearded, half-wild newcomers from Soviet Russia?"</p>
