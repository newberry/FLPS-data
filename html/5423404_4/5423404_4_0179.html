   <p>As reported on another page in this issue, plans are under way for the building of a central Swedish clubhouse in New York City, and it looks as if these plans will materialize in the near future. The total cost of the projected building is estimated at four hundred thousand dollars. It should not be too difficult to raise this sum, for when the building is completed it is certain to yield a considerable income in rent. The venture is a sound one from a business point of view.</p>
   <p>It is a laudable undertaking, and speaks well for our countrymen in the eastern metropolis.</p>
   <p>They are setting an example which might well be followed in other Swedish centers in America, particularly in Chicago. The need for such a Swedish building here has been evident for a long time. The old Svenska Tribunen took up the idea as far back as 1890, advocating "the erection of a building where we Swedes can gather on important occasions without having to impose on the hospitality of other nationalities, who have had sufficient foresight and initiative to secure suitable buildings of their own." Many years have passed since the Tribunen took up this cause. Great changes have taken place, and Chicago's Swedes have been forging ahead. There are now many fine Swedish clubhouses in various parts of the city, but what we still lack is a central Swedish building in the Loop, Chicago's business center.</p>
   <p>The need for such a building is becoming increasingly evident. Our standards are higher now than ever before, and the need now is for a club building after the pattern of, for example, the Hamilton Club, with first-class restaurant service, large and small dining rooms, committee rooms, a gymnasium, a swimming pool, baths, locker rooms, etc. There should also be a great auditorium, big enough to accommodate large crowds at mass meetings, conventions, music festivals, moving picture shows, dramatic performances, and banquets. The upper floors might offer hotel facilities for residents and out-of-town club members.</p>
   <p>Is not this an attractive idea, and would not such a Swedish building reflect credit on every Swede in the city? The answer is yes; and some such plan as outlined here therefore merits serious consideration. There are many financially responsible Swedes in city, and it should be easy to interest them in such a project. If, in addition, our numerous societies and clubs should lend their co-operation, there is no good reason why plans and talk should not be transformed into action in the immediate future.</p>
