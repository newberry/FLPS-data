   <p>The St.Ansgarius 'Swedish) Church at Sedgwick St. arranged a Martin Luther program in the Church last Tuesday. The rector, the Rev. J. Hedman, read a copy of a letter written by the young student Martin Luther "To his sick mother." Otto Pallin sang the "Paulus" from the orator by Mendelsohn and "O,Salutaris" from Rossini's "Messe Solemne." Miss Martha Johnson sang "Angels Serenado" by Braga. The program concluded with the singing by the whole congregation of Martin Luther's well-known hymn, "A Mighty Fortress is our God."</p>
   <p>About 250 persons attended the concert and the pastor deserves all credit for an unusually well arranged program.</p>
