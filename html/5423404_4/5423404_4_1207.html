   <p>A new local of the Independent Order of Vikings was organized last week at the Ashland Hall, corner of Ashland and Addison. The new lodge, taking the name Yngue, Started out with fifty-two charter members.</p>
   <p>Officers elected were C. Osterberg, chief; Gottfried Johnson, vice chief; Mr. Steffenberg, recording secretary; Ernst Lindskog, financial secretary; John Peterson, treasurer.</p>
   <p>Following the business meeting, all were seated at the tables laden with good, old-fashioned Swedish viands. While refreshments were being served, the Orphens Quartet entertained with several well-executed Swedish songs, comedian Ernst Eckberg brought on side aches from laughter, and Otto Nelson offered several comedy songs. The entertainment throughout was excellent, and is a sample of the future enjoyment in store for the members of the new Viking local.</p>
