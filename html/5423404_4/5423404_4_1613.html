   <p>Complaints have been frequent concerning current practices on Ellis Island, where arriving immigrants are examined and where it is decided whether or not they are to be permitted to enter this country. It is admitted that these complaints are justified in many cases, and Secretary of Labor Davis has just submitted a plan according to which Ellis Island would be abolished as a clearing house for immigrants. He recommends that the selection be made in their own homeland by American officials stationed there for that purpose. Such procedure would save much trouble, and, if it were adopted, immigrants would not have to fear that they might be refused admission after they had reached these shores.</p>
   <p>The plan seems sensible and practical, and might well find many supporters in Congress. But it is doubtful whether the proposal will be adopted, for it is certain to meet opposition in many foreign countries. One European <span class="page-break">2</span>power has already lodged a protest against any possible procedure of this kind.</p>
   <p>An American immigration station cannot be established in a foreign country without the permission of the government of that country, and since some governments may be expected to refuse such permission, it is not likely that Secretary Davis' plan will materialize.</p>
