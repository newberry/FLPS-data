   <p>The outing on Sunday, August 26, to the Old Peoples Home in Park Ridge, was one of the best of its kind ever arranged by the Swedish National League of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The pure air of this outlying spot is well worth the trouble and expense of taking the trip, and Sunday was made to order for the outing. The grounds around the Home were beautifully decorated with a profusion of American and Swedish flags and garlands. The open house visit gave the guests an idea of the faultless management and care practiced by the supervising staff of the Chicago-owned and managed Old Peoples Home.</p>
   <p>Sandwiches, coffee and lemonade were generously served to the four hundred Chicago Swedes making the trip for their own enjoyment and the joy of the sixteen present inmates. Five times the Orion Quartette let their beautiful <span class="page-break">\2</span>harmony ring out to please young and old. Dr. O. E. Wald was the speaker of the day.</p>
   <p>Throughout the day a wonderful joy shone from the eyes of the old people, and although they did not have much to say, when a young person shook hands with them, an unusual thrill passed from old hand to young and back again; there was a heart-to-heart current traveling both ways.</p>
