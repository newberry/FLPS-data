   <p>The life in America, which is changing in many respects for the immigrant, also has a powerful influence on the inner man. The Swede, who, do doubt, is very sensitive to new impulses and impressions, very easily yields to what we term the American spirit, whereby we mean the spiritual atmosphere in which we are living. With this we understand that he is willing to submit to existing customs and that he is living the American life as it appears here. In other words, he learns to look at things and their existence from the American point of view. He is morally and physically changed from Swedish to American, but it does not occur without a fight. It depends upon his education. The more educated he is in the old country the harder it is for him to leave the peculiar Swedish life and to appear in a new national outfit.</p>
   <p>We will now choose from the large crowd one example we can call typical - a young worker, who has been out one or two years in the public schools, where he received sufficient learning to understand how helpless he was in his own country, and whose first year in America was the most remarkable year in his entire life. It was then he floated between two worlds, uncertain as to which of them he should choose, if he ought to go back to the Swedish or stick to the American side, still so strange, cold, and uninviting. He felt himself lost to his native country, and was disappointed in his new place. The people seemed to be so cold and calculating. He had thought that life would continue like a dance on the new earth and that is would be very easy to secure a job.</p>
   <p>Instead he had to seek opportunities to secure a job for a long time. Then he really felt deceived in his dream about life in the New World. When in this mood and in this situation he looked at the rushing stream of life, he shivered and yearned wholeheartedly for that calm little cottage in his native country, where parents, sisters, and brothers were still living. It felt so peculiar in his soul. Should he lose his Swedish qualities and thus everything human?</p>
   
   <p>It appeared so to him in his first fight between that inner Swedish and the outward American life. But he is winning this fight. The second year comes with continued fight. He is not yet reconcilled with his fate. A new victory follows; he begins to distinguish some of the American high-spots, he also, begins to feel that the conditions for success here depend upon the grade of zeal, with which he makes himself acquainted with the conditions here. He understands now, that he must submit himself to the institutions of the new country, not they to him and to his taste.</p>
   <p>The third year brings the conviction that America is yet the best country on earth for the one, who has to work. He has now learned to speak good English and through this has been more closely affiliated with people in general. He has found out at the same time and to his surprise that thest strange people are better than he at first thought.</p>
   
   <p>The fourth year develops a new consciousness in him. He begins to feel that he is a part of the great mass and that he has ambition here, an ambition higher than the worker or the professional man - a political and moral ambition.</p>
   <p>He becomes a citizen in the fifth year (if he has taken out his "first paper".) He becomes an American anyhow with or without the citizenship certificate, because a psychological change has occured. The Swedish characteristics in name disappeared in favor of a more cosmopolitical manner of thought, and the remembrance of the old home, which in the beginning overshadowed the light sides of his present life has been forced into the background, where it is preserved as pictures are in an art gallery, beautiful and dear, but also a bit cold, except in those moments, when a letter from the old country recalls them to life. In short; he is now wed to the new earth and every year fastens him by a new thought or emotion to the great Republic, which he has learned to love as his country. And yet, he is still Swedish in the depths of his soul. He has not changed spiritually. It is superfinally that his spirit has been modified to suit the outward conditions in that country where he is active. Meet him a half century after his arrival and you will find him still a Swede at the bottom, although not on the surface. His political views, his general conception of the world, and his manners are all American or republican if you please; but his prejudices and his likes, his inner man, his whole temper, are, and will stay, Swedish. What is peculiarly great of the Swede stays forever with the Swedish-American, and what is small with the former also follows the latter through his whole life. The Swedish qualities appear more clearly under the American sun. This might arouse the question: How can he be thoroughly Americanized when he still is so Swedish? Because the process of americanizing him dosen't change a man into an entirely different human. The best in the Swedish nature has a very good basis in the American life and the worst in his nature is maintained by the world situation. To be Americanized is hardly anything more that to heartily endorse the republican form of government and then obey it honestly.</p>
   <p>What we have said so far in regard to the Swedish-American and the influence the American life has had on his spiritual expansion concernes only that individual who is so placed that he daily come into contact with people of all types in society and in business. It is different with him, who settled further or in the primeval forest far way from the great highways. Many such remains almost entirely untouched with the American spirit, while some come under its influence but slightly. Such a Swedish colony or colonist located on the furthest border line or American civilization is a very interesting psychological study.</p>
   <p>What the observer notices first it that this monotonous pioneer life puts its stamp on the religious element of the Swede. Separation from the outer world turns his senses inward. The first visible effect of it is homesickness. He knows how fruitless it is to think of seeing the beloved ones he left on the shore of the ocean. How can he then be reconciled with himself and his fate? He dosen't know, but he seeks his consolation in the hope of meeting them sooner or later in another home, the eternal one. When he separated from everything to which his heart has fastened, realizes how pershible everything earthly is, He seeks the eternal with so much more ferver. That is one of the reasons for the erection of so many Swedish churches and prayer houses, which have sprung up during the last thirty years in the American west.</p>
   
   <p>The Swedish-American has an unusually deep, half glad, half melancholy of feeling at this time of the year when the Christmas and New Year holidays are being celebrated. Memories of his old country over take him, so to speak, and his heart bleeds, because he misses that little world and the beloved ones over there. How willingly he stretches the wings of the spirit towards the beloved land in the North, but how deceived he feels when, year after year he discovers that Christmas in this country is not what it was at home and that he is losing more and more that Christmas spirit during the first two or three years in America!</p>
   <p>Has he then lost anything of himself? He believes that and feels sorry for himself. Yet he is the same person in reality. That which he thought was lost has only sunk deeper into his soul and will spring from there as the flowers from the earth when spring arrives.</p>
