   <p>The Washington Park Hospital Bazaar was running to a close; Saturday was to be its last day. As we believe in the old saying, better late than never, we went to the home of Dr. Young where the bazaar was being held, although it was already Saturday evening. It must be admitted at once that all the arrangements had been made with great taste and practical sense; all honor is due to the ladies who had charge of decoration. Admiration for the work done in preparation for the bazaar was general and the enjoyment resulting was equally general. First, from the point of view of decorative beauty, we put the Japanese department. It contained a great deal of trifles, offered to the public by "Geisha" girls, working with hands, feet, and heads to induce the people to buy. And the fun succeeded excellently, quite brilliantly, in fact..... In the Swedish <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Room, Mrs. Myhrman conducted the sale, vivacious and pleasant as always. Here the auction went on as if lives were at stake; corsets followed photography frames; shirts followed flowerpots; tablecloths followed guitars, and so on, endlessly it seemed. The auctioner was both warm and, at times, hoarse but not hesitant. Sales were made in quick succession. Fifty cents! Do I hear seventy-five? Bang! Miss Pearson is the lucky one! And on it goes.</p>
   <p>But what is this, do I hear music also? Quite true, in the gallery for the pictures of unknown masters, our well-known musicians the Hausch trio arranged their instruments. They played beautifully. Their numbers included "The Bohemian Girl," "Allard's Second Symphony," and some popular <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Swedish compositions. What splendid technique, interpretation, classic clarity. A wonderful trio, Mrs. Hausch and her two daughters. There was also other music and entertainment. The bazaar brought a net income of about $1,000.</p>
