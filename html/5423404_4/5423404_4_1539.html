   <p>The highest military honor obtainable in the nation, the Congressional Medal, has been awarded to forty-one American soldiers, three whom were Chicagoans. Two of them were of Scandinavian descent, namely; Sergeant Johannes Anderson, of 4854 West Ferdinand Street, and a soldier, Berger Loman, of 1838 North Spaulding Avenue, a native of Bergen, Norway.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Anderson, who is a member of Company B in the 131st Infantry Regiment, took up the fight alone against an enemy machine-gun nest, and seized the machine-gun, together with twenty-three prisoners. Loman, a member of Company H., in the same regiment, alone captured an enemy machine-gun nest, turned the machine-gun against the foe and forced its flight.</p>
