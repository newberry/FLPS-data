   <p>"Naturalization" is the term denoting the process by which the foreign born become citizens, and as such they have the same legal standing, responsibilities, and privileges as native Americans. The process requires that the person renounce all foreign allegiance and swear loyalty to the United States. The Constitution grants a naturalized individual the same privileges as are enjoyed by a native-born American with this exception: He cannot become President or VicePresident of the United States.</p>
   <p>Naturalization is one of the two methods by which the foreign born may become citizens of this country; the other is through the naturalization of the parents if effected during the minority of the children.</p>
   <p>The process is subject to certain laws: First, one must declare one's intention to become a citizen and thus obtain the "first paper". Second, after having resided in the country for at least five years, one must file a petition with the clerk of the nearest naturalization court for the "final paper". Third, a hearing before a naturalization judge.</p>
   <p>The entire process is quite simple in this country. But it is important that one proceed according to regulations and that all papers be filled out correctly. Many declarations of intention have been nullified as the result of a variety of errors on the part of the applicant. This also happens in regard to the final paper. Many applicants have been refused citizenship because they have not fulfilled the requirements in regard to residence in this country, or because of incompetent witnesses, etc.</p>
   <p>As many of our readers know, the Foreign Language Information Service in New York City has for many years been issuing a practical and dependable guide for those who are planning to become American citizens. The title of the pamphlet is How to become An American Citizen, and a new edition is just off the press. It is a revised edition, made necessary by the extensive changes in the naturalization laws which were made during the last session of the Congress, and which became effective July 1 of this year.</p>
   <p>The pamphlet explains in detail the three steps in the naturalization process, how his family is effected when a man becomes naturalized, the citizenship status of women, the special regulations covering soldiers, sailors, and those who entered the country without being duly registered, and other items of interest to prospective citizens. The last pages of this pamphlet contain about one hundred questions with the correct answers, which the applicant will find very helpful when he appears before the naturalization examiner for the final hearing.</p>
   <p>The price of the pamphlet is twenty-five cents, and it may be obtained from the Foreign Language Information Service, 222 Fourth Avenue, New York City. Payment may be made in cash, by money order or in stamps. It is also for sale in the offices of this newspaper.</p>
