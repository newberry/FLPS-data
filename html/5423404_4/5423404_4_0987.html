   <p>The Society of the Visigoths of Chicago hereby appeals to the Swedes in America for contribution toward a fund for the erection of a worthy memorial for Dr.John Alfred Enander at the Oak Hill cemetery.</p>
   <p>For more than five years now, the doctor has been resting in his grave but only an insignificant stone marks the place. Yet the work of Dr. Enander was of such scope, his exertions for the preservations of Swedish traditions among the scattered Swedes in the New World so important that it well deserves a real national memorial to be erected upon his grave. But if this is to be accomplished then must all the Swedish men, and women too who appreciate what Dr. Enander did for Swedish language, Swedish literature, Swedish history and Swedish culture in America join forces for the promotion of this altogether worthy undertaking.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Dr. Enander's work is of all the greater significance because it occurred at a time when slack cosmopolitanism was gaining force, and the Swedes were about to lose their consciousness of being Swedes.</p>
   <p>Dr. Enander was great as poet, as orator, as author, and as editor, but more than all of this, he was great as a friend of the country of fathers. Never did he permit his fellow Swedes to forget that the fact of being a Swede is the noblest of gifts, the richest heritage of all, and that he who neglects this fact is not merely hard hearted; he is foolish.</p>
   <p>Dr. Enander's contemporaries in America had left Sweden during one of the most depressive times there as concerns the national consciousness. No Swedish pride or consciousness as Swedes did they take with them from the country they left, for there was nothing of the kind to be found, at the time.</p>
   <p>The fact that he could call to life these half dead emotions in many thousands of the sons and daughters of Sweden now dwelling in America - that is the great <span class="page-break">3</span>achievement of Dr. Enander. He reunited into a people the scattered groups of Swedes in America.</p>
   <p>The life work of such a man deserves a national monument. United action to honor the great leader for Swedish unity in America will win its goal.</p>
