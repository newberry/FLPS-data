   <p>Last Sunday, sixteen lodges of the Order of Svithiod held a picnic together at Columbia Park. The day was warm and the sky clear, and nearly two thousand people were present. Speeches were made by Editor F. A. Lindstrand, Attorney Edwin Olson, and Mr. Axel Ahlstedt. The speeches by Messrs. Lindstrand and Ahlstedt seemed to appeal most strongly to the people; both had a message for the attentive listeners.</p>
   <p>After the speeches there was singing by the "Frithiof," the "Svea," and the "Chicago Sextett" choruses, appearing in quick succession. The "Frithiof" chorus was directed by Mr. Ernest Lindblom, the "Svea" chorus by Mr. E. G. Berggreen. All three choruses gave of their best, and their renditions were received with great applause. The music was furnished by the Svithiod military band.</p>
   <p>The picnic was a success from every point of view, and the committee on arrangements deserves high praise for its achievement.</p>
