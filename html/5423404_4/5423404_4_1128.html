   <p>p.7....An attempt is at present on foot in New York to try to realize the long cherished idea of consolidating the different Swedish National Leagues throughout the country into one Swedish National League of America.</p>
   <p>From New York the following was to be found in a Swedish-American paper:</p>
   <p>The Swedish Central Association had a meeting Friday at Teutonia Assembly Rooms. This meeting, which was scheduled for December, was delayed a week on account of the holidays.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Central Association committee consisting of : Dr. J. Hoving, Chas. K. Johanson, John W. Lind, J.H. Johanson, and Harold Nordquist, made a survey as to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>possibilities of creating a Swedish-American League. The result of the study was to the effect that the different Swedish Societies be written to, to ascertain whether such a movement would find any support. The committee itself thought such a League highly desirable.</p>
   <p>If the recommendation of the committee is accepted, a meeting will be held to decide as to whether to go on with the idea. The committee further recommended that Rules and By-laws be worked out at once, so that these could be presented at this meeting.</p>
   <p>The committee's recommendations were accepted.</p>
