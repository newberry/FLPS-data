   <p>We informed our readers some time ago that some Swedish-Americans in Chicago, hailing from the well-known city of Grenna, on the shores of Vittern, have formed a society for the purpose of sending home some contribution at Christmas time to aid the needy ones in Grenna. The Ladies' committee which undertook the collection of gifts, during the brief period elapsed since the formation of the society, have gathered nearly one hundred crowns, which amount has been sent to Grenna. This, however, is merely a beginning. For Christmas gifts a year hence far better result is expected. But the beginning is good, and all honor is due to those who remember the old people at home, especially those who are unable to provide for themselves.</p>
