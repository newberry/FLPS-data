   <p>The well-known builder and real-estate broker, Victor E. Carlson, has erected many large buildings in Evanston, and now has another building under construction at 608-12 Church Street. It will be a seven-story commercial building costing approximately $760,000. The foundation is made strong enough so that, if it should later be found desirable, five or six stories may be added. It will be especially well suited for medical and law offices.</p>
