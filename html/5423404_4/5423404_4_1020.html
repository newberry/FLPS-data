   <p>Fellow Swedes, do not fail to register! The registration of voters takes place next Tuesday, March 22nd from 8 A. M. until 9 P. M., at the regular polling places. Do not forget that only those who have been registered have a right to vote. This right should be exercised by each and everyone who is an American Citizen. If all men unite at the election, April, 5th, there is a great possibility of curbing the Irish power in Chicago politics.</p>
