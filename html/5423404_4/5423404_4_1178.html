   <p>During the hard times for the past year, the people in Pullman have been hard pressed, and for the purpose of helping them, there was organized last February the Southside Swedish Women's Club. Many poor homes have been helped by this organization under the leadership of Mrs. Enoch Anderson.</p>
   <p>In order to become better acquainted, the club is holding a musical program September 30 at the Palmer Assembly hall on 111th Street. The Norden Singers' Club will entertain with songs. A splendid speaker will also be there. The public is cordially invited. There is no admission fee.</p>
