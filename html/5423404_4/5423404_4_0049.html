   <p>The Swedish-American Hospital Association has now been completely organized. The board of trustees consists of eleven members, representing nearly all the Swedish churches and societies on the South Side. The objective of the Association is, as most Swedes know, to build a first-class Swedish hospital at the south-east corner of Green and Sixtieth Streets. The undertaking will raise funds through the sale of stock, and the shares are being taken up rapidly. The board of directors believe that part of the buildings or, perhaps the whole hospital may be made ready for acceptance of patients this fall. The medical staff has not been selected yet, but it will consist of the very best among doctors, not merely of Swedish nationality, but from other nationalities as well. The hospital will be a genuine Swedish institution, under Swedish control, exclusively. The general agent for the Association is Attorney O. C. Peterson, Room 1025 Unity Building, Chicago, and he will gladly supply any pertinent information concerning the hospital.</p>
