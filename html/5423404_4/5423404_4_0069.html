   <p>Ten per cent of the membership of the Swedish Lutheran churches in the city were present at the mass meeting at Farwell Hall last evening held for the beneift of Augustana Hospital.</p>
   <p>For the last eight years there has been a frame structure at Lincoln and Cleveland Avenues which has afforded accomadations for eighteen patients. This was the Swedish Hospital. At length its needs outgrew the tenement. Possessing ground 180x250 feet it was decided by the management to build, if possible a handsome six story building 62x180 feet in dimensions which would afford accomodation for one-hundred patients. The matter was discussed on the churches, and that discussion resulted in the mass-meeting which was held last evening.</p>
