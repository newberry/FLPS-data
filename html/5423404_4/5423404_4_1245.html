   <p>The Swedish Old Settlers' Society of Chicago gave a party last Sunday at the Swedish Businessmen's Club, 171 Washington Street, for one of the city's oldest Swedes, Captain John G. Carlson.</p>
   <p>Captain Carlson, who arrived here in 1852, was with the fire department from 1856 to 1902. At the time of the great fire, he was captain of Company 4, which was then stationed at North Avenue and Larrabee Street, and had occasion to show what stuff he was made of. Mr. Carlson is fond of recalling the early days of Chicago, and can narrate many interesting stories.</p>
