   <p>The Scandinavian Harmony Festival Association was chosen as a name for the new society organized a week ago in Chicago. It was accomplished at the initiative of the Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian Consuls. The aim of the society will be to sponsor three festivals each year, to establish a stronger friendship between the sons and daughters of the three countries in Chicago. The society will have as a program the study of literature, and noted men in literature. Its work will leave a mark of distinction for the society. At the large festivals each year the producers of Scandinavia's most noted masters of drama and literature will preside, also the artists and orators of the United States and the three Nordic countries.</p>
   <p>The first festival will be held May 26, 27, and 28, in Orchestra Hall. A guaranteed fund of $2,600 has already been subscribed. The proceeds from these festivals will be equally divided among the three nationalities.</p>
   <p>Consul John R. Lindgren is president, and County Commissioner C. R. Chindblom is Secretary. The directors number ten persons and will be increased to fifteen.</p>
