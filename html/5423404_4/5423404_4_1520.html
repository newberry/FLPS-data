   <p>The Sunday School of St.Ansgarius Episcopal Church will arrange a Christmas festival in its newly decorated church at Sedgwick St. and Chicago Ave. on Tuesday, January 6th at 7:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>These Christmas festivals in St. Ansgarius for the children are always very well liked both by young and old, but this time the committee in charge has promised a well arranged musical program. The bishop will address the congregation; good songs and music will be presented, and the children will enjoy the sight of a tall nicely decorated Christmas tree.</p>
