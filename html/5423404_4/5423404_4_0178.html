   <p>The Ring Lodge No.8 of the Order of Svithiod is now the proud owner of a new home at 3730 North Clark Street. It has been baptized the North Side Auditorium, and an auditorium building it verily is, much more so than a club house or a lodge hall. The new building no doubt will prove popular in the future for Swedish doings of all sorts.</p>
   <p>The formal dedication of Ring's new home will take place tomorrow, October 14, but the festivities in connection with the opening will continue nightly for eight more days, or up to and including the 22nd.</p>
   <p>There will be a carnival and all sorts of entertainment during this opening week, so the public will have every opportunity to acquaint itself with the newness of this "home".</p>
