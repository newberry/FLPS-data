   <p>The big gathering feast for all the Swedes in Chicago was held at Elliott's Park last Sunday, and was well attended, in spite of the rain, by some ten thousand persons. Miss Jennie Johnson, 4851 Kenwood Avenue, was crowned the "Midsummer bride." It can be said that the well arranged feast was very much appreciated by those present, and very successful also.</p>
