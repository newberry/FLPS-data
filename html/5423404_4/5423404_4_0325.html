   <p>The Swedish-American Women's Club, well known for its excellent and tireless work for the promotion of good undertakings, will hold a bazaar at Bush Temple of Music on November 9,10,11 for the purpose of raising means for emergency assistance of needy men and women among the Swedes. People of the better class ought to consider it their duty to support this bazaar in a most vigorous manner. Winter is at hand, and many a poor person will be suffering from hunger and cold, unless people able to help, mercifully come to assistance in hours of sorrow and suffering.</p>
