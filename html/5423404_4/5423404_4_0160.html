   <p>The Swedish Old People's Home, located in Park Ridge, is intended to serve old people who have no means and are residents of Chicago.</p>
   <p>A call has gone out to our many countrymen asking for their most liberal support towards this worthy institution. It is to be hoped that the response will justify the hope of the many Swedish lodges and clubs that have made this house possible so far.</p>
