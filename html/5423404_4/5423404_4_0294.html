   <p>On another page of this issue a correspondent presents a touching plea in behalf of the striking workers in Sweden, urging that financial aid be dispatched to them immediately. Due to a lockout and a consequent general strike, which under the circumstances could not be avoided, these unfortunate people have been prevented from earning their daily bread.</p>
   <p>We heartily endorse this plea, and it should appeal strongly to all Swedish-Americans if the old saying that blood is thicker than water still holds true.</p>
   <p>In order to win in this struggle the workers need cash, for they cannot, like their employers, draw on the immense resources of the banks. Their resistance is bound to break unless help is forthcoming from workers of other countries; and it is only natural that they look hopefully across the ocean to their countrymen in America, many of whom undoubtedly have relatives among the strikers, who with their wives and children may now be threatened by hunger. This is a situation that calls for co-operation, solidarity, and mercy, for there is bound to be much suffering in the many poor homes if foreign aid does not arrive. All of us should act quickly and give something. Even a small amount of American money, may be converted into a considerable sum in Swedish currency.</p>
   <p>Contributions may be addressed to Mr. Herman Lindquist, The National Secretariat, Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
