   <p>The Swedish Societies' Old Peoples Home Association held its regular annual meeting at Hotel Sherman last week. Of special interest was the report made by the Treasurer, Mr. John P. Friedlund, that the Association's "Endowment Fund" is rapidly approaching the $100,000 mark, which is the goal set in order to enable the Home to utilize the money for its intended purpose. The fund has exceeded $90,000, which means an increase of about $20,000 during 1925.</p>
   <p>The election of officers for the fiscal year of 1926 resulted as follows: Former Alderman Albert D. Anderson, president; C.A. Carlson, vice president; Herman Olson, secretary; Eric Hanson, financial secretary, and John P. Friedlund, treasurer.</p>
   <p>It was decided the Home's annual summer outing will take place on Sunday, July 18.</p>
