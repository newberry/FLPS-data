   <p>A change in the constitution for the Central Association was adopted at a meeting November 1. The most important point was the proposal of the committee to change the name to Swedish Old People's Home Association. It was further decided that every Swedish organization which contributes at least $25 annually to the Home is entitled to three representatives in the Association, and up to five for larger contributions. It was also decided that all countrymen are entitled to membership if they contribute at least $5 annually, or $50 which will give them membership for life. Another decision was that the association's regular meetings will be held once in every quarter of the year, and that a Board of Directors, consisting of fifteen persons is to be chosen to take care of the Home. Several donations to the home were received with thanks.</p>
