   <p>St.Ausgarius Swedish Episcopal Church, Sedgwick St.,Chicago, was founded in 1849 and is under the jurisdiction of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America. The parish is the oldest Swedish congregation in America. Many solemn church festivals have been celebrated this past Easter in the church.</p>
   <p>The Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago, the Rt. Rev. Wm. E. McLaren, D.D. visited the parish on Palm Sunday and confirmed seventy-four candidates; they received their fist Holy Communion on Easter Day. An enormous crowd of worshippers attended the High Mass. The altar and the sanctuary was adorned with flowers and palms. The congregation celebrated at the same time its 45th anniversary as an organized parish; the Rev. Herman Lindskog began his eighth year as pastor of St. Ausgarius. The Communion Easter Day was the largest which has ever been held in St.Ausgarius so far. The altar rail was filled thirteen times, which means that over three hundred communicants received the Sacrament of the Altar.</p>
