   <p>Our countrymen on the Northwest Side, especially those living near California, North or Armitage avenues, have been thoroughly aroused to the danger to women and girls in this community. The last woman attacked by hoodlums, was Mrs. O. V. Anderson, who had just left a streetcar at California and Cortland (a block south of Armitage Avenue); a few steps from her home she was knocked unconscious and dragged to a vacant building where she was brutally attacked. She did not regain consciousness until after she was found and carried home.</p>
   <p>Citizens of the district mentioned are thoroughly aroused and have organized a community vigilance committee that is pledged to be on the lookout for future activities of such morons who have gratified their criminal and immoral lust so often.</p>
