   <p>The cornerstone of the Swedish Baptist Old Peoples' Home in Morgan Park was laid on Wednesday, May 2, 1906; the impressive ceremony being conducted by Reverend G.A. Hagstrom. The solemnity of the occasion was enhanced by the attendance and participation by many pastors from Chicago and vicinity. The speaker of the day was Reverend J.W. Hjertstrom.</p>
   <p>The original building, for which the above mentioned cornerstone was laid, will cost eighteen thousand dollars; the building to be three stories, with many accommodations. The plans provide for additional buildings next fall that will make it possible to accommodate a number of orphans as well.</p>
