   <p>At a meeting of representative Swedes, held at the University Club last Monday, the John Ericson League was organized. The purpose of the organization is to co-operate with the United States Government in the war, to act as a clearing house for the patriotic activities of the Swedish-American societies, and to create a better understanding between the United States and Sweden. The following gentlemen were elected to office: Judge Harry Olson, president; Harry A. Lund, vice-president; Henry S. Henschen, treasurer of the State Bank of Chicago, treasurer; Edward Bjorkman, director of the Scandinavian Bureau Committee on Public Information, secretary.</p>
   <p>A number of meetings were held before the organization of the League. Among the men who have supported the idea are Charles S. Peterson, president of the Swedish Club; Gustaf Andreen, president of Augustana College; J. E. Chellberg, J. G. Bergquist, Andrew Lanquist, Mrs. Othelia Myhrman, president of the Swedish Womens Club; Eric Norton, Victor Olander, secretary of the Illinois Federation of Labor.
