   <p>The Swedish-American Woman's Club held its annual meeting at 3823 N.Clark St. on Feb. 9. Leonis H. Fordham, a learned lady from Switzerland, was present and gave a most interesting lecture. A resume of the activity of the club during its twenty-two years existence gave evidence of splendid works of service to needy Swedes. Thus, for example, the Club has furnished a ward in the hospital in Bowmanville; a room in the home for the aged in Evanston; a room in the Washington Park hospital; a room in the Baptists' Home in Morgan Park; also, have given liberal amounts to the Swedish hospital for consumptives, in Colorado; and besides contributed many thousand dollars for the relief of needy Swedes. Few clubs would be able to point to more splendid and unselfish activity. Officers for the coming year were elected, and a committee was appointed to arrange for a banquet for all those who at one time or another have been members of the club.</p>
