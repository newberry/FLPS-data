   <p>Captain A. L. Lofstrom, one of our best known Swedes, who has conducted his unique business Dalkullan, at 113 Oak Street, for many years, has moved to 1729 No. Clark Street.</p>
   <p>While at the old location he became famous for his stock of books, music, smokers supplies, and Swedish souvenirs. In his new quarters, he has a much larger stock: imported music, instruments, souvenirs, and antiques from the Scandinavian countries, especially Sweden. Here is found the largest selection of antique Swedish books, music, etc; in the United States or any other country, except Sweden. The Captain's ideal is to keep a full stock of things most appreciated by his countrymen. We advise all who are interested in any of the lines mentioned to drop in and enjoy themselves.</p>
