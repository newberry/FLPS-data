   <p>Last Saturday and Sunday the congregation of the Getsemane Swedish Lutheran Church observed the fiftieth anniversary of the church. On Saturday night, the church choir, assisted by a number of well-known soloists, gave a fine concert in the church. The church is located at Huron and May streets. On Sunday morning, Dr. M. C. Ranseen, president of the Illinois Conference, delivered a jubilee message. The pastor of the church, W. E. Pearson, assisted by Reverend C. O. Bengtson, officiated at high mass.</p>
   <p>In honor of the golden anniversary, a history of the congregation and its activities has been published.</p>
   <p>The founder was pastor P. Ericson, who was followed by A. G. Skeppstedt. The <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>latter served for two years and then resigned because of failing health, and returned to Sweden. Dr. M. C. Ranseen was pastor from 1879 to 1910.</p>
   <p>During the last few years the Getsemane congregation has experienced the same kind of trouble that has beset other congregations in that district; namely, a serious loss of membership. This loss was due to the fact that so many Swedish families have moved to new homes in other parts of the city. Plans for moving the church further west are now under consideration.</p>
   <p>The pamphlet published in honor of the anniversary contains pictures of the veterans of the congregation, and of its young men who served in the world war. It also contains greetings from former pastors.</p>
