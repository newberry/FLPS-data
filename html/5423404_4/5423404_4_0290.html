   <p>So far the strike aid committee of Chicago has received $1,040.53 which has been forwarded to the president of the national committee, Herman Lindquist. The campaign for funds is going on with undiminished vigor, and the public is responding generously. Several organizations are collecting funds within their own ranks, independently of the committee. Local No. 181 of the Carpenters' Union, through its financial secretary, J. Jensen, has thus remitted $150 to this newspaper, and this sum was forwarded to the Swedish representative in New York. Many organizations are sending money directly to Sweden.</p>
