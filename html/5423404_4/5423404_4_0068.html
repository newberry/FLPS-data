   <p>A Swedish mass meeting was held last Wednesday, March 30th, at the Farwell Hall under the auspices of the Augusta Hospital Association of the Augusta Synod. The purpose of the meeting was to make the Swedish element of Chicago better acquainted with the Hospital's activities and to discuss plans for the building of a new and larger hospital to better serve the needs of our people. The attendance at this meeting exceeded all expectations and the enthusiasm displayed was great. Subscription lists were circulated and considerable sums of money were pledged. Speakers were the Reverends Carl A. Evald, M.C. Ranseen, L.A. Johnston, L.G.Abrahamson, Erland Carlson, O. Olson, Carl A. Swensson and C.P. Rycholm.</p>
   <p>The plans are to substitute the old two-story hospital building with a new structure of six stories in height and with accommodations for at least 100 patients.</p>
