   <p>The Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Trinity Church of Lake View was dedicated last Sunday, June 20th. The church is one of the most prominent Swedish churches in America.</p>
   <p>Trinity congregation was organized in February, 1883 in Lake View, Chicago. Services were first held in the congregation's parsonage until 1887, when they were continued in the basement of the church which was then built as a first step before the completion of the real temple which occurred in April of this year. The church property is valued at $30,000. There are seats for nine hundred persons. The exterior as well as the interior of the church can well be compared with any other large church in America. When the Rev. L.A.Sandahl took over the congregation in 1886 there were only thirty six communicants. There are now over eight hundred and the membership is steadily increasing.</p>

   <p>The dedication service was very solemn and the church was packed to the doors with worshippers, clergy and laity both from the city and others living far away attended. Addresses were made both in English and in Swedish by Professor C.E.Lindberg from Rock Island and Rev. M. Frykman, who, as the President of the Illinois Conference of the Swedish Lutheran Synod, delivered the dedication address and dedicated the Church. He was assisted by several of the clergy, who read suitable verses from the Holy Scriptures. Rev. L.A.Sandahl preached the sermon and gave a history of the church, its erection and its finances.</p>
   <p>A solemn sacred concert filled the church again in the evening.</p>
