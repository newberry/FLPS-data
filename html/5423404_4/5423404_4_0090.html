   <p>Plans for this annual festival or picnic are already being discussed. A concrete start was made last Monday at the meeting of the Board of Directors in the Svithiod Singing Club, 624 Wrightwood Ave. Election of functionaries was held, as follows: Dr. O.C. Nylund, executive chairman; Eric Lundgren, secretary; Nils J. Lindskoog, ticket holder, and Erik G. Westman, publicity director.</p>
   <p>As has been the policy at the previous festivals of the Home, an automobile will be given away free to the one that holds the lucky number and, in addition, there will be innumerable other prizes.</p>
