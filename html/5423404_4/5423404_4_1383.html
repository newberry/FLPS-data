   <p>The Salem Lutheran congregation will observe the sixty-fifty anniversary of its founding with special services next Sunday afternoon and evening. Dr. Conrad Bergendoff will be among the speakers. He was the congregations pastor for several years before he took over his present post as dean of the Angustana Theological Seminary. Oscar A. Benson, present pastor, will be in charge of the program.</p>
   <p>The Salem congregation is the oldest Swedish congregation on the South Side, and began its activities in a small building on Bushnell Street near Wentworth Avenue. Later on a church was erected at 28th Street and Princeton Avenue. This building was used until about ten years ago, when it was sold, and the present church was built at 74th Street and Calumet Avenue.</p>
