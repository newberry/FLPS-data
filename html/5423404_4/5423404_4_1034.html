   <p>The activities of the Swedish Republican Naturalization Club have increased tremendously. About two hundred Swedes took out their citizen papers last Thursday before Judge Hawes, and five hundred Swedes received their papers last Tuesday from Judge Tuthill. It took a dozen clerks until midnight to write out the papers.</p>
   <p>The officers of the club deserve all honor for their unselfish and patriotic work.</p>
