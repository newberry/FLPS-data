   <p>The Linnea Aid Society of the Englewood Hospital was organized Friday, February 16, by the ladies representing the Bethel Lutheral Church, the Swedish Baptist Church on 59th Street, the Mission Church, and the Bethlehem Lutheran Church. There were fifty-six charter members at this meeting.</p>
   <p>Meetings are to be held on the second Monday each month.</p>
   <p>Judging by the enthusiasm displayed by those attending the organization meeting, one can look forward to much good being done, which, under ordinary conditions, the patients would find it impossible to obtain efficient and proper medical treatment.</p>
