   <p>The Bethany Home of the Swedish M. E. Church will be dedicated today in Ravenswood. The building is situated on North Paulina Street, South of Webster Avenue.</p>
   <p>The home is in the hands of the Bethany Home Assn., under the auspices of the Swedish Methodist Episcopal Church. The object of the institution is not only to provide a permanent home for aged people, but also to give temporary shelter to any sick and needy persons who come to them for aid, and those who are discharged from hospitals before they are strong enough to work; and for overworked persons needing rest. Another object of the society is to provide an asylum for orphan or destitute children, for whom Christian homes will be found where they may be adopted.</p>
