   <p>During the two services in the Swedish Lutheran Ebenezer Church last Sunday, collections taken up for the benefit of the starving and sick people of central and southeastern Europe amounted to $650. The collection at the morning service came to $523, and this will be forwarded through the National Lutheran Council; while the vesper collection reached $127, which sum will be handed over to Countess Wilamovitz, who addressed the congregation.</p>
   <p>A collection for the same cause was also taken up on the preceding Sunday, and $90 was taken in. This congregation has thus, during the last two weeks, given $740 to the people of Europe who are living in misery. It certainly is a fine showing, and probably a record as far as Swedish congregations in Chicago are concerned.</p>
