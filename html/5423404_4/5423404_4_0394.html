   <p>A few weeks ago, T. M. Swanson opened a so-called "Concert Hall" at 226 Milwaukee Avenue. It did not take the Police long to find out what really was going on there.</p>
   <p>C. Williams and O. E. Little, agents for the Illinois Humane Society, arrested Swanson, on the charge of permitting girls under fourteen years to frequent his saloon.</p>
   <p>Swanson had a stage erected in the back of his Tap room, where these girls, none of them over twelve years, would dance and sing. Later, they had to mingle with the patrons, to drink and dance with the men.</p>
   <p>Most of the customers were pimps, prostitutes, and crooks of every description.</p>
   <p>Such dens are to be found all over the city. It is high time that these "Joints" be closed. The Humane Society is doing its part, but the Police, as usual, are very lax.</p>
