   <p>The Board of Directors for the Swedish Home for the Aged decided at a meeting held in October last year at the La Salle Hotel, Chicago, to engage a finance agent for the purpose of collecting funds for the maintenance of the Home and for its endowment fund. Mr. Albert Swanson, well-known among the Swedes in Chicago, was appointed finance agent for the Home. He started his work October 15 last year, and has since that time increased the fund to $3,900. The largest part of this amount comes from eighty-six persons who pay $50 life time dues. The trustees for the endowment fund are: A. Lanquist, Edward C. Westman, and John S. Widell.</p>
