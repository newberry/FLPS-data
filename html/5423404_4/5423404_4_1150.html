   <p>Carl von Linne, called the "Flower King," will be honored by Chicago's Swedish population on Saturday, May 24, when the Svithiod Singing Club will gather around his statue in Lincoln Park and greet the arrival of springtime. This club will be assisted by other singing clubs in Chicago. The celebration of the memory of Linne at his statue, and the arrival of spring as a forerunner to summer has been a national feast in miniature among the Swedes during the later years here in Chicago.</p>
