   <p>The Swedish Baptists in America celebrated this week their Fiftieth Jubilee with an elaborate church festival at the American Baptist Church on Michigan Avenue. The festival was attended by many delegates representing Swedish Baptist congregations not only from this country, but from Sweden, Norway, and Finland. Many speeches were made concerning the denominational work here in America. A solemn church service concluded the jubilee. The Swedish Baptist denomination in America was founded by Reverend Gustaf Palmquist of Rock Island, Ill. on Sept. 13, 1852. There are now 16 conferences, 318 congregations, 293 ministers, 245 churches and 21,767 members.</p>
