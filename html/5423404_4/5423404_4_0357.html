   <p>The largest Swedish Church in Chicago, Immanuel Church on Sedgwick St., was packed to the doors last Sunday by a devoted crowd.</p>
   <p>The pastor of the church, the Rev. Carl A. Evald, spoke of the three cities in Sweden, Sundsvall, Umea and Lilla Edet, which recently had been greatly damaged by fire, and the need among the inhabitants there.</p>
   <p>The pastor asked the vast congregation to show mercy and to give freely to the needy. Hardly an eye was dry. The offering for this worthy purpose amounted to $423.26. All honor to both congregation and pastor.</p>
