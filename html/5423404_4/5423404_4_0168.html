   <p>Dr. William Henshen delivered an address. He spoke of the nobility of the work and thanked the founder of the home, John R. Lindgren of Evanston, for his gift of $10,000.00 for the work. Dr. Henshen explained that the home is to be non-sectarian. After Dr. Henshen's address, Miss Edith Mountain rendered the soprano solo "Calvary" and Dr. F.M. Bristol made a short talk. After Dr. Bristol's address, the congregation adjourned to the foundation of the home, where the corner-stone was laid by the Rev. Alfred Anderson. The ceremonies were concluded with a prayer by Prof. Albert Ericson.</p>
   <p>The new Bethany Home will, when completed, have accomodation for fifty-six aged people. The structure will cost $25,000.00. The intention is to ultimately add to its wings to be used as an orphan assylum and hospital, respectively.</p>
