   <p>The Swede's Day was celebrated on July 20th in combination with the Song Festival in Chicago, which was held on July 18th in Central Music Hall.</p>
   <p>Madam Caroline Ostberg, Prima Donna and C.F.Lundquist, tenor barytone, both from The Royal Swedish Opera, Stockholm, and basso Conrad Behrens appeared on the program together with a chorus consisting of the Swedish Glee Club, the Swithiod Singing Society, and Lyran Singing Society.</p>
   <p>The sun was clear and warm on Thursday morning, the Swede's Day, when five hundred singers from the American Union of Swedish Singers were gathered together in Chicago. Thousands of people jammed the streets either to participate in the parade or to get a position on the sidewalk from which to view the procession better.</p>
   <p>The Swedish societies in Chicago had gathered together as one man and put all their strength into presenting something unusual, something never seen in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>city. The streets were filled by members of different Swedish organizations dressed in their various uniforms. The following served as marshalls for the parade: Robert Lindblom, L.F.Hussander, Sven Windrow, C.F.Corsell, and N.N. Cronholm. About 12,000 Swedes participated in the parade, which started from the Lake Front, and ended at the Fair, where the Grand Concert was held. Several addresses were made and the following telegram was sent to the Swedish King:</p>
   <p>"His Majesty King Oscar II, Stockholm, Sweden. - Fifty thousand Swedes celebrating the Swedish Day in Jackson Park, send their heartiest greetings." Fireworks ended the perfect day.</p>
   <p>Another concert was held on Friday at the Fair and the last one on Saturday afternoon. A banquet was arranged for the singers on Sunday at Brand's Hall. The singers also sang in Lincoln Park at the Linne' Monument, and at "Bellman-festival."</p>
   <p>Both The Swede's Day and The Grand Swedish Singing Festival was very well arranged and turned out to be a great success which will never be forgotten.</p>
