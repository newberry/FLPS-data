   <p>It was just two hundred years ago last Thursday that the most prominent Swede, the Flower King Carl von Linne, was born in Smoland, Sweden. The memory of this great man is not only celebrated in Sweden but also in America, especially among the Swedes of Chicago. Over one thousand persons gathered last Thursday night around the Linne statue in Lincoln Park to see the Swedish Singing Society pay homage to the Flower King. A wreath was placed on the statue.</p>
