   <p>A thoroughly successful bazaar was held by the Orphei Sangarklub (Orpheus Male Chorus) on Thursday, April 5, at the Claremont Hall, 1630 North Clark Street.</p>
   <p>The unexpectedly large audience was more than pleasing, as was the storm of applause given the participants, and the generous purchases made of valuable articles put on sale by the chorus. The raffling off of a piano, several excellent pieces of furniture, and sets of dishes was such a financial success that the committee handling this branch of the program could hardly believe what they saw in the way of income.</p>
   <p>Entertainment was efficiently furnished by the Iduna military group, Viking Orkester (Viking Orchestra), Orpheus, Harmoni, and Svithiod Male Choruses, Orion-Sextet, Joel Mossberg, Werner Melinders, and others.</p>
