   <p>The season's first Swedish Concert to be given as a benefit for the Swedish Old People's Home, in Evanston, will be held in Orchestra Hall, Oct. 17th. Our well-known Opera singer, Marie Sundelins, will sing soprano numbers, Her pianist will be Edna Gunnar Peterson, and Professor Frederick Frederickson, with Organist-Director, Edgar Nelson. This will be a gala night for the Swedish Music minded public. No Swedish music concert of importance can be held successfully, without our great Basso singer, Gustaf Holmquist.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Old People's Home has rendered a much needed service to its old people, and it is to be hoped that the concert will have an overflow attendance. Our countrymen, John E. Rrikson, and Gordon Berg, will be co-chairmen of a flying squadron for publicity. </p>
