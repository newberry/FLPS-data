   <p>"As will appear from the records of the Committee, which will be forwarded to you as soon as they are printed, it has been possible to prevent much intense suffering, thanks to the sizeable contributions of which such a large share has been collected among our compatriots on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
   
   <p>"The Committee begs to request that you convey to the contributors to your Committee our heartfelt thanks for their great assistance during this trying year. The Committee also desires to thank you for your splendid and valuable collaboration in this greatly needed task.</p>
