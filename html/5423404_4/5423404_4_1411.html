   <p>The Swedish Lutheran Bethesda Congregation was hard hit in 1920 when its church was completely destroyed by fire. Plans were immediately made for the building of a new house of worship, and last Sunday these plans neared completion as the cornerstone for the new church was laid. The ceremony took place in the presence of several hundred people. Dr. Peter Peterson, president of the Illinois Conference, officiated.</p>
   <p>The new building is attractively and conveniently located at 105th Street and Avenue J. The pastor of the congregation is Carl H. Rask.</p>
