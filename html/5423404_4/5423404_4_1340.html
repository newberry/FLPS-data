   <p>The society Thor celebrated the Christmas season with a barn party at Phoenix Hall last Saturday evening. About five hundred people were present ....The program was varied and interesting. Perhaps the outstanding feature was Professor Clarence Ongman's lecture on Sweden, illustrated by motion pictures. After the program coffee and cookies were served to all those present, and then began the dancing around the decorated Christmas tree.</p>
   <p>The many children present were each given a box of candy....</p>
