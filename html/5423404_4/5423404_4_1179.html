   <p>On Tuesday, June 2, the Swedish National Society held its monthly meeting at which time a report of the first five months of the year was rendered. During this period, the report showed that seven hundred fifty-five, six hundred thirty-two women, totaling 1387 persons had secured employment thru the free employment service. At the same time, the society has spent $1,073.05 for the poor, sick, and unemployed.</p>
   <p>Two old ladies have been placed in homes, three sick persons have been given help to return to their homeland; two young children, whose father <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was in the poorhouse, and whose mother was too ill to support them, have been sent to a home in Nebraska; a woman, with five children, whose husband is in prison, has been given money to return to Sweden, where a sister has offered them a home; one hundred fifty-five families, who needed help either on account of illness, or unemployment, have been given food, coal or house rent.</p>
   <p>A committee from the society is preparing for a midsummerfest on June 21. It promises to be one of the biggest events of the season. There, the Chicago Swedes, in real Swedish fashion, will celebrate midsummer; there they will meet friends and acquaintances and refresh the memories of their childhood days.</p>
