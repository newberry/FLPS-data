   <p>If you are an artist and have talents, beware! The greater your artistic ability, the greater must be your caution. For - the latest edict, - issued by our wise police Solons, is to the effect that paintings, which in some way or other depict United States notes of currency, henceforth will be regarded as means for degrading and endangering our social and moral life.</p>
   <p>Just the other day, a picture of that type, belonging to a Mrs. Stevenson, Indiana Avenue, was confiscated by the police. The artist of the "dangerous" picture is a young Swede by the name of Carl Linden, who undoubtedly had done a good job, inasmuch as Police Captain Potter, the confiscating officer, at first thought that the bill had been pasted onto the picture.</p>
   <p>Vigilance as effective as this on the part of our police does make one feel secure, indeed! What difference does it make if one gets robbed or knocked over the head, or gets one's throat cut, which are daily and hourly occurrences in our beloved Chicago, so long as the police are determined to guard us against evil pictures of imitations of demoniacal greenbacks? Hurrah for our police!</p>
