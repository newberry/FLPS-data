   <p>While we Swedish Americans are singing our songs of complaint and our songs of praise--the former with reference to conditions in our homeland, the latter with reference to the great possibilities of our new home--and while we are still moving about in a state of jubilation over the conditions of liberty and equality which exist in this republic, Anglo-American papers will speak occasionally of conditions in the United States, in terms which do not at all harmonize with the praise given by the masses.</p>
   <p>We reproduce below, without comment, an article from the paper The Pocohinta Sun:</p>
   <p>"Honored Immigrants: You do not realize what you are losing, you who do not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>want to become a citizen of our great and beautiful country. No country in all the world can compare with the United States....Here we have Bibles and fortresses, guns and churches, millionaires and beggars, theologians and thieves....Christians and criminals, schools and prisons, corporations and bums.</p>
   <p>"This is a country where we make....canned meat from diseased cows and old mules, and corpses of the people who eat the stuff. Here we put people into prison if they are poor, and sentence them to prison labor if they cannot find work. We have four hundred men in Congress to make laws and nine men in the Supreme Court to declare the laws unconstitutional....Here we make men wicked by liquor, and liquor by wicked men. Here newspaper men are bought....and ministers and professors are paid....to do similar service as those newspaper men. The expounders of Christianity are paid from $1,000 to $25,000 annually to tickle the vanity of the rich and to teach the workers to vote for men subservient to the money powers and otherwise to be godly <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and content (i.e., satisfied when robbed of the fruit of their labor). Business, here, means to get hold of money by whatever means.....</p>
   <p>"Here we pay $5,000 out of the people's money to bury a congressman and $10 to put a workingman underground....Here the government pays a pension of $5,000 to the widow of an officer but a mere $144 to the soldier who was in the midst of the battle. Here we smile disparagingly at the virtuous and call the honest man eccentric....Here we worship gold. Here we pay fifty dollars for a puppy and fifteen cents in wages for the sewing of a dozen shirts by some poor woman who has no other way of obtaining bread for herself and her child.</p>
   <p>"Here we teach the Indian the way to Heaven through the so-called Indian Mission, and afterwards we kill him with a poison called whiskey. Here we imprison a man if he steals a loaf of bread when he is hungry, but if he steals a bank or a railroad, we elect him to Congress. Here justice is dozing while crime plays about; here graft is flowing over into the social system, and the Devil gets his toll at every street corner."</p>
