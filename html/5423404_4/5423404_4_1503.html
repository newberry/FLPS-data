   <p>The General Conference of the Swedish Baptist Church, which has been in session the last three days at the First Church, corner of Milton Avenue and Elm Street, concluded its labors yesterday. The reports indicate that the church is in a flourishing condition, and that the increase in membership has been very large. Almost the entire morning session yesterday was occupied in discussing the question of building an academy for the education of theological students preparatory to sending them to the Swedish department of the Chicago University. After a protracte discussion it was decided to give up the idea of building for the present. It was then decided to consolidate with some American school, Morgan Park Academy, being preferred.</p>
   <p>The choir appointed a committee to consult with the officials of several schools in regard to consolidating with them, and to ascertain what terms could be made. The afternoon session was given up to speechmaking, and to discussing the study of Greek by the theological students.</p>
