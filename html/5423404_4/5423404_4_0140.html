A few years ago he graduated from the University of Minnesota, and later took an examination for lawyer; he also practiced in Minneapolis until about five years ago when he came to Chicago. Here he has taken a lively interest in various Swedish societies, of which he is a member, and as delegate to the Old People's Home Society, he has been particularly active. When the previous chairman, Mr. Henry Schreil resigned, it was natural that the vice chairman take his place, and Mr. Norton's personality and crafty business ingenuity assures the society of a practical business administration.</p>
