   <p>It is as regrettable as it is true that during recent years foreign groups in this country have made generous contributions to worthy national causes and undertakings without receiving any recognition whatsoever for the services they have rendered. When such occasions are under discussion, it is so easy to talk of what America has done, and to forget that this nation is made up of many national groups, all of which have done their share.</p>
   <p>This situation is exemplified in the case of the Liberty Loan drives, and in several other "drives" initiated by various national organizations during the last few years. The total amount of money collected has been published, but the people in charge have entirely forgotten to mention the contributions of individual language or national groups. This is rather discouraging, particularly so when one considers that no time is lost in checking up on crime and <span class="page-break">\2</span>other undesirable activities of individuals within these same groups.</p>
   <p>A few years ago it was recommended from certain quarters that the most merciless publicity be given to such individual misconduct, and this was actually done in many cases. It is readily seen how this procedure tended to place the entire group in the public spotlight, and to reflect unfavorably on every member of it. The worst of it is that this happened in cases where the accused were entirely innocent.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, when the group as a whole or individuals within it have made valuable contributions of one kind or another to our society, the favorable publicity to which they were logically entitled was withheld. In other words, the destructive tendencies within the national group have been emphasized, while its constructive contributions have been ignored.</p>
   <p>The patriotic American spirit, which has so often been displayed by the great mass of foreign-born Americans, has been overshadowed by the publicity given to <span class="page-break">\3</span>the comparatively few undesirables among them. This is a deplorable injustice, and is the main reason why they have been so misunderstood by native Americans.</p>
   <p>Next November, the annual roll call of the American Red Cross will take place, when old memberships are renewed, and new members sign up. This annual campaign enables that great organization to go on with its humanitarian work, not only within our own borders but also in the European countries which were ravaged by the World War.</p>
   <p>In previous years the amounts donated by the foreign-born population have not been made known to the general public. But this year the Red Cross intends to keep an accurate account of, and to publish, the contributions made by our foreign groups, who will then receive the recognition which is due them. And the various organizations within each group will also receive credit for Red Cross membership fees and individual donations which they turn in.</p>
   <p>During this campaign the Red Cross does not want money to be deducted from <span class="page-break">\4</span>workers' paychecks, because this procedure tends to give employers credit for donations made by their employees. This great humanitarian organization is asking for the support of free men and women, who, of their own free will, give whatever they feel they can afford, be it as individuals or as members of organizations and groups.</p>
   <p>In most communities where Swedes have made their homes in any considerable number, central committees have been formed, that will be in charge of the Red Cross roll call work among their countrymen. We urge all congregations and societies to co-operate with these committees during the campaign, so that results may be obtained that will compare well with the accomplishments of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Those interested in forming central committees in localities where none as yet exist should write to: Swedish Section, American Red Cross, Bureau of Foreign Language Information Service, 1107 Broadway, New York City.</p>
