   <p>Rev. Elof K. Jonson of the Swedish Evangelical Luthern Ebenezer on Foster Avenue is making an appeal through the Swedish press of Chicago of Mercy fund.</p>
   <p>Thus far, the Colony of Mercy project is only a picturesque 400-acre farm land at Bartlett, Ill., about 25 miles west of Chicago, not far from Elgin.</p>
   <p>The beautiful and worthy idea, however, as conceived and sponsored by Rev. Jonson, embodies the erection of one or several buildings to receive such Swedish men and women, who have had so many discouraging episodes in their lives that mentally and physically they have become wrecked and with little or no hope of recovery and restitution.</p>

   <p>The Colony is to be non-denominational, according to Rev. Jonson, and to be governed by a Board of Trustees to be elected from roster of experienced and trustworthy Swedish men and women. </p>
