   <p>At the beginning of the meeting which saw the founding of the Chicago branch of the Society for the Preservation of Swedish Culture in America, A. G. Witting, prominent engineer, addressed the audience, which later requested that his address be placed on record in the archives of the organization, and also that copies of it be distributed among Swedish-American newspapers, So that their readers might have the opportunity to read Mr. Witting's inspiring words. Complying with this request, we herewith present the speech:</p>
   <p>[Address by A. G. Witting]</p>
   <p>Ladies and Gentlemen: We have answered the call and gathered here, happy that this step has at last been taken. Before such an audience as this, it is, I think, rather superfluous to argue the desirability of, and the justification for, preserving the fundamentals of our Swedish culture here in our adopted country. This cause is close to our hearts, and we consider it a precious duty to protect and revere this heritage which has been left us by our fathers. And we must especially protect and revere the language, which has told us all that is most dear to us, and which makes us feel that we have all sprung from, receive nourishment from, and are still growing from the same root.</p>
   <p>But our first duty to this organization which we are about to from is to go out among our friends and acquaintances and persuade them to join us. When we do this, we shall meet doubters who must be won over, and we shall encounter arguments which must be intelligently answered. It may not, therefore, be out of place to consider at this time the foundations on which our efforts are to be based.</p>
   <p>First of all, we must expect doubts as to whether the preservation of Swedish culture in this country is really a proper object to pursue. So much is being said about one-hundred-per-cent Americanism and the breaking of all the ties that bind us with the land of our fathers that it might be taken as a sign of disloyalty on our part even to remember the fact that we were born, and that many of our closest relatives still live, under a flag other than the Stars and Stripes. But it is an utter misconception to presume that all other countries are inferior to America, not only in a material sense but also morally and culturally. In the case of certain countries, there may be some justification for such an assumption, but it certainly is not true of Sweden. And even if it were, this fact would not alter the situation in which we find ourselves, for it is psychologically impossible to transform a native of a foreign country into a one-hundred-per-cent American. A leopard cannot change his spots; they can only be removed by skinning the animal. And what would be left of it then? It is equally impossible for an immigrant to remove the influence of his foreign birth. If he should try to force himself to get rid of this influence, he would have to close up all the inner recesses of his mind and subject himself to spiritual starvation. Even then, he would not succeed, and in the attempt, he would become a poor American Citizen.</p>
   <p>This is fully understood by intelligent native Americans, as the following statement by no less a person than President Harding indicates: "A person of foreign birth who is not concerned about the welfare of his father and mother, his brothers and sisters, who does not revere the time-honored traditions and precious memories of his people, and who is indifferent to the fate of the people from which he sprang; would make poor material for an American citizen. America does not demand or desire such sacrifices." Therefore, any Swede who would "create" Americanism by suppressing the Swedish spirit is a fool, and not a true representative of the country from which he came. For in the realm of good citizenship, the Swedes have more to teach other nations than to learn from them.</p>
   <p>The inherent conception of respect for law and duly appointed authority which we find in the Swede, his devotion to duty and responsibility, and his regard for personal liberty and the rights of the individual, are more in accord with the theoretical principles of the American system of government than with their practical execution. These qualities represent a valuable addition to the actual work which he performs in various fields of endeavor in return for the right to make his living here. We have, therefore, every reason to hold on to those qualities which characterize us as Swedes; we have every reason to be proud of our nationality; and we should make it our business to acquaint not only our own nationals but also the great mass of native Americans with this fact. To the extent to which we value and preserve the best of our specifically Swedish culture and characteristics, to that same extent do we become good American citizens.</p>
   <p>I do not, of course, advocate a one-sided and stubborn affinity for everything Swedish, and a consequent refusal to adjust oneself to American conditions. We are here to stay, and it behooves us to make ourselves feel at home. We must not become a pathological growth within the body of the great American society, but an integral component of that society, filled with affection for and loyalty to the new homeland. But this does not mean that we have to abandon our Swedish heritage and our devotion to the fatherland, any more than a man's love for and loyalty to his bride means that he must cease loving his mother. And may we never forget that Svea is our spiritual mother. [Translator's note: "Svea" is a poetic and patriotic term for Sweden.]</p>
   <p>It is thus necessary for us to become Americanized, but only by absorbing those attributes which will enrich our character and spiritual life, not those that will make us poorer. We must add to our worthy qualities, not subtract from them. The American melting pot should not permit the evaporation of anything that is genuine and valuable; the proper blending of all good ingredients and the isolation of the impurities should alone be permitted. And it is up to us to oppose the kind of Americanization which would require the elimination of all that is Swedish in us. If we do this, we will place ourselves on an equal footing with our fellow citizens, and will deserve and receive their respect.</p>
   <p>We cannot escape--and we do not want to escape--from our Swedish nature. It will follow us throughout life as faithfully as our shadow and our Swedish accent; we can never break our ties with Sweden. And if we want to earn the respect and good will of the native Americans and be accepted by them at our true value, we must teach them to appreciate Sweden and to accept Sweden at her true value. The first condition for success in this effort is that we ourselves preserve and revere the cultural heritage which our forefathers have amassed for us down through the centuries.</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>When we consider the extent of this heritage and how much we are permitted to call our own, we realize how much it is worth preserving. No other nation has so much of which to feel proud. It is not just an empty boast when we call Swedish the language of honor and of heroes, and Sweden the cradle of freedom. History corroborates us. Every nation has its proud memories, its national heroes, its great poets, and its great men of science. But in the final analysis, the true greatness of any nation is measured by what it has done for others, not by what it has done for itself. Measured by that standard, what country compares with Sweden? Our fatherland has never been the rich man who has arrogantly suffered others to eat the crumbs from his table, nor has it ever been the rich man who has generously shared his wealth with others. No. What Sweden has given to the world has been, rather, the widow's mite. She has not contributed gold and wealth, but she has sent forth her sons who have given their blood and their lives for the freedom and rights of other nations. The Swede has taken his stand in Europe like a lone fighter, one against ten; like a fort in the wilderness has he arrayed himself against brute power and oppression, a champion of spiritual freedom and individual rights. Yes, we have proud memories from a glorious past, when the name of Sweden was beloved and blessed by the oppressed, and feared by the oppressors. Why should we hide from the reflection of that honor?</p>
   <p>And in the firmament of civilization some of the most sparkling stars that have lighted the path of humanity bear Swedish names. Men of science, who have opened up new horizons; inventors, who have helped make life easier; great poets and artists; standard-bearers of material and spiritual welfare and progress--these comprise an unending procession of men and women whom we are proud to count among our countrymen.</p>
   <p>What more have we? We have our Swedish language, with its wealth of literature. And again we challenge any nation to present such poets as Tegner and Runeberg, Victor Rydberg and Snoilsky, Froding and Karlfeldt; such novelists as Selma Lagerlof and Heidenstam. But the poetical feelings of a people, its intimate attitude toward the universe, can be truly expressed only through that people's own language; even the best translation is only a piece of glass ' which attempts to imitate the genuine jewel. Those Swedes who thoughtlessly discard and forget one of the most melodious and, at the same time, most forceful languages in the world are throwing away a treasure, and are doing a disservice to their children.</p>
   <p>Then there is our Swedish song. Created by and from our national spirit itself, it expresses in verses, psalms, and hymns our innermost thoughts and highest ideals. Has it not time and again won first prize in competitions?</p>
   
   <p>Is it not victorious wherever it is heard throughout the world?  Should we let it be taken from us?</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>I have tried to point out not only the most evident reasons why it is proper and desirable for us to work for the preservation in this country of our Swedish cultural heritage, but that this is actually our duty, both as Swedes and as Americans. And, naturally enough, I have emphasized those things which are most apt to inspire in us love for and pride in the Old Country, the country where our ancestors lived and toiled; the things most likely to instill in us a burning desire to keep this heritage as a source of inspiration and spiritual refreshment for ourselves and our children.</p>
   <p>However, this is also the proper time to remind ourselves that we Swedes, too, have our share of shortcomings. In The Funeral of a Hero, written by Heidenstam, one of the foremost exponents of Swedish prose, some of the national traits which always have brought--and, unless we overcome them, always will bring--us to grief are grimly exposed. Among them are indifference to the common welfare, shortsighted arrogance toward strangers, and petty envy of successful fellow countrymen. To these there has recently been added another, which was unknown to our ancestors; namely, a tendency to become discouraged and give up in the face of what seems to be insurmountable obstacles--a fatalistic attitude which expresses itself in the words "What's the use?" on occasions when a more aggressive spirit would spell success. Let us be on guard lest such weaknesses overtake us. Let us go forward with courage and determination toward the goal which the organization we are forming here tonight has set for itself: Swedish unity!</p>
   <p>The heart of every Swedish-American has a chamber which he usually keeps safely locked. But it can be opened. There are four keys, as it were, which can open the lock; they are our Swedish-American press, our Swedish churches, our Swedish aid Societies, and our Swedish singing societies. Let our organization, the Society for the Preservation of Swedish Culture in America, be the ring which holds these four keys together.</p>
