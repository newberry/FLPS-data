   <p>The Swedish Clergymen of Chicago had a meeting and dinner last Monday at the Morrison Hotel. Pastor Elof K. Jonson of the Ebenezer Church spoke on his favorite subject, the Colony of Mercy, of which he is the originator and chief sponsor. He mentioned that he himself had secured more than 50 members to comprise a Founders club, the initiation fee of which is a donation of $1,000. He now appealed for support from his fellow colleagues, which was pledged forthwith. Three groups were devised, one north, west and south side sections of Chicago. One hundred and twenty-five "founders", or $125,000, was set as their immediate goal.</p>
