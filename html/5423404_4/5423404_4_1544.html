   <p>"For extraordinary heroism in action at Geneva, France, October 9, 1918. Lieutenant Carlson advanced 400 yards, leading his men after he had received a bullet in his shoulder. He held this position for more than an hour during a fierce bombardment by the enemy. Due to his courage in holding this position, he saved the flank of his battalion and made possible further advances. On October 27, this officer, at the river La Stille, was further wounded by an exploding projectile. When he was able to do so, he advanced with his battalion. Lieutenant Carlson became an officer at Fort Sheridan Training School for officers, and has been with the American Army in France for more than a year.</p>
