   <p>The Swedish Baptist Churches of America will celebrate their 75th Annual Jubilee in Chicago next week in conjunction with the regular annual meeting of the Chicago Swedish Baptist churches.</p>
   <p>Elaborate arrangements have been made for this jubilee. A joint chorus from all the local congregations will appear at the various sessions during the duration of the convention, August 23 to 28, inclusive. A "jubilee offer" of $350,000 for the mission and the churches' schools will be taken up. The initial or "grand meeting" will be held next Thursday evening in the Moody Memorial Church at North Avenue and Clark street.</p>
