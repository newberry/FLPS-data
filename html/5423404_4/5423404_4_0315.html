   <p>In other columns we publish details of the great San Francisco catastrophe. It is hard to realize that the world-known "Golden Gate" could possibly have been laid in ruins, practically in less time than it takes to tell.</p>
   <p>The scenes enacted in San Francisco during and after the earthquake can only be properly described by eyewitnesses. The worst should now be over, providing that the epidemics which usually follow do not develop.</p>
   <p>A world-wide movement to aid the victims of the disaster is coming through with gratifying contributions. Foreign donations, reaching the committee handling the relief, are very generous.</p>
   <p>Our Swedish colony has been called upon several times in the past, the Kansas City flood, and the Marquette, Kansas tornado, for example, and their response was hearty and liberal in each instance.</p>

   <p>We are confident that Swedes in Chicago and elsewhere who read our publication will respond to our appeal with generous donations to help the San Franciscans, thus showing our well-known Swedish goodheartedness and sympathy for our fellowmen.</p>
