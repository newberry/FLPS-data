   <p>"Customhouse Court," which for years has been a spot of shame to the city, and one of the most miserable, shabby "red-light" districts in the world, where lust and crime went hand in hand, has now ceased to exist.</p>
   <p>The street is still there and in broad daylight there has, to outward appearance, been no change, but when night comes one sees no dimly lighted windows, nor invitingly open doors, inviting the passer-by to enter the pesty, immoral holes. Neither can one hear the many noises identifying the demoralizing activities within.</p>
   <p>All owners of these low dives were notified to pack and disappear by midnight, May 1, 1906. The notice was fully complied with and this act was, in our opinion, a decided step toward elimination of immoral places and their inmates throughout Chicago.</p>
