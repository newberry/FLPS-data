The income of the society during the five year period was $8,130.16, and the total expenses $4,407.68.</p>
   <p>Miss Carrie Lind, president of the society, had charge of the anniversary. Mr. Joel Mossberg, accompanied by Miss Karin Lindskog, sang some of his highly prized songs. Mr. Robert Johnson rendered Gosta's lusty poem: "Nar man ar herre i sitt hus" (When man is master in his house) in a most effective manner. Editor F. A. Lindstrand was the orator of the evening, delivering a most interesting speech on "Sister love." In his speech, he emphasized the power of woman, and power of the heart. In times of illness and suffering, it is the language of woman's heart that carries effect.</p>
