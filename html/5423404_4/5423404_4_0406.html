   <p>The Chicago Crime Commission consists of a group of men charged with the task of remedying the crime situation in this city. Last week, they appealed to city authorities for support in this work, declaring that during the immediate future their chief effort would be directed toward reducing the number of murders in Chicago. And they submitted statistics which clearly show that such an effort is imperative. The figures certainly are impressive, and they do not lie.</p>
   <p>Since the beginning of this year, 177 murders have been committed in the city of Chicago. The monthly record is as follows: January, 25 murders; February, 26; March, 24; April, 33; May, 27; and June, 30.</p>
   <p>Of this number--almost one murder a day during the first six months of the year--41 are as yet unsolved. Since the beginning of the year, 127 persons have been charged with murder, but so far only 42 of these have been convicted. Two murderers have paid for their crimes with their lives.</p>
   <p>Considering these figures, one can readily understand why the Crime Commission desires the co-operation of the city authorities. But if the members believe that a whirlwind anti-crime campaign of the ordinary kind will solve the problem, they are badly mistaken. Such a campaign might have a temporary effect, and might reduce this flood of murders while the drive was going on. But lasting results can be obtained only through extensive and well-planned work. As is the case in so many other serious situations, it is necessary to get to the root of the evil.</p>
   <p>It has often been said that the war is the cause of the current increase in crime and the disregard for the law which is so evident all around us. Be that as it may, if we are to restore respect for law and order, that respect must first be implanted in the younger generation. And in that regard we have failed miserably. From their early childhood, the youngsters have been fed unwholesome literature and unwholesome picture shows, and this has been justified on the grounds that it is good for them to become familiar with the realities of life at an early age. It should be remembered that the impressionable boy may be tempted to play the role of the bandit instead of that of the hero.</p>
   <p>A good deal of the responsibility for the increase in crime may well be placed on our daily press. Quite often the criminal is made the subject of glorification, especially if the culprit is a young and attractive woman. And court proceedings are often represented as a theatrical farce.</p>
   <p>Neither do those who are charged with enforcing and administering the law always perform their duty. Long-drawn-out investigations, red tape, and "technicalities" are not conducive to a healthy respect for the law. When the law is broken, the guilty should be punished, regardless of whom it hits. Equality before the law is among the fundamental precepts of democracy, if not the first of them all. When that rule is followed, and when a true moral sense and the sacredness of human rights are deeply implanted in the race, then and only then shall we see a lasting decline in crime.</p>
