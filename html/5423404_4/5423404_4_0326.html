   <p>Last Saturday evening, Mr. and Mrs. Thelander Larson, 337 West 22nd Place were visited at their home by about two hundred friends and acquaintances, most of these belonging to the society, Enighet, of which Mr. Larson is a member. For the past four months Mr. Larson has been ill, and the surprise party had been arranged by two other members of the same society, William Anderson and O. Peterson, as a means of extending help to the Larson family..... A purse containing $147 was given Mr. Larson, who warmly thanked the friends for the gift.</p>
