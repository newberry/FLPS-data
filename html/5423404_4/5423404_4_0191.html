   <p>From time to time the question has come up why we Chicago Swedes do not procure our own building, a Swedish "People's House," such as they have in many cities in Sweden, which would serve as a central meeting place for the discussion of our own affairs. The money which we now spend for rent of halls could then be diverted to other purposes, and such a building would, of course, tie closer together the various Swedish societies in Chicago.</p>
   <p>These were the points stressed in the invitation issued by the Verdande Lodge for a massmeeting last Sunday in Jaeger's Hall, but, we are sorry to report, the public did not respond in such numbers as one would expect for this occasion, so important to Swedish interests.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>However, the meeting took place, and a number of worthy proposals were discussed. A Swedish Finlander and a newspaper man brought up the idea of a Scandinavian "People's House," and pointed out the many advantages of such a project, one of them being the great energy and enthusiasm displayed by our Scandinavian neighbors--the Norwegians, Danes, and Finlanders--for undertakings of this kind.</p>
   <p>Many speakers supported the proposition, and a ten-man committee was appointed and instructed to get in touch with the Scandinavian organizations, particularly on the North Side, requesting them to send delegates to another meeting, to be held in the near future, and where the question of a Scandinavian "People's House" will be discussed from all angles.</p>
   <p>The committee was instructed to study and make suggestions in regard to the <span class="page-break">3</span>financing of the project, location, building plans, and other details.</p>
   <p>When this preliminary survey is completed, a meeting is to be called of all the Scandinavian delegates. The latter should be authorized to speak for their respective organizations, so that definite decisions may be made. New proposals are, of course, gratefully received.</p>
   <p>Nearly everybody present at the meeting seemed to be inspired by the idea; only a few expressed their doubt as to the desirability and practicability of such an undertaking by Chicago's Scandinavians, and they did not succeed in discouraging the rest.</p>
   <p>For many decades now the Scandinavians have kept on coming to this great Western Hemisphere, tempted by enticing stories of dollars and gold, and more "milk and honey" than can be found in the countries of the north. When <span class="page-break">4</span>the young Swede, the young Finn, the young Dane, and the young Norwegian set their feet on American soil they usually lose track of the friends and acquaintances which they have acquired during the voyage across the ocean; they scatter to the north, south, east, and west, and our immigrant finds himself alone. In some cases he has relatives and friends to go to, but most newcomers are complete strangers. The Scandinavian immigrant then looks for an organization of his countrymen, where he may find sympathy and strike up new friendships. This is not always so easy, unacquainted as he is with the city and the language. In a centrally located Scandinavian "People's House" he has a good opportunity to attend the meetings of various types of organizations and to join those that appeal to him. A home of this kind here in Chicago would undoubtedly give the impulse for the establishment of similar institutions in other cities with a considerable Scandinavian population.</p>
   <p>In the same manner that the individual feels the need of associating with others of his kind, and just as this association is beneficial if properly <span class="page-break">5</span>chosen, so it would be a great boon to Scandinavian brotherhood and cooperation if this plan could become a reality, including at least the societies of the North and Northwest Side of the city; the South siders are probably too far removed from the center of the Scandinavian population to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
   <p>This is indeed a great cause, worthy of the most wise and energetic leadership that can be obtained.</p>
   <p>It is not out of order already at this point to begin to picture the interior of this future "People's House," the exterior we will leave to the contractors and architects. The layout must be carefully planned. There must be of course, a large auditorium, suitable for theatre and concert performances, with up-to-date stage facilities. Every effort should be made to make this auditorium spacious, dignified, and beautiful. This is desirable not only from the <span class="page-break">6</span>esthetic but also from the financial point of view, with an eye to profitable renting. It is particularly important that this auditorium be so planned that the greatest Swedish (also the greatest Scandinavian) organization in Chicago--The Swedish National League--will find it suitable for its needs. We all know what immense sums the league pays out in rent alone for its annual events, for instance in the Auditorium. In addition to this large room, several smaller ones, suitable for lodge and club meetings, should be provided for. There should also be a library and reading room, well stocked with selected literature and newspapers, as well as a lecture room and a gymnasium. A restaurant, smoking room, and a bowling alley should not be lacking.</p>
   <p>Up to now there has been little or no association and cooperation among the four Scandinavian brother nationalities in this city. The proposed "People's House" would be a strong instrument for unity, replacing dissention and jealousy with concord and friendliness.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>You, Scandinavian individuals and organizations, do not treat this cause with arrogant contempt, and do not take it for granted that this plan cannot be materialized just because it did not originate with you or your organization; and do not shake your head at the name "People's House."</p>
   <p>At this stage of advanced civilization and progressive enlightenment, those that already enjoy the advantages of education, culture, and wealth, should not make it their business to resist the intellectual progress of the masses; it is rather their privilege, for instance, by means of such a "People's House," to contribute generously to the knowledge and education of their less privileged fellow human beings, through lectures, discussions, and the like.</p>
   <p>Take the constructive, progressive attitude and remember that "many small creeks make the big river."</p>
