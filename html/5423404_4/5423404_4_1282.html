   <p>"The Vikings"has the reputation of being the most lively and industrious of Swedish societies. It is about to open a free Swedish Reading-room on Chicago Avenue, where Swedish newspapers from all parts of Sweden and in America together with other useful and up to date literature will be available for the visitors.</p>
   <p>But as it costs money to rent, arrange and maintain such an institution, the Swedish Theater Society will give a pageant at Criterion next Sunday, January 29, and "The Vikings" a concert at Turner Hall the following Sunday, February 5th. The net income from both these activities goes to the Reading-room Fund; and to make the foundation of this fund as large as possible our countrymen ought to attend both of these benefit affairs.</p>
