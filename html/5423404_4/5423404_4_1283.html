   <p>The executive or building committee of the Swedish Society Building Project held its scheduled meeting last Sunday, the 13th. At this meeting it was learned that more than one thousand shares of certificates have been sold. In other words, a sum exceeding $25,000 already have been subscribed. This is a very satisfactory result, indeed, and gives cause for great elation.</p>
   <p>The number of delegates from various societies, that have joined the cause, now numbers fifty-five. The very latest addition is five delegates from the newly organized Council of the Royal Arcanum. The next meeting will be held Sunday, March 27th, at which time all the subscription lists are to be presented to the secretary of the committee, Dr. Sven Windrow, for examination.</p>
