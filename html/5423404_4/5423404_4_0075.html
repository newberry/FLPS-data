   <p>This was a great day for the Swedes of Chicago, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>About two years ago the General Conference of the Swedish Church conceived the idea of building an orphan's home and industrial school for the benefit of orphan children of Swedish parents and decided Joliet as the place. The site is about two miles southeast of the city in a beautiful grove.</p>
   <p>Today the corner-stone of the edifice was formerly laid, the Rev. L. S. Abrahamson of Chicago performing the ceremony of placing the stone in position. There were a large number of people present. The building will be a magnificent structure, built of Joliet stone, 60 x 100 feet in dimensions. It will be three stories in height.</p>
