   <p>The Anglo-Saxon bloc in Congress is encountering stiff opposition in its efforts to change the Immigration Act of 1924 by adding the provision which will make the national origin percentage the basis of quota computations. This question has now been discussed for such a long time, and so thoroughly, that the general public has become aroused and is beginning to realize what is really at stake.</p>
   <p>The issue is this: Shall the immigration quota of the various foreign countries be computed on the basis of the number of immigrants who were here in 1890, or on the basis of the national origin of our present population? The former system has been in operation since 1924. But the latter will go into effect if Congress, which is to convene this month, does not repeal the National Origins provision or vote another postponement.</p>
   
   <p>It may be true, as pointed out by the advocates of this provision, that the 1890 immigration figures were chosen entirely accidentally as the basis of present quotas. But it so happens that there exist no reliable immigration statistics covering any period previous to that year. And it is a fact that it is not possible now to determine correctly the proportion in which foreign nations contributed to the ethnological make-up of the population of this country during the first one hundred years of our history. The first immigration records date from 1820, but not until 1850 were the foreign born classified by their national origin.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the determination of quotas based on the national origins of our present population can be nothing but guesswork, and if one may judge by the large increase in the quotas of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, it looks as though all those individuals whose origin is doubtful are credited to those two countries. Furthermore, it was in the beginning of the current century that the immense mass of immigrants began to arrive from the countries of Southern and Eastern Europe. The quotas of those countries have, therefore, increased considerably, and this is one consequence which the creators of the National Origins Clause neglected to take into consideration.</p>
   <p>Ever since the principle of selective immigration was adopted, the policy of giving preference to people from Northern and Western Europe has been followed. The British were favored, but any great influx of people from Southern and Eastern Europe was not desired. But the National Origins provision increases the Greek quota by 207 per cent, the Hungarian by 83, the Italian by 50, and that of Austria by 80 per cent.</p>
   <p>President Hoover is not in favor of this provision, and has promised to support those who are determined to work for its repeal during the coming session of Congress. If this action is successful, the present quota regulations will remain in operation. And if the powers that be will make the future of this country their chief concern, and act accordingly, we are confident that they will prefer the present quota system and repeal the National Origins provision of the Immigration Act.</p>
