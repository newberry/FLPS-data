   <p>Last Sunday was an unusual day for the Swedish Lutherans in Chicago, for on that day High Mass services were held. Bishop Scheele, from Sweden preached.</p>
   <p>Long before the services began, the huge hall was packed with worshippers. The complete High Mass was then celebrated. The preludium was given by Prof. Emil Larson.</p>
   <p>The collection totalled more than $600, which was given to the Augustana Hospital's general fund. The Bishop has no doubt ever preached to a more attentive audience than the one found listening in the Chicago Auditorium.</p>
