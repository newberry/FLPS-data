   <p>The Rev. Herman Lindskog, Rector of the Church made a brief address concerning the merits of Gustav Adolf II as the hero of Protestantism but he also mentioned the progress of Catholicism in the United States, which, in pastor Lindskog's opinion was a danger. Svithiod sang: Silent Shadows. Pastor Lindskog pronounced the Benediction and the program ended with the singing of Martin Luther's well known hymn, 124 verse 4.</p>
