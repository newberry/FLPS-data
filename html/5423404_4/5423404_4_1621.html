   <p>We have already expressed ourselves as being against the increase in immigration which is so strongly desired by our industrialists, and we have even pointed out the advantages of a further tightening of immigration regulations.</p>
   <p>Last week, the Immigration Committee of the House of Representatives recommended the passage of a bill which supposedly reduces the number of immigrants who are to be permitted to enter the country annually. According to this measure, the so-called quota is lowered from three to two per cent, and this quota is to be based on the number of immigrants who entered the country in 1890. Up to now the 1910 figure has been used as the norm.</p>
   <p>In reality, however, an increased number of people will probably be admitted to the country if this bill is passed. One of its purposes is said to be to encourage immigration from northern Europe, whose people are considered, for various reasons, the most desirable immigrants. But there is nothing in the bill which is likely to serve this purpose.</p>
   <p>The bill as it is now presented provides that relatives of citizens living here are to be admitted regardless of the quota; and, furthermore, unrestricted immigration is permitted relatives of aliens who have lived here for two years or more, and whose declaration of intention to become American citizens is one year old. All that is necessary for admission to this country is to have somebody who is already living here declare that he is related to the prospective immigrant. Under such provisions we should soon see a rapid increase of our ghetto population.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that those countries whose emigrants are most wanted here are most sending enough to fill the present quotas. What, then, is the purpose of limiting their number by a new law? And yet, not satisfied with this limitation, the Immigration Committee wants to provide loopholes through which less desirable immigrants may come in.</p>
   <p>Is it possible that certain elements in Congress want to make it appear that they favor further limitation of immigration, which is demanded by the majority of our people, but that they in reality are trying to comply with the wishes of manufacturers' associations, to whose interest it is to import an unlimited supply of cheap labor? A cynic would be inclined to answer yes.</p>
