   <p>The Old People's Home Association of the United Swedish Societies held its regular quarterly meeting, last monday at the Sherman Hotel. Committee reports were made and approved, and general routine work transacted. Most noteworthy among the reports was that of the Swedish-American Club, which showed that the Club had turned over to the Old People's Home Association, a check for $1,025.00, this sum being the net proceeds from a charity ball sponsored by them late in the fall.</p>
   <p>In addition, the S.A.C. has raised enough money to completely furnish one of the rooms in the Home, and this money was turned over at this meeting by Mr. Charles H. Rosberg, chairman of the club's Board of Directors.</p>
