   <p>The recent report made by the Englewood Hospital, owned and maintained by the Chicago Swedish Colony, justifies the pride of the Chicago Swedes. From September 1, 1905 to September 1, 1906, the hospital has cared for 864 patients; 754 were cured, 80 died; 718 of the patients paid in full, while the other 146 were charity patients who received the best of care. The income of the hospital during the year was $21,262.98, exceeding the expenses by $1,611.88. This record is an outstanding one for which great credit is given to the hospital superintendent, Miss Emelia Dahlgren, formerly at the Augustana and other highly regarded hospitals, and to the business manager, Mr. Fred Westberg.</p>
