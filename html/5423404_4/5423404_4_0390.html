   <p>Mr. John A. Linn, present clerk of the Circuit Court, has been accused of embezzling sixty thousand dollars during the eight years he was clerk of the Superior Court. This money, according to the accusation by the Citizens Association, was paid out in salaries to imaginary county employes. Linn is also accused of hiding or destroying several books of records in which the paying of the illegal salaries are falsely entered. He is also charged with placing the blame for the disappearance of twenty-five thousand dollars on an unnamed employee in his office. State's Attorney Healy has decided to refer the case to the next Grand Jury.</p>
   <p>Friends of Mr. Linn have approached Governor Deneen in an effort to have the case kept from being handled by the Grand Jury. Governor Deneen refuses to interfere.</p>
