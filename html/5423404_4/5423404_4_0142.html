   <p>Last Monday it was decided to buy the property at the corner of Evanston Avenue and Grand Avenue in North Evanston for $6,500. Here the Society will build a new Old People's Home. The lot in question is 240 by 428 feet. The building will be a two-story edifice, 38 by 134 feet, built of fireproof tile, and will cost $25,000. The Society now has about $18,000 in the treasury besides $2,000 which it has lent out.</p>
   <p>Architect Sandegren drew the plans for the Home and will supervise its construction.</p>
