   <p>Next Sunday, September 28, will be a memorable day in the history of the Albany Park Lutheran congregation, for on that date its new church, located on the corner of Spaulding and Thorndale Avenues, will be dedicated.</p>
   <p>The program will start at 3 P.M. when the building committee, headed by Dr. G. R. Freedlund and the architect, Robert C. Ostergren, will officially present the church to the congregation.</p>
   <p>Building plans for the new temple were prepared by Architect Robert Oestergren, and its cost as it now stands, is $85,000. It ordinarily seats 400 people and this number can be increased to 600 by moving a removable wall.</p>
