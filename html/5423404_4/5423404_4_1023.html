   <p>The immigrant-- and please remember that we all once were immigrants--can be viewed from at least four different angles. Almost invariably he is poor and, as a consequence, an economic problem to himself and others, but we are not going to talk about that now. He is always new when he arrives and as such gaped upon and talked about by inquisitive people. But he is not new to us and this phase of it we'll leave alone. He is also of serious mind, but as we ourselves are not serious-minded at this moment, we'll not view him from that angle. It cannot be denied, however, that from the viewpoints just mentioned he makes a rather interesting study in humor. The humoristic aspect is the more conspicuous because of his own unconsciousness of the fact. Disclaiming any humoristic talents, we will, nevertheless, treat the subject of our Swedish immigrant in a vein lighter and more humorous than usual.</p>
   <p>How polite is he not, when he first comes here! Particularly so, if he hasn't got a rich uncle already living here. For instance, watch him make <span class="page-break">2</span>those three quick bows, when he introduces himself, and assume that well-disciplined military posture, when he tells you of the reasons for his coming to America. We do not pretend to say that there is anything funny or ridiculous in such manners, quite on the contrary. But if we observe his subsequent manners and then draw a mind picture of the same individual as a newcomer, we simply cannot refrain from smiling, even though we may possess no more sense of humor than the one and only Swedish comic paper published here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Gradually, and usually within only a couple of years, the soft-mannered and well-polished immigrant becomes stiff-jointed and unpolished. The graceful bows have disappeared, and an "I-don't-care" posture and an "I-am-as-good-as-you-are" attitude have been adopted. At the same time one cannot help but notice that his language has been subjected to a process of moral deterioration. It is no longer the immigrant speaking, his Swedish conceptions of moral cleanliness have become prisoned, cuss words emerge from his lips with remarkable ease--not those having the stamp of our forefathers <span class="page-break">3</span>upon them and the ring of Swedish metal in them--but those in a broken dialect and expressive of vulgarity and profanity that has nothing in common with his ancestral make-up.</p>
   <p>The emigrant now is in his first stage of American transformation. At this stage everything goes amiss for him, the language, his half-soles, his luck and his entire individuality. He drifts hither and thither, not knowing whither, but is profoundly conscious of the fact that he lives in the Land of Liberty, where he could have become president, if it were not that he was born in Smaland, Vestergotland, or Skane. During this transition period, in these years of American apprenticeship, so to speak, the young emigrant presents a most sorrowful picture and at the same time a most comical one, if we are permitted to apply a sense of humor in a case like this.</p>
   <p>But during the course of time, sooner or later, depending upon his inherent qualifications, he will find himself, like he was at the time of arrival, plus a seventy-nine per cent improvement in English, but minus his imported soft-mannerism and the subsequent artificial stiff-jointedness, which he had <span class="page-break">4</span>been forced to practice to dispel the suspicions of appearing a "greenhorn."</p>
   <p>During this second stage of the Americanization process he becomes a real man, a good American. But this does not mean that the Swede in him has been driven out; quite the opposite! Beneath the Americanized surface, all the good virtues imbedded in his character, as seeds from the mother country, commence growing roots and will in time develop more fully, more richly, than they would have done in Swedish soil. This, of course, is on the presumption that the good qualities outnumber the bad ones. If the seeds of weeds are in the majority, the development along the path of evil is equally as rapid. The American soil is fertile and the emigrant either becomes a good, useful man or a rascal in less than half of the time here than what would have been required back in Sweden.</p>
   <p>What is then that Americanization process that we hear so much about? It is generally thought that it is a process of elimination of a person's "old identity." This is a capital mistake! America merely develops it. The difference between an Americanized and an un-Americanized Swede is chiefly <span class="page-break">5</span>one learns to view a matter from several angles. In short, one becomes practical and cosmopolitan, at all times in accordance with one's inherent characteristics. These are not lost by the emigrant, but instead further developed by him, and his qualifications as a man and a citizen are determined thereby. This explains why the emigrant, who came here twenty or thirty years ago, at the bottom of his heart, is just as much a Swede as the one who arrived yesterday. They are true to the Swedish colors, at least as to their sentiments. That particular trait of the Swedes, which has been given the epithet "royal" and in our national colors is symbolized by the yellow cross, is not any fainter in the subconscious mind of our old time emigrants that it is in that of our newcomers. And no one ever doubted our loyalty, symbolized by the sky-blue in our flag.</p>
   <p>We are loyal--loyal until death do us part from what we once learned to love and respect. Thus dwell the Swedish traditions forever in the heart of our emigrant. The more a Swede he is, the better an American he is. Long live the Swede!</p>
