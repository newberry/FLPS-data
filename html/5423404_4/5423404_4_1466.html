   <p>A few weeks ago, the Reverend Charles Stelzle of the Presbyterian Church in Chicago applied to the Chicago Federation of Labor for admission into the Federation of delegates from the Presbyterian Ministers' Association.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Mr. Stelzle called a meeting for the discussion of the matter. This meeting was held last Sunday. The leaders of the various labor unions were present, and expressed their opinions in this important matter. Against the suggestion, Mr. Thomas Hall, delegate for the bricklayers' union, spoke most strongly. He said: "The whole religious movement leans upon capitalism. The railroad corporations are maintaining the Y. M. C. A. I smell a rat in this request from the ministers."</p>
   <p>Reverend Stelzle did not reply to this attack. Perhaps he did secretly admit <span class="page-break">2</span>that Mr. Hall was right. Perhaps he was realizing that the majority of the men who are leaders in the religious movement have not acted in a manner so as to win the full confidence of the workers.</p>
   <p>Perhaps Reverend Mr. Stelzle is honest in his motion, and is imbued with a warm interest for the advancement of the working class. Perhaps the ministers who worked with him for the same goal also were honest; yet, if their application were granted for membership in the Chicago Federation of Labor, with right to vote, the Federation would, of course, have to grant similar membership rights to representatives from other religious sects. The consequence--well, that is easily seen if one admits the truth of Mr. Hall's statement: "The whole religious movement leans upon capitalism." Not only do we think that the meetings of the unions might be changed into prayer meetings and revival services--the Presbyterian delegation by itself would be sufficient to bring such a state about--but the union would be in danger of being split, and in a way before long, it would nullify all the work which the Chicago Federation of Labor has performed in the interest of organized workers for many years.</p>

   <p>All those who are warning against "pulling in a yoke with unbelievers" would consider it a task pleasing in the sight of God to destroy an organization which, in their opinion, is an obstacle to the spread of Christianity. They would not hesitate to seek to become members of such an organization if they thought they were able in that manner to destroy it so much more speedily.</p>
   <p>If our clergy really were interested in the welfare of organized labor, and of the working class as a whole, they might start by showing this interest within their own congregations: point out to the workers in their groups that it is their duty to join the organization into which the Presbyterian ministers sought to enter, that it is their duty to work hand in hand with their fellows in that organization. The clergy might also inform the rich church members that their riches have been acquired through the efforts of their brethren, the workers. If the clergy is really interested in the workers, their sermons must give evidence of such interest; the truth must be stated in regard to the workers and about the employers whenever the question is brought up.</p>
