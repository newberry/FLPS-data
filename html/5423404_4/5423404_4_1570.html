   <p>Yesterday our countryman Charles A. Olander could look back upon twenty year as a Mail Carrier for Uncle Sam. On June 21st, 1872 at 10 A. M., Olander was sworn in as Mail Carrier by the then Postmaster, Frank Eastman. Olander is only fifty-two years old and is in fine physical trim, which he attributes to the daily long walks. It has been estimated that in these twenty years he has walked a distance equal to three times the distance around the world.</p>
