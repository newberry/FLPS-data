   <p>The Swedish Methodist Chapel at Englewood was dedicated last Sunday. The Swedish service was conducted by Rev. H. W. Eklund and the English by Rev. Dr. Witting. Other speakers included Rev. A.T. Westergreen and C.G.Nelson.</p>
   <p>The offering amounted to $450.00, which will be applied on the furniture bill. The church is still in debt to some extent, but it is the hope of the members of the church to pay those debts as soon as possible.</p>
