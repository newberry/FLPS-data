   <p>The Immanuel Mission Congregation, which for some time has worshipped in Schott's Hall, has begun the construction of a new church on Aldine Avenue, just east of Clark Street. The location is very convenient for the members of the congregation. The new temple will be ready for use in the late fall.</p>
