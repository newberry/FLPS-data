   <p>The tercentenary of the battle of Lutzen and the death of Gustavus Adolphus, the hero king, was observed by Chicago's Swedes last Sunday in a very dignified manner.</p>
   <p>Ceremonies began in the morning when Dr. Elof K. Jonson, in a church service which was broadcast over radio station WIBO, called the significance of the day to the attention of the public. Also in most Swedish churches throughout the city tribute was paid to the memory of the heroic Swedish king.</p>
   <p>The real official memorial service took place in the afternoon in the Moody Memorial Church, where the Chicago department of the Gustavus Adolphus <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Tercentenary Memorial Association, through a specially appointed committee representing various denominations and secular organizations, presented a festive program worthy of the great occasion.</p>
   <p>The Moody Church was the largest one available for the Celebration. It accommodates about five thousand people, and when the program opened with the unison singing of the great Reformation hymn "A Mighty Fortress is Our Lord," every seat was occupied, and people were standing in the aisles and even in the vestibule. The crowd kept coming, and soon there were almost as many people outside the church as inside. It was decided to open the large auditorium in the basement, which seats about one thousand people, and there Dr. David Nyvall, the noted educator and author, delivered a spirited speech on the life work of Gustavus Adolphus and its significance. But hundreds of people had to return to their homes without entering the church. However, the arrangements committee is not to be blamed for this. Early last summer it tried to obtain larger quarters for this celebration but they could not be had.</p>

   <p>Following the singing of the hymn, Dr. Harold Lundquist, dean of the Moody Bible Institute, led the audience in prayer, and a church choir consisting of some six hundred voices, under the direction of Harry T. Carlson, sang Bach's "Now Let Every Tongue Adore Thee," and "Unfold Ye Portals," from Gounod's "Redemption".</p>
   <p>Dr. Algoth Ohlson then presented Oscar C. G. Lundquist, Swedish consul in Chicago, who in fitting words introduced the main speaker of the day, Wollmar F. Bostrom, Swedish minister to Washington.</p>
   <p>The minister's address was quite long, but perfect in form and contents, and he presented a memorable word picture of Gustavus Adolphus not only as a warrior for the Protestant cause but also as a statesman and leader of his people. We regret that we cannot give our readers even a summary of it here.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Dr. Julius Lincoln, who is recognized as one of the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>foremost Swedish-American public speakers. He eulogized the hero king as the great religious liberator, "God's tool for the preservation of religious freedom".</p>
   <p>During the intermission between the two main addresses, Dr. Algoth Ohlson reminded the audience of the plans for a permanent Gustavus Adolphus memorial in this country. It will most likely be in the form of a bust of the king, which is to be placed in the John Morton Building in Philadelphia. A collection was then taken up for the benefit of the memorial fund, and also for defraying the expenses of this Chicago celebration.</p>
   <p>The church choir rendered several more numbers. Among which was the "Hallelujah Chorus" from Handel's "Messiah", and at the end of the program Reverend Bostrom thanked the singers for their excellent performance.</p>
   <p>Dr. Lincoln has asked us to convey his sincere thanks to all those who helped <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>make this celebration so successful, particularly the chairman of the program committee, Dr. Peter Peterson and his aids, as well as the members of the various subcommittees.</p>
   <p>In concluding our imperfect review of this memorable event we feel constrained to voice only one regret, namely, that the arrangements committee did not succeed in securing a larger place for the celebration so that everybody who wanted to could have attended.</p>
