   <p>Our fellow countryman, Leonard R. Lindroth, who for four years has been a police officer in the Pullman district, now has been promoted to the rank of police sergeant. The promotion also entails his transfer to the larger Woodlawn Park district. Sergeant Lindroth has distinguished himself because of his great ability, and is looked upon as good timber for higher positions on the Chicago police force. He has a pleasing personality and is well liked and highly thought of by fellow policemen and citizens alike.</p>
