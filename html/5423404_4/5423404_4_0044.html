   <p>The Swedish Washington Park Hospital on the South Side is to increase its capacity. The main building was finished in February 1906 and has already been found too small. The directors, last Friday, bought two lots adjoining the present property, on which additional buildings will be put up to accommodate twenty more patients. The hospital is in need of a number of efficient nurses. Here is a wonderful opportunity for young women having the required knowledge to start on a high grade career. Experience that may be theirs at the Swedish Washington Park Hospital cannot be surpassed in any other Midwest institution.</p>
