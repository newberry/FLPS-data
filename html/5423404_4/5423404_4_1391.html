   <p>Last Sunday was a notable day for the members of the Swedish Mission congregation in North Park. During the afternoon ceremony the cornerstone of their new Church was laid. The temple will be located on the southwest corner of Christiana and Berwyn Avenues. The ceremony was favored by ideal weather, and a large number of people attended.</p>
   <p>The congregation's pastor, Arthur M. Bowman, was in charge of the program, which opened with a group song. The rector of the North Park College, Professor Algoth Ohlson, then read from the Bible. The former rector of the College, Dr. David Nyvall, led the congregation in prayer. A program of song and music was then given. The Reverend C. V. Bowman, president of the Swedish Mission League of America, addressed the congregation, reviewing the activities of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>League during the last few years. He reminded his listeners of the great responsibility which now rests upon them.</p>
