   <p>The Swedish Singers' Day at Riverview Park last Sunday had tempted about 8,000 persons to come out and enjoy a good time. A chorus of 200 voices, the same one which sang so excellently at Grant Park at the Olympic games, under the direction of Ernest Lindblom, won the the public's heart from the beginning to the end of the program.</p>
   <p>The festival address was delivered by Senator Charles F. Hurburgh from Galesburg, Illinois. The athletes Anderson, and Petterson, presented a trick, showing their unusual strength by holding a bridge over which an automobile with ten persons was driven. The Swedish National Friends society won a prize for their appearance.</p>
