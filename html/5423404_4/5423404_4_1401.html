   <p>The Swedish Lutheran Ebenezer Church is ready to build a Community House to adjoin the church building at the Northeast corner of Foster Avenue and N. Paulina Street. A committee of 165 members of the congregation was appointed some time ago to solicit subscriptions for this addition, and at the meeting held a few days ago it was reported that the required minimum sum of $100,000 had been reached.</p>
