   <p>The Immanuel Women's Home, the Augustana Synod's home for lonely women, located at 1505-1515 North La Salle Street, is celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of its founding today.</p>
   <p>In January of 1907, Dr. C. A. Ewald, then pastor of the Immanuel Swedish Lutheran Congregation, called a meeting at which it was decided to form a society which was called the Immanuel Women's Home Society, and Reverend Ewald was made president. A few months later the Society bought, with money which it had borrowed, the building located at 1505 North La Salle Street. They remodeled the building to make it suitable as a home for women and furnished it by means of funds collected by the members. The facilities proved adequate for some time, but after a few years it became necessary to expand, and in 1913 the adjoining building was bought for $13,000. In 1918 a third building was purchased at a cost of $13,500. Four years later an annex was <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>built on extra land acquired in the purchase of the third building; the cost of the annex was $50,000. This last expansion enabled the Home to accomodate 140 residents, and it was thought that this was the largest number the institution would ever be able to care for. It turned out otherwise, for in 1926 it was decided to buy still another building, and the property located at 1515 North La Salle Street was acquired at a cost of $60,000. In addition to these expenditures the Society had enough funds at its disposal to buy a number of building lots suitably located for summer cottages, and two of these lots are close to the Lutheran summer resort colony at Cisco Beach, where it [the Society] now is planning to build a summer home for its clients.</p>
   <p>The following ladies are directing the activities of the Immanuel Women's Home Association: Mrs. Emmy Ewald, president; Mrs. Peter Peterson, vice-president; Mrs. J. O. Broman, secretary; Mrs. John E. Ericsson, treasurer.</p>
