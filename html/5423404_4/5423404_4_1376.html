   <p>The Svithiod Great Lodge held its annual convention here in the city on Wednesday February 10. The representatives of the various lodges gathered at the office of the Great Lodge, 122 LaSalle Street, and from there they marched to the hall in Masonic Temple, which had been rented for the occasion. Here the convention was called to order, and the members welcomed to the city by the chairman, Olaf Pearson. He called attention to the importance of the topics at issue, and congratulated the representatives on having met under the present favorable circumstances.</p>
   <p>From the official report of the secretary, it appeared that the Order has made considerable progress during the past year. Five new lodges have been organized, and nine hundred forty-nine applications for membership received. Forty-four of the applicants were rejected by the examining doctors, and a total of eight hundred seventeen received membership certificates. Thirty-five members died during the year, and one hundred ninety-four were <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>expelled for various reasons. Thus, at the end of December 1903, the Order had a total membership of 3,463 distributed between twenty-five lodges, with a guaranteed insurance amount of $3,294,500. During the year, insurance to the amount of $36,330 was paid to relatives of deceased members, and the cash in the treasury of the Great Lodge at the end of December 1903, amounted to $9,731.04.</p>
   <p>The cost of a $1,000 life insurance amounted to $12.95 during the past year, and the average cost during the past five years was $10.17, or somewhat less than 85 cents per month, per $1,000 insurance.</p>
   <p>The assistance extended by the lodges during the year to sick and need members amounted to the following very large sums:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Sick aid</td>
     <td>$11,572.50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Burial aid</td>
     <td>3,357.95</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Donations</td>
     <td>925.47</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Total</td>
     <td>$15,855.92</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>If to this amount is added the sum of $36,330, insurance amounts paid during the year as mentioned above, then we find that a total of $52,185.92 was distributed by the Great Lodge.</p>
   <p>The cash held by the various subordinate lodges total $29,123.48, so that the cash held by Great Lodge and the subordinate lodges together totals $38,854.52.</p>
   <p>This fine result of one year's work can only be considered a triumph for the Order and the principles underlying its work, and all the more since the increase is not the result of exertions by paid agents, but solely the result of persistent efforts of interested members.</p>
   <p>The auditing committee reported that the books of the Order had been examined and found correct.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Officers were elected for the ensuing year.</p>
   <p>After the conclusion of the convention, the delegates gathered for a fellowship dinner at Swedish Businessmen's Club.</p>
