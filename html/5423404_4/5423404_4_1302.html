   <p>Liberty day, the Fourth of July, is a festive day when more than at any other time we remember the Declaration of Independence and rejoice in it.</p>
   <p>The Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Independence together form the foundation on which the liberty of the American people rests. The Constitution is a juridical document in which are set forth the principles which guide the lives of free citizens. It speaks to our reason. But the Declaration of Independence is a document created by strong feeling. It delivered free-born men and women from foreign oppression, giving liberty to everybody in this country.</p>
   <p>Let us,therefore, on the Fourth of July, give free rein to our happy feelings and rejoice in our precious liberty.</p>
