   <p>A chapter of the American Scandinavian Foundation was established here in Chicago last Sunday. Such chapters, made up of individual members or associates of the Foundation, already exist in Jamestown, New York and in Rockford, Illinois. The purpose of these chapters is to bring about closer co-operation among those who are interested in the work of the Foundation.</p>
   <p>The Chicago chapter was organized immediately following Dr. Leach's address in the Swedish Club last Sunday afternoon. Dr. Leach is the secretary of the American Scandinavian Foundation. He visited the Rockford Chapter last Saturday. In his address here, Dr. Leach took the opportunity to explain the new working methods employed by the Foundation. It has many associate members throughout the country, and it has become more and more clear that it would be desirable to bring these associates into closer co-operation with the Foundation on the one hand, and with the public, the American as well as the Scandinavian-American, on the other.</p>
   
   <p>When prominent Scandinavians come to this country and visit various Scandinavian centers here, there is no organization better fitted to make the proper arrangements for their reception than a chapter of the Foundation. Individual members or associates here in Chicago have always done the best they could in this regard, but Dr. Leach was of the opinion that closer co-operation among members here was highly desirable. He therefore recommended the formation of a chapter, which was accordingly established, the following officers being elected: C. S. Peterson, president; Dr. Max Henius, vice-president; Birger Osland, treasurer; H. S. Henschen, secretary; N. M. Hokanson, corresponding secretary. Applications for membership in the Chapter should be addressed to N. M. Hokanson, in care of the Great Lakes Trust Company, Chicago. The annual membership fee is two dollars, and members receive the Foundation's monthly publication free of charge. [Translator's note: The American Scandinavian Foundation is an organization formed for the purpose of bringing about a closer cultural relationship between the United States and the Scandinavian countries. Among its activities is the exchange of students and university professors. Every year it awards a certain number of scholarships, and thus makes it possible for American students to spend some time at a Scandinavian university, and for Scandinavian students to attend some American institution of learning. The Foundation also makes arrangements for students of business, social conditions, and industrial methods. It will, for instance, place a young Swedish bank employee in some leading American bank so that he may get an insight into American banking methods.]</p>
