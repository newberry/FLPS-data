   <p>During the month of April, the free employment bureau of the Swedish National Association succeeded in placing 291 men and 75 women, a total of 366. Some people may hold that at present it is not very difficult to get employment for people, and this is true to a certain degree. On the other hand, it should be remembered that the majority of the men and women who have found employment through the activity of the Bureau have come to this country only recently, and on account of their lack of knowledge of the English language in all probability would have had considerable difficulty in securing employment were it not for the Bureau's assistance.</p>
