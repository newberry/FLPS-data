   <p>A Little Town within itself is practically erected by our well-known countryman, Carl A. Carlson at the corner of N. Dearborn and Maple Streets. The building will be 22 stories high and is to contain 247 apartments, most of them of 2 rooms each, but many with 3, 4 and 5 rooms. This is the third building of similar type constructed by Mr. Carlson within the last few years.</p>
