   <p>On the initiative of the well-known manufacturer, Herbert Hedman, the directors of the Swedish Club held a meeting last Friday at which it was decided to address an appeal to all Swedish organizations in Chicago, urging them to take part in a concerted drive for the relief of the unemployed and needy Swedes in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The resolution was adopted unanimously and Hedman was appointed to take charge of the relief campaign. A request is now being sent to Swedish churches, societies, and clubs, that they send representatives to attend a meeting which will be held in the immediate future, and at that time it is planned to have a managing committee appointed. This committee will then work out definite plans for a drive for funds, and will submit these plans at another meeting. Anyone who is interested in this worthy cause will be invited.</p>
