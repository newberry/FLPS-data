   <p>A pamphlet has recently been published which contains much of great interest to the foreign-born people of this country, not least of all to the Scandinavians. It is the annual report of the Bureau of Immigration in Washington, and among other interesting information it contains a section of "Trades and Occupations of Immigrants of Various Countries".</p>
   <p>Scandinavians--meaning Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes--are included among the nationality groups discussed. Of the 309,556 immigrants who entered this country last year, only 5.4 per cent, or 16,678, were from the Scandinavian countries. Thus Scandinavian immigration is not very important numerically when compared with that of other groups. The Jews, for example, provided 53,524 newcomers; the Italians, 41,154; the Germans, 31,218; and the British, 30,429.</p>
   <p>But in some other respects the Scandinavian group is of considerable interest. The figures show that it contains a higher percentage of individuals with special occupational training than any of the other groups. In other words, there are among the Scandinavians a proportionately smaller number of people who are not trained for any special kind of work.</p>
   <p>While the Scandinavian group made up only 5.4 per cent of the total number of immigrants who arrived during the past year, it comprised 8.5 per cent of all the skilled workers admitted; and of the total number of immigrants in the category of the professionally trained, 6.5 per cent, or 286, were Scandinavians. Even to the class labeled "miscellaneous," and including farm workers, servants, fishermen, etc., the Scandinavians contributed a somewhat larger percentage than 5.4.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian group contained 3,835 persons who were classified as having no occupation or trade, this category including dependent women and children. This class comprised about 23 per cent of the total number of Scandinavian immigrants for the year, a percentage lower than that of any other group.</p>
   <p>For the sake of comparison we gave the corresponding percentages for other national groups. They are as follows: Of the 53,524 Jewish immigrants, 31,526, or roughly 60 per cent, had no trade or occupation; of the Poles and the Portugese, 55 per cent; of the Japanese, 55 to 60 per cent; of the English and Dutch, 45 to 50 per cent; of the Americans, Bulgarians, Rumanians, Russians, Slovaks, Spaniards, and Syrians, 45 to 50 per cent; of the French, about 40 per cent; of the Scotch, 40 per cent; of the Italians, 35 per cent; of the Germans, 33 per cent;....</p>
   <p>It is also interesting to study the various occupations represented among the immigrants. In the Scandinavian group, electricians and engineers comprise a high proportion of the total immigration. The 111 electricians and the 175 engineers who arrived here last year from the Scandinavian countries constituted a percentage of the total Scandinavian immigration which was more than three times as high as the average for all other nation groups.</p>
   <p>Considering the various trades we find that the Scandinavians contributed a proportionally higher number of skilled workers than any other group. Among them were many carpenters, cabinetmakers, bakers, ironsmiths, office workers, machinists, gardeners, metal workers, mechanics, painters, interior decorators, stone cutters, and so on. Of the 7676 farmers who arrived here during the year, 634 were Scandinavians. The Scandinavian group also contributed 1,859 out of a total of 10,524 farm workers.</p>
