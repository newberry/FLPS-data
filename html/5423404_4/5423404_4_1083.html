   <p>"Blekinge Gille" is the name given a society, which was organized at a meeting last Thursday evening at Hagelin Hall, 5153 North Ashland Avenue. The attendance surpassed all expectations, and eighty "Blekingar" joined at this first meeting. The interim officers appointed at an earlier gathering, worked out a set of laws which were unanimously adopted. The following officers were elected: president, John Synnerberg; vice president, Ivar Carlson; secretary, Oscar Lindberg; treasurer, H.O. Windahl; custodian, Erick Nicklason; trustees, Vertil Wiberg, S.E.Anderson, and Alfred Anderson.</p>
   <p>As auditors, the following were elected: Axel Swanson; Wrik Lind and Alice Johnson. Viola Pearson and Carl Swenson were elected as substitute officers. After the meeting, those present gathered for a social hour with aromatic coffee and a most delicious cake, artistically decorated with the "Blekinge Coat of Arms." The affair culminated with a dance to old well-known tunes from a harmonica.</p>
