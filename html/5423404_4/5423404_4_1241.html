   <p>Last Sunday, a couple of dozens of Vikings.... undertook the trip to Joilet, neighboring city of Chicago, for the purpose of forming a "Fylke" (Old Norse, for a certain governmental subdivision. Tr.). The Vikings came, saw, conquered; thirty Swedes from Joilet, joined hands, went into session, and swore, by the ancient Sword of Oden, to remain ever faithful. The name of the new "Fylke" is "Thorsten".</p>
