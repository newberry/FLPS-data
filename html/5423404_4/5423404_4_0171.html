   <p>On November 5, 1890, the Bethany Home (Betania-Hemmet) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois. The chief purpose of the organization is to maintain a permanent home for aged people of both sexes, but the by-laws also provide for the lending of aid of more or less temporary nature to orphaned children and destitute adults. Although the Home is under the supervision of the Swedish Methodist-Episcopal Church, not only members of this sect may be admitted, but also others, who are worthy of help of this kind.</p>
   <p>At the present time, a ten-room house at 652 Sheridan  Road, Evanston, is being used as temporary quarters for the Home, but plans are afoot for the purchase of ground and the erection of a building suitable for the purpose. Our generous countryman, J.R. Lindgren, the banker, has pledged a donation of $10,000. toward the plan, provided that the Swedish M.E. churches raise a similar amount. This sum has already been pledged by the various congregations and $8,000. paid into the fund, to which Lindgren promptly has added his $8,000., making the total available cash $16,000.</p>
   
   <p>The Superintendent of the Home is Mrs. Anna Malmstrom. Its activity began on March 1, and already two persons above the age of seventy are being cared for. Several applications are under consideration.</p>
