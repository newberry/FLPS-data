   <p>The Good Templars' youth clubs, "Idrott," "Ideal," and "Harmoni," celebrated Youth's Day last Sunday in Good Templar Park. The program was especially notable for its great variety and was very interesting. The weather was ideal, and the attendance was good; the program therefore came off exactly according to plan. It began with the competition of the young men in sports of various kinds, among which were discus-throwing, the shot-put, the broad jump, and the hundred-yard dash.</p>
   <p>The more formal program began at two o'clock in the afternoon with music by Norin and Anderson's orchestra and a welcoming speech by Einar Lindskog, in which he pointed out the cultural significance of the activities of the Good Templars and the high ideals which form the basis for the Order's work among young people. The speech was followed by music contributed by the Good Templars' male choir, which sang "Sveriges Flagga" <span class="page-break">\2</span>(The Swedish Flag) and "Jag Vet Et Land" (I Know a Land), for which it was rewarded with hearty applause.</p>
   <p>Next came a performance by the National Dance Club, which presented a number of typical Swedish folk dances. To all appearances the audience enjoyed them very much.</p>
   <p>The final part of the afternoon's program consisted of more music by the above-mentioned orchestra, singing by the male choir, and another performance by the Dance Club.</p>
   <p>In the evening Henning Ohlson's play, "Fadernearf" (The Heritage from Our Fathers), was played before a large and receptive audience, and all the roles were remarkably well handled.</p>
   <p>A popularity contest was conducted during the day, and first prize went to Viola Gustafson, who belongs to the Ideal Club. The two girls representing <span class="page-break">\3</span>Idrott and Harmoni won second and third prizes respectively.</p>
   <p>It was, all together, a wonderful day which will long be remembered by all those who attended.</p>
