   <p>The Swedish National Association has decided to try to secure a new trial for our compatriot, John Nordgren, who was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment for the alleged murder of his wife sometime ago. It appears that Nordgren's case was not handled according to legal rules, the reason being the lack of ability of the counsel for the defendant.</p>
   <p>The Swedish National Association now has taken over the case, and has decided to provide the accused with able legal counsel. For this purpose, the Society has engaged one of Chicago's ablest criminal lawyers, Attorney W. S. Elliott, who will defend Nordgren. A court case of this nature requires large amounts of money. The committee appointed to handle the finances in this connection feels assured that the Swedes of Chicago will gladly extend a helping hand to defend a compatriot in need, and in this assurance we appeal for contributions. Subscription books have been made up, and a great festival has been arranged for at the North Side Turner Hall, on May 10.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Theatrical Society, under the direction of Mr. Christ Brusell, will present the humorous farce, "He Is not Jealous." Svithiad's sextette will sing, also Miss Anna Nelson, and Meek's Orchestra will furnish the music. Attorney W. S. Elliott will speak on the case of John Nordgren. After the program, there will be dancing. Tickets at fifty cents may be had at the office of the Swedish National Association and at the entrance of the hall.</p>
