   <p>The festival held by the Swedish National League of Chicago, at the Auditorium, on Saturday, May 19, was a success as far as the program was concerned, but the attendance was not large enough for a capacity house as expected to boost the fund for the relief of the stricken San Franciscans. In addition to the natural urge to help all stricken citizens of the destroyed city, five thousand Swedes were included, a known fact that should have more than filled the Auditorium. The theatrical and musical numbers on the program were exceptionally good, our most talented Chicago Swedes having volunteered and served gratis. Our Chicago Swedish Colony should have unhesitatingly attended this festival to aid their own countrymen.</p>
