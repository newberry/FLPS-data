   <p>p.11.......Last week we were informed that Birger Osland, of the firm Birger Osland &amp; Co., Western General Agents of the Norwegian America S/S Line, had been appointed Captain of Infantry in the National Army, with orders to report for duty immediately.</p>
   <p>Mr. Osland has been for many years well-known in this city, and is a member of several organizations, such as the Norwegia Club, the Swedish Club and others.</p>
   <p>Our countryman, Sigurd H.Henning, who has been with said firm for about a year as Chief Clerk, before which time he was with the White Star Line's Office for fourteen years, will manage the firm during Mr. Osland's absence, a task for which he, considering his long experience in this particular field, is fully qualified.</p>
