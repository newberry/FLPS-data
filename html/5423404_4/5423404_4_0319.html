   <p>The Swedish National League has made its annual report. Among the many interesting accomplishments are the following:</p>
   <p>Their free employment bureau at 80 Dearborn Street has secured work for 3,104 men and 1,503 women, a total of 4,607. Among these men and women were workers of every trade, and they were sent to every state in the Union.</p>
   <p>A noble and blessed work in charity has been done among our needy people. During the past year, $560.50 has been given to needy widows, large families, old people, and those suffering from illness.</p>
   <p>For sick people, a direct relief amounting to $1,107.08 has been spent, partly for reduced train and boat fares which the League found possible to arrange.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The National League acknowledges its indebtedness to the Chicago Bureau of Charities, through whose co-operation they were enabled to follow the recommendations of doctors to send sick people to Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, Kansas, Texas, Washington, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and other sections.</p>
   <p>Three persons who were unable to support themselves in this country were returned to Sweden on free passage arranged by the League with our government.</p>
   <p>At the annual meeting of the National League, the Swedish Singers League appealed to the National League for help in raising funds necessary to pay the deficit incurred in January 1905 while entertaining the United Swedish Singers when that organization gathered in Chicago for their national convention.</p>
   <p>The Swedish National League is always willing to support any movement through which our people are advanced in culture and prominence. Therefore, they decided to co-operate with the singers whenever during the next two years <span class="page-break">\3</span>they sponsored programs by which funds are to be raised. The cooperation of the National League also brought the following contributions for the Singers League: fifty per cent of the net earnings of the Chicago colony's midsummer festival of 1904, $1,366.50; fifty per cent of the 1905 winter festival, $316.89; and similar share of the 1905 midsummer festival $1,833.74; making a total of $3, 517.13.</p>
   <p>The Swedish National League expresses its appreciation for the support of our people during past years, and looks forward to a capacity house at this year's midwinter festival, to be held in Thomas Orchestra Hall on January 25.</p>
