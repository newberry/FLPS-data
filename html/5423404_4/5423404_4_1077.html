   <p>p.7..............It is the American Sons and Daughters of Sweden with its officers; many leading men and women, and the many thousands of Swedes in different parts of the country, who are back of this movement - the most comprehensive ever undertaken among men and women of Swedish birth or ancestry in this country.</p>
   <p>The work, in connection with collecting funds to accomplish this gigantic program, has been started. It has already been under way for nearly a year, and $400,000.00 have been gathered in. But this is not enough. We must continue in order to reach the goal. We must reach the $1,500,000.00 figure, in order to make the whole plan a success.</p>
   <p>Up to now we have succeeded in bringing the John Morton Building - a part of the program - under roof. The finishing is left as well as the interior.</p>
   <p>When this is done, we will turn to the other parts of the program.</p>
   
   <p>From all parts of the country we receive the most encouraging reports of the warm interest in this grand idea, and also considerable cash donations.</p>
   <p>Head-office address is: Room 1300, Capitol Building, Chicago, where all information may be obtained, either in person or by correspondence.</p>
