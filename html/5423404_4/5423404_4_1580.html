   <p>At a very spirited meeting, where the finest fellowship prevailed, the Vasa lodges in Chicago got together last Saturday and decided to organize a children's club, the first organization of its kind in Chicago. If the interest which was evinced by the children who were present at the meeting continues, one will not have to worry about the club's future.</p>
   <p>A special committee appointed by the Vasa lodges had arranged the meeting, and much of the publicity work was done by the children themselves.</p>
   <p>The children elected the officers of the club. Esther Sander is the president, and Mrs. Margaret J. Widerborg will act as singing instructor and will teach games, etc.</p>
