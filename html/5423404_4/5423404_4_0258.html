   <p>The Colony of Mercy which has been mentioned on several occasions, is gradually becoming a reality.</p>
   <p>At a luncheon at the Morrison Hotel the other day, given by a closed member of the Colony of the Swedish clergy of Chicago, it was reported that several generous donations toward the worthy cause had been made lately. Three kind-hearted men, August H. Skoglund, Axel W. Anderson and C. Edward Carlson, are recent donors of $1,000 each.</p>
   <p>Dr. Julius Lincoln presided at this luncheon and meeting. Pastors representing all Swedish churches in Chicago and Cook County were present.</p>
