   <p>Not very long ago we informed our readers that the West-Side Swedish Women's Aid Society, had raised a sum of $10,000, for the Swedish Tuberculosis Sanitarium in Denver, Colorado. Shortly afterward we were able to tell you that our ladies on the South Side had raised not less than $15,000, toward the so-called Chicago Pavilion at the Sanitarium. And now behold! Both of these groups of fine, dear women have resumed activities and decided to raise, each, a sum of $15,000, or a total of $30,000 to be set aside as a fund from which the interest shall be used for the care of needy patients.</p>
   <p>The officers of the West-Side group are as follows: Mrs F. Nordquist, president; Mrs. George Peterson, vice-president; Mrs. Carl Burgeson, recording secretary; Mrs. J. A. Richert, financial secretary, and Mrs Joseph Wassell, treasurer. The South-Side group is composed of the following; Mrs. N.A. Nelson, president; Mrs. C. P.Wik, vice-president; Mrs. Victor Bovik, recording secretary; Mrs. Hildur Soderbeck, financial secretary, and Mrs. C. L. Anderson, treasurer.</p>
