   <p>The bazaar for the benefit of Augustana Hospital was concluded last Saturday at Turner Hall. The net proceeds are believed to be around $3,000. A lottery was arranged. A site donated by broker P.H.Pearson, valued at $400 was won by Miss Lottie Fried, superintendent of the hospital for many years. Many other lucky players won valuable prizes donated by different individuals.</p>
   <p>It is the intention of the committee in charge of the bazaar to hold an auction later to dispose of the left overs.</p>
