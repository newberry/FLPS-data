   <p>For the first time, we believe, the Swedes in Chicago will celebrate Memorial Day, Saturday May 30. On that day, there will be a large excursion to the new Swedish cemetery known under the name "Oak Hill", located at 119th Street and Kedzie Avenue. Three trains will leave from Dearborn Street Station for Oak Hill, in the forenoon. The trains will stop at every local station. The return trip will start at a suitable hour in the afternoon. Price of return ticket is twenty-five cents. The trip to the cemetery may also be taken by streetcar, via Morgan Park. The committee invites everybody to join.</p>
