   <p>The distribution of 'Majblomman' (the May Flower), this year, as in the few preceding years, will be handled by Mrs. Gustaf Holmquist, widow of the late soloist and conductor. This year's flower will have the likeness of a blue Anemone (blasippa) and will sell at the regular price of ten cents. As we all know, proceeds of the sales go to a worthy cause, which is the Swedish Sanitarium in Denver.</p>
