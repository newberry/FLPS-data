   <p>The Swedish National Society will hold its fifteenth annual midwinter festival on Sunday, January 19, in the Auditorium. The program will begin at 8:00 P.M.</p>
   <p>The Auditorium is America's largest and most beautiful theater, and for the last fifteen years we Swedes have gathered there on special occasions such as this one.</p>
   <p>The name of the Swedish hero king, Gustavus Adolphus, recently was on everybody's lips on the occasion of the dedication of the Gustavus Adolphus Chapel in Lutzen, a gift from the late Consul Oscar Ekman. The Swedish National Society also wants to honor his memory, and will present Zacharias Topelius' great historical drama, "Gustavus Adolphus and Regina Von Emmeritz," at the festival. Professor J. R. Ortengren and Ida Ortengren will play the title roles, supported by our ablest actors and singers, and they may be counted on to give a great performance.</p>
