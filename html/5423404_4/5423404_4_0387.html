   <p>John A. Linn has been indicted by the Grand Jury. Many charges have been made against him for embezzlement during his eight years as Superior Court chief clerk. Twenty-five charges are made against Linn, including one for general embezzlement of public funds, two for conspiracy, nine for grand larceny, and twelve for counterfeiting. He is also charged with refusing or failing to turn over proper records to his successor in office. To all appearances, the case against Linn has become a very serious one. Evidence of his dishonesty is very strong, placing him in a very precarious position, even though he is considered innocent until he is proven guilty. Linn was placed on a $25,000 bond, and refuses to talk, referring reporters and others to his Attorney, Moritz Rosenthal.</p>
