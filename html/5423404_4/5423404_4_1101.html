   <p>The Society for the Preservation of Swedish Culture in America has now been in existence for several years. It has branches in Minneapolis; Detroit; Lindsborg, Kansas; and Kenilworth, New York. Chicago, which has a larger Swedish population than any other city in America, has no branch, but plans are now under way to remedy this condition. Every Swedish man and woman is herewith invited to become a member of this national organization, and to support its work for the preservation of our beautiful Swedish language, our songs, our ideals, and our traditions and memories.</p>
   <p>The Society does not intend to supplant other Swedish organizations, or to trespass upon their individual spheres of activity. It offers its co-operation to all who are anxious to keep alive our national inheritance. The Society has no political purposes whatever. The preservation of our Swedish culture in America is the only plank in its platform. It does not undertake any kind <span class="page-break">2</span>of propaganda. Its sole purpose is to preserve and strengthen in our Swedish nationals those inherent Swedish qualities which have earned for them the position which they hold today in public esteem and which also help to make them better American citizens.</p>
   <p>Such a purpose deserves the hearty support of every Swedish-American, and we hope that this appeal for members will not go unanswered, but that many will respond--the more the better--and will hasten to join the Society. The membership fee is one dollar a year, and members receive free of charge the periodical Allsvensk Samling (Swedish Unity), which is published in Gothenburg, Sweden, and the yearbook of The National Society for the Preservation of Swedish Culture. [Translator's note: This seems to be the official name of the organization in question.]</p>
   <p>An organization meeting will be held Monday, April 16, at 8:30 P. M., in the clubhouse of the Swedish Engineering Society, 503 Wrightwood Avenue. Everybody is welcome. Those who are unable to be present may mail their membership <span class="page-break">3</span>fees to the treasurer, Reverend C. Bergendoff, 7352 Calumet Avenue.</p>
   <p>(Signed) The Organization Committee.</p>
