   <p>At 2 P.M. Saturday afternoon, December 7, the dying monarch regained consciousness for a few moments. When he opened his eyes, he recognized his family, and others present in the sickroom, and said: "God bless you all." The Queen then said to the King: "Yes, the Lord shall lead thee through. His grace is great." The King then agreed, saying: "Yes, His grace is great." The Queen whispered: "Jesus Christ, the blood of the Son of God, cleanses us from all our sins." The King then said: "Thanks, Jesus!" These words were King Oscar's last words.</p>

   <p>At 5:30 A.M. Sunday morning, December 8, the King's doctors, seeing the end was near, sent a message to the members of the Royal House to be present at the old King's deathbed, and when they arrived they found his old beloved Queen sitting close to the bed, with his hand enclosed in hers. A deep silence prevailed the deathroom. The majesty of death, and the dying majesty called for respect, which was not to be disturbed by soft lamentations. But shortly after 9 A.M. (3 P.M. Chicago time) the dying king made a faint move, the doctors rushed to his bedside, and then they pronounced him dead. The old dowager Queen then said a prayer which touched everybody's heart, and the touching drama was over.</p>
