   <p>The Swedish Methodist Episcopal Church, corner Oak and Market streets, whose erection was begun after the Great Fire in 1871, but delayed because of bad times, had been recently finished. This Summer it underwent thorough decoration, both inside and outside. The expenses connected with this work, $5,000, have been raised through donations. The congregation has placed an order with P. Colseth in Moline, for a large organ at a cost of $400, to be delivered about Christmas time. The women of the church have donated $400 for rugs.</p>
   <p>The pastor of the church, the Rev. D. S. Sorlin, has been working hard but successfully to get the church ready for services. The dedication night will be October 24, when one of the bishops, probably, will preach. The value of the property is $22,000.</p>
