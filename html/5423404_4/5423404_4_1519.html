   <p>The new Swedish Lutheran Salem Church on Portland Ave., between 28th and 29th Sts.,was solemnly dedicated last Sunday afternoon by Professors T.N. Hasselguist and O. Olsson. The choir, under the direction of Miss Selma Wretberg, sang. The erection of the building cost around $22,000. There are seats for 1,500 persons. The interior is beautiful. The altar picture (The Crucifixion) won general admiration. The pastor is the Rev. C.B.L.Boman. The church was packed to the doors on the occasion.</p>
