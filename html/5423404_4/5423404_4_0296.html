   <p>According to the latest dispatches from Sweden the strike is countrywide, and three hundred thousand workers are involved. Up to now little progress has been made toward a settlement.</p>
   <p>Financial aid to the strikers is pouring in from foreign countries.</p>
   <p>Chicago's workers also are coming to the aid of their brethren in Sweden. The Lake View Scandinavian Socialistic Club arranged a mass meeting last week, and similar meetings have been held in various parts of the city. Speakers urged their audiences to help the Swedish strikers.</p>
   <p>The first meeting was held last Tuesday in Clifton Hall in Lake View. A collection was taken up, which brought $55.88, and a greeting, expressing sympathy <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and encouragement, was cabled to the strikers. Last Thursday a meeting was held in Northwest Hall, and Saturday another was held in the Kensington Turner Hall. Tonight sympathizers will meet at the Orpheus Club, 1428 School Street.</p>
   <p>Subscription lists have been circulating all over the city, and it is hoped that members of Scandinavian trade unions will contribute generously.</p>
   <p>A committee of six, headed by Charles H. Sand of the Lake View Scandinavian Socialistic Club, is in charge of the campaign to obtain financial aid for the striking Swedes. John Down, of 2382 North Sacramento Avenue, is the committee's secretary.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian Socialist Aid Society voted at its meeting last Friday to give one hundred dollars to the strike aid fund, and it is expected that other Scandinavian Socialistic organizations in Chicago will follow this example.</p>
