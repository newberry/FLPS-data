   <p>Welfare stamps from Sweden, fifteen thousand of them, have been received at the Swedish vice-Consulate of Chicago. The funds to be raised by the sale of these stamps are to be used to conquer tuberculosis in Sweden. The anti-tuberculosis campaign has been in progress two years in our mother country, where this terrible disease has been increasing the number of victims every year for many years. Our countrymen, still living in the Fatherland, have done their best to stamp out tuberculosis. Their National Society is making an appeal to Swedish-Americans to help this cause by buying the welfare stamps, selling at one cent each. They are on sale at the office of the Chicago Swedish vice-Consulate, 142 Washington Street.</p>
