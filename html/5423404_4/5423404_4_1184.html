   <p>The Swedish Singing Society decided last Thursday to make a "singing trip" to Sweden shortly after the singing festival in New York, either the latter part of May, or in the early part of June 1910. Prof. John R. Ortengren was chosen the leader for this trip, assisted by a committee, consisting of Aug. Nordstrom and Edw. Molin of New York, Olaf Nilson of Chicago, Dr. Victor Nilsson of Minneapolis, and Gust. Sundelius, of Boston.  </p>
