   <p>The banquet held last Saturday by the Svithiod Singing club at the club house at Wrightwood Avenue turned out to be one of the best the club had ever arranged for a long time. About two hundred guests attended the feast. A delicate Swedish "smorgasbord" was served. Then the speeches began. Building contractor John E. Erikson acted as toastmaster, and presented John A. Sandgren, Grand Secretary of the Svithiod Lodge as the first speaker. He was followed by several others. The chorus sang during the evening, directed by Professor Joel Mossberg.</p>
