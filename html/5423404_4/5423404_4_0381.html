   <p>Carl Samuelson, 246 West Erie Street, and one of his friends had some time ago obtained a concession that permitted them to sell liquors at a dance hall on the Northwest Side. They had failed to pay the price of the concession, $12.50, and when the government agent called to collect, Samuelson refused to pay. His refusal resulted in his being held over for the grand jury under a $500 bond.</p>
