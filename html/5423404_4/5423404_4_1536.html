   <p>The well-known Swedish architect, John A. Nyden, has been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the construction division of the Quartermaster Corps of the United States Army. In case of mobilization, he will be stationed in Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>During the last war, Nyden served as major with the same group, and acted as controller during the construction of forty-five army hospitals, the total cost of which amounted to twenty-two million dollars. In this connection, it is worth mentioning that at a recent meeting in New York he was elected vice-president of the Construction Division Officers' Association, which has a membership of some fifteen hundred army officers who served in the World War.</p>
