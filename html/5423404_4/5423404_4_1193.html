   <p>Prof. John R. Ortengren arranged a concert at the Casino last Sunday night, the net profit of which was sent over to Sweden, as the contributions of the Swedes and Swedish-Americans of Chicago toward the fund for the erection of a statue of Gluntarnes Skald (the great composer Gunnar Wennerberg) at Upsala, Sweden. The concert was attended by some 3,000 persons and was very well arranged. A mixed choir, under the direction of Professor Ortengren, sang several of Wennerberg's compositions.</p>
