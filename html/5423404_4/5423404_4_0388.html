   <p>Former Superior Court clerk, John A. Linn, charged with embezzlement of at least $100,000, is now being examined by the Grand Jury. In last week's issue, we mentioned this case wherein it is charged that he embezzled money in several ways during his eight years incumbency of the office of Clerk of the Superior Court. This office is now held by Charles A. Vail, who succeeded Linn. The statement has been made that James J. Healy, who was chief clerk under Linn during his eight years in the office, and who was also dismissed when Vail took charge, gave out information to the Citizens Association. This information brought on the investigation and formal charge of embezzlement. His charges are based on what the association claims is irrevocable evidence of Linn's eight years of guilt. The charges are that many employes listed on the pay roll, during these eight years never had worked a day for the county, and in addition these names were fictitious.</p>
   <p>How extensively the charges are based on facts and whether or not they can <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be proved, will be decided by the thorough investigation started last Thursday by the Grand Jury. Appearances are that the Grand Jury will indict Linn as they have instructed Healy to draw up the legal forms necessary to have the case assigned to the proper court and Judge.</p>
   <p>One important movement has been brought on as a result of the Linn affair. Mr. Brundage, president of the Cook County Commission, has appointed a committee to see that financial records in every county office are thoroughly audited. The result of this extensive audit is only a question of time.</p>
