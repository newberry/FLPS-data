   <p>Editorial: The present year, 1884, is a presidential election year. The Republican candidate is James G. Blaine, who also is the Swede's choice, G. Cleveland is the Democratic candidate. The fight is a hard one and the Swedish Tribune is devoting its efforts toward Blaine's election.</p>
   <p>Native-born Americans are often heard complaining of the un-American sentiments entertained and expressed by some of the naturalized citizens in this country. They say, and the Swedish Tribune has on more than one occasion been tempted to repeat, that the social and political tendency of these foreigners is to establish a state within the state.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we really believe that the immigrants have no real desire or deliberate purpose to do so, nor do they have any intention of antagonizing what we may call the American idea. Many of the foreign-born voters are,in their political actions, blinded by wrong notions of their duties as Republican citizens. They have not had the time nor the opportunity to become acquainted with the true spirit of our institutions and the true aim of <span class="page-break">\2</span>enlightened democracy. Then add to this the fact that they are continually bothered by time-serving and demagogic politicians who lead the unenlightened ones astray by appeals to their passions and prejudices and you need not wonder at their apparent hostility to the principles every true American, whether native or foreign-born, holds dear.</p>
   <p>Neither is there reason to fear that the high pressure of our educational forces and political methods are not able eventually to transform all the now clashing notions and divergent views into common, clear and comprehensive ideas in line with the highest ideal of American citizenship.</p>
   <p>What we were about to say is that the foreign elements are, as a whole, more unanimously American than the natives themselves.</p>
   <p>Speaking for the three leading nationalities, the Scandinavians, the Germans, and the Irish, we are free to say that they, in whatever touches the honor and dignity of America, stand up for their adopted country, as against the states whence they have come. In this, they are perfect strangers to that <span class="page-break">\3</span>un-American or it would be more proper to say unmanly, and unwise conservatism prevalent among many of the native-born who boast of the ability to trace their lineage to the heroes of Bunker Hill and Lexington.</p>
   <p>This, if nothing else, demonstrates that we are no enemies to the republic, no masked friends of the government from which we have fled. The reason is clear. We are Republicans, or Democrats, if you prefer, from our own free and rational choice, while the natives are unconsciously born to the name. We have acquired the title. They have inherited it. We have learned the difference between the progressive republic and the effete monarchies by a living experience. They can contrast the two sides only theoretically. This explains the absence of all monarchical proclivities, as far as we are concerned. Is it not possible that this fact also accounts for the discernible difference between the sentiments that characterized the thirteen young colonies of 1776, and those advocated in high places now, when the starry flag waves proudly over thirty-eight great and well developed states?</p>
   <p>Be this as it may. The fact now is that the 500,000 Swedes living within the <span class="page-break">\4</span>United States have a presidential choice, and that choice is the man who is himself not afraid, and thinks that this mighty republic has no reason to be afraid of observing that degree of noble and natural independence, without which any state, be it ever so great in other respects, sinks into political nonentity among the nations of the world.</p>
   <p>For this, as well as for his ripe experience and consummate ability as a statesman generally, the Swedish-American citizens admire James G. Blaine. They look upon him as the best representative of the principles to which they have been undeviatingly attached. Ever since the foundation of the party he has served brilliantly and efficiently, whenever it needed courage in a crisis, or inspiration in an hour of doubt and indecision. They admire him for his grit and pluck. They admire him for his almost unequaled ability to grasp every public problem, and his equally quick and correct judgment about the best way of solving it. But their admiration for his foreign policy is especially high. They know him to be right in that, as in most other things. They want to see the country of their adoption, which they <span class="page-break">\5</span>love with patriotic favor, maintain its dignity in its dealings with other powers. They have to see this country submit to affronts from the European monarchies in the meek and lowly spirit that befits a fifth rate power, instead of one that stands first in peace, first in war, and first in the heart of every liberty-loving being in America. They know that America is great, and in its greatness sufficiently respectable, to dare to speak as it behooves a first class and progressive state without any risk or danger.</p>
   <p>But they are not bellicose. They have no foreign grievances to avenge, no alien ideas to propagate, no cause of European origin and nature to defend.</p>
   <p>Consequently, this government has no desire to invite the hostility of other nations. On the contrary, they are in favor of maintaining strict neutrality on every question not concerning the weatern continent, and they know that Mr. Blaine is the foremost exponent and defender of these aspirations and principles.</p>
   <p>They know, too, that he is averse to the undignified and almost cringing attitude the government at present assumes in its diplomatic dealings with other nations, and they want his policy to become the policy of the country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Nominate him, and they will rally with intense enthusiasm around the old flag. Defeat him for the third time, and many will interpret the act as an endorsement of the ridiculous idea that the fifty five millions now living in America have not a tenth part of the courage and common sense possessed by the five millions that achieved our liberty and founded our independence.</p>
