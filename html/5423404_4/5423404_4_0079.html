   <p>p.11...........The committee for the "Svithiod Day" festivals, celebrated last June at Good Templar Park, Geneva, held its last meeting in "High Noon Club," 1850 Michigan Avenue Saturday evening, when the final report was presented. Mr. Chas. E. Smith, who as president of the committee has taken many a heavy lift to make this affair a success was in the chair. It was already known that the monetary result was satisfactory, but that it would be overwhelming as the secretary Mr. Bernard Johnson's report stated, no one had ever hoped. Great was the rejoicing, when he announced the receipts to balance with $29,000.00, and the net proceeds to be $19,230.74 with a few small outstanding amounts still to be accounted for. Receipts and disbursements had been audited by a committee headed by Holger J. Rosberg, and on the recommendation of this committee, the report was accepted. The treasurer Mr. Fred Nelson was instructed to split the amount with one third, going to Svithiod's Old Peoples Homes and the remaining two thirds to be divided among the participating lodges, in proportion to the number of tickets each lodge had sold.</p>
