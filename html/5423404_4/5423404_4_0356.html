   <p>A concert is being arranged for Sunday, April 12, at the Svea Hall, corner of Chicago Avenue and Larrabee Street. The entire proceeds of this affair, which will wind up with a ball, will go to the widow of the late Axel Nahnfeldt, who was very popular in wide circles, but who left his wife and two small children in stressed financial circumstances. The Svea Society has donated the free use of its hall, and all the entertainers are donating their services. Among the artists on the program are Otto Palin, Christoffer Brusell and Leopold Svenson, and merely this circumstance is a guaranty of an enjoyable evening.</p>
