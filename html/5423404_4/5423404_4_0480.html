   <p>The well-known Swedish contractor, Sam Olson, has sold the Beach View Hotel, which was built by him, to a syndicate represented by Max Schubert, Joseph Goldberg, and Barney Fagel. The price is said to have been $575,000. As part payment, Olson took title to the property located on the northeast corner of Clark Street and York Place, and to the vacant lot at 723-27 Belmont Avenue. On this latter site he is planning to erect in the near future a large five-story hotel for bachelors at an estimated cost of $200,000. The drawings have already been completed by architect Paul Olsen.</p>
