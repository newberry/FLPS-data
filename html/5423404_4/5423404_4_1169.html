The newly elected president, Dr. Ernst J. Berg, professor at the electrical department at the University of Illinois, Urbana, Ill., delivered a very interesting address. His topic was: "The successful engineer." Attorney G. Bernhard Anderson spoke about "The old and the new homeland." The Swedish National Anthem "Du gamla du fria," and "America" were sung in unison.</p>
