   <p>Rev. Prof. Reck, from the same institution delivered a discourse in English, closing with an appeal for aid to rebuild this house of God. The Pastor then read an interesting historical sketch of the organization, during the reading of which a subscription and collection were taken.</p>
   <p>The congregation which was organized eighteen years ago with a few Swedish immigrants, had grown to be one of the largest Protestant congregation in the city. It consisted before the fire, of 1270 communicant members. Of 340 families embraced in this communion, 320 families were made homeless and reduced to poverty.</p>
