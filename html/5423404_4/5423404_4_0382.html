   <p>The stirring case of John A. Linn, former Clerk of the Superior Court of Cook County was finished on last Saturday. Linn pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to defraud Cook County of funds paid in through his office. Naturally, he was sentenced to imprisonment, and assessed a fine of $2,000. Complying with the request of the State's Attorney, Mr. Healey, the sentence was suspended for thirty days to give Linn an opportunity to reimburse the County.</p>
   <p>The prosecuting attorney states that on every charge under which Linn was indicted, the evidence obtained irrevocably proved his guilt, whereas the actual amount could not be determined until the auditors finished their task of auditing the books. Linn is free for thirty days under a $25,000 bond.</p>
   <p>Linn resigned on Saturday as Clerk of the Circuit Court. His resignation was submitted to Judge Honore, who yesterday called the other Circuit Judges into a conference for the purpose of appointing a successor to John A. Linn.</p>

   <p>This case has been followed very closely by the Chicago Swedish colony, Linn being a Swede.</p>
   <p>John A. Linn has been a prominent figure in political circles for many years, and when the twenty-six charges were hurled at him, after he had been trusted to the limit, the colony, other than his co-guilty friends, was thoroughly shocked.</p>
   <p>Linn was born in Kalmar, Sweden, in 1849, and arrived in Chicago with his parents when he was fourteen years of age. As a young man, he was very diligent in securing a thorough education. He served in the Police Department several years, during which time he gained a reputation which made it smooth sailing for him when running for office. Aside from his political career, he had a very good income from the undertaking business which he founded, and in which he still holds a controlling interest.</p>
