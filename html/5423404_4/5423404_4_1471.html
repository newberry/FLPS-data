   <p>A number of Swedish-Americans interested in the tenets of the Unitarians met last week at Wells Hall, 1631 North Clark Street, and organized a Swedish Unitarian congregation under the name of "The First Swedish Unitarian Congregation." Officers and a board of directors were elected, and Reverend August Dellgren, formerly the minister of the Swedish Unitarian Congregation in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was called to become the leader of the new congregation. Reverend Dellgren accepted the call. Meetings will be held, until further notice, every Sunday forenoon at Wells Hall, 1631 North Clark Street. The public is invited to attend.</p>
