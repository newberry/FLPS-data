   <p>A vigorous campaign for the purpose of securing five hundred more life members for the Swedish Home for the Aged was opened May 31 under the direction of Albert Swanson, president of the campaign committee, and the work is progressing in a successful manner.</p>
   <p>The present members number about five hundred, and the majority of them are active in this drive in behalf of the Home. Their goal is five hundred new members in the League and $25,000 for the fund. This sum is needed in order to make the future of the Home secure. They are striving to reach this goal before the great summer meeting which is planned to take place at the Home in Evanston.</p>
   <p>Willing and aggressive campaigners are needed, and when one of them calls at your home, store, office, or other place of work, inviting you to sign up for a life membership which costs fifty dollars, be generous and take those fifty dollars that are lying useless in the bank, under the mattress or wherever they are, and put them to work for a good cause.</p>
   <p>Take out a life membership! If you should be overlooked by the volunteer campaigners, do not let that stop you. Show that your heart is in the right place, and ask Edward L. Jarl, cashier in the savings department of the State Bank of Chicago and also treasurer for the Campaign Committee, for an application blank. We assure you that you will not be turned down.</p>
