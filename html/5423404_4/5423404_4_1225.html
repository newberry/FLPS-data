   <p>The Swedish Glee Club's Bohemian Night, Saturday evening, April 1, was an affair of riotous gaiety from beginning to end, and original throughout. The keen enjoyment and appreciation evidenced were due both to the program itself and to its execution. The fact that the day was April first also contributed to the success of the entertainment. An excellent supper was served late in the evening, and afterwards there was dancing until the small hours of the morning.</p>
