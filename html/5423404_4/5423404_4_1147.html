   <p>Last Sunday, at Elliotts Park, the Swedish National Association's Midsummer Feast was very successful and attended by some 20,000 persons. The weather was fine, and so was the music and songs presented by a music corps, and the National Chorus. But the greatest attraction on the program was the appearance of His Excellency, A. O. Eberhardt, Governor of Minnesota, who arrived with a special train from St. Paul to Chicago to participate in the feast as the main speaker. This famous and popular Swede does not need any introduction. He is well-known. He won the hearts of his hearers again with his interesting and sympathetic address, which he delivered partly in Swedish and partly in English. He was rewarded with prolonged applauses, which never seemed to cease. The Governor was unanimously elected as an honorary member of the National Association.</p>
