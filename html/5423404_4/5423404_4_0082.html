   <p>The Swedish Old People's Home in Evanston greeted two welcome guests last Sunday, namely: Mr. Folke Anderson, the operatic star from Stockholm, and our own Mrs. Ida Anderson-Werner, amateur actress and recitalist. Mr. Anderson sang a group of old Swedish folk songs that carried the aged men and women in memories back to their home shores in the Old Country and made them re-live the days of their youth. Mrs. Anderson-Werner's recitals were in the sentimental as well as in the comical veins. A lovely time was had by all.</p>
