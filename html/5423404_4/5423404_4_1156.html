   <p>This club celebrated its twenty-fifth jubilee anniversary last Saturday at its hall, 1258 La Salle Street. The feast was a huge success. The banquet started at 8 P.M. when a splendid "smorgasbord" was served in the dining-room. The festival dinner was then served in the large reception hall at fifty small tables. Director C. S. Peterson, the president of the Swedish Club, acted as toastmaster. Addresses were given by consul Henry S. Henschen, director August Lindberg, Mr. Bernard Anderson, actor Elis Olson, editor Frithiof Malmquist, and attorney Carl R. Chindblom. Dr. Larson from Crystal Falls, Michigan, spoke about the deceased members of the Glee Club. Several speakers thanked the leader Director William Dahlen for his splendid work to promote good song, especially as the leader of the Glee Club. Mr. Dahlen responded with a brief speech and sang the tenor solo in "Torpflickan" and "I Rosens Doft." Mr. N. W. Anthony also sang. The singing of the Swedish folksong "Dugamladufria" ended the pleasant banquet, and then the dancing started.</p>
