   <p>Editorial: The December number of the "North American Review" contains an article by Prof. H.H.Boyesen on "The Scandinavians in the United States." The writer claims that in the great cities the Scandinavians rapidly become Americanized, though they have their own musical, athletic and social organizations. In Chicago where they number at least 150,000, and in Minneapolis and St.Paul, where they are numerous, they naturally play a considerable part in politics, which would be a far greater one if they were not so addicted to jealousies and internal dissensions.</p>
   <p>"The Norwegians are jealous of the Swedes,..(and vice versa), and the Danes of both." They take naturally to politics, having had no small share in the formation of popular opinion in criticism of the government at home, but have not learned party discipline nor the faculty of asserting themselves as a unit. Perhaps <span class="page-break">2</span>from the American point of view this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret. For we have already an overwhelming abundance of alien nationalities that have the insolence to ask recognition, not as leaders of American citizens, but as Irish, Bohemians, and Poles, as if in that capacity they had any right to participation in the government of the American Republic. The Scandinavian element in the United States is overwhelmingly Republican, partly because a large majority of the old settlers participated in the war and the newer arrivals take their tone from them, but also because they dislike the Irish, all of whom they regard as Democrats. This antipathy is so deeply rooted that, "if the Republicans should succeed in detaching the Irish in large numbers from their first allegiance they must be prepared for a large loss of Scandinavian voters in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The Norseman and Celt will never pull together, and can scarcely be gathered into one political fold." In the rural districts the people are still intensely clannish. Each new arrival is attracted to the spot <span class="page-break">3</span>where he has friends or kinsmen. After he has gained a little money his first desire is to draw friends and kinsmen around him. As soon as this settlement thus formed is strong enough it sends for a Norwegian Lutheran clergyman and a schoolmaster, and without any hostile intent the church and school-house are the centers of efforts to isolate the new community from the influences of other nationalities. The old Norse speech is corrupted by the introduction of a kind of hybrid-English. Terminologies that are not recognizable as a part of the language of the church, school and daily speech creep into the people's linguistic expression.</p>
   <p>The Parson, too, knowing his influence will endure only as long as he can exclude American ideas; loses no time nor opportunity in warning his flock of the dangers that threaten those who go in search of strange gods. And some of these clergymen have spent twenty or thirty years in the United States without acquiring any more knowledge of American life than if they had stayed quietly at home. They may <span class="page-break">4</span>have collected superficial half truths and shallow generalizations in abundance, but their point of view remained stubbornly alien and hostile.</p>
   <p>This state of things is to be deplored, but scarcely to be wondered at when it is considered that"native Americans are not in the habit of welcoming the immigrant with cordiality; and they have often good reason for regarding him with eyes not altogether friendly." The Scandinavians are not alone in this respect. After the lapse of a hundred years the Pennsylvania Dutch, still speak a German dialect, and the Dutch settlement in Wisconsin and those of the Mennonites in Pennsylvania and Ohio, though of more recent origin, have succeeded as completely in preserving their alien identity.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians in the country districts have done this less completely, while many of the city descendants of Norse settlers speak English as their native tongue, and have forgotten the Norwegian if they ever learned it. The writer thinks the <span class="page-break">5</span>rapidity with which these have adopted American speech and mode of life indicates that the problem of the assimilation of the immigrant may safely be left to time, without interference of artificial agencies. He does not believe that the Scandinavian or any other nationality is strong enough to remain permanently alien in our midst; though they are surely able to resist for a whole generation the influence of our national life and make the process of assimilation a difficult one for their children.</p>
   <p>The total Scandinavian population of this country in 1880 comprised 440,262 actual immigrants. About as many have arrived since, so that making allowance for deaths the number cannot be far from 750,000. It has been estimated that 900,000, and perhaps another 900,000 may be added for descendants who are ethnologically Scandinavians, though many of them may be American in sentiment. The writer adds that the process of assimilation of the heterogeneous foreign elements in our population is similar to that in process in England from the eleventh to the fourteenth century.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>During the period the Saxon, the Norseman, the Dane, and the Celt were gradually transformed into Englishmen. Saxon and Norman hated each other as long as each could be plainly distinguished as native or alien. The same confusion and strife, mitigated by the influences of a later civilization, may be looked for here while we have to grind alien grain in the national hopper. But the homogeneous nationality that will issue forth from that process will justify the turmoil and noise and discomfort of the grinding.</p>
