   <p>The Swedish National Society held its midwinter festival at the Auditorium last Sunday night, and the large place was filled to overflowing. The most prominent attraction on the program was the National dancers from Skansen, Stockholm, Sweden, and the Swedish Ladies' Quartet. A Polish singer and a German chorus also appeared on the program. The income from the festival goes to charity, among needy Swedish countrymen.</p>
