   <p>The Home received thousands of visitors last Sunday, who greeted the old residents of the Home. The weather was fine. Attorney Nels H. Olson, president of the board of directors of the Home, and Consul Bernard G. Anderson delivered appropriate addresses. The Swedish National Music Corps presented a good program and so did a Swedish chorus of fifty voices. Refreshments were served the visitors and it was estimated that about 4,000 persons attended the affair.</p>
