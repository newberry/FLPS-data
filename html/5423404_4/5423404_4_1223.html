   <p>The Iduna Singing Club has arranged a very pleasant festival to be held in Lundquist's Pavillion, corner of Morgan and 61st Streets, on May 11, 12, and 13. A new program will be offered every evening and it will be followed by dancing. Iduna calls the festival "Three Evenings in a Palm Grove," and we suppose that the pavillion will be decorated to resemble a palm grove for the occasion rather than a dance hall.</p>
