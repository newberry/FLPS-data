   <p>On April 3, at its last meeting, the Chicago Central Aid Committee decided to abandon the work of collecting money for the relief of the suffering in Norrland, Sweden. Those holding subscription lists are requested to send them to Mr. John R. Lindgren, State Bank of Chicago,at once in order that the Committee may be able to present to the public a complete and final report at the next meeting of the Committee, scheduled for Friday,April 17.....to which meeting the public is invited. In order to get a fairly complete report of the gifts collected from all over United States for the needy in Norrland, the Committee requests the aid committees in other places to forward reports of the amounts gathered to the Chicago Committee. Since such a report would be of great public interest, we hope that our request for these reports will meet with a favorable response.</p>
   <p>On behalf of the Central Aid Committee,</p>
   <p>Robert Lindblom, president,</p>
   <p>Othelia Myhrman, corresponding secretary.</p>
