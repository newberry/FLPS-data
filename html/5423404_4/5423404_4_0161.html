   <p>Last Sunday afternoon a few hundred of our countrymen went to Park Ridge to visit the Swedish Old People's Home.</p>
   <p>This institution has a beautiful setting, with green woods and terraced lawns. Its rooms are furnished to suit their size and shape. The Ladies' Guild of the Swedish Central Union donated the tract where the Home was built. The rest was furnished by the Svithiod Lodge No. 1, the Swedish-American Women's Club, the Ingeborg, and the Vega.</p>
   <p>The gifts were presented by Hjalmar Heden, from Svithiod Lodge No 1., Attorney G. Bernhard Anderson, from Ingeborg; and Othelia Myhrman, from the Women's Club. The gifts were received by Hans Anderson, chairman and director of the Home.</p>
   <p>Although the Home will not be open until October, Johan Peter Hult, 82, <span class="page-break">2</span>is already living in it. His countenance shines with joy in anticipation of the opening. Harry Hanson, owner of a plant nursery in Rosehill, has beautified the lawns of the Home for the occasion. May much good come from this noble undertaking.</p>
