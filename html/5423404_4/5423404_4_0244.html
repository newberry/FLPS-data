   <p>The Swedish National Association held its monthly meeting November 24, and reports showed that since the previous meeting the Association has donated six hundred dollars in cash to needy families and individuals. Mrs. Andrietta Wolt, chairman of the chairty committee, reported that she had provided clothing and meal tickets for some of those in need, and families with small children were given milk and other food and three hundred and seventy dollars was given for rents.</p>
   <p>It was voted to appropriate six hundred dollars from the Association's treasury, for additional aid to unemployed and others who are in need. This appropriation was made possible by the profit derived from the bazaar which the Association, in partnership with the Nordstjernan Singing Club, recently held in Belmont Hall. It netted the two organizations six hundred dollars each. The Association expressed its gratitude to the singers and their ladies for their friendly cooperation on <span class="page-break">\2</span>that occasion.</p>
   <p>The meeting also voted to send a consumptive Swedish youth to the sanitarium in Denver, Colorado. Admission has been obtained for him through the assistance of Dr. Julius Lincoln, and the Association will pay the young man's traveling expenses. Mrs. Wolt and the ladies' auxiliary have also arranged for the return to Sweden of another sick person.</p>
   <p>The Association has now opened an office at 3180 North Clark Street, where Mrs. Wolt may be seen every day and from which food and clothing will be distributed.</p>
   <p>At the meeting it was further decided to serve meals for the unemployed in cooperation with Lake View's Swedish Salvation Army corps. Gifts of food and clothing will be received at the new Clark Street office. Winter <span class="page-break">\3</span>coats and underwear are most needed.</p>
