   <p>In compliance with the regulations of the immigration law of 1924, a commission consisting of representatives from the Departments of State, Labor, and Commerce, undertook the task of studying the data pertaining to the national origins of the American people. These data had been collected by a committee of experts, and it was on them that the immigration quota of foreign nations was to be based.</p>
   <p>The commission reported that the statistical material which had been gathered was of such a nature that they were not suitable as a basis for practical immigration legislation. The majority of the Immigration Committee was of the same opinion, and seemed to be willing to have the law declared void, but a strong minority was opposed, and the result was that <span class="page-break">\2</span>the date on which the law was to become effective was postponed, first for one year and then for one more. This was done in spite of the Committee's declaration that even at the end of this period the same uncertainties and difficulties would surely persist in regard to the feasibility of basing immigration quotas on national origins.</p>
   <p>There seemed to be agreement within the Committee that the difficulties involved were real, and impartial experts who have studied the problem also agree that the law is not only impractical but unfair. And one does not have to be an expert to see that. According to the most dependable authorities, no reliable statistics on immigration for the first two hundred years of the existence of this nation are available. Not until 1819 did Congress pass a law requiring that captains of ships arriving from foreign countries submit a passenger list. Such lists might have been helpful at the present time, but they were all destroyed in a fire on Ellis Island in 1896, and it was not until the early nineties that systematic records were kept of persons <span class="page-break">\3</span>arriving here from overseas. It was then that the Immigration Bureau was established.</p>
   <p>Present immigration quotas cannot, of course, be based on nonexistent statistics. But in 1906, Congress passed a law requiring the census chief to prepare a list of all persons who were included in the census of 1790. It was then discovered that, during the occupation of Washington, D. C. in 1812, the files covering the states of Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, Tennessee, and Virginia had been destroyed by the British. But in 1907 a subordinate in the Census Bureau had prepared a list, not only based on incomplete census reports but also determining people's nationalities by their names, even though it is well known that a great many foreign names have been Americanized.</p>
   <p>On such artificial data as these, then has the committee of experts based <span class="page-break">\4</span>its calculations. And it has been definitely ascertained that no reliable data exist which cover the required period of time. In the census of 1850, a person's birthplace was recorded, but not that of his parents. The first really complete data were recorded in the 1890 census. As for the years preceding 1790, the committee seems to think that the people who came to this country during that period were not immigrants. If not, what, then, were the Swedes who settled in New Sweden?</p>
   <p>We repeat that one does not have to be an expert to realize that this proposed law is based on falsities, and is therefore not only impractical but actually unjust. Still there are those who would put it into effect next July 1. We therefore urge our readers to write or wire their Representatives in Congress, asking them to do their utmost to prevent this proposal from becoming law.</p>
