   <p>A mass meeting of Swedish workers was held on Sunday at Voltz Hall, 187 East Chicago Avenue, for the purpose of raising money to aid the 20,000 iron and steel workers in Sweden who are under lockout, thereby deprived of their earning powers. In addition, about 80,000 people are affected by the lockout, and now find themselves in a miserable condition, financially. It was decided at the meeting that contribution lists be placed at Ragnar Thorell, 187 East Chicago Avenue, and with the secretary of the meeting, Ch. Molmstrom, 135 Oak Street.
