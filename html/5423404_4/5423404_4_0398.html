   <p>Charles H. Johnson, a Swedish laborer, the other day went into Bartholdy's hardware store at 240 W. Chicago, Avenue and asked the woman behind the counter for some money. When he was refused, he grabbed hold of a large tin kettle and walked out with it. Upon being arrested he said that he had stolen for the purpose of being sent to Bridewell, where he would get food. He had not worked for four months and was starving.</p>
