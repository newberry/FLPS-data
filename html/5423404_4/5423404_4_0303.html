   <p>It is authentically reported that prominent, sincere people, who are interested in the activity of our Juvenile Court, refuse to accept a donation of five million dollars by John D. Rockefeller, with which to accomplish much more in redeeming the stray youngsters who are placed under their jurisdiction.</p>
   <p>Rockefeller's money is tainted and the result of the most disgusting muckraking ever praticed in America and is unfit to be used for such a laudable purpose as that of the Juvenile Court.</p>
   <p>Their judgment as to the condition of this money may be right but their decision regarding its use for humanity presents to us our example of a group with good intentions, though they are too narrow-minded for their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>own good and for the good of the young delinquents.</p>
   <p>Take it for granted that Rockefeller expects to purchase admission to the heavenly castles by making large donations to groups, doing a morals reclaiming job. It may be that his conscience is really bothering him, even condemning him, for his selfish, illegal methods. His knowledge of his own criminality urges him to do good deeds; his money, on one side of the scales of justice will, in his judgment, outweigh his evils and shortcomings.</p>
   <p>We expect the most beautiful flowers to grow on piles of fertilizer, but we leave it to a few true men and women to handle the problem that requires unlimited funds and unlimited effort to find a real solution.</p>
   <p>Let us suppose that the Rockefeller donation would make possible the redemption of a few wandering boys and girls; that cigarette making loafers, ready to cross the prison threshold, may be converted to model young men.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>This can be done wherever the effort is able to materialize by sufficient funds. Let Rockefeller's tainted millions or a saint's mite be used to reach the selected.</p>
   <p>Let us be sensible. Let us hope that a powerful influence, conscience, or conversion, may force John D. Rockefeller to become a real, cleansed enthusiastic philanthropist of the purest type. His money can succeed in concluding a good fight for morality and honesty.</p>
