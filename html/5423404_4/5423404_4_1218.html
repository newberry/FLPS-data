   <p>The Scandinavian Socialist Club held a social last Saturday evening at Phoenix Hall, and those who appeared in the program had the pleasure of speaking, singing, or playing, to a full house. Strure's Orchestra opened the social with a musical number, after which Mrs. Forberg gave a vigorous, straight forward speech. She treated her subject very capably, and the lively applause which rewarded her gave evidence that the people appreciated her speech. The Harmony Club sang "Annie Laurie," and "Inga Lill". The young and able violinist, Folke Gilbert's enjoyable presentation also won strong favor as did Rinaldos, the comedian.</p>
