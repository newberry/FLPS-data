   <p>On Saturday last, our compatriot, John Nordgren, accused and sentenced for the murder of his wife, was refused a new trial by Judge Chetlain, for reasons known only to the judge. The Swedish National Association, which has taken up the cudgels in behalf of Nordgren, has,however, taken steps, through its attorney,to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, in order to obtain a new trial for Nordgren.</p>
