   <p>On next Thursday, the Swedes will have their day at White City. The board of directors for this splendid place of entertainment have set aside this day for the benefit of the Swedes in Chicago. Free admission is offered to all members of Swedish societies, provided that the secretaries of such societies make application to Mr. Woodward. If the secretaries should forget to make the requisite application, the tickets may yet be had free, by members of Swedish societies, if they present their badges at the entrance. The tickets are good for the whole afternoon and the evening. Mothers should use this occasion to go with their children to the White City in the afternoon, making arrangements for their husbands to come in the evenings, when the struggle of the day is past. Music, fireworks, and a circus are listed as free on the program. White City is located at 63rd Street and South Park Avenue, and it is the foremost place of entertainment in Chicago.</p>
