   <p>The Scandinavian Socialist Club on the North Side held a meeting last Tuesday in Clifton Hall, for the purpose of discussing ways and means of aiding the striking workers in Sweden, and in spite of the heat the hall was filled to capacity. A collection was taken up which netted thirty-five dollars.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sand made the introductory speech in which he discussed the background of the economic struggle which is now going on in Sweden and other European countries. Miss Anna S. Swanson, editor of Fylgia, described the events which led up to the strike, and praised the Swedish workers who are now fighting for better living conditions. The audience, which consisted mostly of Swedish men and women, applauded heartily.</p>
