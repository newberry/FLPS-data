   <p>At 918 Winona Street, just east of Sheridan Road and near the lake, construction has started on an apartment building which will have one unusual feature. The building, which will be six stories high and will contain forty-eight apartments, will be equipped with a roof garden, like those on the roofs of the city's large, modern hotels. The building will be named the Winona Beach Apartments, and it is estimated to cost $400,000. The Admiral Hotel is located a short distance away. Architect John A. Nyden has delivered the plans for both these buildings. They are owned by him and Albin Nilsson.</p>
   <p>During the first seven months of this year, the building commissioner's office has issued building permits representing one hundred and ten million dollars' worth of construction work, on double the amount for the corresponding period last year. Among the latest permits are the following:</p>
