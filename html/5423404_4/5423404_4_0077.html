   <p>p.18. Pastor John P. Miller, who, on the 11th was honored by being appointed Superintendent of the Swedish Societies' magnificent Old Peoples Home in Evanston is a man well-known in wide circles in Chicago, and has during a long, useful life as business-man, editor and minister made a host of friends who are glad to welcome him into his new field of endeavor.</p>
   <p>Pastor Miller resigned Wednesday from his position as Pastor of Elim Swedish M.E. Church in Lake View, where he is certain to be missed.</p>
   <p>The Old Peoples Home's new Superintendent was born in Ostergotland, September 4, 1866. He has spent most of his life in America, but he is no less Swedish on that account. He graduated from the Theological Seminary in Evanston in 1892 and studied later at Knox College in Galesburg, till he in 1920 became a pastor in the Methodist Church; later on he became business manager and associate of the magazine Sandebudet here. The Methodist Church chose him later as chief of its Public Book Concern while he maintained his association with Sandebudet. Two years ago he accepted the call as pastor of the "Elim" congregation.</p>
