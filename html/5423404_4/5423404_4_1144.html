   <p>The Svithiod Singing Club opened the winter season with a grand banquet at the club with about two hundred persons present. Mr. Sigge Franson acted as master of ceremonies. Addresses were made by attorneys Olof J. Olson and Alfred A. Norton, Leon Hornstein and others. The club's own chorus was very generous with songs by presenting a complete concert program. The gathering continued after supper until the early morning hours!</p>
