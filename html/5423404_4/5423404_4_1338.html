   <p>Thus the longings of the Scandinavians find their expression every year at the approach of the Christmas season. The custom of celebrating this festival among relatives and friends in the old country is gaining wider acceptance every year among our Scandinavians of the far West, and one may notice crowds of Scandinavians preparing for the Christmas trip to Europe every fall. If one visits the steamship office at Kinzie Street, Chicago, one may observe thousands of trunks, and a mass of passengers ready for their Christmas trip. Great excursions have been arranged, according to advertisements..... They are scheduled to take place by way of the great speedy new ships of the Scandinavian-American Line, "Oscar II" and "Hellig Olav".....</p>
