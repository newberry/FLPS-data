   <p>For the benefit of the Swedish Home for the Aged in Evanston a great concert is being planned to be given at Orchestra Hall, November 11. The popular governor of Colorado, Carlson is to be present as a guest, and he will probably deliver a speech. The special objective of the present concert and the drive for money of which it is a part, is to pay for a stretch of land which was recently bought for the home. Our friend of the home has offered to contribute $500.00, if money can be provided to pay for the land in full. Swedes are urged to come to the concert, also, in order to help pay this debt.</p>
