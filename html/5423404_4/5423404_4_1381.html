   <p>The Illinois Grand Lodge of I.O.G.T. held its annual convention last week. As far as the Swedish lodges of Chicago were concerned, they were ably represented and succeeded in getting their request for the organization of a Swedish district lodge. Moreover, our countryman F. L. Malmstedt, of Chicago, was elected a delegate to the World Temperance Conference that is to take place here in Chicago in June,1893.</p>
