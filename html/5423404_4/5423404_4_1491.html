   <p>This week, representatives of nine hundred Swedish Lutheran congregations will meet in convention. They represent a membership of about two hundred thousand, a half-dozen schools with a student body of about two thousand, a half-dozen orphanages, a half-dozen hospitals and other charitable institutions, etc.</p>
   <p>They will assemble in a sanctuary which is worth close to one hundred thousand dollars, where an American-born Swede preaches each Sunday in classical Swedish. In view of all this, it is difficult to understand why it is that some people in Sweden wonder whether we value Swedish culture.</p>
