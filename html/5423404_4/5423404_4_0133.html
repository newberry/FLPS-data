   <p>The Old People's Home in Park Ridge has become too small, so a cornerstone for a new one was laid last Saturday afternoon, June 12, in North Evanston. It had rained in the forenoon, the sky was rather cloudy when a crowd of interested spectators gathered at Crown Street and Evanston Avenue, the location for the ceremonies. In the foreground stood the architect for the new building, John A. Sandgren, who laid the cornerstone. The Home is being built through donations from forty-two Swedish societies in Cook County, and the cost will be $33,000. Mr. Sandgren placed historical documents of the Swedish Old People's Home Association inside the cornerstone. The leading Swedish and American newspapers that sent their reporters to the ceremony were given copies of these documents. Alfred A. Norton, chairman of the building committee, <span class="page-break">\2</span>then gave a speech. Rev. C. A. Nybladh of Englewood's Swedish Emmanuel Church presided at the ceremonies and gave a very appropriate talk. County Commissioner Carl R. Chindblom also voiced his compliments to them for being able to fulfill the plans for the Old People's Home. C. S. Norman later spoke, pointing out this splendid tribute to the old people in their time of trials and tribulations. The ceremonies came to a conclusion with Mr. Sandgren's wish that many old people will seek admission to the Home when it is completed this fall.</p>
