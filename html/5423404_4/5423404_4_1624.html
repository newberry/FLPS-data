   <p>As reported last week, the Immigration Committee of the House of Representatives is currently considering several proposals for a new immigration law to replace the temporary act that is now in operation. Among the proposals submitted is one which already has the support of President Harding. It provides that all aliens in this country be required to report to the authorities at certain intervals, so that the latter will always know where these noncitizens are and what they are doing. This procedure will also make it easier to check on the progress which they are making in absorbing American ideals".</p>
   <p>It may be assumed that the primary purpose of such a law is to encourage immigrants to become American citizens as quickly as possible--a purpose which is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>entirely proper and laudable. How the law would operate in practice, and whether the disadvantages accruing from it would outweigh the advantages, is another question. Of all civilized countries, America has the least detailed statistical information about its own citizens. This is one of the reasons for the many irregularities which occur at elections and other important public functions.</p>
   <p>During the war the draft became a very complicated undertaking and many errors were made. In the light of that experience one can get a pretty good idea of the confusion which would arise if all those who have not wanted citizenship, or who for some reason or other have neglected or have been unable to obtain it, should be required by law to report to certain officials at definite times and submit to questioning in regard to their activities, their plans, their thoughts, and their feelings. The picture is not an attractive one, even if one does not take into account that many errors and injustices which would <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>undoubtedly be made as a result of misunderstandings and differences of opinion.</p>
   <p>A psychological element is also involved. Would it be the purpose of such a law practically to force aliens into citizenship, or would it allow them freedom of choice, as has heretofore been the case? It should be unnecessary to argue which of these two courses is the more desirable.</p>
   <p>Admittedly, the United States has among its native-born population a larger number of criminals and individuals with criminal tendencies than any other country on earth. This element will supposedly enjoy its accustomed freedom from interference, while many an honorable and law-abiding immigrant will have to report to the police or to the Federal authorities at designated times. A situation of this kind will lead the majority of immigrants who have not yet become citizens to the conclusion that they are being discriminated against, and it is certainly not conducive to inculcating in them the love they ought to have for their adopted country, which has invited them to become citizens.</p>
   <p>American ideals cannot be instilled into the mind of the immigrant by force, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and he will not become a good Republican or a good Democrat by being forced to submit to periodical "once-overs" by some board or other authority. And as for "American ideals," they are no different from the ideals which immigrants have always brought with them, from the earliest days up to the present time. Our southeastern states were originally populated by exiled criminals from England, and their ideals are reflected in the practice of lynching and in the activities of the Ku Kluxers of today. The states of the Northwest have been populated by immigrants who come here of their own free will, and their ideals are reflected in honesty and respect for the law. We wonder which of these two sets of ideals will be promoted by the proposed compulsory registration law.</p>
