   <p>It is the intention of the Order of Svithiod to erect a building in the near future where meetings may be held. There is already $4,000 in the building fund, and it is expected that this sum will be increased considerably by the anticipated income from a proposed outing to be held Sunday, August 3 at Alton Park. The affair will be supported by ten branch lodges of the Order.</p>
