   <p>When Jenny Lind, "The Swedish Nightingale", visited America and Chicago about seventy-five years ago, she donated the sum of $1,500--a large sum at that time--to the Swedish St. Ansgarius Episcopal Church, which in those days was located at Illinois and Franklin streets. Later the congregation was dissolved, only to be revived again, and at this time the congregation numbers 175 members under the guidance of Pastor W. Blomquist.</p>
   <p>The once discarded hopes of building a new church have long been re-awakened and just recently assumed concrete form. A building site for the new church has been purchased at the corner of Maplewood and Thorndale Avenues, and the congregation possesses a cash sum of $6,000 as an initial fund for the new church, which, according to plans drawn, will cost approximately $50,000.</p>
