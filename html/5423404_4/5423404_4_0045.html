   <p>A welfare concert was given by the newly organized Lake View Hospital Aid Society at Belmont Hall on Saturday March 3. The attendance, which was large, exceeded our expectations. The hall was crowded even before the first number on the program was presented. It being the Society's first public affair, it was indeed surprising to see such a large and appreciative audience. The membership of this Society is over seventy, and many others have agreed to join. The prospects for a large and active group are encouraging.</p>
   <p>The program was opened with a well-performed piano solo by Benjamin Peterson, which was followed by offerings of several outstanding artists in a well-arranged order. Reverend Hagstrom spoke of the necessity of the Swedish Hospital and an efficient aid group to take care of financing the welfare work of the Lake View institution. Dr. J. A. Enander gave a very interesting talk about the work at the hospital, and acknowledged the help available through the Aid Society.</p>

   <p>Following the speakers, the Mozart Quartette sang several enjoyable songs, and Miss Frida Ecklund won the audience with a beautiful soprano solo. A violin solo by Karin Lindskog drew the limit of applause as usual.</p>
