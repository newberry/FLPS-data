   <p>The Swedish Glee Club concluded its winter season last Tuesday at the Swedish Club on La Salle Avenue. Not only did all the active members of the Glee Club attend this gathering, but also many members of the Swedish Club. Prof. Carl Lonnerblad acted as toastmaster. A real "Smorgasbord" was served. The toastmaster spoke, and presented to the leader of the Glee Club, Prof. William Dahlen, a gift of $100 in gold, as a token of appreciation for his good work for the club.</p>
   <p>An invitation from the Swedish Singing Society in Sweden urging us to participate in a singing festival in connection with the Olympics at Stockholm next year was read. The Glee Club decided to send a delegation over there to represent the Club.</p>
