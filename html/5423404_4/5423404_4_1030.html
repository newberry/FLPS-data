   <p>The Swedish Trivune reprints the following remarks from an editorial of the New York paper "Nordstjernan:"</p>
   <p>"The Influence of the Swedes in America is an old song. We have heard it sung for thirty or forty years, but it has become tiresome, especially when it is an effort to win the sympathy of the Swedes or their votes.</p>
   <p>It seems impossible for certain persons to conceive the idea that the Swede in America is, and must be American. He doesn't need to condemn old Sweden. He can when alone, or in the company of others, let America understand what the sons of old Sweden are able to do in the fields of science, art and education. Take for example what our singers did in Chicago recently.</p>
   <p>Their appearance had more influence than a dozen political mass meetings. Such influence does impress the real worth of the Swedes upon the nation much more <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>than does the fact that a dozen Swedes obtained jobs as policemen in Chicago or Minneapolis.</p>
   <p>It is not with the police club in hand that the Swede is going to win respect and a reputation in this country. He is one of the quiet persons in the land. That is his glory. It is not his task to contend with the Irishmen for glory. He is not a fist-fighter, or ball player, or race rioter.</p>
   <p>The Swede is satisfied with less showy, but more useful accomplishments.</p>
   <p>He did not come here to rule America. He came here to better his position through honest work. It is an honor for the Swedes that so few of them apply for office work. Let the Swede go his even, quiet way and take care of his work and his business. He likes that best.</p>
