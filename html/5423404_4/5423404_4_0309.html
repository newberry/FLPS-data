   <p>We are pleased to announce to our generous countrymen in Chicago (Swedes) that the campaign for the aid of the stricken San Franciscans (among which there are five thousand Swedes) is going over the top. The total amount, now accounted for by the "Committee of Five Hundred," is $900,000, and we are confident that the allotted million will be raised. So, send your contributions without delay.</p>
