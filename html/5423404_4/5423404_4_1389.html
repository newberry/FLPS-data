   <p>Next Sunday, September 28, will be a memorable day in the history of the Albany Park Lutheran congregation, for on that date its new church, located on the corner of Spaulding and Thorndale Avenues, will be dedicated.</p>
   <p>The program will start at 3 P.M. when the building committee, headed by Dr. G. R. Freedlund and the architect, Robert C. Ostergren, will officially present the church to the congregation.</p>
   <p>Building plans for the new temple were prepared by Architect Robert Oestergren, and its cost as it now stands, is $85,000. It ordinarily seats 400 people and this number can be increased to 600 by moving a removable wall.</p>

   <p>The artist, Emile Zoir, donated three fine religious paintings last winter, and they have been placed in the church. The exterior of the church is of varicolored brick and presents an attractive appearance.</p>
   <p>The present pastor is Herbert W. Linden who, in 1922, succeeded the founder of the congregation, Dr. Philip Andreen.</p>
   <p>Dr. Peter Peterson, president of the Illinois Conference, will deliver the dedication address.</p>
