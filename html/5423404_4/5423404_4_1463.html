   <p>At the Svenska Evangeliska Lutherska Trefaldighets Kyrkan (the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Trinity Church) at Barry and Seminary Avenues, on Thursday, September 18, Dr. John A. Enander was honored for his outstanding services to the church. Reverend Gottfried Nelson, pastor of the church, delivered the welcome address after which a very good program of instrumental and vocal solos was presented. As a token of appreciation for his work in the church Dr. Enander was presented a fine gold watch and chain. Dr. Enander thanked the congregation for the honor shown him and the token presented and gave them a concise review of his trip to Sweden, promising to deliver a full lecture on the tour on Thurs. Sept. 27.</p>
   <p>A full house is looked forward to as Enander's lectures are always very good and his subject on Thursday is of great interest to all Swedish-Americans in Chicago.</p>
