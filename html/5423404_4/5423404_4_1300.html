   <p>The Annual Linne Festival was held last Sunday at the statue of the great scientist in Lincoln Park. As customary, the United Swedish Singers' Society presented a group of songs, which were followed by a brief memorial address in Swedish by Mr. John E. Ericsson. The principal address, however, was delivered by Henry C. Cowles, professor of Botany at the University of Chicago, who at length spoke of Linne's remarkable and revolutionary contributions to the science of Botany.</p>
