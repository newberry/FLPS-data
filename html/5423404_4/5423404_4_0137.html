   <p>The Swedish Old People's Home Society has recently sold the home in Park Ridge to the real-estate broker, F. Gillick, for a cash sum of $8500.00, and it is to be vacated by next August 15.</p>
   <p>The Society now has at its disposal $20,000, and has engaged Architect Andrew Sandegren to draw up plans for a new modern home, which is to cost about $25,000.</p>
   <p>A committee has been appointed to select the most suitable site for the new Old People's Home. It will probably be built in North Evanston.</p>
