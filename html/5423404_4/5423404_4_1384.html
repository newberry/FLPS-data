   <p>The Trinity Swedish Lutheran congregation, whose church is located at Seminary and Barry Avenues, will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its founding next Sunday. The festivities will continue through the following week.</p>
   <p>It was on February 28, 1883, that Dr. C. A. Evald, then pastor of the Immanuel Swedish Lutheran Church, formed the Trinity congregation. A Sunday school, which was established in Lake View in 1879 by members of the Immanuel congregation, was really its forerunner.</p>
   <p>Among the charter members of the new congregation were G. A. Bohman and the well-known newspaperman, John A. Enander.</p>
   <p>The first church was built in 1883, and three years later the congregation <span class="page-break">2</span>engaged the first pastor of its own S. A. Sandahl, who remained at the post until 1901. The present church was erected in 1896, and its pastor is Dr. Gottfred Nelson, who has now served the congregation for thirty years. Of the charter members only one is still living, namely, Mrs. J. A. Anderson.</p>
   <p>In 1925 a Sunday School building was erected; it is one of the largest and best equipped schools of its kind in the city.</p>
   <p>The jubilee will conclude with a community night, March 7, when pastors of the various congregations in the district will appear as speakers.</p>
