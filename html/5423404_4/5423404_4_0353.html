   <p>Mr. John Linderholm of Chicago, a member of the Chamber of Commerce here, is the owner of thousands of acres of land in the State of Texas, where he is cultivating rice on a large scale. He has been very successful, and his rice is brought to earlier ripeness than other rice cultivators due to a new watering method called "The Shallow Well System." It is an old annual custom in the State to sell the first ripened sack of rice of the season, which has been brought into Houston, at a public auction, and to donate the money to the Home for Old Women in Texas. There has always been a keen competition between the rice cultivators in this State to be the first one to deliver the money. Mr. Linderholm not only won that distinction this year, but he also made a new record by bringing into Houston a sack of this year's rice one month earlier than is customary.</p>
