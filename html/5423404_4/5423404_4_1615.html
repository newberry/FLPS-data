   <p>Secretary of Labor Davis, who has just returned from a study trip to Europe, declares that his observations in the various countries which he visited have strengthened his belief that a more rational immigration policy on the part of the United States is imperative. America desires good immigrants, but under present regulations she has no choice. He found that several European countries followed the policy of granting visas only to the less desirable elements. He feels that America should no longer permit herself to be used as a dumping-ground, but should make her own selection of immigrants according to her own standards. This country would still get as many newcomers as are needed here.</p>
   <p>The Secretary recommends that the selection be made in the country of <span class="page-break">2</span>origin. Instead of admitting all those who come here within the quota for their respective countries, Davis wants the American consuls to decide whether or not a prospective immigrant is desirable by American standards. Visas should be granted only to those who may reasonably be assumed to possess the qualifications for good citizenship and for making an adequate living for themselves.</p>
   <p>Through this procedure, the United States would secure for itself the highest type of immigrants that Europe has to offer. Right now, the desire to emigrate is strong in Europe. The Secretary of Labor believes that half of Europe's population would be glad to go to America if given the opportunity.</p>
