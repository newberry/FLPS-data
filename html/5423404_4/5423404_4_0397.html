   <p>Our countryman, Charles Johnson, has sued George Hankins, a gambling-house proprietor, to recover a sum of $600. that Johnson claimed he lost in Hankin's place on April 1,1889. On the same grounds Mrs. Johnson has brought suit for $2,000. The fact that it is possible to bring forth so many law-suits on the same item is explained by the peculiarity of our laws, which state:</p>
   <p>If the person losing the money does not present his claim within six months from the date of the loss, any one may sue the proprietor of the gambling house for a sum equal to three times the amount of the original loss.</p>
   <p>Mr. Johnson formerly was the proprietor of the Larson Furniture Company of this city.</p>
