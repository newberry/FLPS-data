   <p>The Swedish Lutheran Pastors' Association of Chicago, which has about one hundred members, held a meeting last Monday in the Olaus Petri Church. The president, Pastor P. Arthur Johnson, who has just been called to the Trinity Church of Galesburg, Illinois, directed the meeting in a tactful and jovial manner. The members listened with evident interest to a lecture by Pastor C. A. Lindvall on the topic "The Pastor of the Congregation," which provided much food for thought for the men of the cloth. In the audience were several out-of-town pastors. Dr. Gustaf Andreen, pastor of the Olaus Petri Church, and Dr. M. Pankoke addressed the meeting in behalf of the building fund of the Theological Seminary. The goal to be reached is set at $400,000, and the pastors showed their interest in the cause by signing up for $3,000 right then and there. Alumni of Augustana College and Theological Seminary have demonstrated their devotion to their Alma Mater by donating $30,000 to the fund.</p>
   
   <p>Pastor Emil Berggren gave a talk in which he discussed the work of Lutheran church publications. Several ladies were present, and at the end of the meeting they served a tasty supper, during which G. Bernhard Anderson, Swedish vice-consul of Chicago, and Countess Wilamowitz gave inspiring talks.</p>
   <p>A friendly and jovial spirit pervaded the entire meeting. </p>
