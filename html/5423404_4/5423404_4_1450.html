Saturday the synod disbanded after the ministers had a meeting in the afternoon when the question of economy was discussed and the financial condition. The question arose what should be done with farms donated to Augustana College when outside of Paxton. Some thought such farms should be sold and the income used to build an auditorium <span class="page-break">\6</span>at Augustana College, such as they have at Lundsborg. Some thought they better use the income from the farms to support ministers who had been sent away. Others thoughtan auditorium should be built nearer Rock Island, where the people there would be benefited. Dr. G. Andreen read his report of Augustana College, this was well presented and understood. In the evening a concert was held at the church.
