   <p>Last Sunday afternoon, we had the pleasure of participating as guests in a social which was as unique as it was successful. The social was held at the Odd Fellows' Hall, and the host was the Vikingen, a monthly, organ of the Order of Vikings. On the day mentioned, the monthly was celebrating its sixth anniversary also. The editor of the magazine, Mr. Anders Hessel, together with the business manager, Mr. Otto Anderson, sent invitations to a number of the men carrying forward the work of the Swedish-American press to attend a social, or as the invitation had it, a convention.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hessel, the happiest of all editors, opened the convention, after which Editor Jacob Boriggven was elected chairman. Editor Frithiof Malmquist was elected secretary. A mallet of the type used to open a keg of beer was placed in the hand of Doctor Boriggren to serve as a gavel, which he used with disturbing effect. Space does not permit us to describe the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>pleasant social.</p>
   <p>We beg to express our thanks to our newspaper friends, Messrs. Hessel and Anderson, for the invitation extended us, and for the excellent food we thank Mrs. Peter Johnson.</p>
