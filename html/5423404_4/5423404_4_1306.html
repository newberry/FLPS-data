   <p>The Birthday of the Flower-King, Carl Von Linne', (210th) was celebrated last Sunday at the Lincoln Statue in Lincoln Park. A large gathering also met at Svithoid's Club. A great crowd of people were at Lincoln Park too. The songs were sung chiefly in the Swedish language, but several Norwegian numbers were given too with much feeling.</p>
   <p>The Statue of the Children's Fairy Tale writer Hans Christian Anderson is near the Lincoln Monument.</p>
   <p>The memorial speech was given by Attorney Carl R. Chindblom who employed the significance of the memorial as far as Swedish-Americans are concerned. "Hor oss Svea" (Hear us Svea) was particularly impressive. About two-hundred attended the buffet supper given in the Svithiod Club. John E. Ericson was master of ceremonies. Charles S. Peterson presented the Swedish singers with a beautiful photograph of the Robert Lindblom High School. The festivities ended with the singing of America, and, a lively hurrah, for the Swedish Singing Club.</p>
