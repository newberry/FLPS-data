   <p>The Norwegian-Americans held a special memorial service for their former King Oscar at Vor Frelsers Kirke last Sunday afternoon with Pastors B. E. Bergesen and Alfred Johnson officiating. The former said "that when the history of Norway is written, the page concerning King Oscar will be one of the most beautiful, and that no word of bitterness is going to be written of it."</p>
   <p>One of the most solemn memorial services for the deceased King Oscar II was <span class="page-break">\2</span>held last Wednesday night in St. Ansgarius Swedish-American Episcopal Church, under the auspices of Svithiod Order. The church was draped in mourning and could not accommodate those who wished to attend the service. The Rector of the church, the Rev. Herman Lindskog, who has delivered so many fine memorial speeches, surpassed himself as an orator when he delivered the memorial address of the late King of Sweden, Oscar II. The Svithiod chorus sang under the direction of Prof. Ortengren.</p>
