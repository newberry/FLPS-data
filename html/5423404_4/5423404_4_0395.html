   <p>Walter Jacobson, about thirty years old, and residing at 110 Sholto St., was arrested last Sunday morning for the murder of James Johnson, a painter, of 38 Sholto St. These two men, in the company of three others, had spent Saturday night drinking and carousing in the saloon located at the corner of Sholto and Gurley Sts., and which is owned by Michael Dalton. They had imbibed so freely that finally one after another fell asleep in chairs or on the floor. Around seven o'clock in the morning they were about to resume their beer drinking. It was at this time that somebody dropped a glass on the floor, which somehow aroused Jacobson's anger. A quarrel ensued, during which Jacobson pulled a knife and lunged toward the saloon-keeper. He tripped and fell against Johnson, however, and the quarrel was now between these two men. All of a sudden Jacobson thrust his knife into Johnson's chest. Then he left the saloon and went home to try to sleep. The witnesses to the tragic incident were all so intoxicated and so apathetic from the night's orgy that they did not even think of sending for help for the wounded man, who succumbed before medical aid finally was <span class="page-break">2</span>summoned. Johnson's arrest took place at nine o'clock the same morning. He is married and has two children.</p>
   <p>The July 24, 1890 issue of the Swedish Tribune relates the sentencing of Walter Jacobson by Judge Altgeld to five years of hard labor. The verdict was manslaughter.</p>
