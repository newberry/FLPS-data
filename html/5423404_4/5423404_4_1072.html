   <p>A luncheon was given last Thursday in the Swedish Club, 1258 North LaSalle Street, in honor of Dr. K. A. Hjorth, of Gothenburg, Sweden, who is the secretary of the Swedish branch of the Society for the Preservation of Swedish Culture in America. Some sixty persons attended. Gotthard Dahlberg, president of the Club, welcomed the guest of honor in a short speech, and was followed by a number of brief speeches among which were those of Congressman Carl Chindblom, City Treasurer Charles S. Peterson, Attorney Hjalmar Lundquist, and Mrs. Othellia Myhrman. One speaker discussed Sweden and her culture, another told of the cleverness of Swedish-Americans, another pointed out the importance of a cultural exchange between Sweden and the United States. Finally Dr. Hjorth arose, thanked the Club members for their hospitality, and discussed the purpose of his American tour and his impression of this great country. He outlined some of his plans for the future. These included a convention of the Society for the Preservation of Swedish Culture in America in connection with the Chicago World's Fair of 1933.</p>
