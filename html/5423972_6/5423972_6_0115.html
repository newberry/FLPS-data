   <p>Congregation Ohave Sholom donated $4000 to build a new Talmud Torah. It is understood that other Jewish congregations will also make their donations. The first response to this very necessary undertaking, however, was made by Congregation Ohave Sholom which is located on the corner of Polk Street and Ashland Boulevard.</p>
   <p>Immediately after Kol Nidre [the most solemn prayer of the Yom Kipur Eve liturgy], Rabbi [Saul] Silber delivered a sermon in which he described the plight of the Jews in Chicago who were raising their children without a Talmud Torah training. The result of the appeal made by Rabbi Silber, urging the Jewish public to make donations, was very gratifying.</p>
   <p>In addition to the donation of $4000 there were other donations as follows: Mr. Sam Phillipson, $500; Young Men's Talmud Torah Auxiliary, $500; Mr. B. Morris, $200; Mrs. Jacob Cohen, Mrs. Henry J. Kurwitz, Mr. Isidor Cohn, Mr. Torgsoon, and Mr. S. Berger, $100 each; Mr. Ben Zion Laiserovitz, Mr. Charles Kohn, Mr. Harry Shapiro, Mr. J. Firedman, Mr. M. Crown and Mr. Louis Mames, $50 each; thirty-one contributors, $25 each; six contributors, $20 each; four contributors, $15 each; twenty-eight contributors, $10 each; and three contributors, $5 each.</p>
   <p>A meeting of the board of directors of the Talmud Torah is called for tomorrow evening in order to elect the officers and appoint the chairmen of the various committees.</p>
