   <p>Dr. Hirsch's Lecture at the Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>An interesting group of more than 200 people most of whom were women, braved the weather and came to the Institute last night to hear Dr. Hirsch, Rabbi of Sinai Temple, lecture on economic distress caused by forced immigration.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, superintendent of the Institute, opened the meeting, and after giving a resume of the speakers and subjects of the coming lecture season, introduced the speaker of the evening, Dr. Hirsch, who received a very hearty welcome from the audience.</p>
   <p>In his talk Dr. Hirsch stressed the economic distress upon the Jewish family caused by forced migration from the land of their birth to a totally strange land. He was particularly concerned with the estrangement between children and parents, resulting from tendencies of assimilation among our youth.</p>
   
   <p>"The old generation" he stated, "retains its old language and its old customs, while the new generation is seeking a new way, perhaps an even better way than the old one." "This the old generation does not understand and therefore suffers to see its old ways forgotten by our youth."</p>
   <p>Other speakers were Mr. Graham Miller, and Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, who also announced the formation of an Institute class for Social Science. People interested in taking the course should enroll now.</p>
