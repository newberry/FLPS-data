   <p>The world was created because of the Torah; it should, therefore, be most precious to the Jew. The Torah, as we know, is the foundation of our permanent existence as Jews. The first thing we must work for is to teach our Jewish youth the Holy Torah. In order to do this we must have an Yeshivah, a theological seminary.</p>
   <p>In order to maintain an Yeshivah we must have enough funds. The financial condition of our Yeshivah is very poor. We have no money with which to pay the teachers who instruct over 100 poor children in the Yeshivah. Three weeks have already passed since we paid the teachers for their services. Besides failing to pay the teachers, we also have many payments to make which are past due. Furthermore, we have no coal with which to heat the building which houses the school.</p>
   <p>As yet we have not worked out any plan which will increase our income, except <span class="page-break">\2</span>that of making a strong appeal to our worthy Jewish public to open their hearts and to think of their duties toward the Jewish youth of Chicago. Every Jew in Chicago who is a member of a synagogue must bear in mind that if the Yeshivah is neglected, the Jewish training of our youth will go to naught. It would then be useless to build beautiful schools for no one would visit these houses of learning unless we were financially able to have enough competent teachers to instruct the pupils.</p>
