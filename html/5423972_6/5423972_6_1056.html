   <p>Report of the Executive Board of the United Hebrew Relief Association.</p>
   <p>It is natural and proper, that the Relief Association should always be deeply interested in the financial prosperity of its friends and patrons. The improved condition of our affairs show that this has been a year of general prosperity. The revival of business, has produced a better state of things in the concerns of the Association. The recipients of your bounty have lessened in number, and those who remain are able to contribute something towards their own maintenance. That utter helplessness and destitution, to which our predecessors directed your attention in former years, no longer exists. We have, to some degree, compelled them to rely upon their own resources for a livelihood. This work is a step in the right direction. The truest benefactor of the poor, is he who teaches them to provide for themselves.</p>
   
   <p>Collections.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding this general prosperity, it must be said that our collections have been small and hard to secure. The number of general contributors have diminished and we fear will continue to diminish. The difficulties with which the Board has annually to contend to secure Collection Committees, and the positive reluctance with which these committees enter upon their work, demands some radical reform in view of our collection plans. The old plan of personal solicitation has outlived its usefulness. It may still be employed but should not be the chief reliance of the Board. It is due to these causes and others, that the great city of Chicago, with all its famed public spirit enterprise and liberality, does not contribute one-third as much charity as either of the great cities of the East. Surely it can be no pleasant reflection to know, that in proportion to its wealth and numbers, our city does not bestow upon its poor, as much as the humblest Jewish Relief Society in the land.</p>
   
   <p>Self-Appointed Collection Committees.</p>
   <p>In the course of prosecuting their duties, our collection committees have had to contend with an evil which if suffered to continue will seriously cripple the usefulness of the Association. For several years past, many well-meaning persons - chiefly ladies - have, without the knowledge and approval of the Board, pursued the practice of collecting monies, for the benefit of applicants, who, almost invariably, have been found upon investigation, to be utterly unworthy, or have already received repeated assistance from the Association. These private collections are made so frequently, and bestowed so thoughtlessly, that the donors become discouraged, and, we may add, often disgusted. Merchants find it impossible to refuse these solicitations, because they are made, either by intimate friends, or by ladies of social prominence and influence. These ladies suffer themselves to be imposed upon, it would seem, by every impostor who happens to have the dramatic ability to tell a touching story of imaginary sufferings.</p>
   
   <p>They are guided by sentiment and not by that common-sense and prudence so essential to the proper distribution of public charity. They exercise no discretion, and as a consequence, their charity hardly ever relieves the deserving poor, but is too often bestowed upon the professional beggar. The friends of the Association have been so frequently annoyed and harassed by these self-appointed committees, that when solicited by the members of the Board, they either contribute nothing or sums small in comparison with what they ought and would give had they not been annoyed so incessantly during the year.</p>
   <p>Annual Dues.</p>
   <p>The Board is collecting the dues of the various component societies - but more especially, some of the lodges - has found much difficulty in enforcing prompt payment. Many of the component societies have been delinquent for some years.</p>
   <p>Change of Annual Meeting.</p>
   <p>After several years of experience, the Board and its predecessors have found that to hold the annual meetings as now held in the Spring of the year, was an unfortunate change. Formerly they were held early in Autumn. When the annual meeting now adjourns, the Summer is upon us, and all interest cease in both public and private charities. There is an utter stagnation until the frosts of Winter remind us that the poor are again in want. Your collections are made in Autumn. All activity begins in that season. It is then the annual meeting should be held.</p>
   <p>Statistics of the Year's Work.</p>
   <p>During the year we have assisted 161 resident families aggregating 833 persons. Of these, about 32 were new applicants. 15 families were, upon their own request, sent to other cities. 21 families left the city without our assistance. The Association maintains as regular pensioners, 22 widows, and 19 women who have been abandoned and left destitute, by their husbands. 27 persons were sent to the hospital. During the year 10 adults and 12 children died and were buried by the Association. There were 35 applications for relief rejected - the applicants, upon investigation, having been found unworthy, or for other reasons not entitled to relief. We have expended $200 in medicines and medical aid and consumed about 211 tons of coal.</p>

   <p>This money will be barely sufficient to meet our wants for the period of about six months, which must intervene before we receive any money from future collections.</p>
