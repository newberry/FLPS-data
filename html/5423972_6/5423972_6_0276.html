   <p>Next door to the Settlement was the drug store owned by Leo Porges, the first Russian druggist in Chicago to open a drug store of his own in the neighborhood. His place became a rendezvous for all the intellectuals of the vicinity. Doctors, lawyers, dentists and all others who were admitted into the circle designated as "intellectuals," would gather regularly every evening in back of the prescription counter and there create a thousand problems and settle them. It was here that the inspiration was born to organize a "Self-Educational Club." The very name of the club was a challenge to the Maxwell Street Settlement. Its members were to educate themselves and not to receive their education as charity from the hands of a few highbrows. The most active leaders of the new venture were Dr. Michael L. Aren, Dr. Kate Levy, Peter Wiernick, Meyer Lesser, Prof. Isaac Hurwitz, Prof. Abraham Feldman, Dr. Leo Fels, Harry Fels, and Dr. Emma Blount. Quarters were procured on Halsted Street, south of Fourteenth Street. Classes were immediately organized in elementary and advanced English. Among the teachers were Harry A. Lipsky, Hyman Goldberg, Rosa Kanter, who has since become the wife of Hyman Goldberg, and Pauline Pines, <span class="page-break">2</span>now the wife of Dr. M. L. Aren. Lectures on a variety of subjects were arranged for several nights a week. Among the lecturers were such distinguished men as Prof. Harper, President of the University of Chicago; Prof. Moulton, Prof. James Breasted, Prof. MacClintock, Prof. Andrews, Prof. Fredrick Starr, M. M. Mangazzarian, Graham Taylor, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Prof. Isaac Hurwitz, and Clarence S. Darrow. Every lecture was supplemented by a musical. George Shapiro, Isaac Levin and Joe Copeland furnished the music. The Self-Educational Club soon attracted wide attention and was always crowded with men and women anxious to avail themselves of its benefits while the Maxwell Street Settlement, with all the wealth behind it and the opportunities and possibilities at its command, drew an attendance which decreased steadily. It was not until many years later, when Ernstine Heller was put in charge of the Settlement, that it became an active and busy institution, ministering to the neighborhood's needs and functioning in a way intended by the men who were the founders of it.</p>
