   <p>In a soccer football game played last Sunday at the Cubs Park between the Maccabees Juniors and the Cermak Flashes, it has been demonstrated that the Jewish boys are awakening to the sporting life. The game was played brilliantly and both teams composed of Jewish boys have shown the advancement made within the very short period of their existence.</p>
   <p>The Maccabees has been limited to boys of certain ages and therefore has been handicapped by the withdrawal from the game of their best men. The first half of the game was an even break, as for the second half, the Maccabees had the advantage all through the game. The offensive line of the Maccabees always threatened the opposite goal and the Cermak boys kept their defense well in order up to the end of the game. The final score terminated in favor of the Cermak Flashes, three goals to two goals for the Maccabees.</p>
