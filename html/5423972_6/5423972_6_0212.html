   <p>A few weeks will witness the dedication of a new and beautiful building devoted to the purpose of education, to be known as the "Michael Reese Training School." In addition to the school there will be a Lying-In Hospital for obsteterical cases. Until now, there has been no maternity ward in the Michael Reese Hospital proper.</p>
   <p>The architect is Simeon B. Eisendrath. The cost of the building will be $15,000, which will be furnished from the Michael Reese Trust Fund through Mrs. Henrietta Rosenfeld and Mr. Jacob Rosenberg.</p>
   <p>The school is in connection with the Hospital and is intended as an educational institution for nurses. The course of training will be two years. The instruction will consist of lectures by visiting resident physicians, and surgeons <span class="page-break">\2</span>and the superintendent and head nurses, supplemented by daily practice at the bed-side of patients in the various wards. On the completion of the two year course, after passing the required examination, each student will receive his diploma.</p>
