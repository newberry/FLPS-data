   <p>The old administration of the Talmud Torah concluded its term of office last Thursday. The new board of directors elected new officers, a new board of education, and a principal. Now it is up to us Jews in Chicago to get busy and raise our children according to the old Jewish customs and traditions.</p>
   <p>The new directors are aware of the task they have before them. They understand that a new building is an absolute necessity. There are no materials which the children may use, and no building for the children to study in. A new system of teaching, and above all, competent teachers are absolutely essential. All this work must be accomplished as quickly as possible. At this time, when the public is interested in this much-needed project, it is up to the new officers to get busy at once and make a success of it. The new directors are some of the best Jews in Chicago. They are progressive in their ideas.</p>

   <p>Chicago Jewry looks up to this new Talmud Torah organization. We must get to work immediately. The most vital questions are awaiting immediate solution. After securing competent teachers and changing the system of instruction the cornerstone for a new Talmud Torah should be laid.</p>
   <p>The future of the new Jewish generation now lies in your hands. You can make good Jewish citizens out of your children; you can build an American Judaism. You can make Chicago the center of Judaism and Jewish culture. You have a trustworthy undertaking to perform; success or failure is entirely in your hands. Do not neglect this great work and your name will remain among the builders of the Jewish nation and religion for the future generations.</p>
