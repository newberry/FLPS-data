   <p>The Jewish women of Chicago, regardless of their political or social tenets, have united in a movement to create a Jewish day nursery in the Douglas district. This is a noble enterprise; the main principle of the organization is to give a motherly home to children, who are sadly in need of it.</p>
   <p>A building has already been purchased. It contains 18 rooms. The total cost was $15,000 of which $6,000 has already been paid. The organization has 800 members, many of whom are in the radical movement, such as Mrs. Shore, secretary, Mrs. Bakal, Mrs. Rothblatt, Mrs. Strausman, Mrs. Schaffner, and others.</p>
