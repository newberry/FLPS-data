   <p>Among the institutions of which Chicago Jewry is in possession, one of the most important is the Deborah Boys' Club, 5930 S. Polk Street.</p>
   <p>The club accepts boys who are working for a livelihood, who are too young to take care of themselves, who seek self preservation and at the same time make preparations for a future - these boys can find a home there.</p>
   <p>The Jewish boys, who are accepted there, earn from five to six dollars a week. At that wage one would be unable to provide for himself, but the Deborah Boys' Club offers room and board at $3.00 per week to every boy who makes this club his home.</p>

   <p>The club would like to contact every Jewish boy who is in need of a home. The superintendent, Mr. Friedlander, is more than pleased to keep every Jewish boy, not only by giving him a home, but also by securing a position for him. Free courses are offered in English, shorthand, etc.</p>
