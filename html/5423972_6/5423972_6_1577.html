   <p>Yesterday the Daughters of Zion Day Nursery celebrated its first year of existence at the Sabin School assembly hall. An address was delivered by Dr. S. M. Melamed who pointed out the need for such an institution and asked for greater activity. Another speaker was Rabbi Margolin. Then too there was a rich program of various amusements such as plays, songs, and dances which the audience greatly enjoyed.</p>
