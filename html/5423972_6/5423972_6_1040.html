   <p>We distributed at the office 1,168 articles of wearing apparel and shoes, and furnished 119 school boys with clothing. The sending of children to school has been made a necessary condition of relief to parents, and our Superintendent is in active correspondence with the principals of the schools which the children attend, and exercises a watchful supervision over their education.</p>
