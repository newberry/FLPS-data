   <p>In the 40th annual report of the Executive Committee of the United Hebrew Charities in 1899 the following statement appears</p>
   <p>"At the suggestion of Henry Greenebaum, Ramah Lodge #33, in the summer of 1859, appointed a committee to wait upon the several Jewish societies dispensing charity and urged their participation in a convention to be called by the Lodge and composed of delegates from the different societies."</p>
   <p>Through the efforts of the Lodge, a convention was held which resulted in the organization of the United Hebrew Relief Society of Chicago. The present Jewish Charities of Chicago is the outgrowth of this humble organization.</p>
