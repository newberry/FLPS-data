   <p>Heavy storms yesterday interfered with the celebration of laying of the foundation stone for the new Maimonides Kosher Hospital at California Avenue and Rebecca Street. It will take place, however, in the near future. A great many people have come to participate in the celebration, which ended quite abruptly for reasons mentioned above. Functioning as chairman on this occasion was Mr. Harry M. Fisher, president of the Hospital Association. Addresses were delivered by Messrs. A. J. Sabath, National representative, Dr. George Sultan, representing Mr. Bartzen, president of the County Council, Dr. B. H. Breakstone, Rabbi Joseph Silber, and Sheriff Zimmer, Directed by Messrs. William Block and Edward Solomon, a so-called "combat with noble intentions" was instituted as a means for naming one of the eight corner stones, after the highest bidder. The largest offer, that of $400, came from Mr. J. Lurya. The remaining stones were named after Samuel Polakow, Nathan Rosenzweig, Michael Rosenberg, Mrs. M. Lapin, Messrs. Meyer, Kadeschewietz and the previously named auctioneers. Various other honors enriched the hospital fund by $3000. The west Side Ladies' Society gave a hospital bed as an endowment. It will be a most modern structure, with two dining-rooms, to accommodate the orthodox as well as the reformed Jews. Adjoining the hospital will be a synagogue with a sitting capacity of about 150.</p>
   <p>Mr. Samuel Neveleff was appointed director for the institution, which is expected to open its doors to the public in about a year. The hospital is named after the Jewish philosopher, Maimonides, of Spain.</p>
