   <p>Excerpt from an article by Dr. Theodore B. Sachs on the tuberculosis campaign in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"The U. H. C. West Side Dispensary was one of the pioneers in the fight against tuberculosis in this city. Operating in one of the most crowded districts of Chicago, the medical staff of the Dispensary were years ago aware of the enormous prevalence of tuberculoses in the poor sections of the city.</p>
   <p>In 1900 the Dispensary printed circulars in English and Hebrew, in which the true nature of the disease was briefly explained and instructions laid down for the benefit of the consumptive and the protection of his family and neighbors. Since that time, distribution of these circulars has steadily been going on to my knowledge, this was the first attempt of its kind in this city.</p>
   <p>By early detection of the disease, personal instruction, distribution of circulars, advice as to change of quarters or occupation, free treatment and distribution of milk and relief through the medium of the U. H. C., the West Side Dispensary played a very conspicuous part in the campaign waged against the terrible plague of tuberculosis."</p>
