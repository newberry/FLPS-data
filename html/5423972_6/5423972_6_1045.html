   <p>It is just a quarter of a century since Ramah Lodge sponsored a convention of delegates of the different Jewish lodges, congregations and benevolent societies, which was held for the purpose of forming one common Jewish charity organization called the United Hebrew Relief Association. Prior to that time there was but indiscriminate alms-giving and duplications thereof.</p>
   <p>The first regular meeting of the Executive Board took place November 20, 1859, and its first yearly report is dated October 4, 1886. Henry Greenbaum was its first president.</p>
