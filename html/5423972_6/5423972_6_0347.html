   <p>A few days ago there was founded in Chicago a society named the "Jewish Intellectual Forum," with the purpose of instilling greater consciousness in Jewish thought and increasing the knowledge of Judaism. Mr. Philip Seaman, superintendent of the Hebrew Institute, is the chairman.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Intellectual Forum will open its summer season Sunday, May 25, at 2:30 P.M., in the gymnasium of the Hebrew Institute. Dr. S. M. Melomed and Madame Bertha Kolish will take part on this program. The great dramatic actress will recite poems by famous Jewish poets. Dr. S. M. Malomed, editor of the Courier, will deliver a scientific discussion on the more important problems facing the Jewish people today.</p>
   <p>The details of this tremendous work will be made public shortly.</p>
