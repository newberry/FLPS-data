   <p>The Curan Joint Committee of the Illinois Legislature, which visited yesterday the Marks Nathan Orphanage, expressed its admiration for the fine order and loving attitude which it found there.</p>
   <p>Especially was the Committee impressed with the system, and the spirit of independence in which the children are being brought up. There is no loss of individuality either. Each child wears different clothes, according to its taste. Each child has its own locker and shelf on which his name is written in full.</p>
   <p>The discipline in the institution is very good. The smaller children are under the supervision of the grown up ones. The girls of the ages eleven to seventeen are busy darning hosiery for the little ones. At meal time each table with eight children has a grown girl, who serves and supervises and upon whom the little tots look as a mother.</p>
