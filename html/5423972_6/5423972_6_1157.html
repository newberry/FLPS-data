   <p>It affords me unusual pleasure to submit to you the fifth annual report covering the activities of Mt. Sinai Hospital for the year 1923.</p>
   <p>The year just passed has been an eventful one in many respects. I know you will rejoice with me when I look back on Mt. Sinai's rebirth some five years ago. Step by step, year by year, we have labored and built, many times meeting with a determined and stubborn resistance, but due to your loyal support and unselfish work, we have convinced the Jewish population that a properly conducted kosher hospital was and is a necessity of the great West Side. It has been proven through surveys and investigations made by hospital authorities, that there exists today a crying need and an honest demand for a greater and <span class="page-break">\2</span>larger Mt. Sinai, one built to properly function as an integral part of the health program of the community. It is hard for me to adequately express my thanks and the thanks of the community to those who have labored and struggled to place Mt. Sinai in the splendid position which it now occupies.</p>
   <p>Important Factors</p>
   <p>The two outstanding and important events of the year were of unusual significance to the Hospital. The first one is our participation in the two and a-half million dollar drive, and secondly, our affiliation with the Jewish Charities of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Two and a-Half Million Dollar Drive</p>
   <p>You will agree with me that Mt. Sinai Hospital owes a debt of gratitude to the chairman of that great drive, Mr. Jacob M. Loeb, whose dynamic personality and tireless efforts led a great host of co-workers, among whom I wish to <span class="page-break">\3</span>particularly mention Mrs. Edwin Romberg and Mrs. Benjamin Schiffman, out into the field, and secured for our institutions, subscriptions sufficient to make up the required quota. On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Hospital, I take this means of publicly thanking Mr. Loeb and his co-workers, for their unselfish contribution to Mt. Sinai. As a result of the drive, we can now see a 150 bed Mt. Sinai, one which can more properly discharge its duties to the community and function in a fitting manner.</p>
   <p>Affiliation with Jewish Charities</p>
   <p>The event of our affiliation with the Jewish Charities of Chicago has in no way affected the management of the Hospital. Since our affiliation, we have been receiving $3,500 each month, and the Charities have co-operated with us to the fullest extent. Our association with them has at all times been exceedingly pleasant and helpful.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Research Branch</p>
   <p>The Jewish people in this community are indeed fortunate in having a man of the type of Mr. Louis M. Cahn, chairman in the research bureau. Through the co-operation of Mr. Cahn with the various activities of the Charities and with Mt. Sinai, there has been considerable improvement in the general welfare of the patients, as well as in the economic accomplishments in purchasing.</p>
   <p>Medical Staff</p>
   <p>Our medical staff, under the leadership of Dr. M. Lewison, has been doing remarkably good work in the institution, and maintaining the proper co-operation between themselves and the management of the Hospital. They have taken the proper steps in providing</p>
   <p>(1) A $500 fellowship fund for research work;</p>
   <p>(2) In giving encouragement for papers to be written by members of the <span class="page-break">\5</span>staff, at least once a year, for publication;</p>
   <p>(3) Have encouraged young men in the practice of medicine through large numbers of clinical meetings and conferences.</p>
   <p>It is true that through the efforts of the medical staff, the Hospital has attained the high standing in the community which it now holds.</p>
   <p>Nursing Department</p>
   <p>During the year, Miss Dora Levine has been placed in charge of the Training School, and through the courtesy of Mt. Sinai Hospital workers, a course of training in teaching nurses, has been awarded to Miss Levine at the Columbia University during the summer. We now have in training twenty-six nurses, and despite lack of adequate quarters for instruction, our nurses are graduating with the highest honors, and all who have graduated have passed the State Board examination.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Interne Department</p>
   <p>We have now four internes graduated from the University of Illinois, one fulltime resident physician and one part-time anesthetist. These internes are receiving a full course of training from members of the staff. The committee on internes consists of Drs. V. L. Schrager, Charles Newberger, and Benjamin Gruskin. It is gratifying to know that the internes who have graduated in the previous years, are now rendering valuable service to the community and making very good progress in the medical profession.</p>
   <p>Laboratory Department</p>
   <p>Our laboratory department is in [the] charge of Dr. Benjamin Gruskin, assisted by Dr. A. Feldman, and later by Drs. Weinberg and Harris. During the month of July, 1923, arrangements were made whereby complete diagnoses are made on all cases that enter the Hospital, as well as cases admitted through the <span class="page-break">\7</span>dispensary, at a flat rate which is very nominal. The technical work is of such a character that it has brought considerable recognition and praise from various authorities on this particular phase of Hospital's activities.</p>
   <p>X-Ray Department</p>
   <p>The X-ray department is in [the] charge of Dr. M. I. Kaplan, assisted by Mr. Seilin, who also has charge of the Hospital records. The work this department is doing has been a credit to our institution, and we hope that with the enlargement of this department in our new building, a greater amount of work will be accomplished.</p>
   <p>Dispensary Department</p>
   <p>The dispensary department is now in [the] charge of Miss B. Epstein, who has taken a special course in social service and dispensary work, is a graduate of Mt. Sinai Training School, and who has made great improvements in our dispensary <span class="page-break">\8</span>during the year. We look forward to a greater amount of achievement in the coming year.</p>
   <p>Administration Committee</p>
   <p>The administration committee has held regular meetings throughout the year with the executive committee of the medical staff, and we believe has established a much-desired point of contact between the lay board and the medical staff.</p>
   <p>Building Committee</p>
   <p>Considerable time and study have been given by the building committee in studying a vast number of hospitals, interviewing hospital superintendents, hospital consultants, architects, in order to draw plans for a first-rate institution. While at this present report, nothing of definite nature can be reported. Great credit is due to Mr. Leopold Kling, chairman, Mr. Irving N. Klein, and Mr. Sam Platt, and other members of our building committee in their <span class="page-break">\9</span>untiring efforts in this direction.</p>
   <p>Superintendent</p>
   <p>All of our committees and officers have functioned in a manner which we believe, has resulted in the proper conduct of the Hospital's plans. On April 1, 1923, Dr. Max Switton resigned as superintendent of the Hospital and Miss Anna Koenig was appointed to fill the vacancy. I am happy to report that she has at all times discharged her duties in a fitting and satisfactory manner, co-operating fully at all times with the medical staff and maintaining the proper technical standards of Hospital management.</p>
   <p>Auxiliary Departments</p>
   <p>Since the amalgamation of Mt. Sinai Hospital with the Jewish Charities of Chicago, the work of the auxiliaries is of a more constructive nature. Each auxiliary is assuming responsibility for certain departments in the Hospital, <span class="page-break">\10</span>as follows:</p>
   <p>Mt. Sinai Hospital Workers</p>
   <p>The Mt. Sinai Hospital workers are assuming the responsibility of providing necessities for the maternity department.</p>
   <p>Children's Aid of Mt. Sinai</p>
   <p>The Children's Aid of Mt. Sinai Hospital is assuming the responsibility of the children's ward.</p>
   <p>Service Club of Mt. Sinai</p>
   <p>The Service Club of Mt. Sinai Hospital is providing special nurses for needy cases, especially charity cases at the Hospital, and looking after the general welfare of our pupil nurses, which has made the work of the nurses much easier and more pleasant.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>Mt. Sinai Women's Club</p>
   <p>The Mt. Sinai Hospital Women's Club looks after the religious and general welfare of the patients who require spiritual and moral welfare.</p>
   <p>Infant's Aid of Chicago</p>
   <p>This report would not be complete if the work of the Infant's Aid be not mentioned. This organization has provided the needs for our infants in equipping the necessary linens and layettes and all miscellaneous necessities for the infant. They are very prompt in filling the requirements, and I take this means of apologizing to the good ladies of the organization for not mentioning their activities toward the Mt. Sinai Hospital in our last annual report.</p>
   <p>Special Donation</p>
   <p>The members of the Board have taken interest in the welfare of your institution, <span class="page-break">\12</span>and during the year, Mr. Sam Platt and wife have furnished a room in the Hospital, and it is a great pleasure to thank them in behalf of the Board of Directors of Mt. Sinai Hospital.</p>
