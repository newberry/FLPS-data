   <p>In the Maimonedes Hospital changes and improvements are made slowly but with assurance. In addition to increasing the staff by many new physicians, such as Richter, Shraeger, Cohen, and Levinson, provision has been made for many other changes.</p>
   <p>No sooner had the present superintendent, Mr. Fine, moved to resign, than a committee, consisting of Judge Harry M. Fisher, S. J. Rosenblatt, and I. Lurie, left for New York yesterday, on their own account, to make negotiations for another superintendent.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the supervision of the hospital was left in charge of Dr. H. Cohen, who will be assisted in his work by the present superintendent of the Michael Reese Hospital, so that the inmates receive proper attention.</p>

   <p>Many persons qualified to act in the capacity of superintendent for the hospital, were recommended to the committee. The recommendations come from the greatest authorities in the medical world. The committee, however, desires to interview the candidates personally, for which purpose they departed for New York.</p>
   <p>As soon as a new superintendent is engaged, the entire medical staff will be reorganized. Those who are now on the hospital's medical staff, are tendering their resignations to the Medical Board, in accordance with the decision of the Board of Directors.</p>
