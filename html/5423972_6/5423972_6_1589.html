   <p>At the last meeting of the directors of the Orphans' Home, a report was read by the acting superintendent, Mr. Trotsky, in which he called attention to many necessary improvements.</p>
   <p>The president, Mr. M. Stone, suggested they should give the committee, under the chairmanship of Rabbi Saul Silver, authority to control all matters pertaining to the Orthodox duties of the home. At present this committee directs the Jewish school only.</p>
   <p>This recommendation was accepted. The motion that four Rabbis, chosen by the Rabbi Union, should be admitted to the educational committee and given a voice in everything pertaining to the Orthodox Jewish educational program for the orphans was also adopted.</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher, as a representative of the Federation, informed the orphanage directors that according to Illinois law, the Marks Nathan Orphans' <span class="page-break">\2</span>Home, is entitled to charge the county $10 a month for each orphan boy and $15 for every orphan girl. A committee was appointed to cooperate with Judge Fisher in preparing all the legal papers in this matter.</p>
