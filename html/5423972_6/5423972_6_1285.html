   <p>The bread-winner of the family caught a slight cold; he coughs occasionally, buys a box of cough drops or a bottle of cough syrup, and he thinks that his cough will soon pass away. In the meantime, he goes to work, or to his place of business, and he supports his family.</p>
   <p>But the patient does not show any improvement. He begins to lose weight, his wife notices that he has a fever and that he sweats excessively at night and complains of chills. She gets frightened and calls in a doctor. The doctor examines him, and with lots of sympathy, diagnoses it as tuberculosis.</p>
   
   <p>The family suddenly loses its bread-winner, and it is up to the wife to go out to look for support for herself and children, in the best way she can.</p>
   <p>But as sad as the tragedy appears for the wife and children, there is no comparison to the sad plight of the poor, unfortunate, tubercular husband. The doctor says the sick man must not remain in the house, for it would be impossible for him to prevent the spread of the disease, and he would endanger the health of the entire household. His expectorating, his eating out of the same dishes used by his family, would spread the germs of his disease. Aside from this, if the patient does not obtain the right kind of medical aid, if he fails to live a normal life, or if he does not have the proper food, there is no hope for him.</p>
   
   <p>The unfortunate family is then in despair. Even if the family is not yet in poverty, it is just a matter of a short while before it will be in dire need.</p>
   <p>When such a case is considered, which case, of course, is not such a rarity among the working class and the middle class, we begin to think, and we realize the meaning of such institutions as the sanatorium for Jewish consumptives in Denver, Colorado.</p>
   <p>The unfortunate sufferer of tuberculosis must be saved from being an outcast. He must be helped, for his own sake and for the sake of his family. But the question arises, where shall we send the sufferer?</p>
   
   <p>There are enough institutions in America for such diseased people. But even for those who are in the last stages of the disease, the fee is at least fifteen or twenty dollars per week. Where is the poor family to get so much money? For tuberculosis even in its early stages, takes many months of rest to cure.</p>
   <p>In the institution of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society of Denver, you will find more than 100 unfortunate inmates from Chicago proper. How much is it worth to the Chicago community, therefore, to have an institution like this of their own, where they can send their Jewish consumptives, with the assurance that they will receive the proper medical care, and at the same time avoid the danger of spreading the disease at home?</p>
   
   <p>It seems to us that the larger Jewish communities in America, which send their sick to the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society, should support an institution of this kind with great honor and pride. Unfortunately, this is not the case, particularly since the dire need of the millions in the war-stricken countries have received a great deal of help from such institutions. In order to endure, this sanatorium is compelled to seek aid by various indirect means. In Chicago, for example, two performances are to be given in the Jewish Theatre, April 4th &amp; 5th as a benefit for the sanatorium. Similar means must be adopted in other cities in order to appropriate sufficient money to aid this institution.</p>
   <p>If the Chicago Jews at the present time are not financially able to do something constructive for the sanatorium of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society in Denver, they should at least see to it that the two plays to be presented here in Chicago, despite the present depression, bring in a substantial amount of money for the institution.</p>
   <p>These unfortunate outcasts are appealing to us to help save their lives. So let us respond to their pitiful appeal and do all we possibly can for them.</p>
