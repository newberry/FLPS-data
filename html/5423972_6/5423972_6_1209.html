   <p>At last we have peace in the city. The representatives of Mount Sinai Hospital and the relief workers have come to an understanding about the hospital drive that should be taking place now. The drive has been postponed until spring and the relief workers have pledged themselves to help make the hospital drive a success.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that they will keep their promise.</p>
