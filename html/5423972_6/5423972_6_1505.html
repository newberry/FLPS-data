   <p>"Dear Editor of the Courier: On Sunday evening, January 14, Mrs. Charney Rieger will be installed, for the tenth consecutive term, as president of the Bnoth Zion (Daughters of Zion), and for the seventh consecutive term, as president of the Nursery and Infant Home. Since I have been secretary of the Bnoth Zion since its inception, I trust you will permit me to review the work that Mrs. Rieger had done for the past ten years.</p>
   <p>"This article was read to the members of the board of directors who confirmed everything herein written and I hope that you will publish this statement.</p>
   <p>"Ten years ago, a society by the name of "Bnoth Zion" was organized on the Northwest Side and Mrs. Rieger was elected president. The aim of that Society was to revive and enlarge the small Talmud Torah of the Northwest Side. We <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>held a meeting in one of the synagogues, or what was then a Talmud Torah. The Parokheth (curtain in a synagogue that covers the ark) was torn, so we immediately purchased a new Parokheth, a new table for the pulpit, besides other miscellaneous items.</p>
   <p>"This Society carried on its work in this manner, until a group of Jews of the Northwest Side purchased a Children's Home at Rockwell and Hirsch Streets from some gentiles. Then the Bnoth Zion Society, with Mrs. Rieger as president, swung into real work. Under the direction of Mrs. Rieger, the women worked tirelessly and turned that building into a beautiful Hebrew school. The Bnoth Zion Society spared neither money nor energy.</p>
   <p>"At that time the American Jewish Congress was born. A woman once came to a meeting of the Bnoth Zion Society, weeping bitterly, and said that she was compelled to live on the mercy of charity, because she had no place to leave <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>her two children while she went out to earn a living respectably. She brought her children to a gentile day nursery on the Northwest Side and the matron told her that if the Jews could afford to have a Congress, then it was high time that they established a day nursery for their children. And she [the matron] refused to admit the children.</p>
   <p>"This, and other similar cases, induced Mrs. Rieger to found a Jewish Day Nursery on the Northwest Side. Aided by her profound knowledge, she soon launched a large movement on the Northwest Side for a Jewish Day Nursery and the Bnoth Zion Society soon became engaged in the noble task of providing Jewish babies with a home, which enabled their mothers to go to work. This also prevented the Jewish children from entering Christian homes where they would be compelled to make the sign of the cross before each meal.</p>
   <p>"The noble women of the Northwest Side did such splendid work that in a short <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>period of eighteen months, they purchased a house at 1441 Wicker Park Avenue for $11,000 and remodeled it into a Day Nursery. We declare proudly that in this nursery, the children are reared in a Jewish atmosphere, because the Society spares no money in their effort to maintain a Hebrew school where the children can learn to read, write, and speak Hebrew.</p>
   <p>"In 1918, when the dreadful flu epidemic overwhelmed Chicago, many mothers were torn from their children by death. Poor, lonely fathers did not know what to do with their babies. The sad plight of the unfortunate babies broke the hearts of the members of the Bnoth Zion Society, and Mrs. Rieger, together with the officers, members, and friends of the Society, did unusually splendid work by establishing a home for infants in the Day Nursery.</p>
   <p>"The wonderful work which was done for lonely babies caused the Home to become overcrowded, and the home now lacks space to accommodate a number of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>infants who are in need of a home. About 178 applications are lying in the desk but the lack of space does not permit the admission of these applicants.</p>
   <p>"Under the supervision of Mrs. Rieger, who has been elected president of Bnoth Zion for the tenth consecutive term, a beautiful new infant home will soon be opened on California Avenue, where all the unfortunate motherless infants of Chicago and the vicinity will be housed.</p>
   <p>"Ten years ago, when Mrs. Rieger was elected president, Mrs. Lena Riseberg, was elected vice-president; Mrs. Louis Shapiro, treasurer; Mr. Louis Finder, financial secretary; and the present writer of these lines--Mrs. Lena Ross-- was elected recording secretary.</p>
   <p>"The installation of officers will take place this Sunday evening in the Sabin <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>School, Hirsch and Leavitt Streets. The installation will be conducted by Louis Reingold.</p>
   <p>"[Yours truly],</p>
   <p>"[Mrs. Lena Ross]."</p>
