   <p>A meeting of the Personal Service Society was held Wednesday afternoon in the vestry rooms of Zion Temple. Eight new members were enrolled. Reports were made upon several cases, and an entertainment committee was appointed to arrange for a dramatic performance and strawberry festival to be given in the near future for the purpose of raising funds, in as much as poor people require substance as well as sympathy.</p>
