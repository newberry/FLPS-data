   <p>p. 5 - Yesterday marked the beginning of the 32nd convention of the district grand lodge No. 6, of the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith. The convention is held at the Covenant Culture Club. According to the report by the secretary the membership of the order has decreased during the last year. This fact necessitated a rather careful selection of officials, whose names alone vouch for a more satisfactory report by the secretary of the order, to be given at next year's meeting. Mr. Max Stern, the vice president of the order, who by right was in the line of promotion to the presidency, resigned in favor of Mr. Adolph Loeb. The officials elected are: (12 names are given).</p>
   <p>The convention will be in session three days. A banquet will be given this evening at the Covenant Culture Club, in honor of the attending delegates.</p>
