   <p>A drive is now being conducted in the Douglas Boulevard district to raise a $50,000 fund with which to erect a new day and night nursery building for Jewish children in the Douglas Park neighborhood. The institution already, has a building, but it is becoming inadequate, for the number of applicants is getting larger and larger every day.</p>
   <p>So have pity on these small children who have no fathers or mothers. Help us out in this fund-raising. Let us hurry and build this building as soon as possible, and let it be a home for the homeless children.</p>
