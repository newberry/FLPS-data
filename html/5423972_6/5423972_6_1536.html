   <p>Two ladies enter my office and say to me: "Do us a favor and print this in your paper. We represent the Douglas Park Day Nursery. We keep seventy infants in our institution during the day and thirty-five during the night. We have in our institution, at the present time, a six-weeks-old baby, and you can imagine what that means. Our weekly [sic] budget is between two thousand and twenty-two hundred dollars per month and we have a membership of one hundred and thirty-five--mostly women. We must continually fight, however, to maintain our institution. We need more financial support and more forces. We also need a home for our institution which does such brilliant work. We hope that the community will help us. Tonight we are having a mass meeting, at which our members and the public will receive a very pleasant surprise. Put all this in the paper and you will be doing us a favor."</p>

   <p>I have put it all in the paper, not because I want to do somebody a favor, but because Jewish women who do such important work should be supported. I wish that every Jewish woman in Chicago would become interested in some such philanthropic institution--there would be less misery and poverty on the Jewish streets in Chicago.</p>
