   <p>What has been done in reference to Michael Reese Hospital? So far it is rather quiet. There are only two weeks left in which to accomplish something. According to our latest information, the money collectors can not get together on the collection proposition. It seems that the collectors are in great competition as to who will or can collect the most money for the hospital. Hence the delay in getting the proper results. It is all because every collector wants the honor of showing the biggest collections, while if the collectors were all united in having all funds in one pot, we are sure that better results would have been accomplished.</p>
