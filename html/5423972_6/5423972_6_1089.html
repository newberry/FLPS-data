   <p>The case of Mrs. Chayd Neshelman, 50 years old, of 2908 West 12th Street, against the Progressive Order of the West, is one of the most interesting cases ever to come before the local courts.</p>
   <p>About two years ago, Mrs. Neshelman was awarded five hundred dollars from the Progressive Order of the West by the Circuit Court. Mrs. Neshelman, over two years ago, had sprained an arm. According to her policy held with the Progressive Order of the West, she was entitled to insurance. The Order denied this fact, so she started legal procedure against it. A jury awarded her five hundred dollars. Her lawyer was Mr. Max M. Korshak.</p>
   <p>The Order appealed the case, but for certain technical reasons, it was thrown out of the higher court to be returned to the lower courts for a <span class="page-break">\2</span>new trial. This occurred in the summer of 1918.</p>
   <p>In March 1919, Mr. Korshak began a new trial. The Grand Counsel of the Order, Samuel Makon, refused to accept the case, or to give information regarding the Order's representatives in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Korshak then applied to the insurance department of the State, receiving the information he needed there. As a rule, when a lawyer calls for information such as Mr. Korshak asked of Mr. Makon, a second lawyer, it is generally furnished.</p>
   <p>Several weeks ago, Mr. Harry Wolf, one of the supreme officers of the Order in Chicago, brought to trial, not only Mrs. Neshelman, but also Mr. Neshelman, her husband. Mr. Wolf accused them of seeking to extort money from the Order illegally, and wished to <span class="page-break">\3</span>oust them, through court procedure as members in the Order.</p>
   <p>It was now necessary for Mr. Korshak to acquaint himself with the rules and by-laws of the Order. He, therefore, wrote to the main office for a copy of their Constitution. This correspondence was ignored. He, once more, had to resort to the insurance department of the State for aid.</p>
   <p>Then the Grand Lodge began to deny that it had anything to do with the prosecution of Mr. and Mrs. Neshelman, stating that the procedure was instituted by the local lodge to which Mr. and Mrs. Neshelman belonged.</p>
   <p>"This does not appear to be so," said lawyer Korshak, "because Harry Wolf, who signed the prosecutions, does not belong to the Palestine Lodge to which the Neshelmans belong."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The Neshelmans are aged people. If they are ousted from the Order, they will not be able to join another lodge because of their extreme age. A jury awarded Mrs. Neshelman five hundred dollars. A doctor explained that she will never be able to use her hand again. But the Order turns a deaf ear, and carries on a huge legal fight costing hundreds of dollars against a poor old woman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Korshak has at last made a statement that he will instigate a litigation which will forbid the Order to operate lodges in the State of Illinois.</p>
