   <p>A group of Jewish men and women have recently organized a Society for the purpose of helping the unfortunate patients in the State Hospitals at Dunning and Kankakee whom the officers are willing to discharge, but who have neither relatives nor friends to take them out during the probationary period. This Society will undertake the task of receiving such unfortunates from these institutions, and either give them a temporary haven and help them find their relatives and friends, who should care for them, or help create work for them.</p>
   <p>The Society already has about three hundred members and hopes to increase its membership soon. Mrs. S. Simansky, 1130 South Sacramento Boulevard, is chairman of the Society.</p>
   <p>The Society will hold a mass meeting Wednesday evening, January 10, at Temple Judea on Independence Boulevard. Dr. Coffe, superintendent of the State Hospital in Dunning,will be the principal speaker. Rabbis Moskowitz and Pearlman will also address the meeting.</p>
