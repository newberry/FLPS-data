   <p>For sometime, our Jewish Community has been attempting to raise money to make the necessary repairs for the Hebrew Institute, which was badly damaged by fire a few months ago, and to build the necessary accomodations for orphans, the present home having been clearly demonstrated to be thoroughly inadequate. In spite of various fund raising activities, sufficient money has to date not been collected.</p>
   <p>At present the Young Men's Christian Association is engaged in a drive to raise a million dollars. A goodly portion of this money was subscribed to by Jews. We know that the Y. M. C. A. is a very fine institution and carries on many worthwhile activities, and we are not averse to Jews lending their support in making this drive a success. Our complaint lies in the fact that when these same Jews are asked to participate in some fund raising activities for Jewish Institutions of similar or greater values, these Jews are not at home to our representatives. They lend a deaf ear to our pleas and exhortations, they forget that we, a new growing people in a new community, are in even greater need of their support.</p>

   <p>We have heard of the thousands and hundred thousands of dollars contributed by Jews to the Y. M. C. A. Drive. We are happy to see our Jews taking a greater part in non-Jewish community activities. We are happy to show the world that Jews think not only of themselves. But, we do feel that we are as important as our non-Jewish brethren. We have only a small Jewish community to appeal to for funds. Non-Jews have a much larger community to appeal to. Therefore we Jews must help ourselves. Charity begins at home. Rich Jews are expected to contribute to Jewish activities as well as non-Jewish activities.</p>
   <p>But we have not lost hope, our youth seems to have found itself. Our youth seems to have found new energy, new life. This is clearly evidenced in the use of our youth activities, debating clubs, dramatic groups, cultural groups, labor organizations, and aid groups. All these are evidence of new life, new activities and new cultural development. When the old generation of rich Jews is leaving us the new generation is coming back to us.</p>
