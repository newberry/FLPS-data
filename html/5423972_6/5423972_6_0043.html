   <p>In the previous article [same title, Courier, March 30, 1913] we have pointed out that one of the reasons why the Talmud Torah does not make as much progress as the public school is because the classes meet during a very poor time of day. In this article we shall discuss the problem of school housing, especially the striking difference between the two types of school buildings and their effect on the children.</p>
   <p>Jews, more than any other nation, were the first nation in the world to recognize the importance of child education--at a time when there wasn't even a trace of a school [among the other nations]. In one of the brilliant passages of the Talmud the story of the establishment of a large Jewish school is related. It was called the Yeshivah ben Gamlah. The rabbis said Judaism was preserved because of the merits of the Yeshivah.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>It would appear, therefore, that the Jews should have solved this problem--the school problem--and should have a better understanding of it than any other nation. Unfortunately, the contrary is true. Other nations have surpassed us in this respect. We are backward.</p>
   <p>Let us consider the structure housing [a Hebrew school and a public school], and note the great difference. The public school building is large and possesses every convenience: a beautiful entrance, windows removed from the street to prevent any interference with the lesson, and large playgrounds. As the child enters the school he begins to feel a certain amount of respect toward it. Inside the school building the rooms are clean, well-ventilated, and well-lighted; the equipment is the best, most beautiful, and costliest. Nothing seems too good for the health and comfort of the pupil.</p>
   <p>Such a situation makes a good impression on the pupil. His physical health is safeguarded as well as his intellectual development. A doctor is within the school premises in case of sickness, and a fire escape and fire alarms are <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>available in order to safeguard the pupils in time of danger.</p>
   <p>Hosts of people support the public schools. They have plenty of money and millions of workers who are engaged in educational work and who are planning how to improve the school building as well as the educational system.</p>
   <p>The difference between the building situation in the public schools and the Talmud Torahs now becomes clear. It is well known how a Talmud Torah is established. The masses are usually indifferent. Only a few Jews, prominent individuals interested in Jewish education, assemble and decide to build a Talmud Torah before they even dream of buying a lot. They begin to gather collections and then start to work on their plans. They also act as architects, drawing up a plan for the school. Then, "with the aid of God," the building is completed, the name "Talmud Torah" is given to it, and classes are opened in it for study.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to stop and speak of Talmud Torahs where children are taught in garrets, where the floors have not been washed since creation (this, of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>course, is not important in education!), and where the pupils write profane language on the dusty windows. Such Talmud Torahs are not worth discussing because they do more harm than good. When we speak of Talmud Torahs we mean those buildings that were originally built for educational purposes. These structures are usually close to the street and have no playgrounds where children can spend their time before going to class. There are no ventilators, no good seats, and no fire escapes. Even those Talmud Torahs which have fire escapes lack fire alarms. The corridors leading to the different classes are dark and narrow, and the steps are made of wood.</p>
   <p>I do not know who constructed our Talmud Torahs. I am sure, however, that they had no love or devotion to Jewish education when they built them. They made a few mistakes--for which they cannot be blamed--whatever cannot be amended cannot be helped. Yet such trivial things as fire alarms can be installed at any time.</p>
   <p>In the public schools the windows are installed in such a way that the light should enter on the left side of the child--so that his hand should not hide the light when writing. We conduct our classes in small rooms where sunshine <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>never enters. In the public schools the rooms are measured in order to determine the air capacity, and thereby know how many pupils can be accommodated in one classroom. We crowd seats into our rooms and command two children to sit at a single desk. The children are pressed together like sardines in a can. A law was at one time enforced among us which did not permit a teacher to have more than twenty-five pupils. Now we allow classes including anywhere from thirty-five to sixty pupils to exist.</p>
   <p>Some will say that it is foolish to point out the need for a beautiful Talmud Torah when what we need is a good educational system. Our parents studied in poor schools and studied there with pleasure. They knew nothing about public schools or their modern conveniences. School included all of their interests in life and could be compared to nothing else.</p>
   <p>In America, however, we should point out that the situation is entirely different. When the Jewish child leaves the beautiful public school and enters the Talmud Torah he loses respect for his Jewish studies, the teacher, and the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>principal. And when respect is lost--everything is lost.</p>
   <p>School housing, therefore, is the second thing which obstructs the progress of our Talmud Torahs. When I consider the detriment which stands in our way on the one hand, and the work we have accomplished on the other hand, I marvel at the patience possessed by the Jewish teacher and the knowledge that the children have gained during the season.</p>
