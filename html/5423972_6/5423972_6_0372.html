   <p>No stronger argument could be raised to affirm that Zionism fits in the higher human aims of modern times than the two brief speeches made in Chicago yesterday, by Mr. Louis D. Brandeis.</p>
   <p>His first speech was made at a luncheon at the Sherman Hotel for the Cook County judges, who assembled to honor Mr. Brandeis. His second speech was made in the evening at the Zionist banquet in the Ashland Club House.</p>
   <p>The audiences were strikingly different, and the subject spoken on for the first assembly had to be very different from the subject dealt with at the second assembly, although both led to the same central idea. Chicago Jews should be thankful to Mr. Brandeis for the message he brought them.</p>
