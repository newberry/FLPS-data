   <p>Although I am not a church pillar, I was glad to read the announcement, that the "Jewish Haute Volee" from Chicago intends to build a Jewish Seminary. This is most praise worthy, as it is important that Hebrew should not be forgotten entirely. We can learn from our non-Jewish brethren and see what care they take of their denominational schools. It cannot be denied that most of our young people cannot read one word of Hebrew, cannot even distinguish Alew from Bet; that they do not know how to say their names in the Hebrew language, do not know the names of the holy days nor their meaning. Provided the children know what is needed for business, the rest is unimportant as long as they are able to walk the streets with newspapers or are able to sell matches and shoe polish. It was time that the gentlemen made this important decision. It is to be hoped that the fate of this seminary will not be similar to the school founded a few years ago by Mr. L. Silverman, which lasted only for a short while.</p>
