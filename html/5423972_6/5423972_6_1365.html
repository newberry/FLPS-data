   <p>This is a communication in the form of an appeal to the Jews of Chicago, for contributions to the support of the Jewish Consumptive Sanitarium in Denver, Colorado.</p>
   <p>The appeal is to all presidents of synagogues in and around Chicago, to all quorums, secretaries and officers, requesting them to grant to the Sanitarium the privilege of placing contribution plates in all synagogues and other gathering places where the Jewish people of Chicago will gather to worship on the high holidays. The custom of the contribution plates has been established by the Consumptive Sanitarium, in Chicago and in other big cities, five years ago, with successful results, and we can rest assured that this year will be another good one.</p>
   <p>Rabbi R. S. Israels is the legal representative of the Jewish Consumptive Sanitarium, and any favors shown him by the different places of Jewish worship, will be highly appreciated by the Sanitarium and its officers.</p>
   <p>Very Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Philip Hilkovitz, President</p>
   <p>Chas. D. Spivack, Secretary.</p>
