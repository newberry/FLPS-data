   <p>The society for establishing free schools where instruction in German and Hebrew, as well as religious instruction will be given, will meet next Sunday at Druid Hall, 626 Milwaukee Avenue, at 4 P. M. For the last three weeks Mr. Isidor Brother and Mr. Adolph Pike have been working indefatigably for this laudable purpose. They have thus far succeeded in getting up a list of fifty members who have declared their willingness to join the society and to contribute toward its support. Next Sunday they will meet at the above-named place to adopt a preamble, to organize themselves, and to elect officers.</p>
