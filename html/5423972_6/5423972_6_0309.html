   <p>A popular demand among the active members of our movement has recently developed to establish an open forum in which the Workmen's Circle, the Jewish Socialist Alliance and the United Hebrew Trades shall participate.</p>
   <p>The educational committee of the Workmen's Circle brought forth a recommendation to the City Central Committee that they shall establish an open forum where lecturers from various sections of the labor movement shall be invited and a discussion by the attendants shall follow the lecture.</p>
   <p>The City Central Committee accepted this proposal and determined that the Socialist Alliance and the Hebrew Trades shall be invited to join the open forum. The above mentioned central bodies accepted the plan and the forum will open this Sunday in the Venetian Hall of the Labor Lyceum.</p>
   <p>Comrade Dr. Lorber will be the first lecturer. He will speak on "The Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Democracy." Admission free. Everybody welcome! No collections!</p>
