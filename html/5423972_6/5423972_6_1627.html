   <p>We Jews in Chicago are proud of our orphans home. This is strictly an orthodox institution where our Jewish orphaned children are being raised. They are trained and being prepared on a permanent orthodox Jewish religious foundation.</p>
   <p>This orphans home is sponsored by orthodox Jews, who would not contribute one cent if they thought or even suspected that there was a single item left out which was not strictly orthodox. Our contention is, and we can assure the citizens of Chicago that our Jewish Orphans Home is strictly an orthodox institution.</p>
