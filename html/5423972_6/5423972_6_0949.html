   <p>"No one can gainsay the practical utility and effectiveness of the institution known as the "Charity Ball, especially when managed as capably as those given by the Young Men's Hebrew Charity Association of this city. It is estimated that within fourteen years of its existence, this society has given $150,000 to the cause of charity. Tuesday night's ball was probably the most successful of the series. It was certainly the most brilliant of all the balls thus far given by the association, and the amount of money to go to charitable ends will probably exceed $20,000.</p>
   <p>The members of the association have a right to congratulate themselves on their success. It is the sort of success the Hebrews usually achieve when they turn their energies to philanthropic ends. And, as is the case of many of the beneficent deeds of this charitable race, the amount received will be distributed to worthy and needy causes irrespective of all considerations of sect or creed." - Editorial in Chicago Daily Record.</p>
