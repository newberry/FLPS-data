   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>Seventeen years have rolled by since a handful of Israelites formed the Relief Society. Beginning its life of charity under the strong and unrestrained impulse of the Jewish heart, there grew in the line of its program many evils. Without order or system, without means to detect impositions, without plan in the collection or distribution of its funds, its charity was abused, its kindly offices bestowed alike upon the deserving and undeserving, and in common with kindred societies, it tolerated if it did not create, in our midst a large number of unworthy pensioners. The most patent errors, at least, have been corrected. System has been introduced in the work of the Association; its charity is distributed by principle, and not by caprice. Prudence in the exercise of power, judicious investigation of the character, life and habits of the applicant, the establishment of rigid rules and strict adherence to them in practice, have in a great measure cured these evils.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Our present system of collecting the funds of the Association has been in use for many years. When the city was prosperous, when money was plenty, and before the financial crisis of 1863, that system served its purpose. Today, its usefulness is gone. The old circle of contributions is rapidly diminishing. Death has taken from us many a generous citizen. These vacancies in our ranks have never been filled. The increase of population has brought us an increase of pensioners. Nothing more. The burden of maintaining your charity is now borne by comparatively few generous citizens. Collecting committees find this work disheartening, and in some quarters of the City utterly unavailing.</p>
   <p>With our meagre funds we can only relieve temporary distress. The primary object of the Association should be, to give permanent relief, to place its sound and healthy applicants in a position where they will cease to need help, and will earn their own livelihood.</p>
   <p>There is one feature to which we wish to call your attention. Many of our applicants have daughters, strong,healthy, and well-advanced in womanhood. These daughters refuse (and are encouraged by their parents) to engage in household employments. They absolutely refuse to do housework of any kind. To do housework is degrading, they tell us.They feel as though it were dishonorable to engage as Domestics.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The statistics of the Association may afford some food for reflection. We give such matters as we have been able to collect.</p>
   <p>During the year we have relieved one-hundred and eighty-five resident-families, aggregating 981 persons, and about 275 strangers. Of the 185 resident-families, about 23 are new applicants. Sixteen families were transported to sister-cities. Of the families transported last year, six have returned, The Association maintains as regular pensioners, fourteen widows, and twenty-one women who have been deserted and left destitute by their worthless husbands. During the year, sixteen adults and twenty-one infant wards of the Association departed this life and were buried by the Association, at a cost of $36.30. We have expended $222.95 in medicines and medical aid, and consumed about 300 tons of coal.</p>
   <p>The Ladies of the several societies, as is their custom, have been of great service to the Association.</p>
   <p>The South-Side Sewing Society has expended, in the purchase of clothing, dry-goods, etc. nearly $1,200, and in addition thereto, they have distributed nearly $400. worth of made-up clothing of all kinds donated by individual members and by the West Side Sewing Society.</p>
   <p>The North and West Side Societies have been taking excellent care of the poor in their several districts. Not having their reports, we cannot detail</p>

   <p>Although very limited in its funds during the winter, the Association with its branches, has done some good work</p>
