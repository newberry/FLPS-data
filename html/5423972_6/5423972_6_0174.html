   <p>The examinations held at the Sabbath school yesterday afternoon proved to the community that the efforts of the school to instill a love and understanding of Judaism and Jewish history in the hearts and minds of our youth during the past year were highly successful. The examinations proved conclusively that the efforts of the instructors, Miss Lipsky, Miss Blum, and Mr. Max Shulman, were not in vain.</p>
   <p>The children showed that they had an excellent understanding of Jewish history and Jewish lore. The number of children who excelled in Hebrew were too numerous to mention here. The hearts of our older generation were indeed gladdened, since they had felt that the Jewish youth of America was becoming completely estranged from the traditions of their people.</p>
