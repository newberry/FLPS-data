   <p>Two Ladies Aid Societies, The Kiev Jewish Ladies Aid Society and the Wohliner Relief Organization, were recently united. They have decided to organize a day nursery for the children of workers in the Douglas Park neighborhood.</p>
   <p>These two societies are assured by the Forward and other prominent people of the support needed for this undertaking. An institution of this kind has been greatly in demand in this neighborhood.</p>
   <p>The poor working women who have small children to take care of are in a desperate situation.</p>
   <p>The two societies are very optimistic in their undertaking. With the support of all workers organizations and their agencies, they are certain of success.</p>
