   <p>We have on our desk letters from doctors and other people. All the letters tell of the terrible state of affairs at the Mount Sinai Hospital and of the scandals that happen there. We learn from these letters that mismanagement, neglect, cheap politics, and irresponsibility reign in the office and wards of the fire trap on Rebecca Street (sic) and California Avenue, which bears the kosher name of Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
   <p>The letters confirm the stories about scandals and terrible acts in connection with the Mount Sinai Hospital, stories that we have already heard. They also tell us about new scandals, acts of mismanagement and irresponsibility about which we have not heard as yet. The letters also confirm the assertion that has been frequently made, that the hospital is thoroughly degenerate, <span class="page-break">2</span>that it is a private institution, that the charity monies it receives are being taken under false pretenses.</p>
   <p>The Mount Sinai Hospital is an institution where only a few physicians can have their patients attended, where the president and two "big shots" there are busy in their self-chosen role of public workers, while the nurses manage and run the institution. This is attested to by physicians, sick poor people, and premature graves in Waldheim. Max Berger, the poor Maxwell Street peddler who was brought to the hospital suffering from blood poison and who was not taken care of there, is not the only victim of the Mount Sinai Hospital. There are others who have also suffered a terrible fate there.</p>
   <p>We do not know which one of the letters to quote first.</p>
   <p>We read in one letter about a patient by the name of Mrs. Weiner, who insisted that she be brought to the [Mount Sinai] Hospital because it is <span class="page-break">3</span>kosher. She came to give birth to a baby. She had had the flu a week before she came to the hospital and suffered from terrible pains, which became so severe that she could not stand them any more. The doctor decided to put an end to those pains. The baby was born alive but the intern, without the doctor's knowledge, put a tube into the baby's throat and blew so long that the baby's lungs burst. The baby died. The nurses and the interns of the hospital had been warned that the mother might have a hemorrhage, and that therefore she should be carefully watched. The doctor in this case, although he lives on the North Side, went to sleep not far from the hospital, in case he was needed by his patient. The patient, however, remained alone. The nurses had either neglected her or forgotten about her. The patient was alone for five hours. It took all of her strength to get off the bed, drag herself to the door, and knock in the hope that somebody would come in. Nobody came in. The nurses had disappeared completely. The poor woman was later found dead on the floor.</p>
   <p>We read in a second letter about the case of a young woman, nineteen years <span class="page-break">4</span>old, who, shortly after that [Mrs. Weiner's case], was brought to the [Mount Sinai] Hospital for an appendix operation. She came there in the evening and was supposed to be operated upon next day, at twelve noon. The patient was put in a ward for little children, in a small bed, just as in Sodom. The doctor in this case called in a well-known surgeon to perform the operation. This surgeon came to the hospital half an hour before the appointed time. As he was not one of the "chosen few", he was told by a nurse that no operating work was being done that day. The "busy" president was conferring at that time with a South Side surgeon, who is a sort of a bogeyman at the hospital, used to frighten people and to belittle capable West Side surgeons, that they should not dare to lift their voices. The doctor in this case, together with the surgeon took the feverish patient to another hospital. The Mount Sinai Hospital, however, kept the money which the patient had paid for her room.</p>
   <p>We read in a third letter the story of a woman who, expecting confinement, registered at the hospital at the proper time. She rented a room and paid <span class="page-break">5</span>a good price for it. When she began to suffer from labor pains, the doctor called up the hospital to prepare the rented room. The doctor in this case was not one of "the chosen-few physicians" of the hospital. He was told by the hospital that there was no room. It was late at night. The doctor and the patient insisted upon their rights. She was brought to the Mount Sinai Hospital. The patient was put upon a stretcher while they looked for a room. They were looking for a room for four hours, although there were four vacant beds. The weak woman had to be taken to another hospital.</p>
   <p>The other letters tell of similar terrible stories and the "closed shop" maintained by the Mount Sinai Hospital for the benefit of a few physicians.</p>
   <p>The most terrible story that we have heard is the story of a baby who was put, while alive, into an ice box. The coroner's jury that made the inquest found out that the baby had died of pneumonia. This story we will tell you at another time. This case alone is sufficient to stamp the manager of the scandalous Mount Sinai Hospital as a most incompetent person, and one who <span class="page-break">6</span>snaps his fingers at public opinion.</p>
