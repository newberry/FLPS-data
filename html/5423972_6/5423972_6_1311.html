   <p>All is well that ends well, so the saying goes.</p>
   <p>The Investigating Committee of the Maimonedes Hospital has completed its work and completed it so well that from all indications everything will be fine. The Investigating Committee certainly did not handle the directors of the Maimonedes Hospital with silk gloves, a fact which proves its independence and strong sentiment for justice. The charges preferred by the committee against the directors of the hospital are not aimed at the hospital alone. They are aimed at all our charitable institutions, which are in line for investigation in the future. The Maimonedes Hospital was built by our young generation, those in whom we put our entire faith for posterity, and when they did the same as their elders, there was no other way out but to act.</p>
   <p>In the older institutions it is only natural to find occasionally an official who neglects his work and duties. Yet they are tolerated because <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of their past activities and their age which is highly respected. But in an institution like the Maimonedes Hospital, a young and new project, why is it that a large majority of the Board of Directors have neglected their work and not fulfilled their duties? Such a thing should not have happened in an institution run by the best element of our young people.</p>
   <p>Upon considering the second clause of the report that "the hospital was opened before everything was brought to order," we realized that this wrong was not so terrible, for young people are naturally a bit too hasty. Had it not been for a few people who accelerated the construction of the Home for the Aged, we would not have that beautiful edifice today. The Marks Nathan Orphanage would probably still have $15,000 in its treasury were it not for a few live-wires who didn't stop working until it became a colossal edifice on Albany Avenue. The Maimonedes Hospital is no exception. The new hospital for consumptives now under construction, as well as the new Talmud Torah (Hebrew School) planned for the future, only can be built if there are a few active men and women to expedite the projects.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The great wrong of the third clause of the Investigating Committee does not lie in the "too hasty appointment of the doctors to the staff," but appointments of staff doctors were made with strong personal inclinations. This wrong must be corrected.</p>
   <p>The other three clauses (1) that the constant quarreling among the doctors is detrimental to the hospital, (2) that the internes were not examined, and (3) that the nurses are not duly organized, are not wrongs but sad circumstances which affect every hospital. In time the bickering doctors, the incompetent internes, and the unorganized nurses would fall by the board. The Maimonedes Hospital was, however, suffering from an overdose of this, for which the directors are not to be blamed but simply the professional or, better said, the entire West Side Jewry.</p>
   <p>And let us herein spill the truth regardless of how bitter it may be. Our West Side doctors, - we mean a great majority of them, with all due respect to the others, - have not had the opportunity of acquiring a suitable <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>elementary education; they were not trained as they should have been; they have not the nobleness, the refinement, and the polish of an educated man, and they lack that which constitutes an intellectual aristocrat. Many of them have gone to night-school while holding a job, and being under such a strain it was impossible for them to brush up on their manners. They endured a great deal of hardship to get their diplomas. And when they got their diplomas, their material condition was at stake.</p>
   <p>These conditions have naturally caused many of our doctors to play a double part in life, something similar to a Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. In their neighborhood, where they were known and where they desired to practice, they sought to gain the respect of the people by conducting themselves properly and displaying a sign with the ethical wording, "Dr. So and So, Physician and Surgeon." They had regular office hours, but in order to earn a livelihood, they dressed themselves in working clothes, went to some remote part of town where they were unknown, and engaged in common labor.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Others were quacks and still others have violated ethical laws which doctors are forbidden to violate.</p>
   <p>When a doctor becomes a quack or violates the ethics of his profession, he usually earns money. As soon as their legitimate practice increases, they lessen their violations of ethical laws until they become good physicians and surgeons. A small percentage cannot resist the temptation of money, so they remain quacks. But a great number of West Side doctors bear upon their shoulders "sins of youth" which they committed when they graduated, notwithstanding their present prominence, honesty, and even good reputation of being good physicians and surgeons.</p>
   <p>And these doctors were to make up the staff. Is it then any wonder why so much mud slinging, accusations, disputes, and slander have become the order of the day in Maimonedes Hospital? No particular person is to be blamed; we all should stand the blame. Our leaders can be judged by our society.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>We must not forget that not only our doctors are on such a plane but we, as a whole, are not any better.</p>
   <p>About the seventh clause, "The expenditures drastically exceed the hospital's income," we can say that we need not deplore this fact. It is certainly an honor for the Maimonedes Hospital, for their doctors, for the officers and directors, and for the entire Jewish district of the West Side in general. After all, the death rate in Maimonedes was lower than in any other hospital. Under all circumstances, good care has been given to the patients for whose benefit the hospital was built.</p>
   <p>This fact alone shows that the "small number of directors who have been so active" will help the reorganization committee make the hospital what it should be, a Jewish monument for posterity. The hospital will remain open and be run by a staff of doctors who will restore health to its patients.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Considering everything, the investigation turned out much better than the best friends of the hospital could have expected.</p>
   <p>All is well that ends well.</p>
