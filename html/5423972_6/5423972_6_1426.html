   <p>The Chicago Lying-In Hospital and Dispensary was founded in Feb., 1895. It began its work in four dark rented rooms in a big tenement on Maxwell St. The Y. M. H. C. A. appropriated $200 for its establishment and to this sum was added three subscriptions of $50 each from three well-known Jews. The times were unpropitious for the new institution and its struggle was hard. On several occasions financial disaster was very near, but each time a helping Jewish hand was offered and the crisis passed.</p>
   <p>The first quarters of the Dispensary proved inadequate and more room was obtained in a Methodist Mission. Soon these rooms were not large enough to accomodate the growing staff of doctors, students, and nurses and a large building was erected at Maxwell St. and Newberry Ave. This new structure cost $20,000 and was opened in May, 1904. There is also a sub-station dispensary on the North-West Side and one on the South Side.</p>
   <p>Since opening the first Dispensary on Maxwell St., the institution has offered <span class="page-break">2</span>courses of instruction to students and doctors of medicine.</p>
   <p>In 1899 the growing need of a haven, where patients requiring especial care could be sent, induced the Women's Board to open a lying-in hospital. A large house was rented at 294 Ashland Blvd., remodeled and furnished at a cost of $2,000, and on Sept. 2, the first patient was admitted. In the same year an incubator station was built in the hospital, the first of its kind in the U. S.</p>
   <p>In the ten years since the installation of the Maxwell St. Dispensary, nearly 6,000 women have been cared for in their own homes. In addition 2,000 other obstetric cases have been attended. 1,100 cases are being taken care of each year. At the Hospital 750 women have been confined and an additional 150 miscellaneous obstetric cases handled. 200 cases are being treated each year. 1,000 students and doctors have received special instruction in obstetric art and science and are now practicing these advanced teachings in the Central and Western states.</p>
   <p>The A. J. C. contributes $3,000 annually to the support of the institution.</p>
