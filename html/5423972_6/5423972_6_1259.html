   <p>The banquet last evening which marked the close of the convention of the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society of Denver was a grand and impressive affair. More than two hundred and fifty prominent men and women were assembled around the table and, after being entertained with a real kosher dinner, heard some addresses made in behalf of the sufferers from consumption. Some of those present gave personal donations. The majority undertook to procure certain sums for the Sanatorium. Mr. Harry Wolf, in behalf of the Progressive Order of the West, pledged the sum of one thousand dollars; Dr. R. L. Halpern, in behalf of Order B'rith Sholom, five hundred dollars; Isadore Cohn, two hundred dollars; Rabbi Saul Silber, five hundred dollars; Workmen's Circle, one hundred dollars; and S. B. Komaiko, one hundred dollars. Smaller and larger sums were contributed by the others. Judge Henry Horner was toastmaster and addresses were made by Rabbi Silber, Leon Zolotokoff, Dr. Chaim Spivak, Dr. Philip Hillkowitz, Mrs. Gordon of the Winfield Sanitarium, Mr. Komaiko and others.</p>

   <p>The fourteenth annual convention of the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society of Denver was officially opened yesterday morning in the Crystal Room of the Sherman Hotel, and continued until evening with the exception of a couple of hours for the recess period. Mr. Isadore Cohn was the chairman. The first to report on the activities of the Denver Sanatorium was Dr. Philip Hillkowitz, president of the institution; following him, the chairmen of the various departments of the institution delivered their reports. This convention differed entirely from the conventions of other Jewish organizations; it bore a decidedly different character because it did not deal with any resolutions or any discussions as to how committees should be appointed. There were no committees for they were not necessary. The main task of the convention was to hear the report of the superintendent of the institution, and then to carry out the outlined program of action.</p>
   <p>The most interesting of all reports was that made by Dr. Chain Spivak, the secretary of the Society. Although dealing with scientific terminology, his explanations were so clear and concise that everyone understood him thoroughly.</p>

   <p>Dr. Spivak pointed out that during the fourteen-year existence of the Sanatorium it had had 2974 cases, of which 2066 were those of persons born in Russia. The average age of the victims of the white plague was between twenty and forty years. He put the sufferers of consumption in three categories. This he did in order to bring out clearly how the institution acts when admitting patients. If, for instance, a person who is not yet in a dangerous condition applies for admittance and is notified that he will be admitted as soon as there is a vacancy, and if at the same time a person suffering from the last stage of the terrible disease applies for admittance, then the rules are overlooked. The person suffering most will be admitted first. The whole procedure would not be necessary if the Sanatorium possessed adequate space. The Sanatorium has become far too small for the number of patients who apply to it; it needs more beds, more cottages, more space, and it fervently hopes that the great Jewish masses who helped to build the Sanatorium when it first began, and who since then have supported it, will continue to do so in the future, enlisting for it more friends and subscribers.</p>

   <p>Another important point which Dr. Spivak mentioned is the problem of what to do with those patients who have recovered fully and have been discharged from the Sanatorium. They are no longer in need of the institution's facilities, but must remain in the mild climate of Denver and must not work too hard. They must be cared for, they must be supported! But who shall do it? The Central Jewish Aid Society does this noble work. This Society consists of all elements of the Jews in Denver and is supported by the Sanatorium with a yearly subsidy of five thousand dollars; the other sanitarium in Denver, that of the Reformed Jews, contributes a like sum annually and the Society itself raises a sum of ten thousand dollars a year. Consequently, despite its shortage of funds and space, the Sanatorium is nevertheless forced to contribute to the support of those who are actually outside its jurisdiction. He concluded his report with a warm appeal to the Jews of America to support the Sanatorium, which in its scope is a national institution; he also stated that if every Jew did his duty toward the Sanatorium, then it would be possible to eradicate to a great extent the terrible pest from Jewish centers throughout the country.</p>

   <p>Dr. Spivak began to read his report at the first session. He completed it in the second session, at which Mr. Samuel Macon presided. Upon the motion of Dr. Spivak, the convention invited the famous Jewish poet Yehoash (S. Blumgarten), who is now a guest in Chicago and is one of the principal founders of the Denver Sanatorium, to speak to it.</p>
   <p>A committee composed of Dr. A. Levinson, Dr. S. Claper and Mr. Bernard Shulman carried the invitation to the noted author, who came with them back to the convention hall. The great poet received a stormy and enthusiastic reception. In a brief but beautiful address he pointed to the remarkable growth of the Sanatorium. He declared that he still remembers the time when the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars was collected during an effort made for the benefit of the Sanatorium. The enthusiasm resulting from this success was then so great that many wanted to celebrate the occasion. And now he had heard that the income of the institution reaches the total of one hundred and seventy thousand dollars and is still not enough.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Yehoash stated that the dissatisfaction of the Sanatorium with its present income proves that the number of sufferers has increased considerably, and he therefore appealed to everyone to aid with everything in his power the fight against the white plague, and to expel it from wherever Jews live.</p>
   <p>Interesting reports were then given by the examining physicians in Chicago, Dr. A. Levinson, Dr. M. Sahood, Dr. S. Claper, and Dr. Morris Levinson. Of equal interest were the reports of the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society of Chicago and of the Chicago-Winfield Sanitarium.</p>
   <p>The following persons extended greetings to the convention in behalf of organizations which support the Sanatorium: L. Benenson of the Workmens Circle, Julius Savitsky of the Jewish National Workers Alliance, Jacob Goldber [Goldberg (?)] of the Progressive Order of the West, Dr. R. L. Halpern of the Order B'rith Sholom, Isadore Liederman of the Knights of Joseph, Charles Bonus of the Order B'rith Abraham, and a representative of Independent Order B'rith Abraham.</p>

   <p>A little controversy ensued, caused by the report of the nominating committee which has always nominated only residents of Denver as candidates for trustees. Many were of the opinion that by this action an injustice was being committed against other cities. Later it was proved that the trustees ought to be persons residing near the Sanatorium in order to participate actively in the business of the institution and to attend its meetings. The candidates proposed by the nominating committee were then elected. [The names of the candidates follow.]</p>
