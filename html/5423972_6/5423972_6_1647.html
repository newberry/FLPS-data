   <p>Ladies Aid Society of the Orphan's Home.</p>
   <p>The following is a report of the Ladies Aid Society concerning its disposition of the cash and clothes collected by the Orphan's Home.</p>
   <p>The second anniversary of our organization was on Dec. 23, last, on which date we turned over $3,500 to the Jewish Orphan's Home. Since that time, we have refurnished the entire Synagogue of the Orphan's Home with the following articles: curtains for the holy Ark and all other necessities in the Synagogue. New furniture in the reception room; seventy pillows for almost all the beds, as well as 350 slips and spreads; towels and table covers. For the holidays we presented the boys with new suits and white vests. To the girls we presented woolen dresses. In the Summer we furnished them with suitable summer clothes.</p>
   <p>We often visit the Home to find out the necessities of the orphans, which are soon supplied. We supplied the refreshments for the ball, which was a great <span class="page-break">\2</span>success.</p>
   <p>We, the members of the Aid Society, thank the public for cooperating with us by helping with good food, drink, and donations. Also, in the name of the Society, we thank our officers, Mrs. Adelson, Mrs. Seresevsky, Mrs. Nathan, Mrs. Cohn, Miss Sophie Hurwitz, and Mrs. Greenberg, who helped us with the work for the ball.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Leah Lazdin, Pres.</p>
