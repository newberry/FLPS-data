   <p>The Jewish Training School is no longer an experiment, it is a success. Not quite five years have elapsed since the opening of the school, but the results achieved during that half decade have more than justified the hopes and expectations of the far sighted and generous men and women who thought they were ardent admirers and supporters of the public school system founded this school from the earnest conviction that peculiar conditions existed in the Russian-Jewish Ghetto, to correct and improve which the public school was not adequately equipped.</p>
   <p>No less than nine hundred children were enrolled last year, and the average attendance was between seven and eight hundred. Every graduate of the Training School without a single exception, boy or girl, has a useful position in life. Six are printers, two are moulders, three are in law offices, two are connected with newspapers, two are truck farmers, three are teachers, two attend the Art Institute, two have their own dressmaking establishments, about a dozen are variously employed in wholesale mercantile houses, and most of the girls are milliners and dressmakers. Though as yet we teach no specific trades, the all-around training which our pupils receive fits them for the filling of responsible positions. Besides, we make every kind of personal effort to persuade the parents not to withdraw their children from school before the course has been completed, and though the temptation to use the earnings of child labor is very great among poor people, thirty four per cent of our graduates this year were members of the class since the school opened, a result which according to an eminent authority no public school in this country has ever achieved.</p>
   <p>Over one-half of the children of this city leave the public school before they finish the primary.</p>
