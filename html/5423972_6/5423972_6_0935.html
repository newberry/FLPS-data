   <p>The 17th annual charity ball of the Y. M. H. C. A. has been held. No affair of the kind ever given in Chicago equalled it in brilliancy or in its financial results. Over 7,000 of our leading people were in attendance, and about $30,000 will be the net profits to be distributed to our charitable institutions. This is the largest sum ever realized from a charity ball, exceeding that of last year by nearly $9,000. Much of the success was due to the ability of President Louis Echstein who gave careful attention to every detail.</p>
