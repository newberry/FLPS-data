   <p>At a meeting held last Sunday, of individuals interested in the work of our Jewish charitable institutions, definite steps were taken to unite the various societies for the purpose of raising and distributing the funds necessary for carrying on the work. The main institutions interested are the Jewish Training School, Home for Aged Jews, Home for Jewish Orphans, Michael Reese Hospital, and the Lying-in Hospital.</p>
   <p>The plan is to place these institutions under the control and management of one organization, with a central committee to receive and distribute the funds. It is planned to do away with all balls, bazaars, performances, etc., that, heretofore, have been the means of raising money, and to procure the necessary funds by guaranteed subscriptions. At least $100,000 will be needed, and of this amount, over $30,000 was subscribed in a few days.</p>
