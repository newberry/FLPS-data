   <p>At a meeting of the board of directors of the United Jewish Charities, which was held at the Standard Club, a letter written by Morris Kurtzon, president of the Mt. Sinai Hospital, was read. This letter reveals the conditions under which the Mt. Sinai Hospital will affiliate with the United Hebrew Charities. It was decided to appoint a new committee to reinvestigate the financial condition of the hospital, as well as other factors, and when the committee submits its report, the board of directors will act on Mr. Kurtzon's letter.</p>
