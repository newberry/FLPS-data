   <p>Justice and charity, in the old Jewish language of Hebrew, are one and the same word. Where justice rules there is no need for charity, but where charity is a necessity the indication is a lack of justice.</p>
   <p>Ancient Jews understood well this contradiction. Down the ages many attempts were made to clarify this with the saying that we cannot dismiss the poverty of the world, therefore, we must seek to justify it by "giving with an open hand," to generously give your brother all he needs. Again at other times arose the prophetic protests, "There shall be no poor among you. You are all equally children of one father, so why make the division of poor and rich among you?" It is at this period that Jewish thinkers evolved such community plans as the Sabbatical year (seventh year), the Shmitah (release), and the Yovel (fiftieth year), wherein the debts of the poor become void. If one brother had more, he shared a part of it with the other. Why should he make it charity? Sold houses and fields were returned to their original owners, those persons who sold themselves into slavery were again given their freedom.</p>

   <p>It is possible that one's poor condition may have been of his own making, but he and sometimes, his children have too long already suffered for it. It is a new jubilee. Everyone again receives his property and liberty which enables him once more to start life anew.</p>
   <p>Present day Jews cannot permit themselves to think of such plans as Shmitah and Yovel in this modern age. They are tenants in strange countries and a tenant cannot proceed with his plans of improving the home he lives in, for even if he should, it would all be done in vain. Present day Jews must, therefore, devote themselves to building homes of their own, if they wish justice instead of charity. As long as they do not do so, for there is as yet no possibility of establishing the "no poor among you," they must willingly or unwillingly be seeped in charity.</p>
   <p>Of late much has been written concerning the good and the bad of a Chicago's Jewish charity organization, the Federation of all Jewish Orthodox charitable institutions.</p>
   <p>But on praise or abuse one cannot quiet his hunger, or heal the sick, or give <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>a home to the aged or educate the orphan. The good and the bad of the leading communities are very important subjects at the ballot box of Federation officials, but is not official business during week days, when their efforts must be directed to the work of helping all needy institutions.</p>
   <p>Those who must apply to charity are certainly not to blame for the injustices of our times. Injustice has been supported thru all times in all lands by those elements that are able to give more than they. And, as long as charity serves as Justice, all those who are known or unknown associates in this unjust order of the world must pay every interest on this large debt that they owe to all victims of unjustice who must resort to charity.</p>
