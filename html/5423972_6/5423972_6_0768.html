   <p>To the subscribers of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities and to the Jewish public in general:</p>
   <p>People, claiming to represent the Hebrew Sheltering Home, have issued a rumor to the effect that the Federated Orthodox Charities had refused to finance the Hebrew Sheltering Home, and they, therefore, had found it necessary to send out collectors as they have done prior to the establishment of the Federation. We, therefore, think it is our duty to explain the recent events between the so-called representatives of the Hebrew Sheltering Home and the Federation.</p>
   <p>As is already known, the Federation was established: 1. to introduce order into the collection of charitable funds; 2. to abolish the expenses of collecting money which amounted to sixty per cent of all income; 3. to facilitate the work of raising funds for the directors of the institutions, so that they can improve the institutions; and 4. the charity funds should go to charity only, and everything should be operated in the most economical manner.</p>
   <p>Until now, the Federation fulfilled its mission. It cost but four per cent to collect the sum of $55,000.</p>
   <p>The work of the Federation is divided into four different committees. One of the committees is known as the budget committee, whose task it is to take care of all bills and expenses of the various institutions.</p>
   
   <p>A few months ago when the budget committee revised the bills which were submitted by the Hebrew Sheltering Home, it was revealed that a sum of $285, of which the Hebrew Sheltering Home was in receipt was not included in the accounts. The officers of the Hebrew Sheltering Home were immediately notified and they were requested to give an explanation about the $285 to the budget committee on some definite evening. The budget committee waited for the officers from eight to eleven o'clock in the evening and they failed to show up. A few days later a committee came to the office of the Federation, wanting to find out the reason for the Federation not having sent any money to the Hebrew Sheltering Home. The officers of the Federation, who were present, told them that a matter of $285 was awaiting an explanation. The officers of the Federation stated that they will still allot the agreed sum to the Hebrew Sheltering Home, if it will guarantee that the money will be used in a legitimate way, viz., to pay bills only, so that there should be no room for monkey business, as with the $285.</p>
   <p>The committee refused to guarantee this. Then the Federation heard that the Hebrew Sheltering Home called a meeting, where the officers proposed to part from the Federation and to begin collecting money in the old manner which can not be controlled and which requires no account to be given. However, the proposal was not accepted. Instead, they determined to reorganize the board of directors, and adopt a new constitution. This was carried through. A nomination committee was appointed and new directors were nominated.</p>
   
   <p>When it was revealed, however, that a few leaders were not nominated as directors, thereby removing their authority over the money, they declared themselves directors and elected themselves to office. After withdrawing $1400 from the bank, which belongs to the building fund, they now seek, under the mask of charity, to send out collectors for which they will not need to give any account, and thereby harm all charity institutions of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors which were elected legally, in the meantime, had held a meeting and elected the following officers:</p>
   <p>Mr. Thomas Piser, the well-known scholar and business man, as president; Mr. W. Farber, vice president; Mr. Abraham Tzeitlen, secretary: and the well-known philanthropist, Mr. Samuel Phillipson, treasurer.</p>
   
   <p>They are cooperating with the Federation and sought to arbitrate in a peaceful manner, but the illegal Board of Directors did not want to make peace.</p>
   <p>The legal Board of Directors, seeing that they could make no headway decided, therefore, to take over the Hebrew Sheltering Home. This was done without heeding the protests of the illegal Board of Directors......</p>
   <p>We appeal to Chicago Jewry, in the name of the Jewish charity institutions and in the name of righteousness, not to permit themselves to be misled by the collectors of the so-called Board of Directors of the Hebrew Sheltering Home. No one should help those who seek to receive money in the name of charity for which they do not have to give an account. The Federation has enough money and is willing to finance the Home, which is now governed by the legal Board of Directors.</p>
