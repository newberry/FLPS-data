   <p>We come to you again, as we did a year ago, with a brotherly call for our nation's relief, for our sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, who are practically starving to death in the war countries of Europe.</p>
   <p>New York city raised $5,000.000 for this worthy cause, and it is up to you in Chicago to do your part. We ask you in the name of the Jewish People Relief Organization, to contribute one day's wages from each union worker for the relief, of our starving people in the war-ridden countries of Europe.</p>
   <p>With brotherly greetings</p>
   <p>The United Jewish Workers</p>
   <p>R. Yookelson</p>
   <p>H. Snide</p>
