   <p>Never before has this body or any similar one in Chicago been so overburdened as during the trying winter of 1893. The mere figures can give you no conception of the labor performed. In fact, such was the nature of the demands that it was impossible at times to keep full statistics of applicants either for relief or for labor. We could do no more than to preserve the records of those cases in which help was given......The past winter has not afforded a special opportunity for testing new methods of work. The emergency was so extreme, the demands so strenuous,the suffering so great, that theory was everywhere cast to the winds, and too often the heart impelled where the head should have guided.</p>
   <p>A first step was taken, however, in the administration of Jewish charities, which is full of bright promises for the future. The women and the men joined forces; the Ladies Societies, the Aids, the Personnel Service, all of them acting on the incentive of a Women's Auxiliary Committee appointed by our Board co-operated with us and expended their monies under the direction of our worthy superintendent, Mr. Kiss.</p>

   <p>Along these lines the tasks of the future must be done. If we are to have a United Hebrew Charities, it must be a union of all bodies engaged in philanthropic work among the Jewish poor: there must be a general office, a unity of purpose, a harmony of action, and thereby an avoidance of all duplication.</p>
   <p>Every cent expended in aid of the Jewish poor should be given through our office, and a record thereof should be kept in our books. Each society will obtain due credit for its contribution....</p>
   <p>One gratifying element in this year's receipts was the fact that many names appear on our books for the first time. The directory of the Jews of Chicago, compiled by our worthy financial secretary, has thereby demonstrated its usefulness.</p>
