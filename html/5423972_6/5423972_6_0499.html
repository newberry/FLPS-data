   <p>A movement to build a monument which shall forever bear the inscription of our martyr and emancipator, Comrade Eugene V. Debs, was organized in Chicago last night.</p>
   <p>Comrade William A. Henry, manager of the House of Debs that is to be built in Indianapolis, is in Chicago and at his request a meeting was held by a group of labor representatives and social workers, where it was determined to start the work of raising a fund necessary to materialize and build the labor temple bearing the name of Eugene V. Debs.</p>
   <p>The following were appointed to the committee to help raise funds for the House of Debs: Benjamin Slessinger, William A. Cuneo, Sam Levin, F. Rosenblum, S. Rissman, M. Perlstein, M. Novack, O. Bronsteter, R. S. Snow, R. H. Hoz, S. Levitas, L. Honock, L. Schaffer, J. Siegel, and Morris Ziskind, secretary of the committee.</p>
   
   <p>All money will be deposited in the Amalgamated Trust and Savings Bank. All checks should be sent direct to the Amalgamated bank.</p>
   <p>Representatives of this committee will in the near future visit all labor organizations, which will no doubt respond to the committee's appeal.</p>
   <p>Comrade Henry, manager of the fund, will remain in Chicago for a length of time for the purpose of visiting all central labor bodies which, he hopes, will help him materialize the idea of building a Debs' Temple.</p>
