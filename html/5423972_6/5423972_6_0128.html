   <p>At the last meeting of the board of directors of the Talmud Torah when President J. H. Cohen had appointed the reorganization committee, certain members were asked to present their views on a new curriculum for the Talmud Torah. The discussion showed that there are still a great number of Jews who believe that all Judaism is, is contained in the Prayer Book. We feel that our youth will be Jews in spite of, and not because of, the Prayer Book. We question the necessity of conducting a Hebrew school if the Prayer Book is to be the basis of its curriculum. The purpose of a Hebrew school is to prepare the Jewish youth of today to be intelligent Jewish adults tomorrow. We want them to be proud of their Jewish lore, literature, and history. We hope that the members of the reorganization committee will introduce an appropriate and modern system of instruction into our Hebrew schools which will be fitting to the progressive Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>On the whole, the reorganization committee is one of the best that could be <span class="page-break">2</span>appointed. Such men as B. Horwich, Samuel Phillipson, and B. J. Schiff are a guarantee that the finances of the school will be kept in order. Such men as Rabbi Joseph Rothschild, Rabbi Morris Levin, Ben Zion Laiserovitz, and T. Piser will certainly keep their eyes open for a plausible plan of education and a curriculum which will present Judaism and Jews in the proper manner. H. M. Barnett, L. H. Bolotin, Max Shulman, and A. M. Karlstein will surely see to it that the adopted plans are put into operation.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute</p>
   <p>It appears that the directors of the Hebrew Institute will accept the recommendations of the executive committee not to rebuild the burned quarters of the Institute but to utilize the annex for its activities. We feel that the recommendations are absolutely justified in view of the circumstances. It seems as if the leaders desired that all the rooms should be utilized at all times. As a result, everyone with any crackpot idea called their group together to meet at the Institute. Instead of becoming a center of Judaism and drawing unto itself <span class="page-break">3</span>the masses of Jews, it slowly repulsed them. As we understand, the annex can accommodate the "valuable" activities of the Institute very well.</p>
