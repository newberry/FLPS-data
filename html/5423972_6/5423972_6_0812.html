   <p>As the Daily Jewish Courier predicted, the United Jewish Orthodox Charities will begin financing all Jewish welfare institutions, January 1, 1913.</p>
   <p>This was decided, last evening at a meeting where representatives of the twelve Jewish institutions assembled with the original Committee on the Organizing of the Federation.</p>
   <p>The roll call of representatives of the welfare bodies showed that the following institutions sent these delegates:</p>
   
   <p>Home for the Aged - August Turner and Isadore Lasker. Moimonedes Kosher Hospital - S. S. Korshak and U. Rosenzweig. Hebrew Sheltering Home - J. Wolfson and M. L. Fox. Yeshiva Eitz Chaim - H. Halper and A. Adler. West Side Hebrew School - David Slepior and the Rev. Neuman. Hebrew Speaking Society - N. H. Boldtin and H. Shodd. West Side Ladies' Charity Society, Mrs. L. M. Silverman and Mrs E. A. Rivkin.</p>
   <p>Jewish Consumptive Relief Society - Mrs. I. J. Rubin, and Mrs. S. Tanner. Free Loan Society - Paul Vitkowsky, and J. Weinstein. Northwest Side Free Loan Society - M. Nathan and George Mordock.</p>
   <p>M. Stone, who should have represented the Marks Nathan Home, sent an excuse that he could not be present at the meeting.</p>
   
   <p>After a lengthy discussion a resolution was passed to the effect that an organizational and by-laws committee should be appointed, which would introduce a program no later than December 1st, designating how the federation should be organized and function when it will take over the finances of all Jewish institutions.</p>
