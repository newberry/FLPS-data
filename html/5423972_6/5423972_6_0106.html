   <p>The well-known teacher and expert on handwriting, Reverend Ben Kamenichky, has opened up a Hebrew school at 1257-1259 South John Street near Maxwell Street, above the synagogue of Congregation Anshe Zhitomir.</p>
   <p>All Jewish parents who have good, energetic children who have a desire for a Hebrew education, and who are true to their children, should register them as soon as possible at the office of the school. By so doing you will save fifty cents per month on your tuition fee. The fee is reasonable.</p>
