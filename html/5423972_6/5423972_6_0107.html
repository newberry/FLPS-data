   <p>The Young Men's Auxiliary held their first official meeting last evening in the meeting room of the Ohave Sholom synagogue to elect permanent officers. Mr. Hugo Pam and Mr. N. D. Kaplan addressed the Auxiliary, and complimented the group on its good work.</p>
   <p>Rabbi [Saul] Silber, in a lengthy address, explained to the young men their duty to the Talmud Torah. The following officers were elected: Dr. Glickson, president; Max Molter, vice-president; I. Cohen, treasurer; L. Waldman, financial secretary; Charles Rabinovitz, recording secretary.</p>
   <p>It was decided to raise a certain amount of money to build a Talmud Torah, and to encourage our Jewish youth to organize themselves with this in view. Donations of $50 were given by Baumgold Brothers and L. Morris; $25 by Mrs. H. Stone--in honor of her father, Mr. Miksichki--L. Cohen, and George Cohen; $15 by Abe Rosenson and William Cohen; $10 by Henry Oppenheimer, Issac Mandlebaum H. Feinberg, H. Kramer, Mrs. S. Levin, Jake Shenberg, Harry Hurvitz, A. Zorokov, Ziv and Company, and Mr. Lapidus; $5 by Mrs. L. Siegel, Mrs. Esther Rosenbloom, Mrs. B. Gordon, H. Krinsky, W. Borisstein, and L. Morris; $2 by Abraham Viner; and $1 by D. L. Gold.</p>
   <p>The board of education selected the teachers. The president, Captain H. Weiss, introduced the first reform: a close check on the health conditions of the children. The very best physicians and nurses will visit the Talmud Torah daily.</p>
