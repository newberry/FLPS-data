   <p>Yesterday afternoon, Israel Zangwill addressed a huge crowd of men and women at the Covenant Club. In his speech, he made fun of the Eighteenth Amendment, and renewed his attacks against Henry Ford and the Ku Klux Klan, declaring that they were dangerous to America. He appealed for unity in the ranks of the Jews. "In this way only, will the Jews be able to show their nobility of spirit, which can be an inspiring influence in the struggle toward an honest and peaceful world." Mr. Zangwill thinks that by fighting the activities of Henry Ford and the Ku Klux Klan, the American Jews will be fighting for the America that was founded by Washington and Jefferson--the America that produced the great humanitarian, Abraham Lincoln.</p>
   <p>In his speech, Mr. Zangwill thanked the publisher of the Courier and his associates "who have shown me so many kindnesses in Chicago, and who arranged the fine meeting Sunday evening at the Peoples Institute!'.</p>
   
   <p>"It is the first time in my life", said Mr. Zangwill "that Jewish newspapermen have treated me so well."</p>
   <p>Zangwill leaves Chicago today for Cincinnati, and will then go on to New York.</p>
