   <p>At a meeting of the Board, Mr. Cahn, Executive Director, reported he had spent ten days in New York and Philadelphia, investigating the situation of the organizations of those cities corresponding to the Jewish Social Service Bureau of Chicago. From these investigations he learned that in both cities budgets allowed dependent families were slightly in excess of those allowed in Chicago. He prepared a table showing comparisons of allowances for food.</p>
   <p>The unemployment situation was far less acute in Philadelphia and in New York. The United Hebrew Charities were not affected by it to any great extent Boston, however was confronted with the problem, but to a much smaller extent than Chicago.</p>
   <p>Much time had been spent with the superintendent and president of the Jewish Social Service Bureau, analyzing all figures and discussing the situation. During the past 10 days there had been a change for the better. There were less new applications for help and there was reason to believe that in a comparatively short time there will be no further heavy demands for relief. The number of regular pension cases in the Social Service Bureau had not increased during the past six months.</p>
