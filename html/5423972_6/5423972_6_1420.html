   <p>The dedication excercises of the new Michael Reese Hospital were held on June 16. The Speaker of the day was Gov. Chas. S. Deneen. Dr. Evans represented Mayor Busse and commended the generosity of the Jews of Chicago in giving to the city as complete an institution as the M. R. Hospital. It is justly a source of pride to Chicago for no expense has been spared to make it a model institution of its kind.</p>
