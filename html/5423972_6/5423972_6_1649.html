   <p>To-day is the Grand Opening of new Marks Nathan Orphan Home. Hereafter, Chicago will no longer witness young Jewish orphans wandering the streets. No longer will you see little orphans selling matches and papers in order to eke out a living when they should be playing and enjoying themselves. These poor orphans who through no fault of their own were left either motherless or fatherless will now be provided with an institution which will cater to their young needs and enable them to grow up to be healthy young citizens.</p>
   <p>The Marks Nathan Home is not the only orphan home in Chicago, but it is the only orphan home in the United States which caters only to Jewish children and will assure these Jewish youngsters a thorough Jewish and Hebrew education. It is the only Jewish institution of its kind which has undertaken to care for the spiritual needs as well as the existence of its occupants.</p>
   <p>The Dedication Ceremonies this afternoon promise to be great and very interesting. Many civic notables are expected to be present. The city mayor Edward F. Dunne and the Governor of Illinois will be present. Everybody is invited to attend the ceremonies. The Home is located on Albany near sixteenth street.</p>
