   <p>Saturday night, October 15, at the Zionist Homeward Club in the Hebrew Institute Congressman A. J. Sabath will speak on "Immigrants in America."</p>
   <p>Today, the question of immigration is without a doubt the most important and most painful problem in Jewish life.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath is the greatest authority regarding this subject, through his study for years, battling the United States Congress to make it easier for immigrants to enter this country. To hear such an authority on such a vital question is something that very few Jews can afford to miss.</p>
   <p>After Congressman Sabath's speech, an educational and musical program is arranged for your entertainment.</p>
