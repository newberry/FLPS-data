   <p>It is the opinion of the directors of the Federation that the expenses for charity in the next six months, will increase fifty percent. The Maimonedes Hospital will have to be financed, beginning this month; The Hebrew Sheltering Home will be in need of more money when a new building will be constructed. They are also contemplating the construction of a new Talmud Torah. All this will add to the expenses, but the office committee is planning to widen the income by $50,000, which will cover the major expenses.</p>
