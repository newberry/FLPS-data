   <p>The annual meeting of the Chicago Home for Jewish Orphans was held Sunday afternoon, the 12th, at Sinai Temple. The reports were read and accepted. The most important announcement was that a site for the new home had been secured at a cost of $37,000. This is at the southwest corner of Drexel Ave. and 62nd st. The purchase of this site was made possible through the kindness of Mr. Henry Siegel, who himself donated $12,500, and raised $7,500 among his friends for this purpose. Besides this $20,000, the society paid $7,000 on this site and the balance of $10,000 is secured by a mortgage, payable on or before five years, with interest at the rate of 5% per annum.</p>
   <p>The financial reports showed that the expenses for the year were $4,234.80. There is a cash balance on hand of $179.74, and a sum of $6,400 is invested and bearing interest to the society of 6% per year.</p>
