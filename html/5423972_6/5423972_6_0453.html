   <p>"A healthy body makes for a healthy mind", is an adage of ancient lineage. It is in fact presumed to be the maxim of the Greeks or the Latins in their heyday of philosophic thought. It is, nevertheless, true that the principle was a well-established doctrine already in early Judean history and the Talmud specifically employs this sort of phrase so as to leave it to be understood that in view of the Talmudicrabbis, it was a matter of fact thought. The distinction between the attitude of the Greek mind and the Jewish in reference to the subject of this kind is well known. Whereas the Jew has virtually lived for the benefit of the mind and has regarded all things as ends to a spiritual life, the Greek has regarded not only the mind but the body as well as an end of life. The consequence of the Hellenic attitude has been that the body has been exhibited in various ways and on various occasions as an end in itself. This the Jews have never done, but it is a fallacious <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>doctrine to infer that the Jews have for that reason neglected the human body and have failed to realize its relationship to the general mental and spiritual well-being of an individual.</p>
   <p>In medieval times the body was almost as badly understood as the mind. The dark ages, so-called, were a period of human history when Western civilization was either in chaos or in a twilight stage; illiteracy was universal rather than general and so little was known of the bodily need that it was considered a mark of chastity to use no soaps or oils but to be for all intents and purposes physically unclean. In common with our European brethren, the Jews of this time showed but little concern for the body's well-being, yet they always kept themselves clean. The Jews believed in the ablution of the body at regular intervals and thus never share the Christian notions of false chastity. In ancient times the Jews were far from being a people of denial. They cultivated their vineyards and their fields and shared the plenty that was their lot. They had in all probability more feast days than fast days and their religion was by no means a religion of denial, though <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>it surely was one of restraint. A religion of restraint is, however, a most desirable religion in that it makes for physical hardihood and furthers the physical no less than the spiritual stamina of the race. If the Jews did not magnify the body as did the Greeks, it was due to the restraint practiced by the Jews in all matters of life. The Jews did not possess the Olympian crew of deities who in their physique and mental traits and passions were so comparable to man himself. The Jews never compared man to deity, always having a decent respect for deity, as the Greeks very often did not have and could not have had in truth. But we have little reason to doubt that the ancient Jews took care of their bodies, for the feats of strength and prowess recorded of the Jews in the Bible in every respect equals those of the Greeks. Samson was in fact a greater hero of strength and certainly a greater spiritual symbol than Hercules.</p>
   <p>After the medieval period of history, when a return to the lore of ancient Rome and Greece brought about the regeneration of civilization in Europe, it cannot be denied that the Greek examples of physical development had a <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>paramount and salutary influence upon Western civilization. Naturally the credit has been given to Greece and while we do not hesitate in saying that it was rightfully so given, we wish to defend the Jewish people against the malevolent insinuation that it has been an advocate of physical neglect of its resources in its human element. That is a falsehood which has even been accepted in some quarters among our own people. While it is true that Ghetto life has produced anomalous situations of this sort on various occasions in various localities, it is not true that the Jewish people have supported any notion of that sort as a general principle. The Jews have for so many centuries been excluded from the science and opportunity of physical culture and training that it is not surprising that they have made some lapses in that regard at various times. In medieval times, Jews could not participate in the tournaments of knighthood or in the sports of the trade guilds or in any other public festivals where physical prowess came into play. Up to within recent times, the Jewish youth of the Western countries and even in America could not make the various school bodies devoted to sports at our high schools and universities. These were exclusive and <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>were chiefly amenable to aristocratic influences. Naturally, the Jews are not the same class as non-Jews despite the fact, as Disraeli long ago pointed out, the Jews were already a great race when the Anglo-Saxons, the Teutons, and the Latins and Celts were full savages.</p>
   <p>Today Jewish youth everywhere, especially in the Western countries of Europe and America and in Palestine, shows himself the equal if not the superior of his non-Jewish mates in the physical game. The various Maccabean societies of Central Europe have on different occasions triumphed over their neighbors and have won the championship of the continent. In Palestine, the students of the Jaffe Gymnasium have displayed their class against many opponents and besides have thoroughly enjoyed their play. The Hebrew language has become enriched by a number of terms applicable to sports and athletics generally. But what is even more interesting is the spirit in which it is all taken. The Jewish youth of all those countries is taking the attitude that a healthy body is desirable. Unlike many students among other peoples they are making no special issue of it and very readily subordinate it to <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>considerations of a higher nature, but we venture to say that their attitude is one of encouragement. Jewish youth must take an aggressive attitude to life, and physical exercise is an aid to freedom in the spiritual attitude taken. We have been branded as weak and physical cowards. That is a dangerous point of view for people to hold of us, and while we do not need to resent this attitude by a spirit of pugnaciousness, we can clarify the atmosphere and assure our safety better by making it unmistakably clear that we are a people that are decadent in no sense, but in every way active. While we are proud to emphasize our interest in matters intellectual, we must not brand ourselves as physical weaklings, but by displaying an all-round development we will best gain the respect of the world.</p>
