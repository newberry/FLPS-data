   <p>The establishment of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities in Chicago brought on seven years of famine for the clique of nickel collectors. Recently, however, they have begun to increase and multiply and go about collecting nickels for all sorts of calamities. They have had tickets printed and sell them to tender-hearted Jewish women for a nickel a piece.</p>
   <p>Several of these collectors go under the name of the "Ladies' Society for the Marks Nathan Orphanage," and collect nickels supposedly for the "Marks Nathan orphanage". Mr. Charles Herron has been forced to make the following announcement in order to put an end to this swindle.</p>
   <p>"To the Jewish Public:</p>
   <p>"I have found out that certain persons go about the city and solicit, either personally or through collectors, money for the 'Marks Nathan orphanage,' giving coupons on which is written: 'Ladies' Society for the Marks Nathan <span class="page-break">2</span>orphanage, 5 cents'. I, hereby, wish to announce that our institution has no collectors, does not issue any coupons, and that no one is authorized to collect money for our institution.</p>
   <p>"Anyone who knows anything about these coupons and these irresponsible persons who use them, is asked to notify me.</p>
   <p>"There are a few auxiliaries doing good work for the orphanage, but the 'Ladies' Society' is extinct.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>"Charles I. Herron, president of the Marks Nathan Orphan Home."</p>
