   <p>The Mt. Sinai Kosher Hospital wishes to announce that in order to safeguard the health and comfort of the patients, no visiting will be allowed on Monday and Friday in the wards, because the big crowd that usually comes, disturbs the sick. Visitors, however, will be admitted to the private rooms as the number of such visitors can be easily controlled.</p>
