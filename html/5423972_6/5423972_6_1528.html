   <p>"Jews of Chicago: Can you watch calmly and see Jewish children who were left poor orphans, being converted to Christianity every day because there is nobody to give them a home? Do you know that there are institutions which take in our poor orphans and give them a home-- BUT THERE IS NO JEWISH HOME.</p>
   <p>"This is done because we, the Jews of Chicago, are too much occupied with our own affairs; we pretend that we don't know that poor orphans are being taken away from us. We are silent.</p>
   <p>"BUT HOW LONG WILL WE REMAIN SILENT?</p>
   <p>Do you Jews of Chicago know that the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery is now conducting a drive for fifty thousand dollars to build a home for the unfortunate <span class="page-break">2</span>orphans? It is the duty of every Jew to help the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery in its sacred work.</p>
   <p>"Do not forget that every dollar you give, helps to abolish the plague of conversion which besets our poor orphans, who are forced to go to Christian institutions because we Jews have no home for them.</p>
   <p>"HELP US, THEREFORE, TO BUILD A BEAUTIFUL HOME FOR OUR UNFORTUNATE ORPHANS."</p>
