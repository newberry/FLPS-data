   <p>Mr. Julius Rosenwald made the proposition to Mr. Edward Morris, president of Morris and Company, the meat packers, that he, (Mr. Rosenwald) will double any amount of a donation made by Mr. Morris to the Associated Jewish Charities. As a result of this proposition Mr. Morris donates $10,000 and Mr. Rosenwald immediately doubled that amount with a $20,000 donation. So the Associated Jewish Charities of Chicago received $30,000 in a lump sum. Mr. Rosenwald, in addition to his own donation, promised and pledged himself to get five more additional donors who will contribute $5,000 each, which he will also double and this will make an additional sum of $50,000. Four of the $5,000 donors are already on the list and they are as follows: Leo Mandel, president of Mandel Bros., Joseph Harris, Mr. Maurice L. Rothschild, and Mr. Henry Schwab.</p>
   <p>The Associated Jewish Charities is an organization which is very dear and popular among our rich Jewish people of Chicago. This organization was organized ten years ago. Its income last year was $250,000. This year we expect our income to be $300,000. The Orthodox Jews of Chicago can not possibly expect to accomplish this much for with all their charity institutions here in Chicago there is not a one who can afford to be so liberal.</p>
