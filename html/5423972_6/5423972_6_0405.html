   <p>Rabbi Hirsch on the West Side.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Hirsch of Sinai Temple will begin a series of fourteen lectures, on Friday evenings, to be given each Friday at the West Side Auditorium. His first lecture will be "Morals and Ethics in Judaism."</p>
   <p>Now, in order to cover the expense of this undertaking, a charge of $1.00 will be made for a season ticket. The price of a single ticket will be 10Â¢. There will be no tickets sold at the door of the Auditorium because of Rabbi Hirsch's thoughtfulness in realizing how unpleasant it would be for Orthodox Jews to procure admission and violate their holy Sabbath.</p>
   <p>These lectures are expected to be very instructive and entertaining, so we urge the Jews of Chicago to procure tickets as early as possible. The idea of these lectures was sponsored by the Chicago Hebrew Institute. This is one <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the best ideas the Directors of the Hebrew Institute could have planned. We are sure of great success. Rabbi Hirsch is well versed on the subject of "Morals and Ethics in Judaism." And, being such a great orator, he will no doubt explain his subject to the Chicago Jews to their entire satisfaction, for they are always ready and eager to hear of something that is worth while.</p>
   <p>In concluding this notice, we urge you again to get your tickets without delay, not to wait until the last minute for there will be positively no tickets obtainable at the door of the Auditorium.</p>
