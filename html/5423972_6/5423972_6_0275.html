   <p>At the meeting of the Community Council of the J. C., I. B. Lipson introduced three speakers who participated in a symposium on "Hitler versus Civilization." These speakers were Dr. Paul Hutchinson, managing editor of the Christian Century, representing religion, Dr. Eugene Kohn, exiled German physician, representing science in exile and Professor Frederick L. Schuman of the University of Chicago, who had recently returned from a trip through Germany. These men stressed the danger with which Hitlerism confronted civilization, giving in detail instances of how the Hitler regime had created a menace in their particular field and had destroyed the fruits of thousands of years of historical development.</p>
