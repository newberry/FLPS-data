   <p>The Corner Stone.</p>
   <p>(Speech by) Mr. M. M. Gerstley, in behalf of the Board of the U. H. R. A.</p>
   <p>The first Hebrew Relief Society in this city was called into existence in a strange and most peculiar manner. It was in 1854. The number of our coreligionists in this city at that time was about 3,000. Everybody endeavored to improve his condition as best he might but it was natural that in this struggle for success, some would fail and be forced to yield to the inevitable. It was then whispered that some worthy family amongst us was in need, even in the want of the necessities of life, but they could not be approached in any way to accept assistance. They would rather hide their misery. It was soon concluded what to do. Certain parties went to a neighboring grocery, bought flour, and provisions, directed them to the party mentioned, with the injunction not to tell who sent them. But the party finding it was to be accepted as a donation, or as charity, refused <span class="page-break">\2</span>to receive them and had them returned. It was then contemplated that in order to spare the delicacy of feeling of parties in need, by being approached through the assistance of individuals, the object might be better accomplished through the formation of a charitable society.</p>
   <p>A society, "the first Hebrew Relief Society" of this city, with scarcely a score of members at the outset was then formed. It was soon ascertained, however, that the scanty means of the society were absorbed by applicants, especially by new-comers, consequently one or more societies for the same designs were formed. While these various institutions endeavored to do all the good, which was to be done within their limited spheres of action, there seemed still to exist a certain incongruity, a want of concerted action, between these societies; for it was clearly demonstrated that while under such a disorganized system, all the necessary care and attention were bestowed upon some parties, others equally as worthy were almost, it not entirely, neglected.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>There was to be a remedy. Several meetings were held, and in order to bring about better results the various component societies, about ten in number, formed themselves into one general institution under the name and style of the United Hebrew Relief Association, in 1858.</p>
   <p>There seemed to be at that time but one, probably two hospitals in this city, that of the Sisters of Mercy, and the St. Luke's Hospital. When the constitution of the U. H. R. Association was formed, two members, engrafted in it a provision, to wit: "It is the ultimate design of this association to build a hospital."</p>
   <p>Time passed. The U. H. R. A. infused new life, and produced a greater concert of action amongst the whole community. Notwithstanding the generous contribution and continuous good will shown by our community for the well being of the association, still the people were not satisfied. They asked, <span class="page-break">\4</span>they clamored for the erection of the long promised hospital. And finally, in 1865, the spirit of our community was aroused, and at a public mass-meeting held at the old Concordia Club Hall, in the then known Lombard Block, sufficient means were subscribed to enable the executive board to buy a lot and build a hospital on N. La Salle St., near Schiller, at an expense of $23,000. At the laying of the cornerstone, in 1866, the late Hon. J. B. Rice, then mayor of the city, proclaimed to the public that though this hospital was to be built and maintained exclusively by the Jewish community of Chicago, he was, nevertheless, authorized to say that its doors would always be opened "to the sick and suffering of all parties, without asking, or investigating, as to their creed, religion, or profession." In this connection we feel authorized to state here again that the same general and unbiased rule will be strictly adhered to in the future (re the Michael Reese Hospital).</p>
   <p>It is natural that the regulation and conducting of an institution of this kind, without any previous practice or knowledge of its workings, would be <span class="page-break">\5</span>attended with considerable trouble and difficulty. Still the institution was managed properly and without interruption. On the whole it proved a success, with encouraging prospects for the future. While in this most prosperous condition, the fire of 1871 put a stop to our ambition. The hospital was destroyed. During all this period (since the fire) the work of the association was pursued with the usual vigor and energy, but the people keenly felt the want, yet had not sufficient means to rebuild the hospital, when, as it seems, in proper time the Messrs. Henry and Joseph Frank, who had the charge as trustees of a charitable fund bequeathed to their disposition by the late Michael Reese, Esq., of California, generously proposed to turn over $30,000 of said fund to the U. H. R. Association toward the rebuilding of their hospital, provided it be named now and henceforth the "Michael Reese Hospital." No less generous were Mrs. Henrietta Rosenfeld and Jacob Rosenberg, Esq., who were in possession of some special funds. They donated $50,000 of said funds to be reserved as a sinking fund, the interest of which to be applied toward the maintenance of the hospital.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Finally, we take occasion to remark that the hospital, with the ground on which it is built, is and will remain the property of the U. H. R. Association, and will be worked and managed by the executive board of the Association. The respective parties who so generously assisted and endowed it with such practical means, claim no further interests, no more individual preference, save that of its name, in order to perpetuate the memory of their generous and esteemed kinsman.</p>
