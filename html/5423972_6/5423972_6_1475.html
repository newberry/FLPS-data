   <p>What is going to happen to the costly but still unfinished building of the Daughters of Zion Day and Night Nursery? The [Chicago Jewish] Charities are stubborn and insist that the Daughters of Zion should stop the work and give up the building. The women leaders of the Daughters of Zion want to go on with the work. One cannot blame them very much, when one considers the fact that they have put a lot of labor and money into the building. Wouldn't it be a good idea if a public hearing were heard on the affair? Let both sides lay their claim before an impartial committee of community workers.</p>
