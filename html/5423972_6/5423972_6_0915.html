   <p>Young Men's Hebrew Charity Association.</p>
   <p>This organization was established in Jan. 1881 and continued in existence until 1900 when the Associated Charities was formed.</p>
   <p>The association has raised and distributed among the charity institutions of Chicago without distinction of creed or nationality, the sum of nearly a quarter of a million dollars.</p>
   <p>Although the Associated Charities has, to a certain extent, taken the work out of the hands of the Y. M. H. C. A., yet the young men who danced for charity at the famous annual balls, arranged by the Y. M. H. C. A. are not idle. They still carry a heavy part of the burden, and work in the interest of the newly-formed association.</p>
