   <p>The Current Topics Club has had several decidedly interesting sessions, during which was discussed that universal and ever-timely topic - the status of the Workingman in the economic system. Capitalism, socialism, sabotage, syndicalism, I.W.W. all came in for their share of the discussions. Some of the members are so well primed on these subjects that the debates were never permitted to lag. ("Debate" is the proper word, for all shades of opinion were brought out as the members waxed eloquent). The views of the advocate of free competition, of the socialist, of the other products of the present social system, were duly presented. Of course, the problems were not solved to the satisfaction of all, and the solution is still an open question: nevertheless, much mental satisfaction was derived from these informal discussions. A thorough understanding of the ideas of others is the first requisite to sympathetic tolerance.</p>
   <p>The next session was devoted to a review of President Wilson's administration. The Club seemed to be divided in opinion as to whether the present administration is or is not a failure. Much was made of the fact that there is now a lack of employment, but the reasons for this state of affairs were not forthcoming.</p>
   
   <p>This proved to be the last meeting for the summer, and it ended, in the words of Mr. Cohen, the leader of the Club, "On a Burst of Song". Mr. Cohen is to be commended on the manner in which he leads the discussions. More enthusiastic meetings are hard to find. They proved so interesting that the members will undoubtedly look forward with eagerness toward the next meeting, which is to be held in the early part of September.</p>
