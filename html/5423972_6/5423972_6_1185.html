   <p>The Chicago Jewish community is now in the process of developing itself. Ten or fifteen years hence, its development will have reached a point where we will be able to speak of a unified community. We are now building the institutions in Chicago which will go to make up a community. If we had leaders in Chicago who had the perspective of statesmen, as well as great organizational ability, the work could have been co-ordinated in such a way that it would have been completed [by now] and would have achieved its goal. Unfortunately, however, we have no such leaders in Chicago and that is why our community life moves so slowly. Instead of following a definite plan, for the purpose of attaining a unified community, various individual groups are doing the work in piecemeal fashion. Life itself demands that certain institutions and organizations be formed and there are groups of people who take an active part in these institutions and organizations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>More than conscientious leadership, life itself is the driving force in community affairs. That is why the welfare work in Chicago is not the result of certain plans, of statesmanlike leadership, but is the product of unknown forces. All our institutions in Chicago are established the moment the public sees that it cannot do without them. The Marks Nathan Orphan Home, the Home for the Aged, the Home for the Incurables in Oak Forest, the Infant Home, and the Mt. Sinai Hospital have been established in this manner. All of these institutions depend upon voluntary contributions because there is no community to support them, and due to the fact that they are all dependent upon voluntary contributions, the number of people who support them must constantly increase. After all, the United Charities is still a large collection agency, and if the representatives of certain institutions do not raise, through drives, certain sums of money, the institutions will suffer considerably. The fact that a certain institution is affiliated with the United Charities does not mean that it is no longer dependent upon voluntary contributions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>However, all of our institutions in Chicago are not affiliated with the United Charities. One of the most important institutions, the Mt. Sinai Hospital, which does as much as any first-class institution, is not affiliated with the United Charities. It depends entirely upon voluntary contributions.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Jewish community has many institutions of which it can be proud. It does not have any unnecessary institutions. But we cannot conceive of a Jewish community without a Jewish hospital. A kosher hospital for a city like Chicago is no less essential than an orphanage and a home for the aged. A Jewish hospital in Chicago is an absolute necessity. Chicago must have such an institution because we cannot and must not compel thousands of sick Jews to eat nonkosher food and to be in a Christian a tmosphere at a time when they are particularly sensitive because of their pain and illness..</p>
   <p>If the Chicago Jewish community had been built along a certain plan, just as a new city is designed, there would be no question of a [Jewish] hospital <span class="page-break">\4</span>in Chicago. The hospital would have been included among the essential institutions which a Jewish community must have. But because our community work is done in piecemeal fashion, the question of a Jewish hospital in Chicago does exist.</p>
   <p>We have the problem of increasing the number of people who would take an [active] interest in the institution and would enable it to develop rapidly. Mt. Sinai Hospital, as it is today, does only one-fifth of the work which it could and should do. Considering the fact that it serves the interest of at least a quarter of a million Jews, its budget is much too small. The Mt. Sinai Hospital should have at least three hundred beds in order to take care of all who seek admission, but it does not even have one hundred beds and is always overcrowded. It must either develop in the immediate future, or else it simply cannot fulfill its mission.</p>
   <p>In every large Jewish community in Europe, the communal management provides for a Jewish hospital. But here we have no organized Jewish community, and <span class="page-break">\5</span>must, therefore, seek other means of maintaining and developing the kosher hospital.</p>
   <p>The only and effective way to help the Mt. Sinai Hospital is by turning it into a typical people's institution, i. e., by obtaining enough subscribers to place it on a broad democratic basis. Then, when the Mt. Sinai Hospital has a membership of five or six thousand, it will know that it can rely upon a large group of people--and in case of necessity, it will always be able to appeal to that group.</p>
   <p>Those who now stand at the head of the hospital must, therefore, endeavor to double or treble the membership and thus place it on a broad democratic basis. Then the Mt. Sinai Hospital will not only be independent, but it will be able to develop according to the needs of the vast Jewish population, whose interests it serves.</p>
