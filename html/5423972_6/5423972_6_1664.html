   <p>The lower story contains wards for the ordinary sick, and the upper story, wards for contagious diseases only. The hospital annex is equipped with the necessary nurses' rooms, physicians' office and dispensary, diet kitchen and other essential accessories, including a separate small laundry for hospital use only.</p>
   <p>One of the important features in connection with the proposed building is the division of the dormitory rooms in such a manner that no room shall contain more than twelve children. Another feature is the fact that all rooms, corridors and other spaces, however unimportant, are provided with direct windows, affording abundant outside light and air.</p>
