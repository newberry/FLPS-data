   <p>The Douglas Park Day-and-Night Nursery was compelled to refuse the applications of 83 orphans, being unable to accept them.</p>
   <p>The orphans had to be enrolled, but due to unprecedented circumstances and limited space, their applications were turned down.</p>
   <p>A new home must be constructed immediately on 15th Street.</p>
   <p>At the completion of the Douglas Park Day-and-Night Nursery Home, all orphans will be accommodated who turn to the home.</p>
   <p>A campaign of $50,000, is carried on for the construction of a new home. Chicago Jewry is urged to support this campaign.</p>
