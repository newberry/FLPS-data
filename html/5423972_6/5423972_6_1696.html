   <p>At the annual meeting of officers and directors of the Home for the Aged, which was held last Wednesday evening in the hall of that institution, a few important reports were delivered. The most important of these reports was the one of Superintendent Otto Felton. Mr. Felton is a new man in the institution, and at the beginning, he encountered opposition to his management. But President Barnett Faroll contends that he [Felton] overcame every obstacle. He adapted himself immediately to the aged inmates. He easily adjusted himself to the officers and chairmen of the various committees, and he is--all right. So is the matron, Mrs. Felton. She is very diplomatic with the female employees.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felton's report is very clear and timely, and it is one of the most constructive reports ever read by a superintendent at an annual meeting. The report is a mirror in which the complete internal activity of the institution can be seen. Only a person with a broad vision, a tender heart and a good mind, would have been able to present such a picture. It appears that Mr. Felton is such a person. Facts and figures, problems from different angles, the life of the individual men and women, and their life as a whole, were reflected in Mr. Felton's report. You will gain a great deal of knowledge from this report. You will learn the functions of the Home for the Aged, which has been in existence for twenty years, and which has had Mr. Harris Cohen as its first president and Mrs. Benjamin Davis as its secretary.</p>
   <p>The greatest tragedy in a home for the aged--the inevitable tragedy--is the constant loss of those for whom so much is done to make their lives more comfortable. "May our reward," said Mr. Felton, "consist in the comforting knowledge that we have fulfilled our duty to those who rely upon us." He listed twenty-seven deaths in 1922. In this institution, there are at present one hundred and twelve inmates: fifty men and sixty-two women.</p>
   <p>Old people are not active--on the one hand, feebleness does not permit them to be active, and on the other hand, they have little, or no worries. "With the cooperation of the house committee, of which Mr. Paul Lakritz is chairman," said Mr. Felton, "we serve large portions of the best meat and the finest fish, and anyone can have a second helping."</p>
   <p>Mr. Felton read a full list of the different foods which are served in the institution. The menus are changed daily. Special menus are served on Saturdays and holidays, in which wine is included for Kidush [ceremony of blessing the wine]. There are Jews in Chicago who donate a gallon of wine regularly to the institution, and Mr. Felton is very grateful to them.</p>
   <p>The medical staff of this institution consists of twenty-four physicians. Two doctors pay regular visits to the institution twice a month. The medical staff is under the chairmanship of Dr. A. B. Yudelson, a physician of high standing and a brilliant student in his profession. In the institution there are patients who are gravely ill. For those who need daily attention, the institution was compelled to hire a paid physician. This doctor is also in charge of the hospital adjoining the institution. He is Dr. I. Singer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felton stated that there are patients suffering from diabetes and that specially prepared food is served to them. He also said that the hospital is too small and must be enlarged.</p>
   <p>Old people complain that they are unable to chew their food or that their teeth are always aching. For this reason, a room has been equipped, thanks to Dr. M. L. Oren, with all sorts of dental instruments, the equal of any dental office in Chicago. Besides Dr. Henry Honoroff, many other dentists offer their services gratis each week.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felton takes pride in the fact that all the necessary supplies for the office are purchased at cost price and for this, he is grateful to Dr. M. L. Oren.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felton then followed with a report of the religious services which are observed there. He emphasized the typically Jewish conduct which is observed. For the well-established religious services, Mr. Felton gives credit to Mr. S. P. Platt. For introducing a spiritual atmosphere and for teaching the inmates the Talmud, he credits Rabbi [N.] Budzinsky. Mr. S. D. Goodman is also commended for his services.</p>
   <p>Throughout the year, the old people enjoy the fresh air in Douglas Park, which is directly opposite the institution. In summer they are given automobile rides. They also hold picnics in Lincoln Park and in Desplaines Forest Preserve. At these picnics, food is taken along and refreshments are served. Those who are unable to attend, receive refreshments at the Home.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felton speaks highly of the entertainment committee of the Home for the Aged Women's Club, of which Mrs. Joseph Lewis is president. "This women's club raises a lot of money for the Home. It also helps make the lives of the aged more pleasant."</p>
   
   <p>Sixty thousand dollars was needed to maintain the institution last year. More money will probably be needed this year because Mr. Felton and others have proposed a list of improvements: improvements in the institution proper and improvements on the beautiful grounds. Mr. Joseph Bauer, chairman of the building and grounds committee, will see that these proposals are soon put into effect.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felton studied the financial report submitted by Mr. J. Panes, financial secretary of the Home. This report shows the assets of the Home for the Aged, and will interest you.</p>
   <p>The wealth of the Home for the Aged, in buildings, grounds, and various funds, amounts to $236,047.56, of which they owe $20,000.</p>
   <p>An institution like the Home for the Aged, is run on the same principles, and, to a certain degree, has to contend with the same elements and problems that are found in a hotel, hospital, or synagogue. An institution like the Home for the Aged also has distinct social problems.</p>
   <p>"Most of us," said Mr. Felton, "are under the impression that institutions for the aged are merely hostelries, or boarding houses, and we fail to see the social elements which are involved. From the brief study that I have made, I have come to the conclusion that when an applicant is admitted, two questions should be taken into consideration: 1. Is the applicant in need of a home? 2. Is he the type for the Home?"</p>
   <p>Analyzing the first question, Mr. Felton contends that the fact that an applicant is dissatisfied with his children, or that he is displeased with their environment, is no justification for his admission into the institution. The children or relatives must, if their earnings permit, care for the aged. It is their duty to themselves and to society.</p>
   <p>Analyzing the second question, Mr. Felton contends that an applicant must be thoroughly examined before he is admitted. He must be well mentally, so that he will not become a burden upon the other inmates.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felton understands the grief of applicants, whose children surround themselves with a non-Jewish environment. He recommends the acceptance of such applicants into the Home for the Aged. He also considers the fact that some aged people are somewhat eccentric and recommends that, in such cases, the doctors should not be so rigid in their examinations.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Mr. Felton reported that all inmates of the Home are amiable and friendly toward each other.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Felton really deserve the ovations they received at the annual meeting.</p>
