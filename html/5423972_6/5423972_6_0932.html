   <p>The great Charity Bazaar, the largest ever held in Chicago, if not in the West, came to a glorious close on Monday night. The hopes of the directors of the U. H. C. and the Y. M. H. C. A., under whose auspices the Bazaar was held, were fully realized. The sum of $81,250 had been amassed for the Jewish charitable institutions of the city.</p>
   <p>According to the plan adopted, the Michael Reese Hospital will receive one-half of the net proceeds and the remainder distributed among other institutions.</p>
