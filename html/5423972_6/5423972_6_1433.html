   <p>An organization has been formed to raise funds for the erection and maintenance of a new Jewish hospital, "for the gratuitous medical and surgical treatment of the poor, independent of race or creed." The project has been the subject of earnest consideration for several weeks. On last Monday, the following officers were elected at a meeting: President, Dr. Michael N. Regent, Vice-president, Leo Porges, Secretary, Dr. Louis J. Pritzker, Treasurer, Herman Felsenthal. It is estimated that expenditures for the project will be $500,000. An effort will be made to induce the Baroness Hirsch to subscribe just one-half of the needed amount. Naturally the question of location has, as yet, received but little consideration, but thus far, opinion is said to favor the West or Northwest portion of the city.</p>
