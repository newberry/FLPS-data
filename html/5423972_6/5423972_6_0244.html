   <p>The directors of the Jewish School for Manual Instructions, consisting of eight men and eight women, have finally decided to purchase the 178 by 110 feet large building ground, located at the corner of Judd and Clinton streets, where the new school for manual training is to be erected.</p>
   <p>Mr. L. Mandel, of the Mandel Bros., has contributed $20,000. for this enterprise. The school, when completed, will be three stories high, and will cost the total sum of $40,000. Twenty one thousand ( $21,000) dollars have been paid for the building ground, and there are now $20,000 in the treasury. The new institute will perhaps be completed by next fall and ready to receive several hundred pupils, who now receive instructions at the Sinai Temple.</p>
