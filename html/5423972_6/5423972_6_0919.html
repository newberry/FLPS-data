   <p>Maos Hitim - Things are getting better - New Contributors - Hope for co-ordination - The Beth Michsa Orphan Home - A mistake in Logic - To be open and above board is the best policy - The Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>For some six or seven years the "Courier" has been advocating a co-ordination of all the Synagogues relative to their Maos Hitim activities. We have consistently advocated co-ordination in both the collection and the distribution of Maos Hitim. It seems to us that the contributors are few and that those who do contribute give out of all proportion to the rest of the population. Men like Samuel Philipson, Benjamin Schiff, and others in a similar position seem to be carrying more than their just share of the burden. Certainly there are many who would be glad to contribute or who would be forced to contribute, to save their face, whose names do not appear on our list of contributors only because they are not approached. These people should be effectively approached by our committees.</p>
   <p>This year, if the present plan is put into operation, Chicago will have a United Maos Hitim Committee. Since this is the first year at a united effort, we will naturally not expect the organization to function in the best manner. However, <span class="page-break">2</span>it is a step in the right direction. We realize that many clubs, aid societies and other organizations have not yet affiliated themselves with the United Maos Hitim Committee. It may be some time before they are convinced of the necessity of a united effort, perhaps a year or more, but the important thing is to get the committee functioning. This we are doing.</p>
   <p>This united effort in the Maos Hitim Appeal is commendable. Perhaps we can extend such co-operation to other Jewish Activities. Just a thought.</p>
   <p>Our Beth Michsob Orphanage is having a little difficulty raising the funds necessary for the purchase of the ground upon which to build their new home.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Home seem to desire a minimum amount of publicity to be given to their inability to raise necessary funds. With all due respect to them and their efforts, we feel they are pursuing the wrong course. We feel that the administration of the Orphan Home is of interest to the entire community, and the more publicity given to the activities of the Home the greater will be its' support by the community.</p>
   <p>Reports of the activities of the various committees of the Home should be <span class="page-break">3</span>made public whenever possible. Plans, whatever they may be, should be discussed by the community as a whole and should be open to criticism by the community. The Beth Michsob Orphan Home belongs to the community and the community should know what should or should not be done.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute is still in ruins. Just a reminder.</p>
