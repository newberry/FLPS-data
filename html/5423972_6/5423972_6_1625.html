   <p>Rabbi Moses Finkel of Milwaukee Avenue added his wonderful voice to the High Holiday services that were chanted at the Beth Mahasa Yesomim [Orphan Home]. Everyone was delighted with the way he chanted in the style of the old Jewish tradition, since Rabbi Finkel is an Orthodox and pious Jew.</p>
   <p>In addition to contributing his voice, he also bought tickets for his children, his son-in-law, and his brother, who were all very liberal in their donations to the Orphans Home. We thank all who participated in our Orthodox observance of our religious holiday.</p>
   <p>Above all, we wish to thank Mr. Weinshenker and his children, Mr. Laurentz, Mr. M. Stein, and all the others for their liberal donations. We wish everyone of you and all our Jewish brothers throughout the world, success.</p>
   <p>Jacob Levy, president.</p>
