   <p>A great necessity is felt by the Jews of this city to create a cultural center for the large masses of Jewish workers who are longing for enlightening on social questions, especially concerning Art and Literature. Such a cultural center has never existed in Chicago. The necessity for such a center resulted in the establishment of a Workers Art and Literary Verein.</p>
   <p>The object of this Verein will be to proffer instructions and awaken an appreciation for the beauty of art and better literature in the Jewish Working Class.</p>
   <p>It will be a sort of a "Forum" on the style of the English Instructing Societies.</p>
   <p>The Verein will arrange lectures every Sunday morning, on certain subjects, and at the same time will provide a magnificent musical program.</p>
   <p>The lectures will be arranged in various localities:</p>
   <p>The first lecture will be held in Gartner's Independent Theatre, Sunday, by the renowned Jewish Artist, Samuel Astrowsky. Astrowsky is one of the most famous Jewish Artists in America; his name is not only known to the Jews, but also the great Gentile World.</p>
   <p>He will speak on the "Modern Jewish and General Art", with illustrations of famous paintings.</p>
