   <p>We take pleasure to inform the public of the incorporation of the Chicago Winfield Tuberculosis Sanatorium, which is situated at Winfield, Illinois, 50 minutes ride from Chicago on the Northwestern Railroad. This most beautiful and ideal spot contains 17 acres of cultivated grounds. Situated on top of a hill is the sanatorium, built on the colonial style, containing 36 rooms, enough elevated grounds to accommodate 100 patients. This building and the grounds were generously given by Dr. Carl Stonehill of Chicago, and deeded over to the Chicago Winfield Tuberculosis Sanatorium, for the use of the Jewish public. The Bacon Hirsch Women's club and their friends are paying for the remodeling of the sanatorium.</p>
