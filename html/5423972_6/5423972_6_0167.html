   <p>A School For Jewish Girls.</p>
   <p>The well known teacher Mr. E. Walpe has opened a Cheder (Hebrew School) for Jewish girls, exclusively. Any one wishing their daughters to study the Jewish religion, Hebrew and Yiddish languages, may apply to Mr. Walpe's School, 210 Dock street. He assures the Jewish public in Chicago, that for the short while he has had his school in operation, the girls already have made wonderful progress. The girls can read Hebrew and write Yiddish very well. They also have acquired an extensive knowledge of Jewish history.</p>
