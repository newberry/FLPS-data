   <p>The Courier wanted to find out once and for all why American Jews have two institutions in Denver for the treatment of consumptives. That Jews should have their own hospitals and sanitariums in all cities where the Jewish population is fairly large, no one questions. It is also clear that in big cities like Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia more than one hospital is needed on account of the size of the city and the large population. But the necessity of having more than one institution in Denver for consumptives is incomprehensible. We quite well know that there are more patients than there are vacancies, but the question is, "Why can't the number of patients in one institution be increased?" In other words, "Why have two separate institutions?"</p>
   <p>Our reporter had a long talk with Dr. Spivak, secretary of the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society. To all these questions Dr. Spivak replied, "The two institutions represent two different points of view, and this is the reason <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>why they do their work in different ways. One is as far from the other as East is from West.</p>
   <p>"The two points of view are as follows: The consumptive is considered from the standpoint of his ability to work. Aid must be extended to the person who can be cured of the disease in a short time and return to work. This is the point of view of the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives which was opened by German Jews in Denver in 1901. "Adhering to this policy the Hospital admitted only those who were suffering from the disease in its first stages, who could be absolutely cured. But when it happened that a patient became depressed due to his serious condition, he was immediately removed from the hospital in order to carry out the letter of the rule which prohibits the presence of patients whose dying condition is evident.</p>
   <p>"The second point of view is that of those who look upon the consumptive from the ordinary standpoint of human kindness. The patient suffering more has greater need of assistance. The person who coughs most, who has a high <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>temperature, who suffers from pain in the chest, from high blood pressure, etc. is more entitled to a place of rest than the one who is afflicted with the disease in the first stage and is free from pain and suffering. This is the point of view of the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society of Denver, Colorado which was opened in 1904 by our Russian, Galician, and Hungarian Jews.</p>
   <p>"Adhering to this policy, no restrictive rules were made. It says plainly that every consumptive may be admitted, whether in the first, second, third, or fourth stage of the disease. In practice, however, the dangerously sick are admitted first because it is only natural and human that we should sympathize more with those who suffer most.</p>
   <p>"The second difference is, that the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society is Jewish, not only in name but in spirit as well. As there are many among the consumptives who do not eat treife (food prohibited by the dietary laws), and since to force them to eat treife would grieve them greatly thereby <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>retarding their cure, a kosher kitchen was installed. In order to prevent any suspicion in regard to the cleaning and salting of the meat, and the separation of dairy and meat dishes in strict conformity with the dietary laws, a supervisor was appointed. The Jewish doctors, who are not so punctilious in regard to the dietary laws, and even the Gentile doctors consider the kosher kitchen a cure medium for the sick.</p>
   <p>"This," Dr. Spivak said, "is the difference between the two institutions, the German-Jewish and the Jewish, a difference which reflects the two points of view."</p>
