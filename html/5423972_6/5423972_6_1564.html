   <p>We are publishing in today's Courier an appeal made by the rabbis of Chicago for the $100,000 drive to erect a home for the hundreds of small orphans who cannot be taken into the orphanage because they are too young. The appeal of the rabbis speaks for itself, and we are convinced that the Jews of Chicago will respond generously in order to make the drive a success.</p>
   <p>There are elements in the city, especially on the South and North Sides, who believe that it would be better to have these little unfortunate orphans reared in Christian families, rather than in a Jewish institution and in a Jewish atmosphere. They believe that there are already sufficient Jews in the world, and that the less Jews there are, the better. We do not believe in the principle: the less Jews there are, the better. We believe the more Jews there are, the better, and we also believe that only those who do not care to be Jews and are ashamed of the Jewish name are opposed to Jewish orphans being reared in a Jewish atmosphere.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We have never been justified in letting Jewish children grow up as Goyim [Gentiles]--and now, when we have lost two million Jewish souls in five years, we certainly have no right to deliver Jewish orphans into the hands of Gentiles. It should not be forgotten that at present the Jewish people do not have an overly great number of children. According to travelers and correspondents who have visited many Jewish cities in Eastern Europe, no Jewish children are seen on the streets. Where are the Jewish children who have hitherto formed a colorful part of the Jewish scene in Eastern Europe? They have become the victims of hunger, the sword or of epidemics, and the number of Jewish children who were saved, are crippled, sick, pale and nervous, and God knows whether they will ever become productive forces.</p>
   <p>America is the only country now where Jewish childred are to be found in normal numbers. America is the only country in the world where the Jewish people can hope that the next Jewish generation will be a strong and healthy one. We in America must exert all our efforts to build a healthy Jewish generation <span class="page-break">\3</span>and to save every Jewish child for the Jewish people. It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that we should found a home for the Jewish infants and not let them fall into Gentile homes where they will grow up as Christians and will be lost to us. We must be frugal now with our human material and every Jewish child who can be saved for our people, must be saved.</p>
   <p>If we allow the orphans to reach maturity in a Jewish atmosphere they will be Jews. Should we fail to build a home and let them fall into Christian hands, they will then reach adulthood as Goyim and we cannot imagine a greater crime or treason to our people at the present moment, than to place numbers of Jewish children into non-Jewish hands.</p>
   <p>The obligation to build a home for the orphans is threefold: religious, national, and humanitarian. The great majority of the Jews of Chicago are still religiously inclined. We are depending upon their Jewish sense of duty for their generous response to the appeal of the Chicago rabbis, so that Chicago <span class="page-break">\4</span>may soon have a home for the hundreds of orphans. The latter will be cared for in a genuine Jewish spirit with scientific methods of modern child-education.</p>
   <p>We also wish to say that the men and women who are directing this noble work--Mrs. Rieger, Mrs. Edwin Romberg, Mrs. Siegel, Mrs. Eisenberg, Mr. Louis Rieger, Mr. Meyer Titelbaum, Mr. Yacoboffsky, Rabbi Margolin and many others--are serious, idealistic, and responsible people, who all belong to the Jewish middle class of Chicago. They can be depended upon to carry out properly this great undertaking. They will see that the children's home is not administered in a bureaucratic spirit of "professional philanthropy" which makes dependent wards out of orphans and deadens every trace of personality in them. They will see that the home is administered in the spirit of a family atmosphere, where the infants will feel at home and will be reared in a happy frame of mind.</p>
   <p>Such an institution is already functioning in New York and the experience of the New York institution is excellent and justifies the brightest hopes. The children there are strong and healthy and are developing in the finest manner. At the head <span class="page-break">\5</span>of the New York institution are no professional philanthropists, but persons representing the middle class, and this explains why the institution is such a great success.</p>
   <p>When these lines reach the reader, representatives of the Daughters of Zion Day Nursery and Motherless Infants Home, who have undertaken to build the children's home, will already be directing the drive for the $100,000. They will approach every Jewish man and woman in Chicago for a contribution. We trust that no one will fail to contribute his share and it is expected that everyone will give most liberally and generously--on this depends both the life and the Judaism of hundreds of unfortunate Jewish orphans for whose fate we are all responsible.</p>
