   <p>"To Dr. David Blanstein, Superintendent.</p>
   <p>Hebrew Institute, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Dear Dr. Blanstein:</p>
   <p>The thought has repeatedly occurred to me during these two weeks past, that we may easily make the work of our proposed class of operative engine-room chemistry of great value, not alone to those for whom it is primarily intended, but also to many others, particularly those who are engaged in manufacturing and who are consequently large purchasers and users of coal, oils of various kinds, water, etc.</p>
   <p>It is an unquestioned truth that a careful study of the fuels, water, and lubricants used in our manufacturing establishments invariably results in a greatly increased economy in their use, and a surprising decrease in the cost of engine and boiler-room maintenance. With this practical scientific knowledge in our possession, and anxious as we are to make our trade school an unmeasured success, may I suggest to you that we invite the active cooperation in our Work of everyone interested in our new class of engine-room chemistry, both employers and employees, so that the good results we hope to achieve may be of immediate and permanent benefit to both.</p>
   <p>I am sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>WILLIAM F. CAHILL,B.S.C. - Principal of Trade School,</p>
   <p>Chicago Hebrew Institute"</p>
