   <p>There are many societies, lodges, aid societies, etc., on the West Side of Chicago. In fact there are hundreds of them. The Daily Jewish Courier is requesting and calling on these different societies to furnish it the number and names of members in their respective organizations, such as charity, social, synagogues and all others. Let us know the addresses and the purposes of each one.</p>
   <p>We are especially anxious to show the world the great things our orthodox Jews of Chicago are doing. We urge every President and Secretary of any Jewish organization such as synagogues, charitable organizations, societies and lodges to tell us of their activities. Give us this information, please, and get busy!</p>
