   <p>The Associated Jewish Charities of Chicago have recently received a check of $1,000 from the Young Men's Associated Jewish Charities as an endowment fund, the principal to remain in the name of the Young Men's Associated Jewish Charities and the interest to revert perpetually to the Associated Jewish Charities. This innovation may be an incentive to others to create a large endowment fund and thus provide an absolute annuity for the future. It is the intention of the Young Men's Associated Jewish Charities to increase this endowment from time to time and thus insure for posterity a yearly fund for the benefit of those unfortunate members of the community who may be in need of aid. In addition to the endowment fund of $1,000 the Young Men's Associated Jewish Charities have, since March 15, 1908, collected in new and increased subscriptions more than $5,000. This is the result of one month's work, and is a substantial and welcome addition to the funds of the Associated Jewish Charities.</p>
