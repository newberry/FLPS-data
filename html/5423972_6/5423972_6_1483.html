   <p>Of the important communal buildings which should have long been opened for the purpose for which they have been built, the Infant Home of the Daughters of Zion Day and Night Nursery is the most important. For more than one year the building for this institution has been under construction and is still not completed, though the need is great and the number of applicants grows from day to day.</p>
   <p>The position of the official Jewish charities as regards the Daughters of Zion Day and Night Nursery is a negative one. According to the argument of the Jewish Charities, Jewish orphans who cannot be admitted to the Marks Nathan Home because they are still too young, should be given away to private <span class="page-break">\2</span>families, and if suitable Jewish families cannot be secured, the infants should then be given away to Christian families. The reason for this procedure is purely a medical one to which the medical men, however, do not subscribe. The representatives of the official Jewish charities assert that it is hazardous to keep small children in a orphanage because in case of certain sicknesses all children are apt to be stricken, and, in order to prevent that, children must be separated in private families.</p>
   <p>If this theory holds true, the Marks Nathan Orphanage would likewise be perilous for the children, for if a child of five years must not be in an orphanage, a child of six or seven years should not be there either, since the danger of contagion is the same. Doctors who have a certain opinion about this question make light of this theory, for, if it were correct, no children would be brought up in any institution. Yet, for the past seven <span class="page-break">\3</span>hundred years, children have been brought up in institutions. It is an established fact that children who are brought up in an institution are less exposed to danger than children who receive a normal upbringing at home. Child mortality is significantly lower in institutions than in private families.</p>
   <p>During the many years in which Jewish day and night nurseries have existed in Chicago we have never heard that a number of children have fallen victims of contagious diseases, and we are almost certain that not one single death has occurred in these institutions.</p>
   <p>Since the argument of the official Jewish charities against the Jewish day and night nurseries and the Infant Home is absolutely false, there is no reason why the Jewish community of Chicago should not finish the work that a group of charitable Jewish women have begun. There is no question that this institution is necessary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>If this institution were now completed, the construction of a new wing would soon have to begin, because the place would be overcrowded. No less than five hundred applications have already been made and in most cases living orphans are involved. ["Living orphans" is a term used in Yiddish, meaning children whose parents are alive but unable to provide for them.] On most applications either the father is a cripple, or the mother must go to work and cannot care for her child, or the mother is ill and the father cannot care for the child. In some cases there are orphans who just came from Europe and cannot find admission in Mark Nathan Home. We cannot and must not leave these unfortunate and helpless children to their own fate, and we cannot give them away to Christian families. Perhaps it is not a violation of the Jewish [religious] law to give infants of a year or two away to Christian families, but it is certainly a crime to give away children of four or five years to Christian families, because all educators agree that the first seven years of a person's life determines his religious character, and giving children of four or five years of age to Christian <span class="page-break">\5</span>families, that they should bring them up, means surrendering the children to apostasy. It is also not advisable to give children away to poor Jewish families, because such children will be unable to receive the sanitary conditions that an institution can offer. If a Jewish family wishes to adopt a child, it may do so, but without compensation. Only the very poor Jewish families, who themselves live in solitude and filth, wish to bring up a small child for compensation, and the conditions that prevail in a poor family are not the best guarantee for a sound physical development of the child.</p>
   <p>The infant home which is now being built by the Daughters of Zion Day and Night Nursery is, therefore, an absolute necessity and it is the duty of the city to see that the building be completed as soon as possible and devoted to its objective: To provide a home for the orphans who are, for some reason or other, not admitted into the Marks Nathan Home.</p>
