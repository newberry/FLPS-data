   <p>The annual reception of the Michael Reese Hospital was held last Sunday afternoon from 2:30 to 5:30 o'clock. The officers and members of the board of directors were all in attendance and were cheerfully escorted about the building. On all sides could be heard words of praise and satisfaction over the neatness and cleanliness of every ward and room. Michael Reese Hospital is a model institution of its kind and a pride to the Jews of Chicago, who support it entirely, although it is non-sectarian in its character.</p>
   <p>A number of donations were entered in the "Book of Life," by visitors.</p>
