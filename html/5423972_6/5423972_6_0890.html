   <p>Speaking of Dr. Herzl's plan to gather the Jews of the world together in Palestine with a government of their own, under the sovereignty of the sultan, Mark Twain was moved to remark:</p>
   <p>"I am the sultan and I am not objecting; but if that concentration of the cunningest brains in the world were going to be made in a free country (bar Scotland) I think it would be politic to stop it. It will not be well to let the race find out its strength. If the horse knew its (strength) we should not ride any more."</p>
   <p>In no way has the effectiveness of "the cunningest brains in the world" become more apparent in the last few years than in the business principles that have been applied to Jewish Charities, and in no place has the system been worked out more successfully than here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Quick to see the advantage of the consolidation or"trust" principle in business the Jews have applied its legitimate features to the collection and dispensing of charity funds. In this they have distanced all other peoples. They have made as great a success of central general control in the bestowing of largesse as in the conduct <span class="page-break">\2</span>of business. Material saving in office force and incidental expense has resulted from the application of the principle of consolidation. The former loss of energy and increment of annoyance have been swept away.</p>
   <p>The name of the Jewish charity federation is the Associated Jewish Charities.</p>
   <p>Among the "Sayings of the Fathers" this sentence is to be found: "There are three things upon which the world rest--the study of the law, divine service and charity." To the Jew, charity is a serious matter. He dispenses it religiously and not temporarily to "square" himself with his conscience. He has also long been noted for hiding his light of charity under a bushel. The application of the "combination" system has tended more than ever to retire him from public scrutiny.</p>
   <p>When the Associated Jewish Charities was organized its promoters had in view several distinct advantages that they calculated would result. This was five years ago. The sagacity of their calculations has been vindicated. Prior to that time much of the money required for local Jewish Charities had been raised by the giving of balls, fairs, bazaars and other entertainments. Large sums were drawn from the pockets of <span class="page-break">\3</span>the patrons, but the wastefulness of the plan was apparent. To the shrewd mind of the Jew the system was unsound in principle. The proportion of expenses to receipts in these entertainments was too great. The patron spent enough - too much, perhaps - but much of what he gave stopped far short of finding its way to the ultimate destination for which it was intended - the relief of the actually needy. The system was found to be annoying to the public and enormously wasteful of energy. As among peoples other than the Jews, it had degenerated into a system of genteel "holdup." It was pronounced demoralizing and a thing to be abolished.</p>
   <p>In addition to this, it was believed that the directors of the various Jewish charital institutions could render more effective service in their respective spheres if they could be relieved of the burden of raising money to support the institutions. The class of men desired for the management of the individual charities became scarce because they objected to placing themselves in the position of persistent beggars - even in the cause of charity. If men of the highest class could be secured and then relieved of all financial worry, it seemed reasonable that the service would be vastly improved.</p>
   <p>It was urged, also, that, a greater degree of harmony could be secured through financial <span class="page-break">\4</span>consolidation. The different relief-giving bodies had been independent of one another. There was no clearing-house where benefactions could be checked up, and duplications and frauds prevented. The result has been waste of more energy. All along it was the conservation of energy that was being striven for. The relief-giving bodies were merged into one, with one set of records and under one general control. The proved advantages have been all they were expected to be.</p>
   <p>Still another purpose in federation was to put an end to the regular annual deficits of most of the institutions dispensing charity to Jews. It was planned to collect enough money so that all the institutions could have enough for their need at that time, and it was hoped the aggregate collections could be increased by the central body so that each charity could have more as the city grew and the Jewish population increased. Each institution, under the new plan, has received considerably more than it was able to collect by its own efforts under the old system.</p>
   <p>Such were the theories from which grew the Associated Jewish Charities. They were only such as the merchants, bankers, and professional men at the head of the movement applied to the management of their own affairs. It was purely a matter of applying advanced business ideas to charity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Twelve distinct charitable institutions were gathered under the financial wing of the Associated Jewish Charities. The beneficiaries and the amount each received last year from the central body are as follows:</p>

   <p>Besides these, the Cleveland Orphan Asylum and the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives at Denver are beneficiaries of the Associated Jewish Charities in the sums annually of $4,500 and $3,000 respectively.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>This central finance body collected last year approximately $147,000 at a total cost of $3,300. In the collection of this money there has been no friction between charities, and the minimum of annoyance to subscribers has been experienced. It is the unwritten law of the federated body that no solicitation shall be made by any its beneficiaries, even for new buildings or furnishings, without the approval of the central body. The provision against solicitation of funds for maintenance is explicit. One of the chief sources of strength of the federation idea lies in the fact that the charitably disposed Jew who contributes to the Associated Jewish Charities knows he will not be solicited to buy tickets to entertainments or otherwise to contribute to any of the constituent charities. The solid influence of the central body, therefore, is thrown against all solicitation, except for the regular annual subscription to the associated fund. There have been cases in which other subscriptions have been attempted, but they have failed, principally because the one solicited, if he were a contributor to the Associated Jewish Charities, could refuse fairly and firmly on this ground. There were 1,711 subscribers to the general fund last year. The largest individual subscription was $4,000.</p>
   <p>The fund accruing by subscription to the Associated Jewish Charities is divided among the beneficiaries in about the same ratio as the money being raised by each <span class="page-break">\7</span>before the federation, bore the total fund. The Associated Jewish Charities does not interfere and, by the nature of its constitution, cannot interfere in the management of any charity. It merely collects and divides the money among them. Each institution of charity has its directors among managers, who rule as they did before the consolidation. Furthermore, they manage to better advantage, because they do not have to waste time in "raising the wind" and because they know just about how much money they will have to meet their needs during the year. Some of the institutions also have incomes from legacies and endowments in addition to the amount supplied them by the Associated Jewish Charities.</p>
   <p>Prior to the organization of the Associated Jewish Charities, there had been in existence for several years the United Hebrew Charities of Chicago. This organization, still intact, but federated with the Associated Jewish Charities, governs the Hebrew charities for relief, the Michael Reese Hospital and the West Side Dispensary.</p>
   <p>It was feared in the beginning of the federation movement that it might act as a check to the more progressive forms of philanthropy and the continuance of the forms already established. This danger has been steered around, as is demonstrated in <span class="page-break">\8</span>the Home for Jewish Friendless and Working Girls. For some time this institution struggled as best it could for existence without the aid of the federated body. The crying need it met, however, became apparent to the controlling financial body, which is now giving it $6,000 a year.</p>
   <p>Another danger of the plan, one that was considered the most forceful objection to it at first, was that rich men would cut down their legacies and that it would become difficult to raise large sums of money for new buildings. Although no such bequests have been made to the Associated Charities, there has been no decreases in legacies to the different charities. When it was decided a year ago to build a new Michael Reese Hospital $400,000 was raised within three weeks by solicitation by a few leaders in the movement. Not a penny was secured by bazaars, fairs, or other entertainments. The raising of nearly a million dollars in a few weeks by quiet solicitation was probably the most notable feat of its kind in the history of the city.</p>
   <p>This last year, in order to increase the subscriptions to the Associated Charities a plan was devised for setting forth to each subscriber in the most graphic and <span class="page-break">\9</span>forcible way the exact amount he was contributing to each of the constituent charities. This plan consisted in the issuing of abooklet telling briefly the work of each charity for the preceding year and the total amount given to it by the Associated body. Under the figures representing the work of each charity this line is found:</p>
   <p>"Amount of your contribution in support of this work for one year $----."</p>
   <p>The blank space is then filled out with the amount representing the proportion of the subscriber's contribution that goes for that particular charity. The effect of this presentation is to show each subscriber how little he is actually giving to each one of the different lines of work, and after thus being shown the contribution usually increased.</p>
   <p>The increase of tuberculosis among Jews is one of the main causes of distress with which the relief body has to contend. This increase has been found in the congested district of the West Side, where sanitary conditions work for the spread of the disease. The charity managers have tackled the problem in a practical way, seeking to prevent development and spread of the dread disease by removing infected individuals and families from the district.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>The personal service bureau of the Jewish charities goes directly into the homes and acts in a paternal way for the welfare of the children and in a semi-judicial way in straightening out the tangles of the fathers and mothers. This bureau lends money to those worthy and needing it, and out of $7, 240 loaned last year only $28 was lost. Difficulties arising from legal actions, such as the unjust actions of vicious constables, are straightened out by the bureau by the giving of free legal advice under which the poor may know how to assert their rights. The institution of proceedings by which the head of the family is compelled by the courts to support his dependents is a valuable function of the bureau, it being argued that there is more real charity in making a worthless father support a delicate wife and his children than in the charity institutions taking care of them. This rule also is applied to children of working age where enfeebled parents are dependent on them.</p>
   <p>From this personal service work come most of the humorous features that go to relieve the monotony of the relief workers' existence. A Jewish teacher was abusive and overbearing at home and niggardly in supplying his wife with funds to keep the household going. His wife, at the instigation of the bureau, went into the county court and asked for an order giving her $4.50 a week for the family table. This was <span class="page-break">\11</span>granted. For more than a year the teacher has paid $4.50 a week at the office of the bureau, where his wife calls for it, although husband and wife have been living together under the same roof.</p>
   <p>Here is the way the bureau treated a nagging wife. Two or three times a week the woman had come to the office to complain against her husband. At last it was decided to allow the husband to leave home. He was making $10 a week and promised to pay $6 to his family. He left home as advised, whereupon the wife set up a loud lamentation, not because the husband she had described as such an agre was not paying enough for her support, but because she wanted her husband back. He was kept away until the wife saw the error of her way and promised to curb her petulance that had nearly disrupted the home.</p>
   <p>The policy of the Jews in adapting strict and advanced business ideas to the giving of alms has rendered the Jewish charities the most economically administered in the world. The small ratio for collection and disbursement to the amount collected has proved a distinct incentive to more liberal giving. In this respect the Jews set an example for the world.</p>
