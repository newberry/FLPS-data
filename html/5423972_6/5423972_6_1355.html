   <p>The Jewish Society, exclusively a women's association interested in the rescue work of Chicago's patients afflicted with tuberculosis, has purchased ten acres of land from Nelson Thomasson, for $10,000. The site is located at West Belmont Avenue, N. 50th Avenue, School Street, and the prolonged N. 51st Avenue. A $40,000 mortgage is attached to the property. The organization is planning the erection of a tuberculosis sanitarium for the comfort of sufferers from that disease indiscriminate of their religious beliefs. Included in this plan is the administration building to be erected at a cost of $15,000, and a number of sanitary isolation homes, at a cost from $2,000 to $3,000 each. These homes will be built on a solid foundation. A corridor will run through the center of the structure with beds on both sides of the hall, and will include other necessary accommodations. Trees will be planted to adorn the place. The management of the institution will be placed in the hands of physicians, who have made a special study of tuberculosis. The <span class="page-break">2</span>support of the hospital will depend upon public contributions.</p>
   <p>This organization, with human interest at heart, was founded eight years ago and has since provided the needy tubercular patients with medical aid as well as with nourishing food. The following are the names of the officials of the association: Mrs. F. J. Robin, president; Mrs. M. L. Aren, vice-president; Mrs. L. C. Barnett, correspondent; and Mrs. Abraham Margolis, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The new sanitarium will be ready for occupancy in 1912.</p>
