   <p>Contributions by our Jewish population toward the erection of a new Jewish Orphanage changed the dream of several years into a realization today. Thus, the management of the Marks Nathan Orphanage 1243-1249 North Wood Street celebrated the laying of the foundation stone for a new building at Ogden and Albany Avenues. The new structure will be large enough to accommodate several hundred Jewish orphans of both sexes. A synagogue with a sitting capacity of 1000, a large hall for social activities, and a hospital, a section of which will be used for isolation cases, rooms for physicians and dentists, an operating room, etc., will also be erected on the same building grounds. Plans for playgrounds have also been made.</p>
   <p>Mr. Louis Bomasch, the second vice-president of the directorate of the orphanage, was highly honored, he being selected to lay the foundation stone in appreciation of his $600 endowment fund.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's gifts of money enriched the building fund by about $10,000.</p>
   
   <p>Festive addresses were given by the following: Messrs. Samuel Alschuler, N. J. Pritzler, A. L. Stone, Chairman of the Building Committee; J. Levy, president of the institution; the Jewish priests: Epstein, Silver, and Budzinski, and Senator Lorimer.</p>
