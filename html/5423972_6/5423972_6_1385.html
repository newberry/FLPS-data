   <p>From the 4th annual report of the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society of Chicago. </p>
   <p>"It had long been the ambition of some of our members to establish a sanitarium, since early cases urgently require institutional treatment. To Dr. Theodore B. Sacks belongs the credit of bringing the sanitarium into existence. It was he who directed the attention of the Baron Hirsch Women's Club to the need of a sanitarium for consumptives. Through his efforts, the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society, the Baron Hirsch Women's Club and the Willing Workers have affiliated and a sanitarium has been opened at Winfield, Illinois, to be managed and supported by the three allied societies. The J. G. R. S. has pledged itself to build and maintain a shack for ten patients, and to contribute 34,000 a year."</p>
