   <p>In an article in last Sunday's Tribune, the following description is given of the Jewish Training School: Crossing to the West Side to Chicago's Ghetto on Judd street, the Jewish Training School lifts its walls unostentatiously, but strongly above the surrounding squalor. This institution, under Prof. Gabriel Bamberger, was established four years ago. The school is free, non-sectarian, and receives pupils of both sexes and all nationalities between the ages of three and fourteen. The qualifications for admission are that the children must be poor, within the age limit, and pass a certain physical examination. One of the most admirable and unique features of this institution is the school physician. He should be in every school for the poor in the city. This systematic medical examination of the children detects the beginning of chronic ailments of the nature of heart disease and consumption and physical infirmities such as defective vision and deformities of the spine. The detection is followed by treatment and the provision of glasses, splints, trusses, and other needed helps.</p>
