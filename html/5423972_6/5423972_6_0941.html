   <p>Quotation from a letter sent to John Koren, New Haven, Conn., by Julian W. Mack, Secretary, "In regard to the liquor question, it is a remarkable fact that in all our experience we come in contact with cases of intemperance and drunkenness very rarely, and although in the last 15 years the class of people whom the Jewish Charity Associations have dealt with, consists largely of the poorest class of Russian Immigrants, the experience in this respect has not changed.</p>
   <p>While the great body of Jews of all classes are not total abstainers, they are practically speaking, very seldom drunkards of the 4500 cases dealt with in 93-94 and the 3000 in 94-95 the superintendent in stating the causes of distress does not mention drunkeness in a single instance."</p>
