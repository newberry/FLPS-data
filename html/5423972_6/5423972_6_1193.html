   <p>The annual meeting of the Medical Staff of Mount Sinai Hospital took place Friday evening, April fourteenth 1922. The President, Dr. M. Lewison, in his annual report, reported much satisfactory progress during the third year of the existence of the hospital.</p>
   <p>The laboratories have been enlarged and equipped to do not only the routine clinical work, but also research work. A Basal Metabolism laboratory has been opened, and will soon be prepared to report the results of its investigations.</p>
   <p>During the past year, the capacity of the Hospital has been enlarged until it now has one hundred and three beds. Even with this increased capacity however, Dr. Lewison reported that the Hospital is able to take care of only about one-fourth of those who apply for admittance. It is hoped that the campaign for a large hospital will soon be resumed to meet this necessity.</p>

   <p>A matter of great satisfaction during the past year is the recognition of the scientific work of the Hospital by the American Medical Association and the American College of Surgeons, who have placed the Mount Sinai Hospital on the Approved List of Class A Hospitals, suitable for giving the fifth year of instruction to medical students. This Hospital thus takes its place as a factor in medical education.</p>
   <p>The Nurses Training School has been greatly enlarged, so that it now has eighteen student nurses. The lack of space for the housing of the nurses is a great draw-back in the development of the Training School. A new Nurses home for the hospital is a pressing need, and should be one of the first developments in the new building program.</p>
   <p>A conspicuous feature in the medical work which has been added during the past year, has been the weekly clinical conferences held at the Hospital, at which the diagnosis and treatment of obscure cases is discussed by the entire staff, and all other matters pertaining to the betterment of the treatment of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>patients at the hospital are fully considered, not only by the members of the staff, but also by all other doctors practicing at the Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
   <p>Dr. Lewison noted with pleasure that Mount Sinai Hospital has served to unite the Jewish Medical Profession of Chicago, and create within them a definite civic spirit and professional pride, so that today, the Jewish Medical Profession work in unison for all matters which tend to the betterment of the health of the community and for the elevation of the ideals of the profession.</p>
   <p>At the election of officers which ensued, the following were re-elected for the ensuing year: Dr. M. Lewison, president; Dr. V. L. Schrager, vice-president; Dr. Chas. Newberger, secretary.</p>
   <p>The following Committees were appointed to carry on the work of the Staff: Internes, Nurses, Diet, Dispensary and Records.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The Dispensary Committee of which Dr. N. Schoolman is chairman, reported that over one thousand patients were treated in the Out Patient Department during the past year, and that lack of space hinders greater progress and more elaborate clinical work.</p>
   <p>The rapidly increasing demands for space is the great need of the institution at present, and it is hoped that the proposed building program for an enlarged hospital will be realized within the coming year.</p>
