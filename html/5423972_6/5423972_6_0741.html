   <p>The Social Service League of Jewish Women has planned two chief activities for the year, a bureau for volunteer workers, and a camp for girls.</p>
   <p>The bureau for volunteer workers is already well established. Its duty is to act as a place of registration for the organizations who can use volunteer workers, and for those individuals who desire to do volunteer service.</p>
   <p>The camp committee has begun active work toward completing plans for a summer camp. It will accommodate twenty-five girls, each of whom will have a vacation for two weeks.</p>
