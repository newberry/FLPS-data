   <p>Next Sunday afternoon the cornerstone for the new Northwest Side Talmud Torah will be laid at 1517 Morris Place near Davison Street. Chicago Jews have long known of the need for a Talmud Torah on the Northwest Side, and our friends in that neighborhood deserve the support and respect of the Jews of the entire city for making possible the building of this structure.</p>
   <p>Many notables are expected to be present at the ceremonies when the cornerstone will be laid. It is planned that the school will also serve some of the functions of a community center.</p>
