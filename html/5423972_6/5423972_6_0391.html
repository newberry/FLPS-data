   <p>Never before in the history of the Jewish Hebrew Institute have we witnessed such great enthusiasm and activities. The most important of all at present, is the first series of lectures and all other lectures which will follow on every Friday evening, this winter season. The first lecture of the series will take place on Friday evening Nov. 3rd, when our well known Rabbi Emil Hirsch of Sinai Temple will speak. Dr. Hyman Cohen of the City Health Department will lecture on Friday evening Nov. 10th. He will speak in Yiddish. This lecture is intended for the benefit of West Side Jews.</p>
   <p>In addition to these lectures we expect to have open dances which will begin on Nov. 1st. The object of the Hebrew Institute is to have these dances to keep the Jewish youth away from the public dance halls. The Institute is also figuring on having the talented musician, Alexander Tchaikowsky, in a series of concerts this season.</p>
