   <p>At yesterday's meeting of the Marks Nathan Home, the report of the investigating and reorganizing committee was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>The report dealt with four questions: 1) the building, 2) inner conduct, 3) the children, 4) the support of the Home. The report was written by a committee consisting of Samuel Phillipson, B. J. Schiff, B. Hurwitz, A. L. Stone, A. B. Zelfreund, Judge Harry M. Fisher and James Davis.</p>
   <p>The report elucidates that the building stands as a monument to the arrogant neglect of those, "who built the home". The management of the directors is such that, "the greatest part of the Board is not enough interested and informed, following blindly the leadership of a few, whose ambition is to kill the influence of others, good or bad"; that the children are reared without discipline and order; that the expenses of the Home are nine thousand dollars more than they should be, and quick action must be taken up, if the home is to be preserved and not suffer.</p>
   <p>On account of this the Committee recommended that a special committee of nine be immediately appointed. The committee shall have the full right to govern the home, without the interference of the officers and directors. The committee shall be in control of the home until election time when new directors will be <span class="page-break">\2</span>elected.</p>
   <p>The new committee shall consist of: Samuel Phillipson, C. Harron, Rabbi Saul Silber, I. Klavons, J. Levy,A.L. Stone, Ike Biezark and M. Ruben.</p>
   <p>The report and recommendations were unanimously adoped, and the new committee will take over the entire management of the home.</p>
   <p>The resignations of Mr. Sol Druker, superintendent, and Mrs. Julia Stone, director, were also accepted at the meeting.</p>
   <p>The report of the investigating committee is an acknowledgment of all attacks and criticisms, which were published in the COURIER for the last three years. In order to correct everything, the committee could do nothing else but remove the management from the present directors and officers.</p>
