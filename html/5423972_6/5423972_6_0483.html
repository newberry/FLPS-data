   <p>To Parents. (Editorial).</p>
   <p>Allow your children to play outdoors. Do not deny your children the pleasures of outdoor sports. Sports are not a waste of time. They are essential to the natural growth of children. A sound body is essential to a sound mind.</p>
   <p>If you have never played ball, which you probably have not, the following will be of interest to you. First, it teaches quick thinking and shows the child that he must do a thing and get it done fast. Secondly, it teaches the value of co-ordination and working with others. It teaches him when it is best to act independently and when working with someone else brings better results. Above all, it brings a healthy color to his cheeks. Every breath of fresh air he gets is better than a hundred dollars in the bank, and every one knows health is better than wealth.</p>
   <p>Do not fear that some of the boys are bad. Twelve year old model children <span class="page-break">2</span>are extremely rare. Athletics will not hurt them. Let your children play during play-time. The outdoors will make him a better man. The world needs men. Men are what the world needs most and this is the way to build them.</p>
