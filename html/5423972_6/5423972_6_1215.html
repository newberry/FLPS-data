   <p>This Jewish Hospital is not Supported by Jewish Millionaires. by Dr. Z. Lorber.</p>
   <p>The Mount Sinai Hospital, which consists of a five story building located at California Ave. and 15th St., is not a charity institution. The two large Jewish charity societies, the Federated Charities and the Associated Charities, have contributed nothing to this institution. According to the (first) yearly report - the hospital exists only 19 months - its entire expenses were $140,000 of which approximately 2/3 was covered from the payments of patients. The remaining $40,000 was covered through contributions made by yearly subscribers. Our rich "Yahudim" (German Jews) who love to parade their philanthropy before the eyes of the Gentiles, have not contributed a single penny for this Jewish Hospital which contains but 65 beds in a community of 150,000 Jews.</p>
   <p>The contribution of the $40,000, according to the report, is made in such small sums an $5. $10, $15, and $25. Only occasionally are larger sums marked. This shows that the little support that the hospital has received during the past year has come mainly from the Jewish working man and a small part of the Jewish middle class.</p>

   <p>The first $16,000 which proved to be the cornerstone of this institution was gathered from pennies and nickels through a tag day which was held sometime in May 1919 when the hospital was first opened. The only lodge which responded to this appeal of the hospital was that of the radical workers of Chicago - the Workmen's Circle which gave $150.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna King, superintendent of the hospital, told us, "We wish to let you know that our hospital has broken all records of all large West Side hospitals for the number of children born. During the past 19 months, there were born in this hospital a total of 647 children, and what is more important, there was not one instance of a child dying and not one blood poisoning case." In response to the question whether the nurses were Jewish, the superintendent answered there were a few Jewish nurses, but that it was impossible to secure enough Jewish girls for training.</p>
   <p>Of the various women's organizations which participate in the support of this hospital, we call your special attention to the West Side Women's Club and the <span class="page-break">3</span>Ladies' Infant Aid Society. The former recently purchased a house which will be transformed into a home for nurses. This means that 15 nurses will be given separate housing and that the hospital's third floor will be devoted to patients.</p>
   <p>The latter sets for itself the duty of supplying clothing and layettes for the infants in the baby ward.</p>
