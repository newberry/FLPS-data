   <p>The first patient at the Maimonides Kosher Hospital was a healthy boy, who was born to Mrs. Louise H. Saltzberg, 1215 S. Millard Avenue.</p>
   <p>No ceremony was made at the opening. There are a number of sick patients who already have reserved beds. Three patients will undergo operations tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Every department is organized with adequate nurses and doctors. The hospital will be strictly kosher. The rabbis have engaged an inspector to take care of all the dietary food laws.</p>
   <p>Everything in the Maimonides Hospital was made after the latest inventions in medical science, and according to professional men it is the best equipped hospital in Chicago.</p>
