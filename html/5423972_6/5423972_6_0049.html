   <p>We return to the old problem of education which should, and must, interest every father and teacher, and anyone concerned with Jewish education. This problem is a very old one. Ancient problems are always great problems. No one has ever declared a problem superfluous merely because it was ancient.</p>
   <p>One of our outstanding social workers asked me: "Why can't we make the Talmud Torahs as good as our public schools--for poor children as well as for rich? Why should the results of Hebrew-school instruction not be as good as those of the public schools? These questions are important--they are vital issues. If these questions could be answered, it seems to me that the problems of Jewish education in America would be automatically solved.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Talmud Torah in America is not considered as important as the <span class="page-break">2</span>European Talmud Torah. In Europe the Talmud Torah was for children of poor parents, but in America, where experienced teachers are rare, even rich parents cannot secure competent teachers for their children. It is as much the sacred obligation of the community to provide the schools attended by rich children with competent teaching staffs, as it is its sacred duty to provide free schooling for poor children.</p>
   <p>Our problem becomes more difficult, however, when we attempt to solve these questions: What are the chief impediments which obstruct and hinder the progress of the Talmud Torah? Why shouldn't the Talmud Torah actually become the focal point, the lighthouse, for general Jewish education in America? We need not go too far [to secure the answers]. Anyone can readily see that one of the reasons why the progress of the Talmud Torah is retarded is--time. We should not forget that in Europe the child went to the Talmud Torah about twelve hours a day for six years--until he was twelve or thirteen years old. Yet, [in spite of this period of training], ninety per cent of the masses of Orthodox Jews who attended the European Talmud Torah cannot read the prayers intelligently--let alone the <span class="page-break">3</span>Pentateuch or Rashi [commentary on the Pentateuch]. The institution existed; but it accomplished very little considering the time the child spent there.</p>
   <p>The period during which the Jewish child studies Jewish subjects in America is the worst possible time of the day. After spending his whole day in public school, the Jewish child must go to Hebrew school at four o'clock in the afternoon, while other children are doing their homework or playing outdoors. Tired, nervous, and often hungry the child enters the classroom and begins his Hebrew studies for two or three hours.</p>
   <p>Comparing the time spent in the public school and in the Hebrew school, we can easily see why the Talmud Torahs cannot progress as much as the public schools. I wish to state that the Talmud Torahs do even more work and attain better results than the public schools, considering the time- limitation element.</p>
   <p>Note how the Catholics understand this problem better than we Jews. They have separate schools where they teach their children their dogmas during the best <span class="page-break">4</span>time of the day. Give us schools where we can have the children during the entire day and where they will devote their time to Jewish studies only--then you shall see than we can accomplish much more than the teacher in the European Talmud Torah. Then we could also be favorably compared to the public schools.</p>
   <p>Our rabbis, the faithful guards of Judaism, should know that the future of Judaism in America depends upon the education we will give our children. They should consider the proposal of establishing a Jewish school where Hebrew will be taught during the day and English at night. In the meantime, we should be satisfied with the Talmud Torah and do the best we can with it.</p>
