   <p>The Northwest Side Ladies Charity Society which has been known for many years for their charity work, find themselves in a condition which compels them to appeal to the Jewish people of Chicago to patronize the Charity Ball which will take place next Sunday evening, November 12th, 8 P. M., at Wicker Park, 2040 North Ave.</p>
   <p>This ball is given for the purpose of raising some money to furnish our poor with coal for the winter. The cold weather came in quite unexpectedly and many poor families are suffering. They are waiting patiently for us to send them some coal, but so far, we have been unable to finance this worthy cause. Therefore we again are making this appeal to you Jews of Chicago to come to this ball. By so doing, you will earn a big "Mitzvah" (reward for good deed) and be entertained at the same time.</p>
   <p>Admission 25Â¢</p>
   <p>Resp.</p>
