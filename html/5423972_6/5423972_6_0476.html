   <p>Playground and Summer Activities.</p>
   <p>Not having been in charge of the Institute last summer, I am not in a position to give you at first hand as complete a report of the summer activities on the grounds as they deserve. I am obliged in this instance to merely summarize from the reports submitted to the Board, by the directors of the summer activities. The playgrounds were opened April 27, 1913. A charge of fifteen cents for the entire season was made to all children under fifteen years of age and twenty-five cents for those over fifteen years of age. The total attendance on the grounds last summer was 113,580. Stereopticon lectures on hygiene were given to the children in the large hall, once a week during July and August. An outdoor Sabbath School was conducted with an average attendance of 110. Sessions were held Saturday afternoons. The program consisted of Bible stories and legends. Numerous outings and celebrations were conducted. I am very hopeful that I may be in a position to give a complete report, including recommendations, next year, after a careful study of the summer activities during this coming season.</p>
