   <p>At the meeting of the Board, it was announced that after an advocacy of 6 or 7 years, a Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds was formed at Philadelphia during a recent Social Worker's Conference.</p>
   <p>Some of the problems presented at the discussion leading to the formation of the Council included the relationship of programs of Jewish Cultural and educational work to the programs of Jewish Federations, the relationship of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds to the programs of Jewish constructive work abroad both in Europe and in Palestine and the relationship of the Jewish family relief programs to tax relief programs locally and nationally and to the emergency relief funds raised in the various communities.</p>
   <p>The group present at the Phila. meeting voted in favor of the formation of this Council. If it is formed and if the right laymen become active in the organization, we shall have in this country a body to plan nationally as well as locally for Jewish philanthropy.</p>
