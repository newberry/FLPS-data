   <p>Lectures on the West Side.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Hebrew Institute last Friday showed their cleverness as to what to do in case of getting into a tight spot. Rabbi Hirsch being sick at home, unable to lecture at the West Side Auditorium last Friday, they decided to select another good speaker to lecture in the place of Dr. Hirsch, so as not to miss any of the prearranged series of lectures, of which the subject is, to speak on Jewish ethics.</p>
   <p>Dr. Yoodelson was selected to lecture in the place of Rabbi Hirsch on this series of lectures and he showed great ability and knowledge in Judaism, Jewish history, etc. The hall was crowded and it showed the eagerness of listening to this great orator to something worth while. Every one went away highly pleased. The series of lectures will be held all this season, and until our beloved Rabbi Hirsch will regain his health, other noted speakers will take his place every Friday evening at the West Side Auditorium.</p>
