   <p>During the year ending October, 1891, $57,000 was expended in the conduct of the relief office and the Michael Reese Hospital, and 12,000 persons had received assistance. In the relief office $19,000 was expended, and in the hospital $38,000. Up to September 1 Russian refugees were provided for, but the forming of an independent relief society for the care of this society has relieved the United Hebrew Charities of the burden.</p>
