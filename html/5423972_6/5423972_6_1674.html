   <p>The ladies and gentlemen advocating the establishment of a Jewish Orphan Asylum in this city have organized and incorporated a society under the name of "Chicago Jewish Orphan Asylum." The papers of incorporation and application for a charter have been forwarded to Springfield and the members of the new society are working hard to bring about a speedy realization of the proposed Orphan's Home.</p>
   <p>The first impetus was given to this movement by the Deborah Verein and the Baron De Hirsch Ladies Aid Society. The incorporators are Mesdames E. C. Hamburgher, D. Yondorf, M. Hecht, Lena Radinsky, L. Newberger, M. Baer, and M. Dessauer.</p>
