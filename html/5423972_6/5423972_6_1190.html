   <p>At a banquet of the Fish Dealers Association, last Sunday evening, the sum of $126.25 was raised, following an appeal made by Madame Fannie Rinehart, for the Chicago-Los Angeles Sanatorium for Consumptives.</p>
   <p>There are a great many Chicago Jews in the Los Angeles Sanatorium. A movement is now on foot to establish a Chicago division for the Chicago victims of the white plague. The Fish Dealers were the first to respond by contributing their share to this enterprise.</p>
