   <p>Camp Covenant.</p>
   <p>None can appreciate what it means to the average boy living in a congested neighborhood, under physical conditions and general environment, the monotony of which has a tendency to depress and discourage, very often causing that blank "I don't care" and "What's the difference" attitude, unless they witnessed the four different groups of forty boys each that left for camp every two weeks from the doors of the Institute. The camp was known as Camp Covenant. An arrangement has been gone into between the B'nai B'rith, who paid the expenses of maintaining the camp, including the camp, director, and assistants, the Institute furnishing the boys, collecting the fees, arranging the groups, and sending off the parties. A charge of $3.50 was made for boys of school age from twelve years old, up, and $7.00 for two weeks for working boys. Needless to say that just as soon as the announcement was hung out to the effect that boys can go to camp, and that those that cannot afford camp may apply for scholarship, we had more applications on file than the camp was able to accommodate by the time the first batch left the city.</p>

   <p>In other words, when the first group returned from camp there were again as many applications on file as the camp was in a position to accommodate for the rest of the season, so that we were forced to"shut down" on taking applications, before the camp season was over, and returned money to a considerable number for whom there was no room.</p>
   <p>The discouraging feature of the entire situation was the inability because of the expense and the physical facilities of the camp to accommodate 500 instead of 160 boys. And a further discouragement was the disappointment of the girls of similar ages for whom there never seems to be any arrangement made for equal opportunities of a recreative character. To quote one of the girls in her characteristic expression, "Oh, when will we ever have a camp to go to like the boys have? Every one likes the girls all right, but they never do anything for them." Of which observation, I could not help but see the justice and merely made a tentative promise that if it is at all possible, I soon hope that the girls may also have a camp in which to recreate, to store up in two weeks, enough freedom and recreation to hold them for the trials of the rest of the year.</p>
