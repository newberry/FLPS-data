   <p>Great progress has been made in the movement to establish a home for unfortunate Jewish infants who lost their parents because of influenza. Leaders in this movement are Mrs. Berry and Mrs. Levin, who have organized the Motherless Infant Club. At this club's recent affair at the Empire Theater, which was a great success, Judge Harry M. Fisher addressed the audience. As a result, almost five hundred dollars in cash was collected, besides the money for the sales of tickets.</p>
   <p>The leaders of this movement plan a huge mass meeting in which prominent speakers will participate. At this meeting, to be held soon, the first step will be taken to establish an orphanage.</p>
   <p>Let every Jew, if he possesses a Jewish heart, help in this undertaking; <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>first, out of pity for the motherless or fatherless infants; secondly, that they may not be given to non-Jews and reared as such. Too many of the unfortunate Jewish babies in Chicago are in the homes of non-Jews, and although we cannot adjust this matter now, at least we should try to avoid such occurrence in the future.</p>
