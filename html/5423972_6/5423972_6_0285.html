   <p>Conservative Judaism Expounded</p>
   <p>At the Five O'clock Forum held on Sunday, December 25, Rabbi Max Kadushin of the Humboldt Boulevard Temple, gave his views on "What Is Conservative Judaism?"</p>
   <p>Rabbi Kadushin explained that the Conservative group looked upon Judaism as a civilization, and not merely as a revelation or a religious--philosophical system. He developed this view and indicated just how such a view is needed right now, for the purpose of preserving the higher values of Judaism for the modern Jew.</p>
