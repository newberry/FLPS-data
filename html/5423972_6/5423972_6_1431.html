   <p>The hospital owes its beginning to a fund bequeathed by Michael Reese of San Francisco.</p>
   <p>In 1879 Henry L. Frank and his brother, Joseph Frank, Trustees of the Michael Reese Fund, offered the sum of $30,000. for a hospital building on condition that it shall be known as Michael Reese Hospital. Mr. Jacob Rosenberg and Mrs. Henrietta Rosenfeld, likewise Trustees of a Fund bequeathed to them by Michael Reese, offered to donate $50,000. The U.H.R.A. accepted both offers.</p>
   <p>The cornerstone for the hospital was laid on November 4, 1880, and on the 23rd of October 1881 it was dedicated and opened for the admission of patients.</p>
