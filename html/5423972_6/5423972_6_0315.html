   <p>The first lecture of this season, arranged by the Educational Committee of the Workmen's Circle, will be held this Thursday evening, for the members of three branches in the Workmen's Circle Lyceum.</p>
   <p>The plan of the Educational Committee is, that if a branch meets on the same evening, at the same time, that a lecture is scheduled, they should conduct the business meetings from 8 to 9 o'clock and then return to one hall, where a lecture will be delivered. The first three branches that accepted this plan of the Educational Committee are: Vilno Branch 178, Pinsk Branch 252, and Branch 39. A lecture will be delivered to these three branches, by Dr. Z. Lorber, on - What is our Jewish Culture?</p>
   <p>The three branches appointed a general committee to take care of the educational work of their branches. Branch 138 appointed Nisenson and Stern; Branch 252 appointed Finkelstein, Sherman, and Rubin; and Branch 39 appointed Silverman and Shepovitz.</p>
