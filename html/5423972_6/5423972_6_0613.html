   <p>In the English language, there is a very popular expression: "practical idealist". This means a person with ideals, one who strives for higher things--not merely a dreamer, nor one who is mentally deranged, but a practical person. The name, "practical idealist," can also be applied to the Order Bnai Zion, which, as a Zionist organization, has as its goal the realization of the age-old dream of our people--the securing of a national home in Palestine. In this respect, the Order works together with the general Zionist movement in America.</p>
   <p>It is understood that every member of the Order is, at the same time, a fully privileged member in good standing of the Zionist organization. In some respects, the Order is superior to the Zionist movement. Not only does it work for the future of political Zionism, but it also believes in present-day activity. One of its basic principles is the fraternization of its members--[that is, it is] <span class="page-break">\2</span>an association, in one large friendly family, of practical idealists who, while striving for their ideals, are at the same time doing everything possible to sweeten the present Jewish life in the Diaspora.</p>
   <p>Thus, the Order Bnai Zion was founded on a practical-idealistic principle. It is an institution embracing the Zionist ideal, and, at the same time, a life and health insurance society. Furthermore, it is an organization in which all members are like brothers and comrades, who work and amuse themselves together, not only as members of an order, but as loyal and devoted friends.</p>
   <p>Here we may ask: Why is the Order Bnai Zion the only one of its kind in the Zionist organization? Why aren't there other such orders devoted to the Zionist ideal? The answer is that whenever the idea of such an organization has been mentioned, a dispute would arise between the practical and idealistic Zionists. The idealists bitterly opposed every attempt that would admit the business element into the Zionist movement, but the practical workers finally triumphed and a convention was held thirteen years ago at Clinton Hall, New York, where <span class="page-break">\3</span>it was resolved to organize the Order Bnai Zion as a benevolent society.</p>
   <p>From then on, the Order has grown tremendously. It now has fifty-nine orders throughout the country (of which seventeen are in New York), and a membership of many thousands. The business side of the Order is placed on such a strictly scientific basis that the disbursement of benefits is [absolutely] safe. The Order now has as high as $200,000 in various safe investments.</p>
   <p>The Order Bnai Zion is the first Jewish organization to adopt a scientific insurance system which gives its members an opportunity to insure themselves for as much as $2,000 (in other orders the maximum is only $500). The death benefits are paid three days after the death notice reaches the office of the Order. Dues are regulated according to the age of a member at the time he is admitted, and as the payments are scientifically fixed, they can never be raised, and, furthermore, the Order can never go bankrupt because it does not undertake to do that which is impossible.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Yet, all these business angles of the Order do not obscure the idealistic side of its activity. When a person passes every examination and is accepted as a member, he is then brought before the president of the camp [lodge] in which he becomes a member. The president delivers the following induction speech.</p>
   <p>"My friend, before I admit you as a member of the [Order] Bnai Zion, I wish to acquaint you with the fundamental laws and principles of our Order. If you approve of them, you will be admitted as a member. If not, you have time to withdraw. Our Order has as its goal the following objectives:</p>
   <p>"1. Aid to the Zionist Congress to obtain for our people a national home in Palestine.</p>
   <p>"2. Support to all Jewish institutions that strengthen our people.</p>
   <p>"3. Dissemination of knowledge of the Hebrew language and Jewish history; and</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"4. Support of every member of the Order who is in business and aid to those who are ill or in need.</p>
   <p>"Do you agree with these principles?"</p>
   <p>If a candidate says "Yes," he is accepted as a member. If not, his candidacy is rejected. The entire ceremony of induction of members is based on Jewish tradition, on Jewish history, and on Jewish aspirations. The impression made upon new members is very profound and remains always in their memory.</p>
   <p>Although the Order is strongly in favor of Zionism, yet, it always has the courage of its own convictions and speaks out very candidly and sharply; for example, the Order has persistently championed democratic elections in the Jewish Congress. We shall write about other important national issues later.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, it will be interesting to note who the presidents of the Order have been from its inception to the present day. The first president of the <span class="page-break">\6</span>Order Bnai Zion was the late Dr. David Blaustein of the Educational Alliance. He was succeeded by the veteran Zionist, Dr. Joseph Blaustone; the noted Jewish writer, Leon Zolotkoff, was the third president; the well-known welfare worker Joseph Barondess--the fourth; Judge Jacob P. Strahl--the fifth; and now the president is Abraham Shamer, the famous dramatist and father of the World Jewish Congress movement in America and in other parts of the world.</p>
