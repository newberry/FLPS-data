   <p>Chicago Illinois.</p>
   <p>October 26, 1907.</p>
   <p>Rev. Solomon H. Bauer.</p>
   <p>City.</p>
   <p>Dear Doctor:- Pursuant to our recent conversation I enclose herewith copy of report just issued by Michael Reese Hospital.</p>
   
   <p>From a perusal of this report you will see that the accusations are unfounded, and I trust you will take steps to retract your newspaper article.</p>
   <p>I will be pleased to lay before our Board of Directors anything you may publish in this direction.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Moses E. Greenbaum.</p>
   <p>The report alluded to in above letter is as follows: - To the members of the Michael Reese Hospital: A word at this time regarding our magnificent new hospital, the pride of Chicago's Jews, will be of interest.</p>
   
   <p>During the period from July 1 to October 1 there were treated at the hospital 340 free patients, receiving 4,912 days of service, being 43.6 per cent of the total number of patients in the hospital during this period.</p>
   <p>These cases of forcibly bring before you the great work of philanthropy your institution is conducting.</p>
   <p>There were treated 179 ward patients, receiving 2,231 days of service, being 19.9 per cent of the total number of patients in the hospital during this period, at the nominal rate of $8.00 per week for board, medical service, drugs and nursing. These are the cases where the patient pays a nominal charge, being about one-half cost, for the service rendered, to come within the requirements for those who can pay shall contribute according to their means for their care.</p>
   
   <p>There were treated 118 private ward patients, receiving 1,758 days of service, being 15.6 per cent of the total number of patients in the hospital during this period, at rates ranging from $10.00 to $18.00 per week, for board, medical service, drugs and nursing.</p>
   <p>There were treated 204 pay patients, receiving 2,346 days of service, being 20.9 per cent of the total number of patients in the hospital during this period, at prices ranging from $25.00 per week up in private rooms.</p>
   <p>In this connection it may be stated that the prices have been carefully graded to provide accomodations at rates commensurate with the ability of the patients to pay and the wishes of the patient in the accomodations desired.</p>
   
   <p>And now a word regarding the policy of the hospital. Since July 9, 1907, the hospital is open to all reputable physicians, whether connected with the staff of the hospital or not, in its private pay rooms. To emphasize - any reputable physician can bring his patient to the private pay rooms of the hospital and use the hospital facilities to the same extent as the regular medical and surgical staff.</p>
   <p>It should be borne in mind that while the Michael Reese Hospital is primarily a charity for the alleviation of distress and sickness of our fellow-men, that a charity conducted on so large a scale must have means of support, and that while it cannot be self-supporting from its pay patients alone, because they comprise only a small percentage of the work done, as is apparent from the foregoing figures, we can do much towards increasing the revenue of the hospital by acquainting the public generally with the fact that at the Michael Reese may be had the most modern scientific and the very best facilities for the sick, and that the open door policy in connection with its private pay rooms has been adopted, and that all reputable physicians and surgeons generally are invited to bring their patients to the private pay rooms of the hospital, with the assurance that every facility will be placed at their disposal.</p>
   <p>To this end your generous co-operation is asked.</p>
   <p>Edwin G. Foreman, president.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edwin G. Foreman is to be congratulated on the business-like form of this report, the system of giving the percentages of patients in the various grades being especially commendable. Mr. Foreman and those associated with him, including of course Mr. Moses E. Greenebaum, who forwarded the report to us, must be commended for the statement in the report that the hospital is primarily a charity for the alleviation of distress and sickness of our fellow-men. And we wish to give wide publicity to the statement by Edwin G. Foreman that "we can do much towards increasing the revenue of the hospital by acquainting the public generally with the fact that at the Michael Reese may be had the most modern, scientific and the very best facilities for the sick."</p>
   <p>We have never doubted that the Directors of the Michael Reese Hospital were competent gentlemen fully able to equip the hospital with the latest and best accommodations and to command the best medical aid. We have never doubted that they were catering to the people at large. Jewish philanthropy is not narrow, but Jewish philanthropy is never unjust; it does not sacrifice the reasonable claims of the Jew are never disregarded. Even if the majority of patients in the hospital were non-Jews, the minority should be treated justly. But where the majority of the patients are Jews, and the founder of the hospital was a Jew, providing for the Jew so that he could find the treatment suited to a Jew, it becomes more than imperative to respect the feelings and the faith of the Jewish patients in the hospital. Those feelings cannot be satisfied, nor that faith be respected where there is no kosher kitchen, and where the mohel is denied admission. Dr. Schanfarber, in our contemporary, has called attention to the fact that the policy of the Directors will lead to the erection of a new hospital, and in the articles signed "J. R." the statement is made: "And so at least two hospitals are needed in Chicago," and we may add that in an issue of the Reform Advocate, Rabbi Hirsch urged the installing of a kosher kitchen.</p>
   <p>In our opinion the Michael Reese Hospital is fully adequate to meet the the present need, and it is just because we desire to witness the success of the institution and because we respect the reputation of the Directors of the hospital, that we have insisted on the establishment of a kosher kitchen and the admittance of the mohel.</p>
   
   <p>We notice that Dr. Schanfarber finds it necessary to warn the Directors of the result of their policy, and "J. R.", issue October 19, declares "Jewish institutions that are managed by non-Jews are an eternal shame to Jews." We are at a loss to understand why "S. H. B." should be signalled out any more than others to receive communications asking for a retraction. When there is a statement made after full consideration; when that statement makes known the true facts of the case, there is no necessity for retraction. We stand by the banners of common-sense and justice. We cannot recede from our position, which is that a kosher kitchen should be established, and the mohel should be admitted. Have the Directors realized the injustice of denying the mohel admission when other hospitals that are non-Jewish do not hesitate - St. Mary's, St. Joseph's, and the German-American. At a time when the feelings of the mothers are most sensitive on such subjects, they are denied the presence of one whose faith and practice make him competent to preform the sacred rite, for it is absolutely necessary that there should be perfect cleanliness and thorough knowledge and experience on the part of the one who preforms the sacred rite. Why do we call the rite sacred? Because it is a Mosaic law. It is because we are desirous that Mr. Moses E. Greenebaum and Mr. Edwin G. Foreman and, indeed, all the Directors of the hospital should adhere to the forms of their faith and be true to the Judaism we know they love so well, that we have called their attention to the needs of patients in the hospital.</p>
   <p>So soon as the Directors accede to the demands of the Jewish community and take steps to fulfill the dietary law and the Mosaic law concerning the Abrahamic covenant, so soon will they earn the respect of the people, and the praise, instead of the criticism of this paper.</p>
   
   <p>In the meantime we ask them to answer these questions: When will they establish a kosher kitchen? When will they admit a properly qualified mohel? What is the reason for the displacement of Dr. Ungerlieder? We will take pleasure in laying the answers before our readers.</p>
   <p>S. H. Bauer.</p>
