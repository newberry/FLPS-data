   <p>That the demand for discussion, instruction and enlightenment on current problems has arisen among the leaders of the trade unions can be readily seen from the establishment of educational and cultural programs in the unions for the members.</p>
   <p>The International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Joint Board have arranged classes of instruction and concerts and lectures for their members. In addition to these educational activities, the Amalgamated Local 39 introduced an open forum every second and fourth Friday evening in one of the halls of the Ashland Aditorium, where various political and economic problems are capably dealt with by representatives of the labor movement. After the lectures all members participate in a discussion.</p>
   <p>Local 39, which began the open forum, invites the members of other locals to attend and take part in the discussion. Admission free.</p>
