   <p>A call meeting will be held of some prominent Jewish citizens of the Northwest Side on Wednesday of this week at Shoenhoffer's Hall, Milwaukee and Ashland Avenue, to discuss plans for the organizing of the Orthodox Jewish Charities on the Northwest Side of Chicago. Twenty-four new subscribers were turned over to the new movement and the total sum collected is $1,675. A subscription list is already out for next Wednesday June 26, showing donations collected for United Orthodox Jewish Charities. There is a movement on foot to organize the down-town Jewish business men in the near future.</p>
