   <p>The Rest Cottage for convalescent men and boys, established by the Baron Hirsch Woman's Club, has now been in existence since January 31, when it was dedicated. Since February 1, 158 men and boys have been cared for.</p>
   <p>The cottage contains fourteen rooms and can accomodate twenty-four patients. The men are those whose home environment is not conducive to rapid recovery after serious illness. They are transferred from Michael Reese, Maimonides, and Cook County Hospitals and the Jewish Aid. This is the first home of its kind in Chicago.</p>
