   <p>Dear Sisters and worthy public:</p>
   <p>At our last meeting we voted the sum of 265 dollars to be spent on clothing poor families unable to purchase these necessities of life. We ask you to remember this organization and its worthy work when you make your contributions to other organizations and institutions during the coming holiday season.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Adelson, Pres.
