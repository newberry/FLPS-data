   <p>At a meeting last night of the directors of the Maimonides Hospital, the good news was received that the receiver, Dr. Arensbi has given an additional extension of sixty days in which to raise a certain sum necessary to assure the existence of the hospital. It looks now as though the danger of foreclosure is past, and the maimonides Hospital will remain a Jewish hospital. All we needed, was $25,000 and $10,000 of this amount has already been raised. We need now only $15,000 and we can rest assured that the hospital will be reopened. The directors therefore have decided to come out with an appeal to the large Jewish community to help raise the $15,000 in order to be in position to reopen the hospital and let it stay open permanently. This appeal is to urge the Jewish people of Chicago to become yearly subscribers to the only Jewish hospital in Chicago.</p>
