   <p>We feel it our duty to announce at this time that there will be a Chanukath Ha-Baith (House-Warming) celebration at the Marks Nathan Orphan Home next Sunday afternoon. The approaching celebration makes it an appropriate time to appeal to the Jews of Chicago to take a greater interest in the affairs of our institutions. This institution in particular is rendering invaluable services to our community and these services should not be limited in any way because of a lack of funds to further its activities. We appeal now for you to become members of the institution and to become regular donors.</p>
   <p>As for the coming celebration, bring your wives and your children. Let our orphans know who their friends are. Every Chicago Jew should visit the Orphan Home and become acquainted with its activities. We owe it as a duty to ourselves and the rest of Chicago Jewry.</p>
