   <p>Jewish women and girls will tag you today. They will be found on every street corner. The tagging will be for the benefit of the new home for the Daughters of Zion Day and Night Nursery. Do not refuse them. Permit yourself to be tagged because we need such a home in our community. Give the good Jewish women a dime, a quarter, fifty cents, or more. Put the money you want to give in a separate pocket so that you will be sure to contribute. You will be blessed by the children for whom the men and women workers of the Daughters of Zion Day and Night Nursery are so deeply concerned.</p>
   <p>May this tag day bring in a large sum of money for the building.</p>
