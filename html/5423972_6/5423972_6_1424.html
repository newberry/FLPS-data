   <p>This evening, a meeting will be held at Cafe Liberman, 211 West 12th Street, of all Presidents of all Synagogues in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The meeting is to be held for the purpose of discussing matters pertaining to raising of funds for the Michael Reese Hospital.</p>
   <p>The Orthodox Jews, can now get all they wish at the hospital, and it is only right that this group of Jews should show their appreciation by cooperating with the Directors of the Institution, and contribute most liberally to this worthy cause.</p>
   <p>There will also be a discussion at this meeting on the subject of organizing a separate Michael Reese Committee. All money taken in for the hospital should be turned over to the committee. Every Synagogue should make separate collections and send the money direct to the Directors of the Hospital.</p>
