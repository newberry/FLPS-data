   <p>The Jews of the Douglas Park neighborhood will have the pleasure of hearing the great Cantor, Bernard Waldowsky, and his choir who will perform the services this evening and tomorrow morning at the Sha'areh Torah Synagogue, Sawyer Ave. and 13th St. Because of Cantor Waldowsky's popularity, we expect the Jews of Chicago to turn out in masses to hear him. It is seldom that you have the opportunity of hearing the great Cantor and his choir and in addition you will perform a charitable deed, for the proceeds from these services will be given to the Denver Jewish Consumptive Sanitarium.</p>
