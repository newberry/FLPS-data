   <p>Our beautiful and spacious grounds, which cover six acres of land, fitted out with boys and girls playfields, outdoor gymnasium, a race track, tennis courts, baseball field, hand ball court, vegetable garden for children, kindergarten, pavilion for the weary, special swings for babies, fountains, goldfish pond, walks, etc. enables us to carry on our good work during the entire summer, at a time when similar institutions, not as fortunately situated as ours can do little or no work at all. During the past summer we had our kindergarten, sewing and raffia classes, gymnasium, horticulture, games, contests of various kinds, lectures on hygiene and sanitation, concerts, meetings, etc. all in the open air and under properly trained and careful supervision. The records show a total attendance on our grounds for the summer months, of 78,365 children, 37,391 girls and 40,974 boys, against 58,269 children, 26,919 girls and 31,350 boys, last year. The adult attendance was 5,985 in the girls section of the grounds. No accurate record was kept of the adults.</p>
