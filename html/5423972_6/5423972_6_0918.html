   <p>In 1846 the Jews of Chicago formed an organization called the "Jewish Burial Ground Society", of which Isaac Wormser was President. This society purchased from the city one acre of ground for a cemetery, for which it paid $46. This parcel of ground was located east of what was then the city limits, along the shores of Lake Michigan and now part of Lincoln Park. This Society existed but a short time as an independent organization. Later it merged into the first congregation, which was organized soon after.</p>
