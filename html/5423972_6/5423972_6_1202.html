   <p>But a small proportion, comparatively speaking, of our Jewish men and women of the West Side and the Northwest Side, who are active in the philanthropic and charitable work of their community know about "Resthaven". The Jewish masses know absolutely nothing about "Resthaven" save the few, who have been inmates of the institution.</p>
   <p>"Resthaven" is a home for convalescent patients--for persons that seek a full recuperation of strength after their illness, "Resthaven" was established by the "Sarah Greenebaum Lodge", an organization of South Side Jewish women, whose aim is to serve in a communal and in a charitable way, not only for their own immediate neighborhood but the entire community. For fully a decade "Resthaven" was located at 3360 South Park Avenue. Recently, however, Mrs. L. Klein, the widow of the founder of the L. Klein Department Store, offered the "Sarah Grennebaum Lodge" the privilege of acquiring her beautiful residence at 4461 Grand Boulevard.</p>
   <p>The opening of "Resthaven" at its new location, took place a week ago last Sunday, with the presence of a large representative group of men and women, philanthropically interested in the expansion of the noble work of the institution. "Resthaven" is now a home with modern equipment, one of the best of its kind, anywhere, that is supported by philanthropic enterprise.</p>
   <p>Jewish women and girls who have gone through surgical operations at the hospital, and require rest and attention, good food and medical assistance and advice, are allowed to remain in the home until their condition is fully improved, until the time when the mother is able to return to her housework, and the young woman to her work in the factory, store or office, or the school-child to its studies.</p>
   <p>Patients are admitted to the home on the recommendation of a physician and the admission committee, and are discharged only on the advice of the medical staff. After their discharge, they are visited by the women members of the Sarah Greenebaum Lodge.</p>
   <p>The superintendent of "Resthaven" is Mrs. Malvina Gordon, a practical nurse, who was for a time associated with the Marks Nathan Orphan Home and the B. M. Z. (Old People's Home) in this capacity. Mrs. Gordon is an exceptionally capable woman. She sees to it, that the institution is kept up in such a neat and clean fashion, that the waiting room, the parlor, the dining-room and the bedrooms, the kitchen and the pantry are all spick-and-span and have an atmosphere of friendliness about them. This is true also, of course, of all the bedsteads, mattresses and other equipments of the bedrooms. The white glow of a new snow on the untrodden by-ways of the country, is to be observed everywhere. The rooms are always in order; guests or no guests make not the slightest difference, in the administration of the institution.</p>
   <p>In the absence of the physician, Mrs. Gordon acts as medical adviser. She know the details of each case and the manner of assistance required.</p>
   
   <p>The patients have a sister and mother in her. She is by nature a good soul, and her experience in the two West Side institutions have fitted her fully for the task. She fully deserves the consideration shown her by the administrators of "Resthaven", all the compliments of the visitors and the good wishes of the patients.</p>
   <p>In this connection we must mention the name of the president, Mrs. Robert Frank, and also the names of Mrs. Lambert A. Wile, Mrs. A. Fellchenfeld, Mrs. M. Isaacs, Mrs. J. Weinstein, and Mrs. H. J. Wurzburg. Thanks to the efforts of these noble women, "Resthaven" is in existence, and is able to serve as a convalescent home for thirty and more patients regularly; thanks, too, to the efforts of these noble women, the annual budget of forty thousand dollars required for the support of the institution is raised.</p>
   <p>None of these noble women, we are quite certain, has ever applied to you, West Side and Northwest Side Jewish men and women, for assistance. But when they do, do not refuse it to them. Give them all you can with an open and cordial hand and sympathetic heart. You must remember that in "Resthaven" there are patients from all parts of the city, immigrants from Eastern Europe, where most of you come from, as well as others. It is your responsibility and duty to help support these. The burden must not fall upon the few, as it has fallen upon the few so far. You who have not been at the dedication of the new home, must remember, that you are not excused because of your absence. You are welcome to visit the institution at any time, but even if you cannot visit the institution in person, you can visit it, none the less, by a contribution. Do this, and you will help a most worthy cause.</p>
   <p>Will you do it?</p>
   <p>Will you meet your responsibility by action?</p>
