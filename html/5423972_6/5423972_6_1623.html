   <p>Today is the Jewish Orphan's Home Ball, at the Big Coliseum. This is the Orphan's Home ball to which all Jews of Chicago will come with their wives and children, to enjoy the evening and at the same time, help the Jewish Orphan's Home. The ball committee did everything possible to make this ball a success and assures the public that it will surpass all other balls held previously. Arrangements were made with the street car company to have special cars ready from 12 midnight to 3:00 a.m. to take the big crowds to home. These special street cars are mostly intended for Wabash Ave., 12th St. and Milwaukee Ave. When everything is ready the young folks will begin with a dance and as for the elderly folks, a splendid buffet has been arranged with all kinds of good eats and drinks and at the same time an opportunity to chat of events of the past in Chicago. Among the prominent guests who will be in the boxes are: Mrs. Marks Nathan, Mr &amp; Mrs. Baumgarden, N. Benzork, H. R. Mish, L. Bornash, B. Hurwitz, D. Steinberg, H. I. Hurwitz, Max Goodman, Samuel Polakow, I. Briskin, Jacob Levy, M. Stone, Charles I. Heron, and many more. Mr. &amp; Mrs. L. Bornash will lead the grand march. Mr. Charles I. Heron is chairman of the entertainment committee and assures us that the Ball will be a big success.</p>
