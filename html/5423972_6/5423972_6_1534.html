   <p>Every Jew in Chicago knows of the excellent and noble work that the Douglas Park Day And Night Nursery is doing for unfortunate children, many of whom do not have a father or a mother. The institution accepts children of from one to seven years of age. There are about seventy-five children there now, and they all have a good home; they receive food, clothing and an education. All this is done lovingly and tenderly for those unfortunate children. Many new applications are received from children who have as much right to be admitted as those who are in the Home. Even with the best intentions of the management, however, it has been found impossible to admit additional children, because there is no room for them. The board of directors, with the help of noble men and women, has decided to build a bigger, more beautiful, and more convenient building for the institution.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The plan was enthusiastically accepted by all the members, and it was decided to open a drive for fifty thousand dollars for a new building. The drive was opened with a magnificent banquet, at which many people were present, and a great sum of money was collected right then and there. Everyone present at the banquet pledged himself to help bring the drive to a successful conclusion.</p>
   <p>The drive will last for thirty days. Committees will visit meetings of Chicago organizations and will explain in detail the needs of the institution.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, appeal to you, Jews of Chicago, to welcome the committees, listen to their appeal, and help them to make the drive a success. Do not forget that the orphans are yours as well as ours, and that you have no right to refuse to give them a home. They have been sufficiently punished by having been robbed by cruel fate of their most precious possession, the tenderness of a father or a beloved mother. It is the duty of all of us to create for them a home with all of its comforts. This can be done only if all the jewish organizations in general, and the Jews of Chicago in particular, will help the Douglas Park Day And Night Nursery to bring the drive to a successful conclusion.</p>
