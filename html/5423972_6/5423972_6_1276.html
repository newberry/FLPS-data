   <p>In the last week of the month, the fourteenth annual convention of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society of Denver will be held at the Sherman Hotel in Chicago. This is the first time that the directors of the national Jewish institution are coming with their convention to Chicago. Jewish businessmen of Chicago, who undertook the task of organizing the convention, deserve the warm gratitude of all who sympathize with the suffering of the victims of tuberculosis and are endeavoring to lighten their unfortunate existence.</p>
   <p>Everybody knows that there is in Denver a sanitarium of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society which accepts sick Jews from throughout America, particularly workers afflicted with the terrible disease. But the public knows it only as if through a dream. With the exception of a small number of Jews who make trifling contributions, there isn't a Jew in Chicago fully acquainted with the real importance of the big institution, and this is truly regrettable. The <span class="page-break">\2</span>great combat conducted by the medical world against this disease deserves the attention of the public to take a greater interest in the welfare of an institution to which the lives of so many unfortunate brothers and sisters are entrusted.</p>
   <p>The convention will bring the institution nearer to the attention of Chicago's Jewish public, and will also bring closer the public's sympathy toward the institution.</p>
