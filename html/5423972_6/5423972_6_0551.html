   <p>At the meeting of the Board, in the report of the Executive Director, Mr. Goldsmith stated that the collection chart submitted to each director showed the variation from month to month each year of the collections from contributors. January is the peak month in each year and July second largest. The peaks have since 1929 been going down steadily. Collections now are at the rate of about 7/12 of what they were 3 years ago.</p>
   <p>The relief chart on the other hand showed a steady upward trend in the number of cases and amount of relief. The peak late in 1931, was reached when all the agencies were still paying rent for the families they were helping and when the number of families was at the maximum, just before a large group were transferred to the Unenployment Relief Service of the Cook County Bureau of Public Welfare.</p>
   <p>The chart also shows how relief is being paid for. Until the end of 1930, this was paid for entirely by our own subscriptions. At that time we <span class="page-break">\2</span>received the first subsidy from the Governor's commission which continued until September 30, 1931. In the fall of 1931 and during January 1932 funds were supplied by the Joint Emergency Relief Fund and since that date by State and Federal funds which had taken over most of the relief burden.</p>
