   <p>Herman Felsenthal, president of the Jewish Education Society, which was formed in Chicago about a year ago and of which nothing was heard for a long time, intended to call a meeting of the members in the course of the winter. A meeting of the members of the board of directors had been called some time ago, but for want of a quorum no business could be translated.</p>
   <p>Altogether $700 has been collected: $264.50 was paid to the Hebrew school which was maintained for only a few weeks by our brethren, the Russian-Polish Israelites of Chicago, and for stationery and printing; $400 was invested in 41/2% U. S. Bonds and registered in the name of the Society.</p>
