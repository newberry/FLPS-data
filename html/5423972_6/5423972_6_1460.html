   <p>The erection of a hospital in this city is now seriously discussed by the heirs of the Reese estate. There are two legacies, one of $50,000, and the other of $200,000, set apart by the will of Michael Reese for various charities. From both of these legacies the Chicago charities are to have their shares. It is estimated that about $75,000 will be the portion alloted to the erection and maintenance of a Jewish hospital in this city. The Reese heirs and the "hospital committee" of the United Hebrew Relief Association, are busily at work deliberating and arguing on the subject. The U. H. R. A. owns a lot on N. La Salle St. for the erection of a hospital. It is proposed by some, that this lot should be sold, and another one be purchased outside of the city limits, where a larger ground can be had for laying out a garden and promenade for the invalids.</p>
