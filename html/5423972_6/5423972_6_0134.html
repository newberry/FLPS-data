   <p>The fire which destroyed our main building, occurred at a time when the work of the institute had grown to a point where all our facilities were taxed to capacity.</p>
   <p>Luckily, only the main building was destroyed. The large annex remained untouched and after the excitement was over, we returned to normalcy but with only about 60 per cent of our previous activity being carried on.</p>
   <p>The educational department is again functioning actively. The classes in English, Hebrew, home-making, the Sabbath school, and kindergarten are again in operation with a smaller teaching staff. The gymnasium is functioning without any curtailment, and the trade schools will be reopened as soon as the new place set aside for it in the annex will be completed.</p>
   <p>The clubs and social activities are functioning outside of the institute, using facilities other organizations were kind enough to furnish us.</p>
