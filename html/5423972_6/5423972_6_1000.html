   <p>In response to a call from the pulpit of the Zion Congregation, about twenty-five ladies met at the house of Rabbi Joseph Stolz and perfected the organization of a Personal Service Society, to supplement the work of the United Hebrew Charities. Mrs. Bertha Powel was chosen president, and Miss Jennie Friend, secretary. Very much enthusiasm for the work was manifested, and several cases are already in the hands of the committees. A meeting has been called to be held in the vestry rooms of the Zion Congregation, May 15, at 3:30 P.M., and ladies from all parts of the city interested in this, the noblest kind of charitable work, are invited to be present.</p>
