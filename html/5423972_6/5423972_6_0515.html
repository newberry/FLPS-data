   <p>It is a pleasure to inform you that through the efforts of Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, member of the Board of Education, the new school now being built on Douglas Blvd. and Lawndale Ave., will carry the name of our never forgotten Zionist leader, Dr. Theodore Herzl. We therefore shall express our thanks to the Board of Education - for the honor they have bestowed upon the Jewish community.</p>
