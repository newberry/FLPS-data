   <p>The Jewish Training School which was called in life during the spring of last year, is now assuming a tangible form and will shortly be a fait accompli. The committee heretofore appointed to look up a suitable site, has secured a plat of ground in the very midst where the projectors of the association designed to do the most good, to wit: Fifty five feet frong by one hundred and ten feet deep, and another lot adjoining same of 27 X 110 feet on the corner of Judd and Clinton Streets, for which they paid about $22,000, and at a meeting held last Wednesday evening, they resolved to obtain plans from architects so as to facilitate the earliest erection of this much needed philanthropical institution.</p>
