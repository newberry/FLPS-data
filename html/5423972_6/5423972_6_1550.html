   <p>The first annual Jubilee Banquet of the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery, which was held Saturday evening in the large hall of the West Side Auditorium, was a moral and financial success.</p>
   <p>Over 300 members, friends and sympathizers and representatives from unions and Workmen Circle branches were assembled. Mrs. L. Bernstein, President, declared that the purpose of the Jubilee was to stress the importance of the institutions, for fatherless or motherless children who are being cared for and for the fifty applicants who were refused because of lack of room.</p>
   <p>She announced to the audience, the happy facts that the Nursery is in the process of purchasing a larger building in a good neighborhood; the new building would enable them to care for a larger number of children.</p>
