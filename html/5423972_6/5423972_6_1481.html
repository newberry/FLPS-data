   <p>The United Hebrew Trades listened to a report at its last meeting which told how the Carpenters Union, Local 504, and the Painters Union, Local 521, had helped remodel the home of the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery.</p>
   <p>The Carpenters Union, Local 504, responded to an appeal made by a committee of the Nursery. The Local determined to engage carpenters to make all the necessary alterations in the building on Fifteenth Street and Albany Avenue. The Carpenters Union appointed Hyman Zalanick, business agent of the Union, to take charge of the work, and the Union contributed $1,000 from its treasury for carpentry work in the Nursery.</p>
   <p>The Painters Union, Local 521, did the same. A committee of the Union, Messrs. Ehrlich and Green helped to obtain all the necessary materials from owners of paint stores, and a group of members has done the painting in the building without any remuneration.</p>

   <p>The United Hebrew Trades has unanimously resolved to extend its gratitude to both unions for the good and noble work they have done for that institution.</p>
