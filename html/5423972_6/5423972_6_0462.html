   <p>A ten-year-old Jewish boy of Chicago has become a serious rival of little Sammy Rzerzewski [Reshevsky] for the title of child chess genius. The little Chicago chess genius is Ralph Molitnikoff of 1902 South Leavitt Street, who won the inter-settlement championship at a match game at Hull House. The little boy won against thirty players.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edward Lasker, the chess champion of Chicago, was the referee. He praised the child's remarkable playing very highly.</p>
