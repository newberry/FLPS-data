   <p>A meeting of 200 women was held yesterday afternoon, at the Temple Judea, for the purpose of founding a home for little orphans under six years of age.</p>
   <p>After visiting many homes and discovering the pitiful condition of young children left fatherless by the influenza epidemic, with no one to care for them while their mothers were at work, it was deemed imperative that some shelter be provided for these orphans.</p>
   <p>The object is to receive such orphans, as the Marks Nathan Home will not admit because they are under six years of age. The women who have undertaken this noble work, deserve the sympathy and assistance of every right thinking person.</p>
   <p>The Committee that is organizing the Society for the founding of the home are Mrs. S. Hayder, Mrs D. Maiman, Mrs. Notowitz, Mrs. Berry, Mrs.Malcum, Mrs. Eude, Mrs. Yudelovitz, Mrs. Schifman, Mrs. Glikman, Mrs. Pritikin, Treasurer, Miss Minnie Guyel, Mrs. H. Kohn, Miss and Mrs. Gulab. All women wishing to join as members, or desiring information, may inquire of Mrs. Ryder, 1429 S. Millard St., Mrs. M. Berry, 1106 S. Ashland Blvd. and Mrs. Maiman, 1428 Clifton Park Ave.</p>
