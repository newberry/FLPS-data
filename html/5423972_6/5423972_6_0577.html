   <p>Meyer Broun, president of the Jewish National Workers Alliance, a workers' order with more than seven thousand members, left Chicago for Detroit, after spending several days here in the interests of the Alliance. He had been organizing the campaign for new recruits, which will soon begin in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Broun declared that this workers' order is constantly growing because the nationalistically inclined workers realize the importance of this order, which devotes itself to national problems. The Alliance now contemplates the erection of a workers' sanitarium in Palestine and will support every enterprise in the interests of Palestine. The order also participates in other nationalistic activities.</p>
