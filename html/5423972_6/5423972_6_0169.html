   <p>It is with the greatest pleasure that I take this opportunity of informing the public concerning the progress the children in the Sabbath school of the First Rumanian Congregation are making. In one class, I am happy to report, the children finished the Five Books of Moses last year and are now studying history and other Jewish studies. They read and write Hebrew, and have already acquired a great deal of knowledge about the language. The names of the children are: Anna Kaplan, Rebecca Lipner, Fannie Raisler, Tillie Levine, Sophie Glassman, Sarah Kaplan, Rosa Markus, and Jennie Lipner. These children have made excellent progress in the last twelve months. Their examinations were perfect. Their parents may be proud of them, for they certainly will make fine daughters of Israel. Now here is another class of children who made good. Their work was also excellent. Their names are: Celia Anixter, Annie Becker, Clara Magilner, Victoria Price, Helen Rosenberg, Sadie Rose, Sarah Rosenberg, Frances Johnson, Sarah Hurwitz, and Fannie Kaplan.</p>
   <p>The Sabbath school of the First Rumanian Congregation is one of the most important Jewish institutions in Chicago, and it is worthwhile for every Jew in Chicago to become interested in the cause and to assist us in making our Sabbath school a permanent institution.</p>
