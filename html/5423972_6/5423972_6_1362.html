   <p>When the plans for the new Sarah Morris Hospital for children are completed this Winter, they are expected to represent the most modern ideas in hospital construction and arrangement. Preliminary work will not be commenced until the return from Europe of Dr. I. A. Abt who is now abroad studying the newest developments in hospital designing.</p>
   <p>The construction of the hospital was made possible by a gift of $300,000 from the executors of Mrs. Nelson Morris to Edward G. Foreman, president of Michael Reese Hospital.</p>
   <p>Land for the new institution has been purchased at 29th St. and Groveland Ave. All those interested in the new building are sparing neither time nor money to secure the latest equipment so that the children treated there will have the benefit of every appliance and artifice known to medical science. The hospital will be occupied within a year.</p>
