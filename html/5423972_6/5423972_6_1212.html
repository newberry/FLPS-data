   <p>The Douglas Park day and night nursery must exist, and be controlled by the workers, and the small children there must be protected. That was the conclusion of the United Hebrew Trades at a meeting yesterday morning at the Workmen's Circle Lyceum. A committee of the nursery appeared at a meeting of the United Hebrew Trades, declaring the poor condition that the nursery finds itself in, and that it is necessary to open a membership drive for 5,000 members, who will be able to pay $3,000 a year to keep the nursery from falling into the hands of the Federated Charities.</p>
   <p>All of the delegates of the United Hebrew Trades realized how important it is for the nursery of the Douglas Park vicinity, where over 60 lonely, helpless, children are given motherly care, to be assisted by the workers' organizations. After discussing a method of helping the nursery, it was decided that committees should be sent out with credentials to visit all the unions and ask for immediate relief. A committee of 5 delegates was appointed to get in contact with the board of directors of the nursery, and call a conference of representatives of the Workmen's Circle central committee.</p>

   <p>The joint boards of the Amalgamated, the Cloakmakers, and the Central Relief Committee of the S.P. will together work out plans to interest all workers of this institution, to help enlarge the organization which is to keep up the day and night nursery.</p>
