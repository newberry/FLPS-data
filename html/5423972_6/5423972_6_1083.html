   <p>Atlantic City. The convention of the Brith Avraham (Brotherhood of Abraham) closed after the adoption of the following resolutions:</p>
   <p>Members of the Order admitted in an incorporated institution or Home may bequeath half their endowment for that specific institution, but no one is permitted to bequeath or leave his endowment to his lodge.</p>
   <p>Members of the Order for less than a year, committing suicide, lose their privileges of endowment.</p>
