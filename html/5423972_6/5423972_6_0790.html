   <p>The quarterly financial report of the United Orthodox Jewish Charity Institutions:</p>
   <p>In the course of our career as newspaper men we already have had enough reports from all sorts of Jewish charity institutions; each report was made with good intentions, they sought to present an accounting which contained complete information. None of the institutions wanted to deceive the public, yet we must admit that the distinguished directors, before submitting their reports, complicated matters so that we had to be experts to know the true conditions of the institutions.</p>
   <p>It will certainly be interesting to the Jewish populace to know that it cost merely $652.43 to collect the sum of $30,300.35, which means that only a little more than two percent constituted the expense of collecting the money. Taking into consideration that prior to the Federation's establishment the expenses of collection were from 25 to 60 percent we can easily picture the accomplishment of the Federation.</p>
   <p>Let us reprint the report as it is:</p>

   <p>In analyzing this quarterly report, we find that the establishment of the Federation, which was the most difficult and costliest work ever undertaken by Chicago Jewry, cost the Chicago charity contributors only $1,483.07. When we consider that by April 1, the Federation raised $96,448.60, we find it merely cost 11/2 percent to raise this sum of money from 4,435 subscribers.</p>
   <p>Two main things can be observed from this report, which shows that Chicago Jewry has made a great step forward in the field of charity. Waste and irresponsibility <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>was abolished. It established order and responsibility.</p>
   <p>It is expected that the Federation will have, by the end of the year, a subscription list of approximately two hundred thousand dollars from which $150,000 will be collected. The quarterly financial report tells us that it is an honor to be a member of the Chicago Jewish community.</p>
