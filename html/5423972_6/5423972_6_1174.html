   <p>Now that the two and a half million dollar drive is nearly over and will be soon brought to a successful end; the Jews on the West Side may rest assured that a greater Mt. Sinai Hospital, with all the facilities and conveniences of a first-class institution to serve both the purpose of the Jewish patients and the medical science, will soon be a reality. The campaign committee has assured the leader of the Mt. Sinai Hospital that everything possible will be done to turn the present institution into a one hundred and fifty bed hospital no matter what the cost, even if it should cost seven or eight hundred thousand dollars, not five hundred thousand. The one hundred and fifty beds in the Mt. Sinai Hospital will be a fact as soon as the building can be erected. The cost of maintenance of a larger Mt. Sinai Hospital will be secured from the United Charities. At present the cost of maintenance amounts to some forty thousand dollars a year. In the future, when a greater Mt. Sinai will be a hard reality, the cost will be double that sum, if not more, and the United Charities will <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>support this institution as they support the other Orthodox institutions on the West Side, with the exception of the Jewish Day and Night Nursery and Infant Home on the Northwest Side.</p>
   <p>The development of the Mt. Sinai Hospital from small beginnings to its present developments and prospects constitutes a real epoch in Chicago Jewish Philanthropic life. The American Hospital Association has declared the Mt. Sinai Hospital an A-1 institution and so have the men of authority in this country declared the Mt. Sinai Hospital a first class institution. The Mt. Sinai has rendered and is rendering every day yoeman services to the Jewish community, and those who fought for it and have given their time and energy for the Jewish Hospital on the West Side deserve the gratitude of the community, for it was not a small matter to establish the present Mt. Sinai on the debris of the defunct Maimonides Hospital. Nor was it a small matter to convince the Jewish leaders on the South Side of the necessity of a real Kosher Hospital on the West Side. The rapid development of the institution is the more wonderful since only a handful of people have carried its burdens and have looked out <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>after its welfare. Without the indefatigable work of Mr. Morris Kurzton, the president of the institution; Mrs. Edwin Romberg, the live-wire in all the enterprises of the institution; Mr. Irving Klein, Mr. Klinger, Mr. Sam Platt, Rabbi Saul Silber, Mr. Harry Blum, and a few others, the Mt. Sinai Hospital would never have reached this stage of development. Mr. Edward Katzinger's generous contribution of fifty thousand dollars toward the building fund of the institution has greatly contributed to place it on the map and to draw the attention of the community to it. Originally Mr. Katzinger's contribution was made in the form of a legacy, and if we understand the proposition right, it is a legacy just now, too. Since the Mt. Sinai Hospital is a party to the present drive and all donations and contributions for the three institutions to be benefited by the drive go into one basket, the drive committee has deemed it fit to accept Mr. Katzinger's fifty thousand dollars with the assurance that the agreement made between the Mt. Sinai Hospital and Mr. Katzinger, concerning the nature of the contribution, will be lived up to. While the Mt. Sinai Hospital will profit by Mr. Katzinger's generous contribution as stipulated before, the drive is also profited by it to a very great <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>extent, inasmuch as it has stimulated others to give more than they had intended to originally and we know it to be a fact that Mr. Katzinger's fifty thousand dollars has caused others to give two hundred and fifty thousand dollars more, and from this, of course, the Mt. Sinai will benefit in turn, because the more money at the disposal of the drive committee, the more it can spend on the enlargement of the Mt. Sinai Hospital.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen responsible for the development of the Mt. Sinai Hospital and its prospective enlargement should bear in mind that even a one hundred and fifty bed hospital is not the limit to which they will have to come one day, for the institution serves the needs of nearly a quarter of a million, and while enlarging the hospital they should bear in mind that the present work is only a beginning, for one day it will have to be a three and four hundred bed hospital. If the Mt. Sinai Hospital were to have today three hundred beds not one would remain unoccupied for a single day. In hope that Mr. Kurtzon, Mrs. Romberg, and Mr. Katzinger will bear this in mind and that they will lay out plans for a larger Mt. Sinai Hospital in such a manner that there will <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>always be room and possibilites for additions. The leaders of the Mt. Sinai Hospital can congratulate themselves upon the great work that they have done in the past two years, and having the good will of the community and the support of the United Charities, they can be assured that every appeal made by them in behalf of the hospital will be responded to nobly and generously.</p>
