   <p>The Northwest Side Talmud Torah is holding a meeting, this afternoon, in its hall, 15-17 Marion Place, for the purpose of electing the eighteen new directors for this year. It is but right that the Northwest Side Chicago Jews should take more active interest in a most needed institution such as the Talmud Torah of the Northwest Side. The funds of this institution are getting low and its continued existence is rather doubtful unless you Jews of the Northwest Side, get actively interested in the worthy cause and begin to come forward with liberal contributions, that we can maintain the upkeep of the institution without interruption.</p>
   <p>We therefore make this appeal to you: By all means come to this important meeting; help us elect the right kind of people as directors for this needed Talmud Torah; help us make a success of this holy institution.</p>
