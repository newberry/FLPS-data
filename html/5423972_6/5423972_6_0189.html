   <p>The workrooms of the Associated Jewish Women's Organizations will be opened on Monday, Feb. 17th, at Kopperl Hall, Canal street and 13th place. Unskilled women will be taught to darn and mend. The services of a competent woman has been secured as a superintendent and the workrooms will be open daily, except Saturday and Sunday. The wages of the working women will not exceed fifty cents per day. The intention is to give work to those who are now receiving alms, and thereby make them, in a measure, self supporting.</p>
   <p>The cooperation of all those interested in this philanthropic work is earnestly desired. Every member of the workroom and house committee has agreed to devote one-half day every other week visiting the workrooms.</p>
   <p>The chairman of these committees is to be in frequent communication with the superintendent, with a view toward bettering the conditions of the women seeking employment.</p>
