   <p>Congregation Ahavas Achim Anshe Ungaren of Grand Avenue has a Talmud Torah which will teach our Jewish youth from Aleph Bayz (the A B C) to Talmud, as well as reading and writing Yiddish. An excellent teacher has been selected. The school is located at 1903 Grand Avenue.</p>
   <p>We appeal to our Jewish brethren to assist us in this holy undertaking by making liberal donations. Those who have children of school age will please apply at the office of the president, Mr. Jechiel Michael Glass, 1957 Grand Avenue [for admission cards]. Two of our most prominent members, Mr. Jacob Markovitz and Mr. Israel Brautovitz, have volunteered to accept the job of collecting donations.</p>
   <p>A special meeting of the Talmud Torah is scheduled for next Sunday.</p>
   <p>Gedalyah Cohen, president.</p>
