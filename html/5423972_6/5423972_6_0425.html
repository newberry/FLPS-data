   <p>"The Wandering Jew" has become a favorite subject, not only with poets, novelists, and painters, but also with Jewish ministers. For the latter it is, indeed, a very grateful subject.</p>
   <p>To our knowledge, three Jewish lectures on "The Wandering Jew" have been published by our ministers; one by Rev. Dr. Felsenthal in 1872; another one by Rev. Dr. Wise in 1877; a third one recently by Dr. Kohler.</p>
   <p>On comparing these productions on one and the same theme, we find that they are one and the same in name only. The modes of treatment are entirely unlike each other.</p>
