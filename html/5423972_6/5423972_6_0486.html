   <p>A gymnasium building needed for the Institute.</p>
   <p>The temporary provision made for the gymnasium has already been outgrown. One season was sufficient to demonstrate the need of a separate gymnasium building with a large exercising floor, swimming pool, running track and most modern equipment. The Jewish people are now awakening to the advantage of physical culture and the facilities offered by the Y. M. C. A. and Settlement Gymnasium do not meet the needs of the Jewish community.</p>
   <p>Provision on a large scale must be made, and opportunity offered for a race to accomplish its physical rejuvenation. The Jew has left behind him the lands of oppression and in the free country he desires to improve his physical equipment to meet adequately the demands of the strenuous life for which his mentality has already received much training in the past, but, at the sacrifice of his physical self. A sound mind must be accompanied by a sound body.</p>
