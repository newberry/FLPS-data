   <p>The conduct of the Trustees of the Baron de Hirsch Fund, in regard to our Training School, is, to use a mild expression, most perplexing. In a weak hour, the directors of the School ventured to lay the financial situation before them, believing that the nature of the work and the increased necessities arising from the constant addition to the population of Chicago from Russia, entitled them to some slight consideration on the part of the fund.</p>
   <p>Although no one here in Chicago paid attention to our supposed interview and protest in regard to Russian immigration, the trustees of the Baron de Hirsch Fund in New York gave it credence there.</p>
   <p>When the directors of the Training School learned what the New York gentlemen thought of the occurrence, they took at once the trouble to correct the wrong impression and to disavow any sympathy with the Alleged views of the gentlemen. Now comes the reply that the damage done by the interview is too great <span class="page-break">2</span>to be repaired by a late denial.</p>
   <p>Therefore the school is entitled to no consideration. This is logic with a vengeance. What has our school to do with any other charity in Chicago? Our applicants increase daily. Our evening school, which we would not need, were it not for the steady influx of these strangers, deprives the main school of a large support, which otherwise it would enjoy from the lodges who now pay for the evening classes, in part, while the directors bear the additional expense of fuel, gas, and incidentals.</p>
