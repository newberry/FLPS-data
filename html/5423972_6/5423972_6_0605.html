   <p>The Queen Esther Aid Society will celebrate their fifth yearly installation with joy. Two years ago, twenty-two women organized this society on the Northwest Side for the purpose of helping their own members, and to the joy of the organizer, this organization grew to two-hundred and fifty members; now this society also helped the new infant home with $53.00. Sisters Fox and Ventzer paid $11.00 for the honor of delivering the $53.00 to the infant home, that the B'nai Zion is building on the corner of Hirsch and California, making it a total of $64.00 for the new home. This society is sending $25.00 to the Chicago Consumptive Aid Society. Sisters Chulak, Miller and Gordon are also donating $11.00 for the honor of delivering the money to the Chicago Consumptives, making it a total of $36.00</p>
   <p>After the installation, refreshments were served and everyone enjoyed them and went home satisfied.</p>
   <p>The doors of the Queen Esther are always open for those who wish to join.</p>
