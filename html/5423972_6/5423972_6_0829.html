   <p>Several months ago a committee was appointed for the purpose of federating the orthodox Jewish charity institutions on the West Side. The committee consisted of B. Horwich, chairman, S. Phillipson, Israel Cowen, B. Baum, and Dr. Yudelson. Offices were opened at 720 W. 12th St.</p>
   <p>The organization now has a list of 650 subscribers with a total subscription fund of $45,000. At a meeting held on June 9, the committee reported on its work and future plans. The Federation of ten orthodox charity societies on the West and Northwest Sides was perfected and by January 1, it expects to have sufficient funds to support all of the various charities.</p>
