   <p>Over 10,000 Jews yesterday afternoon participated in two great celebrations in the Lawndale District, where over $12,500 was raised, when a foundation for a new Jewish center and Talmud Torah was laid, and the opening of a new Jewish center and Talmud Torah for the new generation was celebrated. At both festivities colorful programs were carried through that proved the strength of the Jewish spirit in this new neighborhood.</p>
   <p>On the corner of Homan avenue and Douglas boulevard a cornerstone was laid for the new Anshei Sholom Talmud Torah and community center, in the presence of a large crowd. Speeches were mady by Rabbi Silver, S. Philipson, Judge Fisher. The Jewish judge of the Boys Court emphasized the great necessity of such a Hebrew school for children and social center for the young generation in the Lawndale District. He also related some of his experiences in the Boys Court, regarding the pool rooms in the Lawndale District, and appealed to the Jewish people in the district to see that this community center shall be kept up in order to attract the young generation, and keep them from visiting the pool rooms.</p>
   <p>"In my court, I have often noticed that Jewish fathers and mothers have no control over their children, who go on corrupt paths. We must bring the parents and their children together again, and this center must start the task," he said.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Charles Heron, president of the Jewish Orphan Home, auctioned off the honor of laying the cornerstone to Mr. and Mrs. Sam Cohen for $400.</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher, in a new scheme, auctioned off the honor of placing business and private cards in a box under the cornerstone, which brought in over $700. Together with some of the pledges the amount raised was $7,500.</p>
   <p>Under the cornerstone a manuscript was placed with the history of the synagogue and a copy of yesterday's Jewish Courier.</p>
   <p>The main speakers were Judge Philip Bregstone and Rabbi Samuel Schach, under the chairmanship of Emil Braude.</p>
