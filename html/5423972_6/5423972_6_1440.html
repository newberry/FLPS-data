   <p>The annual reception at the Michael Reese Hospital was held yesterday afternoon. The doors of the home for trained nurses were opened to the public for the first time. The home for nurses is a three-story brick structure standing just to the north of the hospital. A maternity ward occupies the west part. This ward is exclusively for the use of charity patients, and is fitted to accommodate twenty people.</p>
