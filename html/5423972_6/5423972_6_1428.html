   <p>Plans for the construction of the new hospital have been progressing rapidly. Richard E. Schmidt is the architect chosen and specifications are now in the hands of the building committee. Mr. Schmidt is a brother of Dr. Otto Schmidt whose advice on the construction of a new and modern hospital is invaluable. From present indications work will be begun in the early spring and the building committee hope to have the hospital completed by next fall.</p>
