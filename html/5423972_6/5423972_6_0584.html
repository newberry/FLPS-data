   <p>At a joint meeting of the Executive Committee of the United Drive and the Board of Directors of the Michael Reese Hospital, Mr. Jacob M. Loeb called upon Judge Harry M. Fisher to present the viewpoint of the United Drive.</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher stated that Felix M. Warburg of the Joint Distribution Committee, N. Y. C., had hastily returned from Europe a short time ago because in Europe he came in contact with the terrible situation of the Jews abroad, and following his return, the J. D. C. has announced that the Jews of America will again be asked to raise a large fund, approximately $15,000,000 for the relief of the sufferers abroad. Judge Fisher concluded by stating that this means that Chicago must try to raise approximately $3,000,000 to cover local and foreign needs.</p>
