   <p>We, the officers and members of the Berezovker Untershtitsung Verein, wish to thank our brother, Dr. Morris L. Hirshman, 3504 West 16th Street, for his efforts, his special devotion, and his skill in curing our brother, Morris Frank, 1911 Washburne Avenue. Brother Frank had been suffering for nine months with a foot ailment. No doctor or medicine was able to help him until Dr. Hirshman took his case, and in five weeks time, Brother Frank was able to surprise the Verein, by attending a meeting and proving to all of us that he was entirely well.</p>
   <p>May the Almighty bless Dr. Hirshman's hands and grant him twice as many years [to live]. This is the prayer for him of the Berezovker Untershtitsung Verein.</p>
   <p>M. Shmit, president</p>
   <p>S. Belgrod, vice-president,</p>
   <p>R. Golmar, secretary.</p>
