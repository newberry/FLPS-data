   <p>The Association of Rabbis cannot and must not remain indifferent to the grave accusations which have been made against the Mount Sinai Hospital. If the various terrible accusations that have been made against this hospital are based upon the truth--up to now those accusations have not been denied--then this hospital is absolutely nonkosher. Is it not the moral duty of the Association of Rabbis to call in the leaders of the hospital and ask them what is going on there?</p>
