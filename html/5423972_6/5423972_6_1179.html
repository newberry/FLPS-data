   <p>This club was organized in memory of Miss Dorothy Kahn, a popular South Shore girl who was an invalid for two years prior to her death. It was Miss Kahn's hope, that in the event of her recovery, she would help crippled children. Following her death, a group of her girl friends, under the leadership of Miss Stella Levinkind, formed an organization to carry on the work.</p>
