   <p>A home for Jewish orphans is being built in Chicago. The home will occupy an entire block on Hirsch Boulevard between Fairfield and California Avenues. The home, when it is completed, will consist of two floors and a basement, and will accommodate four hundred children, ranging from infancy to six years of age. The home will also have a separate division [Translator's note: About three lines here have been cut out.].....Dubin and Eisenberg are the architects for the home. It will cost three hundred thousand dollars. When it is completed, the home will be an ornament to the Jews of Chicago and a source of pride to the Jews of America.</p>
   <p>It was not easy for a small group of women on the Northwest Side to found the first Jewish day nursery in Chicago, to pay up all the mortgages on their present nursery at 1441 Wicker Park Avenue, to raise money with which to begin <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to build the first infant home in the Western states.</p>
   <p>About three or four years ago, during the flu epidemic, Mrs. Rieger was called to a house where a young woman had died in giving birth to a baby whose father was confined in a tubercular sanitarium. The baby lay amid dirt and filth and its body began to rot. A doctor said that the baby was too weak to be saved, but Mrs. Rieger took the baby to the nursery, called in the house physician, L. H. Block, and now little Sammy is a healthy, beautiful baby, who is a source of joy at the Daughters of Zion Nursery.</p>
   <p>A few days later, Mrs. Rieger went to visit an orphan in a Catholic educational institution. It hurt her, as a Jewish mother, to see Jewish children make the sign of the cross. She politely asked the supervisor why Jewish children were taught such a ceremony. The supervisor answered: "If to make the sign of the cross is against the Jewish religion, let the Jews build their own institution."</p>
   <p>This reply caused the board of directors of the Daughters of Zion Day Nursery to found a few auxiliaries located in various parts of the city, and to elect a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>building committee of twenty-five men and women to build a home for helpless Jewish babies.</p>
   <p>An application for a state charter was sent to Springfield. Certain people opposed the granting of a charter by the state to the Daughters of Zion. These people claimed that the drives for funds which would be made in behalf of the nursery and infant home, would decrease the amount of money available to maintain other institutions. Dr. Charles Werden, a state official, was sent to investigate the claims of both sides, and a charter was granted upon his recommendation.</p>
   <p>The building committee began to function. Many members were of the opinion that a small building, which could take care of one hundred babies, should be erected immediately, that in a few years, a larger building could be built. Other members claimed that it was impractical to have a drive each year for a new building and that there were many Jews in Chicago who would be willing to help build an institution of which the city could be proud. The opinion of the latter <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>[group] prevailed and it was decided to erect a building which would accommodate four hundred babies.</p>
   <p>Letters asking that plans [be submitted], were sent to many well-known architects. These plans were examined by state and city building experts, aided by a committee from the Architects' Association. The building committee decided to accept the plans of Dubin and Eisenberg, 14 West Washington Street.</p>
   <p>A drive for funds began under the chairmanship of Meyer Teitelbaum, a member of the building committee. The drive brought in thirty thousand dollars. A tag day brought in eleven thousand dollars. With this forty-one thousand dollars, they began to build an infant home which will cost three hundred thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The committee had to decide whether a general contractor should be given the work of erecting the building. The question whether to build with or without the aid of building contractors was discussed for six months until it was decided that as there wasn't sufficient money in the bank to guarantee the general contractor <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, an executive board of seven should be appointed which would have full power to appoint subcontractors and to buy material. Meyer Teitelbaum, Louis Shapiro, I. Konigsberg, A. Epstein, S. Weinberg, Mrs. Rieger, and Mrs. I. Siegel, chairman of the board of directors, were appointed members of the executive board.</p>
   <p>During the first part of June, the supervising contractors, Harry Kaplan and A. Woldman, put carpenters and bricklayers to work erecting the building. The first two floors are now finished. If the Chicago Jews would wake up and donate money, or buy gold-brick certificates, then we would be able to celebrate, in the near future, the opening of the biggest and most beautiful Jewish institution in Chicago.</p>
