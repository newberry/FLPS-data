   <p>Benjamin J. Rosenthal, State street merchant and philanthropist, has announced the establishment of the Benjamin J. Rosenthal Charities Inc. Thus he has put into effect his intention to donate to charities all his profits in business over and above a reasonable salary for living expenses.</p>
   <p>The money will be used for two purposes, to provide a fund to keep up contributions to charitable organizations of all kinds, and to realize, to some degree, ideal conditions for the small home-owner, dreamed of by Mr. Rosenthal while a member of the Chicago Housing Commission.</p>
