   <p>The firm resolution to hold lectures Sunday morning was enthusiastically carried by the Zion congregation at their general meeting last Sunday. In August 1884, when Zion congregation first recognized the necessity of this important measure, the Occident urged the matter in its editorial columns. The first year lectures were delivered alternate Sunday only, and in September 1885, when the new Temple was completed, some of the members thought lectures on Friday night would be a good thing, and in order to be able to judge fairly which would be the most practicable Friday night or Sunday morning services, lectures were delivered alternately on those days by Dr. B. Felsenthal and Rev. Max Heller for six months.</p>
   
   <p>Experience has taught that Sunday is the right and proper time to hold service, for on Friday night most people are tired from a week's labor, but on Sunday morning everybody is rested and in the right spirit to listen attentively to a discourse.</p>
