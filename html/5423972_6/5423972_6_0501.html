   <p>Five thousand Chicago Jews will have the opportunity of contributing to a splendid enterprise. They are going to buy a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, painted by that young genius, the Jewish painter, Mortimer Block. This portrait will be given as a gift to the state of Illinois.</p>
   <p>This portrait, together with fifty other paintings of Block's, are now on exhibition at Marshall Field's Lincoln's portrait is considered by every critic to be an original masterpiece. The originality of the portrait lies in the fact that Block pictured Lincoln as a saint.</p>
   <p>This campaign, which will reflect honorably upon the Jews of Illinois, started yesterday. An organization to do the work was created. The following are the officers of the organization; Harry A. Lipsky, chairman, S. J. Rosenblatt, vice- <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>chairman, H. L. Meites, secretary, Samuel Shuster, treasurer, and Sol Posner, chairman of publicity.</p>
   <p>The organization decided that no Jew would be permitted to contribute more than one dollar for this purpose. The reason for this decision is that the committee wants the campaign to have a mass character. "We can easily get a few Jews to contribute the entire amount of five thousand dollars to buy that picture," declared Mr. Harry Lipsky, chairman of the organization, "but that is not our object. We want the Chicago Jews to buy that portrait. The most important thing about this affair is that the finest portrait of Abraham Lincoln was painted by a Jew and that the Jews of Illinois are buying the portrait as a gift for the state of Illinois, which was the home of the great American fighter for freedom." [Translator's note: The next paragraph gives the names of twenty-seven individuals who have each contributed one dollar.]</p>
