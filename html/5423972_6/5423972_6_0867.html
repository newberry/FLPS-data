   <p>To the Jews of America:</p>
   <p>The American Jewish Committee, in executive session assembled, expresses its deep sympathy with the Italian people in their distress. On behalf of American Jewry, it sends the Italian people messages of encouragement and brotherhood, with the prayer that they may be strong and hopeful of the future.</p>
   <p>We call upon the Jews of America to open wide their purses and to contribute what they can to the funds now being gathered by the American Red Cross. Let every Jew do his duty by his stricken Italian brother.</p>
   <p>Contributions should be sent to the nearest local Red Cross treasurer or to the National Red Cross treasurer at Washington, D.C.</p>
