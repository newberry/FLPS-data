   <p>The Progressive Order of the West has the full right to boast and be proud in making the statement which is as follows. There is no other Jewish order which has made such great progress as the Progressive Order of the West, and the Jews in Chicago may be proud and boast to their heart's content with this progressive organization.</p>
   <p>The last report of the executive committee has surprised the executive members. Over 2,000 new members were taken in and an additional ten thousand dollars enlarged the treasury of the order. We can state without the least hesitation that this order is as good as any other Jewish insurance order in the United States of America, and in some respect even better.</p>
   <p>The Progressive Order of the West has an endowment feature which pays $500 to every member and his wife. It pays $500 to its members in case of accident where a member is unable to work.</p>

   <p>The order is being conducted by plain ordinary business men and workers in a high class and clean out manner. At the last convention it showed a gain of 14 new lodges and every member is proud to be one of us.</p>
   <p>The 15th annual convention will be held in St. Louis, January 29, 30, 31. Two hundred delegates will attend this convention. Any one wishing to join this order may apply to the first district deputy #510 S. Desplains Ave. Chicago, Illinois.</p>
