   <p>Twenty-five inmates of Resthaven became homeless yesterday morning when their home at 4401 Grand Boulevard was destroyed by a fire which broke out in the basement. Mrs. Malvina Gordon, the supervisor of the institution, and her assistants displayed great heroism in saving the patients from the flames which spread quickly, destroying a large part of the three-story building. Mrs. Gordon and her assistants took the patients to neighbors of the institution, who were glad to provide them with shelter for a while. The patients were later taken to various hospitals.</p>
   <p>The damage caused by the fire is estimated to be about twenty thousand dollars. A group of philanthropic Jewish women, headed by Mrs. Weil, bought the building about a year ago from Mrs. L. Klein. Poor Jewish women patients, <span class="page-break">2</span>after they leave the hospital, are accepted into the institution for the convalescent period.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Weil and other good-hearted women will soon rebuild the institution, according to the statement made by Mrs. Gordon, because it is one of the most important institutions in the country, and is of great benefit to the community.</p>
