   <p>Mr. Julius Rosenwald is the philanthropist who is financing the cost of looking after the teeth of the children in the Chicago schools. The amount of fifteen thousand dollars will be contributed by Mr. Rosenwald with positive instructions that a system be established to care for children's teeth in all schools in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald's name was withheld in the formation of plans for establishing the first six dental dispensaries. As soon as these six are ready, four more dispensaries will be established, which will make a total of ten. Mr. Rosenwald will donate ten thousand dollars annually which means a thousand dollars per year for each one for its annual upkeep.</p>
