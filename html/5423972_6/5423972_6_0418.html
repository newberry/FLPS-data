   <p>Dr. S. Wolfenstein, Superintendent of the Cleveland Orphan Asylum, passed through the city early this week, on his way home from the I.O.B.B. convention held in St. Louis. On Tuesday evening, Mr. A. Hart, President of the Asylum,tendered the Doctor a reception at the Standard Club. Mr. Hart was assisted by Directors, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kozminski and Weinschenk, and by Dr. Hirsch Julius Rosenthal, and Rabbi Calisch, of Peoria.</p>
   <p>All the former inmates of the Asylum who now live here, were invited to meet their old friend, and about seventy-five were present to renew their friendship and to extend their greetings. Among them were a number of mothers, with babes in their arms, and some who had not seen the Doctor for ten years or more. The evening was plesantly spent and a delight to all present.</p>
