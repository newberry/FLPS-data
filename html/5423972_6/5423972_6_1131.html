   <p>The Edward Katzinger Pathological Anatomical Museum was dedicated at the Mt. Sinai Hospital on January 19th.</p>
   <p>The new museum has a collection of anatomical and pathological specimens of human and animal organs and parts, which were secured in Vienna by Mr. Katzinger on one of his visits to that city. Mr. Katzinger became acquainted with two eminent anatomists of the University of Vienna, who were interested in working out a process of preserving anatomical and pathological parts and organs for teaching purposes. Realizing the immense value that might accrue to medical science through this, Mr. Katzinger subsidized their experiment, which resulted in the process known as the "Aeternitas"? by which, through a series of fixations in various blinds and chemicals, it is possible to preserve indefinitely, in its natural form almost any organism or substance.</p>

   <p>The Mt. Sinai collection includes, in addition to the pathological and anatomical specimens, monkeys, apes, dogs, cats, snakes, insects and all types of foodstuffs, to show how widely the new process can be applies.</p>
