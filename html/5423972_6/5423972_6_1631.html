   <p>B.M.L. Auxiliary in Maywood.</p>
   <p>When people have an ideal before them and energy to achieve that ideal, no community is too small for them. Our small Jewish Community in Maywood has already established a Marks Nathan Orphan Home Auxiliary with no other end in view but to raise funds for the Home. This should be an incentive to the Jewish Community in Melrose Park and other outlying districts, to establish similar organizations.</p>
