   <p>The construction of the new Mt. Sinai Hospital located at 15th place and California Ave. will begin immediately.</p>
   <p>The dedication of the 100 bed unit in May, 1919, was only the start toward the completion of the hospital. This latest unit, when completed, will care for another 300 patients. The present hospital will continue to be used until the completion of the unit, then the old one will be completely remodeled.</p>
   <p>It is planned to spend $850,000 in making the Mount Sinai hospital one of the largest and best equipped in Chicago. This is the second great objective of the Associated Jewish Charities of Chicago; when they started to raise a $2,500,000 building fund.</p>
   <p>The first objective, the nurses' school for the Michael Reese Hospital, has been occupied for some time.</p>
