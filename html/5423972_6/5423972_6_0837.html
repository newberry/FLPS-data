   <p>Although there is no doubt that the success of the United Jewish Charities depends mainly on the number of Jews who contribute large donations annually we believe that the committee to bring an assured success should spread its activities among the ranks of the masses as well. Nothing is more damaging to an institution, than a "let-up" of activities. No matter how enthusiastic the public is over the idea of uniting the orthodox Jewish charities, as soon as rumors get out that the organization is asleep and not active, the fire is cooled off, enthusiasm is quenched and it is taken for granted that nothing will be accomplished.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We understand very well that an organization cannot accomplish much in a week or a month. The work must continue without a let-up, the committee must work on small subscriptions as hard as they do on the large ones.</p>
   <p>We must not forget that the idea of uniting all orthodox Jewish charities into one organization was accepted by the large Jewish public with great happiness and every one is waiting patiently for the committee to call on them so that they can become a part of the organization.</p>
   <p>The committees, however, in the mean time are already quite active and are mobilizing all their forces to unite all orthodox Jewish charities into one. On the strength of their new activities, a good many large donations are already coming in.</p>
