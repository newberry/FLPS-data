   <p>In spite of bad weather, more than a thousand persons attended the opening of the Sinai Hospital yesterday. The affair, which began in the afternoon, continued far into the evening.</p>
   <p>Men and women came from all corners of the city to celebrate this event of the kosher hospital. The committee, which for two and a half years worked ceaselessly for this occasion, received hearty greetings, telegraphically and orally.</p>
   <p>The ceremonies commenced with dancing in the hospital yard about 3 P.M., The chairman was Mr. Ignashus Bernard. Addresses were delivered by Health Commissioner John Dill Robertson, Rabbi Ezreal Epstein, Benjamin J. Rosenthal, Rabbi Saul Silver, Dr. Rudolph Coffee, Rabbi A. E. Kardon, Morris Kurtzon, and Mrs. Edwin Romberg.</p>
   <p>Acting as auctioneer was Mr. Benjamin J. Rosenthal, the prominent clothing manufacturer auctioning off the key to the main door of the hospital. The results showed an income of $1,000, of which Harry Borenstein donated $225. No other articles were auctioned. Mr. Louis Adlarin had the honor of fastening the Mazuza (Hebrew prayer container) at the door.</p>
   <p>All the rooms were not sold yesterday. It is expected that all those wishing to purchase a room will do so this week. From the sale of rooms, an income of fifteen-thousand dollars was collected. Here are some of the many who bought a room, or simply contributed their donations:</p>
   <p>Infant Aid Society, $1,000 to the annual chest for the linen of the infant ward; Sisters of Peace, $500, (both organizations are composed of South Side Jewish women); Mr. and Mrs. Kewzel, $500, in honor of their son, who fell off the Twelfth and Canal Street bridge in an accident with his automobile and was drowned; Samuel Platt, $500; Mr. Harry Borenstone, $1,000; Samuel Philipson, $500; Harry Lubliner, $500; Mrs. Jacob Livingston Fund, $500; Mr. Morris Kurtzon, $1,000; Mr. Meyer Helstein, $500, Ignashus Bernard, $500; Shari Tora Anshe Marev Shul, $500; Beth Hamedrosh Hagadol, $500; Illinois Branch, American Union of Rumanian Jews, $500; Barney Goldstein, $500; and Mr. H. Kramer donated $200.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ignats J. Riess donated the Book of Life in honor of her son, Herbert Leston. All donations contributed to the hospital will be entered into this book.</p>
   <p>The committee hopes that the large Jewish population which believes in the need of a kosher hospital will not simply rely on their beliefs. In order to support the hospital, a sum of $25,000 must be raised annually by subscriptions. To the present time, the committee was fortunate in securing subscriptions for $10,000 annually. Now that the hospital is in operation, the work of securing the rest of the subscriptions will be considerably mitigated.</p>
