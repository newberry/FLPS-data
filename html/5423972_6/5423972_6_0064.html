   <p>What do we do with our children when we wish to teach them Judaism and bring them up as Jews? This question was asked in the last article, and we shall endeavor to answer it.</p>
   <p>The child is reared in a home where he speaks English or Yiddish to his mother, the members of his family, and his playmates.</p>
   <p>The child knows absolutely nothing about Hebrew; neither do his parents, nor the other members of the family, nor the people with whom he comes in contact. He is reared in a Yiddish- or an English-speaking world; his mother tongue is Yiddish or English.</p>
   <p>When the child begins Hebrew school he is told to repeat words that are meaningless to him--words that he never heard before in his life. The language is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>foreign to him and difficult to remember. As a result he becomes discouraged.</p>
   <p>After the child completes the first step [involved in learning the language: namely, becoming acquainted with the vowels and letters of the Hebrew alphabet] he is told to read the separate letters together--as words. He still is indifferent to studying the language. He does not understand it. Nor does he have any conception of what he reads or says. The teacher commands him to read--and he reads.</p>
   <p>The child cannot be pleased with this type of a procedure. The words are strange and meaningless to him. They cannot give him a favorable impression of the language; on the contrary, they cause the child to become discouraged with his studies. The lessons become a burden upon him; they tire him. He is compelled to study, and, therefore, he attempts to absent himself from the Hebrew classes.</p>
   <p>The parents ask: "Why is it that the children are eager to attend public school, and run off to school even before it is time to leave the house, while they must be driven to attend Hebrew school?"</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Poor innocent parents! They are not aware of the fact that it is not the child's fault. No one should wonder at the fact that the child does not want to attend Hebrew school.</p>
   <p>It is also not surprising that it takes the Jewish child much longer to learn to read and write Hebrew than it does for any other child to learn the language of his race. The other nationalities teach a living language, a language in which the child is born and bred, a language which he hears and understands. We teach a language which he never hears at home, on the streets, or anywhere else--a dead language.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to imagine that the other languages could be successfully taught if the child did understand them. Yet, among the Jews, a child is taught to read, to render benedictions, even to pray in a language he does not understand. Is it not pitiful?</p>
   <p>The teacher [of Hebrew] is also in an awkward position (more so than the principal <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of a Talmud Torah). We can easily picture a father demanding that his child be taught to recite the prayers rapidly. The teacher must fulfill this demand, and in doing so, must teach the child to read something he does not understand and something which is, therefore, uninteresting. This task is not an easy one. The child who is compelled to pursue this course of study for a few hours daily becomes dissatisfied. He does not want to tolerate it. He becomes impatient, and tearfully protests against it. He becomes obstinate and hardened. He looks upon the teacher as a tyrant--as one who deprives him of the freedom he desires so much. His contempt for the teacher grows; Hebrew school becomes a prison for him.</p>
   <p>It is an incontrovertible fact that mechanical reading has no value. By reading Hebrew and reciting Hebrew prayers the child does not acquire an understanding of the language.</p>
   <p>Many people will criticize me for telling the truth. A great number will dare to deny it. Others will ignore it, because they do not want to take into consideration the present-day Hebrew educational system. Every qualified teacher, <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>however, and every right-thinking person will admit that the facts I have stated are true.</p>
   <p>Every practical teacher will agree that the relationship between the teacher and his pupils under such circumstances becomes hostile and even vindictive. Such a system creates only anxiety, grief, and discouragement for the child, and is regarded by him with contempt. And unless the teacher makes an impression upon the student, he [the pupil] will detest and despise him. The study will then have no value to the student.</p>
   <p>The teacher who knows his profession observes and studies the temperment, thoughts, and sentiments of the child. He helps the child express his abilities by sympathizing with him and by simplifying things. The child then pays stricter attention, becomes more obedient, and studies more diligently and with greater will power.</p>
   <p>To summarize: The pupil must regard the teacher as his friend, guardian, and <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>guide. How the teacher can bring this situation about under the present circumstances is a question which we shall attempt to answer tomorrow.</p>
