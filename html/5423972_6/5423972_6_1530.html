   <p>We invite all honored rabbis, all honored presidents and officers of synagogues, lodges, societies, organizations and Workmen's Circle branches, to come on Sunday, February 19, at 6:30 P. M., to the Auditorium Hotel, Congress Street and Wabash Avenue, to a fish dinner and a mass meeting, at which we will open our campaign to build a new home. There will be prominent speakers and a beautiful program. We cordially ask all those who did not receive an invitation because we did not have their addresses, to accept this invitation and come and help the only Jewish Infant Home in Chicago. We solicit their advice and support in our attempt to give a real Jewish education to the helpless children. We also ask all our honored presidents of synagogues to inform the public from their pulpits this Saturday morning, of this great and sacred task.</p>
