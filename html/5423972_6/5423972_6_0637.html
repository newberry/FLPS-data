   <p>Chicago will have no more than one Jewish charity organization, beginning January 1. The orthodox and reform charities have united under one name and one management. The name will be - The Jewish Charities of Chicago. The orthodox charities will cater a dinner in the Morrison Hotel, Monday evening, where they will open their campaign for $65,000 to settle all debts of the "Federated" before uniting with the "Associated." The speakers will be: Judge Fisher, Jacob M. Loeb, Judge Horner, James Davis, Samuel Deutsch and S. J. Rosenblatt, chairman of the campaign committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenblatt believes that the uniting of the two charities is an important step forward in the life of the Jewish community in Chicago. The alliance will add many benefits to the philanthropic institutions in the city. "One of the conditions of uniting," said Mr. Rosenblatt, "is that every institution must settle its debts before the first of January. We must, therefore, raise $65,000 in order to cover all deficits and pay all bills." Mr. Rosenblatt also stated that the Mr. Sinai Hospital will unite with the Jewish Charities of Chicago.</p>
