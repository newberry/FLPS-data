   <p>We were never enthusiastic about Sabbath schools. The modern Sabbath schools, which were introduced in all Jewish neighborhoods, are caricatures of the Protestant Sunday school. We have neither praised nor reproached these schools. They are, according to our opinion, a "neutral thing," doing neither good nor harm. The Reform Jews are greatly mistaken if they think that they will attract Orthodox youth [to Reform Judaism] through the Sunday schools. The nationalists believe that by teaching children "Hatikvah" [Jewish national anthem: "The Hope"] they will grow up to be Jewish patriots. The innovators think that if the Biblical story concerning Lot's daughters is told to the children every Sabbath they will grow up to be true Jews. Neither view is correct. We must have the youth for more than a few hours a week.</p>
   <p>Yet, excluding the professional school teachers who make a business of establishing Sabbath schools, and those who established Sabbath schools on the West Side to "civilize" the children of Orthodox parents, right-thinking men and <span class="page-break">2</span>women founded the Sabbath school movement and deserve the support of their friends. Even if no immediate advantage will result therefrom, the movement marks a beginning in an original activity for educating youth.</p>
   <p>One of these Sabbath schools, which was founded by Miss Anna Goldberg, a Jewish daughter who has several ideas on the subject of the education of Jewish girls, at the Beth Midrash Hagodol synagogue, Maxwell Street and Johnson Avenue, has been in existence for six years. This Sabbath school will hold its graduation exercises and Hannkah party in the Hull House Auditorium, Halsted and Polk Streets, next Sunday. A very elaborate program has been prepared for this occasion. Music, songs, dramatic readings, dancing, drills, and speeches by the graduating students and prominent guests will fill the program. In addition, a sketch, "Anna and Her Seven Sons," and a two-act play, "David and Saul," will be presented. Dr. Joseph Stolz will be the principal speaker. Twenty-six girls will receive diplomas.</p>
