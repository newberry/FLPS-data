   <p>The purpose of the Jewish Manual Training School is to teach the pupils the arts and crafts which will in later years enable them to go out into the world to earn their living. The pupil first starts out in a class in carpentry, becomes deeply interested in his work with the knife and square, and thus enters upon this work with delight.</p>
   <p>Leaving the workroom he is promoted to the machine department. Here the mysteries of the steam engine are unfolded to his eye and mind. The lathe, with its whirling wood or iron bar, goes spinning before his wondering gaze.</p>
   <p>Soon all this loses mechanical bearing, and when he enters his classroom, many of the objects in their active process are presented to his understanding and henceforth form what in after years will be vivid recollection, or may be, an active, living pursuit.</p>
   <p>The little girl is taught to work with clay. Design and development of taste are nurtured; change and combination effect improvement. To this is added Calesthenics and the more practical arts derived from the use of scissors and the needle. This work when completed, with the refining influence of music, will comprise a course that in future years must afford that profit and gratification which can only be appreciated by the industrious and persevering.</p>
   <p>We want more mechanics and fewer peddlers, more happy villages with self-supporting families, and fewer trusts. We want more constitutional government, and less political machinery! We want a broader education to fill this broad land. All this we want, and manual training can give it. Not merely the art of handling the plane, or the saw, the square, or the compass. But these to the end and for the purpose of developing a manhood worthy of the fellowship of a Washington or a Franklin.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Manual Training School, as at present in operation in our city, under the management of Professor Gabriel Bamberger, is a fond realization of the dearest hopes of its founders and promoters, and the children of today will in the next generation be grateful for the kind Providence that cast their lot in these happy days.</p>
