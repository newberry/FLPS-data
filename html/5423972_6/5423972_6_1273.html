   <p>A few more days remain before the opening of the convention of the Denver Consumptives Relief Society, known as the Denver Jewish Kosher Sanatorium. The conventions of the Society have been held for the last thirteen years in various cities of the country where Jewish communities responded generously. It is therefore absolutely necessary that representatives of Chicago's organized Jews should send their delegates to the convention which will be held at the Sherman Hotel on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth of this month.</p>
   <p>Many organizations have already sent in the names of their delegates to the headquarters of the committee in Room 1211, Ashland Block. The synagogues and Vereins which have not as yet performed their duty are requested to honor the convention of the real Jewish national institution with their delegates, who are to be elected at their meetings. The officials wish to present their <span class="page-break">\2</span>report on the institution to the representatives of as many organizations as possible.</p>
   <p>The majority of Chicago's synagogues and Vereins are annual contributors to the Denver Sanatorium and should therefore be represented at the convention.</p>
   <p>A. S. Roe, chairman, S. B. Komaiko, vice-chairman, Samuel Macon, secretary, Isadore Cohn, treasurer.</p>
