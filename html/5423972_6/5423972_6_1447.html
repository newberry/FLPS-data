   <p>The Chicago West Side Hospital Association is the name of a recent organization comprising a number of prominent Jewish citizens who are energetic in soliciting aid in behalf of the proposed erection of a hospital for the West Side. Such an organization and under the name Independent Order Bikur Sholim Ukadisha was heretofore known with the same end in view and it appears that the means and influence it possesses are to be devoted to the first named society, who solicits the cooperation of all Jewish citizens and Orders on the West Side to join them in the good work in hand. Among the projectors are Drs. Regentovitch and Klug, and Mrs. B. Davis, besides many other active West Side citizens, both ladies and gentlemen. In connection therewith we are also informed that the well-known Dr. Kadison has just received from the Secretary of State, the incorporation papers for organizing a hospital for the West Side. We are pleased to learn that our West Side friends are eager to establish such a laudable and praise-worthy institution, and trust that all of these organizations may find it practicable to join all their interests to make one grand success of the proposed new hospital.</p>
