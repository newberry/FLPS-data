   <p>The first visit of the Hakoah Soccer Team of Vienna resulted in the adoption of the game of soccer football as the Jewish national outdoor game, and in furtherance of the interest in the game, a meeting was arranged on June 26, 1926, at which the Jewish Junior Soccer League was formed.</p>
   <p>Fourteen teams were entered, as follows:- Maccabees, Roosevelt 2nd, N. W. Syrkin, Red Star, Trumpeldor, (two teams), Brenners, Judaea Juniors, Humboldt, Boys' Brotherhood Republic, Young Poale Zion, White Star, Gordonia, and Crystal Sportsmen.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>J. Berman was elected president and A. William, vice president; J. Rose was elected secretary-treasurer; A. Rose delegate to the Illinois State Football Association, and M. Levin, alternate delegate.</p>
   <p>Through the instrumentality of Mr. Berman, president of the Jewish Junior Soccer League, the Superior State Bank of Chicago presented a beautiful silver loving cup to be played for by the League teams.</p>
   <p>The United States Football Association also presented a cup, to be presented to the winners of the other division.</p>
   <p>Harry E. Kores, one of the pioneers of the original Jewish Soccer Team in the United States, donated a trophy to be played for under the Peel Cup rules as an elimination contest among the League teams.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Two sets of medals were donated, one by Mr. Manson, president of the Roosevelt A. C., and one by A. Millman, vice president of the League. A set of silver medals was presented by the Illinois State Football Association, for the winners of the first division.</p>
   <p>With the opening of the schedule, it was at once evident that the two greatest obstacles to the playing of the schedule were the lack of playing fields, and the need for referees. The former obstacle was partly overcome by playing two and sometimes three games at one field. Several teams found it impossible to play early in the afternoon, otherwise this draw-back would have been completely eliminated. A. Rose and A. Millman offered their services as Junior Referees, and were used throughout the season in that capacity, to the satisfaction of all teams.</p>
   <p>By special arrangement with the Illinois State Junior Football Association, which was formed after the formation of our League, we were allowed to use players over the age of twenty-one, although it was expected that the <span class="page-break">\4</span>arrangement would not be continued after the first season.</p>
   <p>During the past season, the League has been very lenient with teams which have failed to appear for scheduled games. During the coming season the rules must be rigidly enforced.</p>
   <p>The season ends with the Chicago Maccabees Team in first place in the first division, while in the second division, Boys' Brotherhood Republic and Humboldt were tied for the championship at the end of the regular schedule of games.</p>
   <p>In a special game for the championship of the second division, the Boys' Brotherhood Republic won the title by one goal.</p>
   <p>Humboldt beat Red Star in the final for the Harry E. Kores Challenge Cup, the only goal of a well-played game coming in the last minute.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Games conducted by the League to secure revenue have not been well attended by the club members affiliated with the Jewish Junior Soccer League with the result that all such affairs have been virtual financial failures. Teams must understand that these games are the only means of raising funds, since the affiliation fees to the League are not sufficient to meet the obligations incurred during the season.</p>
   <p>The initiation fee last season was only $2, in view of the fact that teams had just been organized and had to make large expenditures for uniforms and so forth. For the coming season 1927-1928, a much larger fee must be charged, in order that the League may be made absolutely self-sustaining. In its first season, the League depended wholly upon donations for the securing of trophies and staionery supplies. This condition of course, cannot be indefinitely maintained and the League must necessarily be placed in a position of financial independence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Increased affiliation fees is the immediate need and a larger attendance at affairs conducted by the League must be secured through the cooperation of all team members.</p>
   <p>I have been tremendously gratified at the success achieved by the Jewish Junior Soccer League, during the first season, and I have enjoyed the closest cooperation from all officers and members of the League, as well as from the older Leagues, and the officials of the Illinois State Football Associations, both senior and junior, especially from Mr. Hames, who, I am pleased to report, has been re-elected secretary-treasurer of the Illinois State Junior Football Association.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The complaints made in this report are made not with the object of expressing dissatisfaction, but are made for the purpose of pointing out where past mistakes might be retrieved and conditions improved during the coming year.</p>
   <p>My experience as secretary-treasurer has been a most pleasant one, and any effort I have expended to further the cause of the Jew in athletics I consider well repaid withthe achievement of the League's numerous successes, and through the close personal contacts I have made with the teams members and the officials.</p>
   <p>The time is not too far distant when an all-star Jewish soccer team will be playing in the Chicago professional leagues, and it is the avowed object of the Jewish Junior Soccer League of Chicago, to so promote the game as to insure during the next five years, the establishment of a Jewish soccer team as the champions of the United States of America.</p>
   <p>Report submitted to the Jewish Junior Soccer League at its annual meeting, August 4, 1927. Jack Rose, Sec'y-Treas.</p>
