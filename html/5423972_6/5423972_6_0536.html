   <p>The Community Council, which is being organized by the Jewish Charities of Chicago, is a move in the right direction. The objects of the organization are to stimulate interest in the civic and philanthropic work of the Jewish community of Chicago; to foster and cultivate the social and educational relationships of the members and to broaden their interest and participation in communal activities, both local and national.</p>
   
   <p>There are no dues or fees of any kind in connection with membership in the Council. Luncheon meetings will be held about once a month during the Fall, Winter and Spring months, and at these meetings outstanding speakers will discuss topics of local, national and international interest. Mr. A. Epstein, who is chairman of the Membership Committee, has undertaken a gigantic though desirable task. If he will get the response and the cooperation that this organization deserves, we have reasons to believe that it will do splendid work, judging by the personnel of its officers and directors.</p>
   <p>Those who are interested in securing additional information may communicate with Mr. Epstein at 220 South State Street.</p>
