   <p>Last Sunday night, a banquet was held in the Auditorium Hotel. The banquet was organized by the Jews of the Northwest Side, or, more correctly, by the Daughters of Zion Day Nursery, or still more correctly, by Mrs. [Charna] Rieger. The Daughters of Zion Day Nursery was founded by Mrs. Rieger. The organization's various auxilliaries were founded by Mrs. Rieger. The last drive for fifty thousand dollars, which sum of money was raised, was organized by Mrs. Rieger. The acquisition of the building and everything that belongs to it, the purchase of the lots, the building activity, the arguments with the contractors, the difficulties with the contractors and builders--[were all the responsibilities of] Mrs. Rieger. The banquet in the Auditorium Hotel for three hundred people was organized by Mrs. Rieger.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rieger is not a young woman and she is not an Americanized woman. Now you can imagine the amount of energy and stubborness there is in that woman. She is what I would call an energetic lady.</p>
