   <p>A Jewish National War Memorial, dedicated to the memory of all Jews who served during the wars of the United States, is to be established in Chicago, under the auspices of the Yarmo-Devere Post of the American Legion. Joseph R. Dorfman, commander of the post, and the officials of Oakridge Jewish Cemetery, have provided the space for the erection of this Jewish shrine at Oakridge Jewish Cemetery, Roosevelt and Mannheim Roads.</p>
   <p>This is the first national undertaking by a local American Legion Post. If the present plans meet with no mishaps, the dedication of the memorial will take place on Armistice Day.</p>
