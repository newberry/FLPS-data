   <p>About 600 of Chicago's West Side Jewish business men responded to the call of Mr. Julius Rosenwald for a meeting which took place last evening. Regardless of the bad weather they gathered at the Hebrew Institute where Mr. Rosenwald awaited them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald called on Mrs. Julia Stone to act as secretary and called the meeting to order. He related how he became interested in uniting the Jewish charities. He also explained to the audience the activities of the Associated Jewish Charities, how it was organized and how it works for the success of every welfare institution which the reformed Jews support. He especially appealed to the West Side better class of Jews to take their hand off their hearts and give as much as they possibly can to the cause of charity.</p>

   <p>Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, the secretary of the Federation Committee, related the story of the federation, how it began with its work last December, and how the work is going on up to the present time. Rabbi Emil S. Hirsch of the Sinai Temple was the next speaker and in his most eloquent address, he spoke on the welfare work of the Associated Jewish Charities and in the mean time made an appeal to the large audience for subscriptions.</p>
   <p>After Rabbi Hirsch's address, Mr. Rosenwald inquired if there is any one in the audience who is against the union of the Jewish charities, but of course no one rose to answer the question but, when he put the question up as to who is wholeheartedly in favor of the federation, every one in the audience stood up to a man. A committee was selected in the audience to solicit subscriptions and $6,000.00 was pledged immediately. Mr. Rosenwald in addition pledged $5,000.00 as soon as the fund reaches the hundred thousand dollar mark.</p>
