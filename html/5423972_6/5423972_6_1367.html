   <p>The Order Knights of Zion, not being a "beneficial" organization whose main purpose is much more that to ameliorate the material needs of the individual, has now found it expedient to join the "Beneficial Orders of the United States." These lodges have finally decided that they should join with others and participate in activities other than Zionist. The "Beaconsfield Lodge" was one of the first to join the Beneficial Orders of the United States.</p>
