   <p>Moes Chitim (money donated for the purpose of providing the poor with food for Passover).</p>
   <p>The Federated Jewish Charities determined at their last meeting to exclude the collection and distribution of Moes Chitim from their program, and the Moes Chitim Committee, which was engaged in this work for many years, was highly pleased with the decision.</p>
   <p>It is the opinion of the directors of the Federation that Moes Chitim is not a form of charity and in a certain sense they are right. Charity either comes from the sentiment of compassion or from the sentiment of obligation, but when speaking of obligation in connection with Moes Chitim, it is as one who runs a party is obligated to satisfy his guest who come to pay him tribute.</p>

   <p>If Moes Chitim would have in view only to provide the poor with matzo for Passover, it would then become the obligation of the Lechem Lerachim Society to fulfill. This society provides the poor with bread throughout the entire year, and consequently, it should provide the hungry with matzo on Passover. But this never occurred among the Jews. The thought of distributing Moes Chitim can be linked with the fact that Passover is a national holiday among Jews. The Jewish race celebrates Passover week as its birthday and it calls all its children to participate in its birth; the most elaborate and elegant foods and drinks are prepared, and the master of each household calls out: "May all those, who are hungry, come in and eat thereof."</p>

   <p>This is the true spirit of Moes Chitim and it was therefore the opinion of the directors of the Federation that it is not in the province of their activity to engage themselves and to take over the financing and distribution of Moes Chitim.</p>
   <p>The Moes Chitim Committee, which is a union of all synagogues, are the servants engaged by the pious Jews to raise Moes Chitim and to distribute it in such manner that not one Jewish house should be short of anything on the ceremonial night. For the past few years, the United Moes Chitim Committee have carried out their program in the finest manner. This year, when the collection of all the social money is regulated this committee should succeed in doing better work.</p>

   <p>Undoubtedly there isn't a Jew in Chicago who sits with his wife and children at his table and celebrates the birthday of his race who will not enjoy the ceremony better if not embittered by the knowledge that his neighbor is seated at an empty table deluged with tears. What the committee has to do is simply remind the public that the time has come for them to cooperate in the holiday and the people will respond gladly with an overabundance.</p>
