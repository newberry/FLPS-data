   <p>The annual collections for the United Hebrew Charities were made in all the temples on Sunday during the "Ereb Yom Kippur" services. While the total amount collected has not yet been announced, it is known that there has been an increase of not less than 25Â¢ over last year's collection. It is estimated that about $18,000 was raised. Of this sum the members of Sinai gave over $9,000; K. A.M. , $4,000; and Zion, over $2,000.</p>
