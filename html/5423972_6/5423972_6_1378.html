   <p>We are very happy as to the decision of our Jewish workers' organizations, to have a theater benefit at the Metropolitan Theater, February 2, 1910.</p>
   <p>This benefit is for the Denver Consumptive Sanitarium, which is one of the most needed and important institutions in the land. The Jewish workers are furnishing the biggest percentage of afflicted to this institute, so, therefore, it is advisable for the Jewish workers to do most of the contributing to this worthy cause.</p>
   <p>The Denver Consumptive Sanitarium is the only one of its kind in the United States conducted by Jews. So it is nothing but just and right that the Chicago Jewish workers should help support this institution. There are hundreds and hundreds of Jewish consumptives here in Chicago, who have no place to go, except to an institution of this kind.</p>
