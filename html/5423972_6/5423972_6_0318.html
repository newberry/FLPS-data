   <p>The Sunday morning lectures and concerts, which are held every week in Gartners Theater, have already become a sort of an institution for the radical working intellectuals of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The program for tomorrow will be an unusual one. It will be one that Chicago Jewry has not yet witnessed. Two lectures will be held, one on "The Origin of the Jewish Literature," by Dr. Z. Lorber and the other by Jack Ryan, on Knute Hamsun's recent book The Growth of the Soil, for which he received the Nobel prize in literature.</p>
   <p>Then, a musical program will be presented by famous stars of the Russian Grand Opera Company, and a great Russian-Polish cellist. The names of the stars are: Buzanowsky, a tenor, Fraulein Ossysova, - the baritone, Pantoliev, and the baritone, Radditziev. They will be accompanied on the piano by the concert maestro of the opera, Herr Prestman. The great Russian-Polish cellist, Bagamil Sikorow, will play Baruch's "Kol Nidre" and Fiote's "Ayres Baskirs." Herr Lev Fiodorov, director of the opera, will also greet the audience.</p>
