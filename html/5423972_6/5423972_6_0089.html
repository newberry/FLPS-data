   <p>Among the announcements printed in a corner of the Jewish Courier appeared a notice which caused a deep sigh in every Jewish heart. The announcement read: "Resignation! I resign from my office of principal of the West Side Hebrew Schools and I thank the directors who have appointed me to this honorable office. I wish them, the officers, and all those who support these sacred institutions a Happy New Year.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>"I. Dolnitzky,</p>
   <p>"921 Winchester Avenue."</p>
   <p>An innocent, small announcement, yet it means a lot.....</p>
   <p>How long ago is it since the finer Jews of Chicago attempted to place the Chicago Hebrew schools on a sound and healthy basis? How long ago is it since we began campaigning to establish a Hebrew school? How long ago is it since we triumphed and accepted Mr. Dolnitzky as principal?</p>
   <p>Oh, what a victory we then seemed to achieve! How rosy the future of the Hebrew school appeared! What plans were made to erect a future educational institution where Jewish children would be able to learn Judaism, and where the future Jewish generation would be created--a generation in which Jews would be Jews, acknowledge Judaism, and be proud of it! We not only hoped for this, but we were certain that it would come about.</p>
   <p>We really progressed when we engaged Mr. Dolnitzky as principal. This alone was a sufficient guarantee that the Hebrew school would turn out scholarly Jews. We did not stop, however, with this act alone. A board of education was elected which consisted of Dr. Morris Levin, Rabbi N. Z. Budzinsky, Rabbi E. Epstein, Rabbi Saul Silber, Mr. Harry Hurwich, and other authorities on Jewish education. We also went ahead and appointed new directors. Business men met on Waller Street and resolved to support the Hebrew school materially. The finest business men among Chicago Jewry, our pride, the "cream" of the Ghetto, Messrs. Benjamin Schiff, Samuel Phillipson, Harry Hurwich, and others like them were appointed directors. Who would doubt, even for one moment, the future security of the Hebrew school with such a board of directors?</p>
   <p>The education of our future generation was already being discussed: How were we to make our future generations better Jews and better men? Dr. Levin, Mr. Dolnitzky, and other young pedagogues participated in this discussion. Everything but the system was approved. Everyone was positive that with Mr. Dolnitzky as principal, and with such excellent people on the board of education, the Chicago Hebrew school would be provided with the best guidance.</p>
   <p>Now we read a small announcement in the Courier beginning with the word "resignation" and ending with "I. Dolnitzky". The Hebrew school seems to be facing a decline; it is on the verge of becoming past history.</p>
   <p>Will Chicago remain without a Hebrew school? Will the Epsteins and the Silbers permit the Jewish textbooks to remain closed and expel the the Jewish children from the school? We must not forget that this month is Elul, the month of spiritual reawakening.</p>
   
   <p>Rabbis and laymen! Everyone to whom Jewish interests are dear and beloved! Everyone who wants to preserve Judaism! Come to our assistance! Help us organize the Chicago Hebrew school! Help now, before it is too late!</p>
