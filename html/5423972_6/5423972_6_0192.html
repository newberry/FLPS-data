   <p>Dr. A. R. Levy is about to establish a Hebrew free school in the vestry rooms of his temple, B'nai Abraham, 509 Marshfield avenue. The object of this school is to perpetuate the Hebrew language as a living useful tongue. The idea is to teach the pupils to write as well as to understand. Two teachers will be needed and perhaps three. The instruction will require less than one hour a day and the school will be open to all.</p>
