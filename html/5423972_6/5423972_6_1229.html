   <p>The Lag B'Omer (holiday) celebration,held last Sunday by the Women's Auxiliary of Jewish Incurables in Oak Forest excelled,not only in the delicious supper and fine speeches, but also in the support that was promised for the synagogue and social center to be established there for the unfortunates.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harry Bornstein, one of the most prominent members of Beautiful Zion Synagogue, promised to donate one thousand dollars for the building now and four thousand at a later date. He was heartily thanked by the president of the Women's Auxiliary. After the appeal, more money was promised by those present.</p>
