   <p>The Maimonides Hospital is now under the supervision of Dr. H. J. Moss, former assistant superintendent of the Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, who arrived in Chicago yesterday morning and immediately took over the duties of his office as superintendent of this Chicago Kosher hospital.</p>
   <p>Although somewhat fatigued from his trip, Doctor Moss granted a brief interview to a Courier reporter. He declared that he was surprised to find such a magnificent structure so modernly equipped. Internally, he found the hospital not so well organized, but that can easily be improved. He hopes to make the improvements immediately.</p>
   <p>"I am surprised," said Doctor Moss to our reporter, "that Chicago, with a Jewish population of over a quarter million Jews, has only two Jewish hospitals, whereas New York, which has approximately three times as many Jews, is in possession of twelve Jewish hospitals." Money is the chief factor to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>keep a hospital up to the standard of modern scientific requirements. With the requisite funds, the Maimonides Hospital will eventually become one of the best hospitals in the country.</p>
   <p>Doctor Moss has taken over the supervision of Maimonides Hospital with an extensive background of experience. In New York he gained a good reputation in the medical world, notwithstanding that he is only 31 years of age. Besides his great skill in medicine, he distinguished himself as a competent director, and is well liked and praised for his many virtues. We wish the new superintendent of the Maimonides Hospital much luck in his office.</p>
