   <p>We must admit that the Independent Order B'rith Abraham has learned a great deal from the recent occurrences in the Jewish lodges, and that at its last convention the delegates carried through many reforms. If this should continue there is a basis for hope that this order will eventually become that order which will really represent Jewish interests on all fronts.</p>
   <p>The adopted resolution, that nomination and election of grand officers should be conducted in a more democratic manner, is a great step forward in improving the lodge system; in due time the grand office patriots will be abolished.</p>

   <p>Yet even the convention of the Independent Order B'rith Abraham was unable to display that true brotherly spirit which should have been the essence of such a convention. A resolution, to the effect that a member of the organization who is old and feeble and can no longer pay his dues, shall have his dues advanced by the lodge and shall afterwards deduct it from the endowment, failed of passage.</p>
   <p>This ordinarily implies that the Order is seeking to evade the payment of endowments in case of death. It is seeking means of preventing the old and feeble, the sick and disabled from maintaining their dues payments in order to scratch them, as it is called in lodge lingo. If a man who has been a member of the order for thirty or forty years, has paid his dues regularly, has constantly bought the usual number of tickets to balls, picnics, or other affairs, has paid the fixed penalty for not attending meetings, funerals, or weddings, becomes too old and ailing to pay dues, his lodge brothers do not assure his widow his insurance, but on the contrary, they immediately scratch him, and erase him from the membership list.</p>

   <p>The resolution to raise a fund for members who are unable to work and earn a livelihood was adopted only after the Grand Master convinced the delegates that the percentage of these unfortunates is so small that it will not effect the order and that it would be a good advertisement of the benevolence of the lodge.</p>
   <p>There is no reason why one should receive insurance if he becomes blind accidentally, but should not get even expenses with which to pay his dues if he loses his sight through old age. Why should one receive $500 for losing his hands or feet in a street car accident and not be advanced fifteen dollars a year for the rest of his life when the same organs are unable to function on account of old age.</p>

   <p>If true brotherly spirit would prevail among the lodge brothers such a thing would never occur. Let us hope that in the near future our lodges shall be more saturated with the spirit of brotherhood, which is the basis of our fraternal organizations. In the mean time they are all the same.........dollar organizations.</p>
