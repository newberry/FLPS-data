   <p>140 incurable Jews are making their home there. A special train of eleven coaches filled with visitors pulled in from Chicago; others came by automobile. The new building for the Jewish sick, consists of a strictly Kosher kitchen, two dining rooms, one for the ordinary sick and one for the consumptives, a synagogue, a library, etc.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lipski, chairman of the opening celebration explained the necessity of this new building. Until now the sick Jewish people felt lonesome and strange among the 5,000 non-Jewish patients.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Reinberg, President of the County Board, stated, "It is very possible that some of the visitors, who are now visiting here, may sometime become inmates here. Therefore it is very important that you should help keep up and support this institution." Through auction of different honors, and pledges, the sum of $1,000 was raised on the premises.</p>
