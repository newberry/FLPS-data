   <p>The Hospital has been in successful running order during more than eleven months and, we hope, shall continue to merit the growing good will of the Jewish and the general public. One of our chief difficulties, however, has been with our employees. We have been compelled to make some changes for which the government of the Hospital has been severely criticised.</p>
   <p>The chief criticism has been that we have no Jewish employees. The Hospital being a Jewish institution, the Board has always preferred to employ competent Jewish help but has not been successful in the endeavor. In the selection of employees, competency, fidelity, and diligence have always been the only requirements. Jewish applicants would have been appointed but no religious bias could prevent us from selecting what appeared to be the best material for the good of the Hospital service.</p>
