   <p>The Jewish Home Finding Society organized in 1907, is an organization devoted to the care of children with particular emphasis on the individualization of such care within foster family homes. No restrictions are made as to type, age or condition of the child. It maintains a housekeeping service primarily for the purpose of keeping families together during the temporary abscence of the mother. In 1935 there was an average of 732 children under care - 597 under boarding care, 135 under housekeeping care.</p>
