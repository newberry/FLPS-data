   <p>At a meeting of the Board, a plea was made by Dr. Joseph B. De Lee for additional funds for the Chicago Lying-In Hospital and Dispensary. Dr. De Lee stated that Jewish cases at the hospital comprised 1/3 of the total number treated and that the net cost of the 775 Jewish cases approximated $18,358 to which should be added $4,462 cost of 425 Jewish patients at the Maxwell St. Dispensary.</p>
   <p>Dr. De Lee urged that the present appropiation of $3,000 per year be increased to $10,000 which is approximately 1/2 of the cost of Jewish patients.</p>
