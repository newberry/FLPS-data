   <p>Yesterday evening, at a meeting of the presidents of large synagogues in Chicago, it was decided that on the second day of Shevuous (Pentecost), at memorial services everywhere, an appeal should be made to raise money for the synagogue and center for uncurable Jewish patients in Oak Forest.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to contact rabbis in regard to making this appeal. This committee consists of M. Salk, Mr. Feinstein, Yerchmeal Rosenberg, Paul Risman, Judge Marken, William Farber, Adolph Cohen, and H. M. Barnett.</p>
   <p>The County Board decided to give a site in Oak Forest for this spiritual center, but Chicago Jews must pay for its construction and upkeep.</p>
