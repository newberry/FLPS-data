   <p>The Medical Department of the Workmen's Circle is one of the most important departments created by the great workmen's order for the health of its members.</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle cares for its members just as parents care for their children. It has united the Jewish workers into one big family throughout the country, and no matter to what city in America a worker comes, he immediately is accepted in the intimate rank and file of the Workmen's Circle. He is also protected by a sickness fund, and insurance.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, it was always felt that a member of the Workmen's Circle did not get the full protection to which he is entitled, so long as there was no special department to care for his health.</p>
   <p>The Medical Department was therefore created and developed by the Workman's Circle in Chicago and those throughout the country.</p>

   <p>The co-operative method of medical aid is the best and most economical for every thinking person.</p>
   <p>But there is also another important point in the plan of co-operative activity in the field of health, a point which the ordinary person does not grasp.</p>
   <p>The members of the Workmen's Circle belonging to the Medical Department do not have to hesitate very long before calling a physician, when they do not feel well. When a member feels a little weak, he immediately calls a physician or visits one in his office. In doing so he prevents the common cold from developing into something more serious. The physician's fee in this case is secondary and negligible.</p>
   <p>These privileges, plus the freedom from worry about the high cost of the physician's fee, are adequate reasons for every member of the Workmen's Circle to belong to the Medical Department.</p>
   <p>The Medical Department of the Workmen's Circle was created for the purpose of educating and teaching the members of the Workmen's Circle that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>it is not necessary for one to become seriously ill before he consults a physician, and that it is wiser to immediately obtain the advice of the physician, so that he can prevent the member from becoming seriously ill. Each member enjoys the privilege of being examined by the Workmen's Circle doctor at the slightest symptom of ill health. Furthermore, even a healthy person has the right to a doctor's examination to determine the general condition of his system.</p>
   <p>The Medical Department of the Workmen's Circle has a staff of the most popular and well-known physicians. They are ready at any moment to serve the interests of the members.</p>
   <p>It is worth your while to become a member of the Workmen's Circle and of the Medical Department. Through your membership you help to build the great health department of the Workmen's Circle.</p>
