   <p>At a meeting held last night in the La Salle Hotel, called by the Board of Directors of the Federation (Jewish Charitable Association), the report of the Investigating Committee on the Maimonedes Hospital was accepted.</p>
   <p>The report was approved by a large majority after considerable debate.</p>
   <p>The investigating committee consisted of Mrs. A. Margolis, chairman; B. J. Schiff, Samuel Phillipson, Rabbi Saul Silber, Morris Taver, and Charles I. Herron, who submitted the following report:</p>
   <p>"To the United Orthodox Jewish Charities:</p>
   <p>"The committee authorized by you to investigate the Maimonedes Hospital, has the pleasure of submitting the following report, together with suitable <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>recommendations:</p>
   <p>"(1) We found that most of the members of the Board of Directors have neglected their work badly and failed to fulfill their duties. (2) The hospital was opened before everything had been brought to order, thus making it difficult for the doctors to carry on their work. (3) We found that the appointment of staff doctors was done too hastily. The directors had no time to investigate each appointment properly. (4) We further found that the staff doctors are quarreling among themselves, which is detrimental to the progress of the hospital, and we think that there is no possibility of ironing out these disputes. (5) We found that the internes were unqualified to do hospital work. (6) The staff nurses were poorly organized from the very beginning when the hospital opened, and the present condition of this division is very poor. (7) The expenditures drastically exceed the income of the hospital.</p>
   <p>"We, therefore, recommend that the Board of Directors, Medical staff, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>assistant doctors and nurses, be entirely reorganized, and that for this end a committee of nine persons be appointed, six from the Federation and three from the Maimonedes Hospital. This committee should be known as the Reorganization Committee, having full authority, even over matters pertaining to the admission of the sick.</p>
   <p>"We further recommend that the Federation grant the hospital a liberal sum in about a month, so as to reorganize the hospital properly.</p>
   <p>"We, the committee, are of the opinion that it would be impractical for the Federation to permit the hospital to carry on as it now does. It would simply be a disadvantageous expenditure, a burden upon the Federation and upon the public."</p>
   <p>The hospital must be reorganized on such a basis as will attract favorable <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>public opinion, and it should be turned into a Hospital which should serve as a monument for the future generation.</p>
