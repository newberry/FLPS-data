   <p>Rabbi Abraham Niagniavsky, the representative of the Rabbinical Seminary of Kovna, is here to collect the yearly contributions of friends of the Seminary, to obtain more subscribers for this holy institution. It is a duty of every Jew who has the love of Torah in his heart to contribute as much as he can to an institution which puts out so many fine Rabbis, the backbone of our people.</p>
