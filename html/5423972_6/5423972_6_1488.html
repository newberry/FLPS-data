   <p>After many years of striving and hoping to raise funds to build a Jewish infants home, we now live to see it in reality, and today we will have our first mass-meeting at 1 P. M. in our institution, Hirsch and California Ave.</p>
   <p>In honor of this occasion a concert has been arranged with good talents, also of children of our nursery. Mme. Fannie Reinheart will open the concert with a vocal solo. Speeches will be made by Rabbi Budzinski, Louis Reingold and Mrs. Charna Rieger.</p>
   <p>The chairladies will announce the program of the big bazaar which is to be opened Saturday night, May 5, on all three floors of the new infant home. Come to the first meeting and concert in the institution for baby orphans, that was built with your moral and financial help.</p>
   <p>Daughters of Zion Nursery and Infants Home.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rieger - President.</p>
