   <p>At a meeting of the Board of Education, a motion by Hon. Harry A. Lipsky, seconded by Gertrude H. Britton, to name the new school at Taylor and Throop Streets, the Jacob A. Riis School, was unanimously carried.</p>
   <p>Mr. Riis, who recently passed away, was well known here in Chicago. He was one of the best Jewish immigrants who came over to this country. The school which stands right in the center of a strictly immigrant neighborhood, could not possess a better name.</p>
