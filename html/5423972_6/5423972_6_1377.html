   <p>The erection of three new maternity hospitals, one in each division of the city, which will maintain free, part-pay, and full-pay wards, is contemplated by the Board of the Chicago-Lying-In Hospital. The first of the hospitals will be built at a cost of $250,000, at 51st and Vincennes Ave. The sites of the North and West Side hospitals have not yet been selected.</p>
   <p>The building of an emergency section to the South Side institution was announced at a meeting of the Mothers' Aid Sewing Club held Wednesday evening, at Isaiah Temple. This annex will cost $30,000, and while under the direction of the larger institution, will be maintained by the club.</p>
   <p>The Chicago-Lying-In Hospital is temporarily at 515 Ashland Blvd., and the outside work in the homes of the poor is directed from a new building at Maxwell St. and Newberry Ave. Since its opening, sixteen years ago, the institution has cared for about 18,000 patients.</p>
