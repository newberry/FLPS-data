   <p>A very important meeting took place last night at the Sinai Temple, 21st Street and Indiana Avenue, where an election of officers of the Hebrew Charities was held. Approximately 1,000 people attended the meeting and discussions were carried on far into the night. It was decided to abolish the United Hebrew Charities and in its place create two new committees to be called: The Michael Reese Hospital of Chicago and the Jewish Aid Society.</p>
   <p>The former will be responsible for the support of the Michael Reese Hospital. The latter will be responsible for the relief of need, the labor bureau, the West Side Dispensary and the Bureau of Personal Service.</p>
