   <p>Mr. Dorf thanked everyone and spoke of the conditions of the Order, financially and otherwise, stressing the necessity for increasing membership rates and installing a new system of paying according to age rates. He also tendered his resignation.</p>
   <p>Much discussing regarding the choice of a committee and a temporary chairman ensued, but this question was finally settled. The next meeting was set for Monday morning at 10 A.M.</p>
   <p>Many important questions and resolutions are to be presented by the delegates at this convention. One requesting the Order to favor Zionism is sure to be accepted because of the favorable attitude of Mr. Dorf and most of the delegates.</p>
