   <p>Two performances will be played today and tomorrow at the Empire Theatre, under the auspices of the Ladies Auxilary of the Oak Forest Infirmary, for the benefit of the Jewish patients, who are kept up by this institution for uncurables in Oak Forest.</p>
   <p>Nearly 100 incurable Jewish patients in that county institution are awaiting our help.</p>
   <p>The Jewish patients of that institute were constantly complaining, why the Chicago Jews ignore them, and are not interested enough to come out to visit them. It is our duty to help those unfortunates who need our help and friendship.</p>
   <p>Tonight at the Empire.</p>
   <p>The Golden Wedding -</p>
   <p>Tomorrow -</p>
   <p>Blind Love.</p>
