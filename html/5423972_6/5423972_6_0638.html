   <p>A feverish activity is going on among the members of the Progressive Order of the West who are in Chicago for the election of the new grand master of the organization. Joseph Schiller, the present vice-grand master is the one who has the greatest following here. This following is well deserved because Joseph Schiller has proved himself to be one of the most loyal members of the Order. He is a respectable businessman with a sense of responsibility toward himself and toward those with whom he comes in contact, an honest and faithful father of a family, and a good fellow in the real meaning of the word. All these virtues, his quiet and calm nature, the sense of fair play and justice that he possesses, qualify Mr. Schiller for the office for which his many friends, headed by Paul Rothenberg, are urging him to run.</p>

   <p>Mr. Schiller is still coy. He has not yet made up his mind to accept the office. If he accepts, he will have the support not only of the Chicago members of the Order, but also the support of the members of the Order in other cities who know, appreciate, and respect him.</p>
