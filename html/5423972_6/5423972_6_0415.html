   <p>The K. A. M. "Knowledge Seekers" met last Tuesday evening and admitted a number of new members. The plan of work adopted is as follows: The Society will be divided into sections of 10 or more members, each section electing its own chairman and choosing its own subject. One of the members prepares a paper for discussion by the section. All the sections meet together once a month when various papers are read and discussed. Three sections are now organized and the subjects selected are "Jewish History and Literature", "General Literature", and "Philosophy."</p>
