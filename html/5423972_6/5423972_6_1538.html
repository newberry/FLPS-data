   <p>The new home for Jewish helpless children of Chicago. The new infants home that is being built in Chicago will occupy an entire block in the most beautiful district of the Northwest Side and will cost a half-million dollars.</p>
   <p>This is the first home for Jewish-orphans being built through the help of the Northwest Side Day-Nursery, and Infants' Home Organization. About five years ago there was a small ladies' society in existence whose aim was to keep up a Talmud Torah. Through the students this society became acquainted with widows and deserted women who were hindered from going out to look for work because they had no place to leave their children. The very thought that a fire might break out inthe house, or that a child might go outdoors alone and get hurt by a street-car or automobile, would rob some mothers of the life and health of children while they were at work in the shop or store. It was clear that ways and means had to be provided to help these widows and orphans, and this Society founded the first Jewish Day Nursery in Chicago. Many of these women did not believe that it was possible to open and maintain a nursery without having funds on hand, but thanks to the energy of some of our devoted mothers, we managed to purchase not only the present home for the nursery, for $12,000, but also ten lots in the Northwest Side's most beautiful spot, at the corner of Hirsch Street and California Avenue just across Humboldt Park, for a Jewish Infant Home.</p>

   <p>According to the plan of the infant home architects, Dubin and Isenberg, the building will have sufficient rooms to raise 500 babies. Two entire floors will be equipped for the babies, and one floor for the offices, meeting-rooms, and day-nursery; and the basement for the kitchen, dining-room, laundry, boiler-room, and coal-bins. It will cost one-half million dollars to build this home.</p>
   <p>It is expected that the home will open about a year from now.</p>
   <p>A short time ago, when the State Charter was received and the name was entered in the official State Journal, the Chicago Federation of Jewish charities wanted the Day Nursery and Infant Home to be placed under its supervision, but the ladies' society flatly refused to let the home become a part of the organized charity. The Jewish infant-home is and shall remain a people's institution. This home for workers' children is being built not by the benevolence of a few Jews but by the great masses of Jewish workers.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday, the ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone of that great beautiful infant-home took place, and it was a joyous celebration. The children of the present home, for whom a new building is being erected, were parading in large automobiles and had a jolly good time. The women working for the institution paraded; here and there they appealed for funds and then they sold <span class="page-break">\3</span>bricks for the new building.</p>
   <p>The workers are determined to make a success of their drive, in order that they may be able to open their new home at the earliest possible moment.</p>
