   <p>The Chicago fire destroyed the Jewish Hospital. Enough money is now available to reconstruct the institution. The proposed site is on North La Salle Street.</p>
   <p>The Jewish millionaire, Michael Reese, of California, gave directions, in his will, that his Chicago heirs spend a portion of their inheritance from his estate for benevolent purposes in Chicago. In accordance with these instructions, Heinrich Frank of this city gave thirty thousand dollars (a part of the inheritance) toward the building fund of the Hospital; and Mrs. Henriette Rosenfeld and Jacob Rosenberg gave fifty thousand dollars to provide an amortization fund.</p>
   <p>These sums have been given to the local United Hebrew Relief Association, and there is about $12,000 in the treasury of the Association which is also available for the Hospital.</p>
   <p>The only condition which was specified in the testament of Reese, was that the proposed institution should be called the "Reese Hospital."</p>
