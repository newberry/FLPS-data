   <p>Lecture Association.</p>
   <p>Last Autumn a Lecture Association was organized to take charge especially of the Wednesday evening lectures, which during the previous year were given directly under the auspices of the Institute. The Association met with a considerable amount of success. At present there are 131 members (29 of whom are regular members of the Institute and to whom no charge was made) comprising people from every walk of life.</p>
   <p>The membership fee is $1.00 a year, which entitles the members to attend all of the lectures of the Association free of charge. Most of the lecturers were professors of the University of Chicago. There were 21 lectures given on various topics. The average attendance for the season was 2,831. An admission fee of 10Â¢ was charged to outsiders. There were 1,952 admissions from non-members. In addition to the above course of lectures a large number of lectures were given by various organizations, among them the English Educational Club, with Judge Hugo Pam as main lecturer, the Institute <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Educational League and the Homeward Club, who gave lectures on an average of once a month, and others.</p>
