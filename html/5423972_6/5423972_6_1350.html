   <p>Hospital Convention a Success.</p>
   <p>Over 300 delegates and representatives of different synagogues, lodges, and other Jewish organizations have made up their minds to get busy and build the hospital. The meeting at the Hebrew Institute, yesterday afternoon was a great success. The Roll was called by President, H. M. Fisher of the Maimonides Kosher Hospital, who opened the convention. It was the biggest convention of Jewish representatives ever before assembled in Chicago. Several prominent Rabbis addressed the large audience and explained convincingly the necessity of building a Kosher Hospital. Mr. Rosenblatt impressed the audience immensely in his address on the preparations for the building of the Kosher Hospital.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Hospital, so far had no plans as to how to raise the necessary funds to build the Hospital. That was why the delegates were called together to formulate plans for the raising of funds for this worthy <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>undertaking. Each and every delegate was invited to express his views, and at the end of lengthy discussion, the following resolutions were adopted: that the present delegates stand elected by their respective organizations; that there shall be an Advisory Board of Maimonides Kosher Hospital which will meet once a month to nominate and elect directors and officers, and that delegates shall form themselves into committees to help build the Hospital.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nevelev, the Superintendent of the Hospital, after delivering a fiery speech, adjourned the convention.</p>
