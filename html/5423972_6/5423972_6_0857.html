   <p>The Home for the Aged, in Jerusalem, which has existed for so many years through the contributions of our Russian brethren finds itself badly in need of funds and appeals to American Jewry to keep the home going.</p>
   <p>The home now provides food and shelter for over 360 old men and women. Jews of Chicago are asked to support this only institution of its kind in the holy land. Their representative, Mr. Solomon Elstien, is now in Chicago to collect money for the institution which is highly recommended by us to Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>Mr. Elstien may be located at 1255, North Irving Ave.</p>
