   <p>The Jewish Training School is the outgrowth of the Ladies Industrial School for Girls. The charter of the latter was amplified so as to include both sexes, and in 1890 the school on Judd Street was opened. The school was made possible because of a donation of $20,000 by Leon Mandel and others, followed with generous contributions. The cost of the school and grounds was $72,000.</p>
   <p>The school is proud of its Alumni, which numbers more than 200 pupils. Each and every one of the graduates is on the high road to success either in business life or as a unit in society.</p>
