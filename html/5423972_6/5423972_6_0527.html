   <p>Richard H. Park has just completed a plaster cast for a bronze statue of Michael Reese. The figure as it now stands in Mr. Park's studio is eight feet in height.</p>
   <p>It has not been decided whether the bronze casting will be made in America or Italy. The statue is made in accordance with the bequest of a nephew of Michael Reese, who died 2 years ago, leaving $20,000. This money is to be equally divided in expenditures on a statue of his uncle and a fountain, both to be placed in the institution of which his ancestor was the founder.</p>
