   <p>The Lawndale District, which is at present the largest Jewish district in Chicago, has its own necessary cultural and philanthropic institutions, and, undoubtedly, one of these institutions is the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery. In the large city of Chicago where there are more than 300,000 Jews such an institution is of inestimable importance. Years ago, before such Jewish nurseries had been established, an unfortunate Jewish child whom bitter fate had robbed of father or mother, or a child, whose mother was forced out of necessity to seek employment in order to earn the daily bread for her children, was surrendered into the hands of non-Jews, and entered an atmosphere which was remote from the Jewish spirit, from Jewish traditions, and from the Yiddish language. Such a child is punished in two ways. Besides being economically underprivileged, he is spiritually sundered from his people, and becomes estranged from his immediate family. When such a child grows up, he is lost to his people. The Jewish father or the Jewish mother who would have liked to have <span class="page-break">2</span>his or her child remain a Jew and to have him follow the footsteps of his forebears, was, however, compelled to deliver the child into non-Jewish hands, thereby causing the parents untold misery. What could a father do when his wife died, leaving him with two, three, or four children? What could an unfortunate mother do whose husband died, thereby cutting off her economic support?</p>
   <p>Frustrated by circumstances, exasperated by fate, with a pessimistic outlook regarding the future, such unfortunates, with tears in their eyes and pain in their hearts, gave their children into such hands--hands which they knew would tear the children away from them.</p>
   <p>Chicago Jewry finally became aware of, and understood its moral obligations, and established these institutions--Jewish nurseries where a child found a Jewish environment and atmosphere, where he is reared in the Jewish spirit and under the supervision of devoted Jewish women.</p>
   <p>The Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery was founded four years ago. The pioneer <span class="page-break">3</span>workers did not find it easy to establish such an institution. It took a great deal of effort and hard work before this nursery was placed on a sound foundation, and much effort and hard work is still required to maintain it.</p>
   <p>At present the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery is taking care of eighty-one children from the age of three months to six years. Thirty-one of them are taken care of during the day, and the rest at night. The maintenance of the institution costs $1,600 a month. The building cost about $15,000.</p>
   <p>Four years ago, when the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery was first opened, the number of children was considerably smaller because the income did not permit the admission of large numbers. But with the increase in membership--at present the nursery has 2,500 members--the income also increased and so did the number of children admitted.</p>
   <p>In view of the increase in the number of children and the children waiting to be admitted, the present building has become too small. A larger place is <span class="page-break">4</span>required for all unfortunate children. Aware of its duties and responsibilities, the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery has begun an intensive drive to erect a large building, where every Jewish child who is in need of such an institution will find refuge.</p>
   <p>For this purpose the nursery has purchased a house and lot on the corner of 15th Street and Albany Avenue where the new building, which is expected to cost around $15,000, will be erected if--if Chicago Jewry will help the nursery to carry through its plans.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt but that the Jews of Chicago will understand and weigh the importance and the necessity of such a sacred enterprise and will respond generously to the call of the nursery and will help it carry through its great plan.</p>
   <p>A grand concert will be given Sunday, February 4, at the Medinah Temple in which the Union of Chicago Cantors under the direction of the famous composer, Mr. Leo Leov, will participate. Other famous musicians will also participate.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The entire proceeds of this concert will go to the nursery. Large numbers of Chicago Jews are expected to attend in order to make this affair a success.</p>
