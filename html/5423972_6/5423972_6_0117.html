   <p>A society known as the "Jewish Educational Alliance" has been created here recently. The chief duty of this organization is to assist the newly immigrated Jews in learning the English language, and acquaint them with the American customs, as well as their business methods and National politics, inasmuch as this will be possible to accomplish by this means. The point in view is to help them in adopting the American way of living, and to become desirable American citizens. Children and adults will share equally the benefits of this instruction. The old Marks Nathan Orphanage, at Bluecher and Wood Streets, will be transformed into an educational institution with the sole purpose of teaching Americanism to Jewish immigrants.</p>
   <p>A. S. Doe, vice-president of the Alliance, has announced that the plan for remodeling and modernizing of the building includes a gymnasium and a swimming pool. Thus, all the requirements for physical, mental, and moral education are taken care of. The operating expenses of this institution will be covered by contributions. The president of the new Jewish Educational Alliance is D. D. <span class="page-break">2</span>Koenigsberger. Mr. L. Siegel is the secretary, and Mr. Adolf Blonder is the treasurer. The remodeling of the building will begin immediately, upon completion of the new orphanage.</p>
