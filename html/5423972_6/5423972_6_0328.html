   <p>We always take pride in the fact that we, Jews, support learning, and that we especially support Jewish learning. The pride is well justified, for the Jewish people as such still clings to the old classical tradition, "Talmud Torah Kneged Kulom,"--the study of the Torah above everything--and to the present day, we do more to support learning than any other people. But still our investments in scholarly enterprises, in scholarly establishments and institutions of learning, are not very productive of results, because our work is not organized. We do not do the work systematically, we do not do it methodically, and it is, therefore, to a great extent wasted.</p>
   <p>When times are normal, we may or may not be justified in wasting our energies and in wasting our good moneys, but at present, when European Jewry is so much dependent on American Jewry, we have no right to waste one single cent, and we have to see to it that we get for a dollar a dollar's worth. We support many scholarly institutions in Eastern Europe, [and] we support many educational enterprises [in other places]. We come to the aid of institutions of learning, and we spend vast sums of money for educational scholarship in Eastern Europe, but the way we do it is simply disgraceful.</p>
   <p>Here is one illustration. Every principal Yeshivah in Eastern Europe sends a collector to Chicago to collect funds for the respective institutions. Of course, we do not know anything about the collections. We do not know anything about the donations; and we do not know whether all the moneys reach their destination. But even if all collectors for these institutions were very honest people, and transmit all the moneys they collect to the proper destination, we still waste a lot of money because without proper organization, without a proper system of collection, we do not know how much people give for these institutions, and in addition, the work is carried on with a maximum of expense. If Chicago Jewry gives ten thousand dollars per annum for the various Yeshivahs in Europe, then only fifty or sixty per cent of this sum will actually reach the Yeshivahs, because the collectors have to be paid for their work, and they are all working on a commission basis. In most cases, they deduct forty or fifty per cent, of the collections for themselves. We do not blame them for deducting that because they have to make a living, but we do blame the community for permitting such a state of affairs to exist. If this work of collecting money for the Yeshivahs abroad would be organized on a proper basis, the revenues could be doubled and the expense reduced to a minimum. If an individual collector approaches a Chicago Jew, with a view of getting some money for the Yeshivah, he may give fifty cents or he may give him five dollars, but if a local committee enjoying the confidence of the community would approach a Chicago Jew, he would have to give much more, and in many cases the committee could determine how much the donor ought to give. In this way the revenues could be doubled and trebled. Besides, an individual collector can only reach a limited number of donors, while a properly organized committee, enjoying the confidence of the community, could reach various Orthodox organizations, and all the Orthodox Jews in Chicago and cause them to contribute a minimum for these institutions. Even people of conservative judgment assert that Chicago Jewry would give from thirty to forty thousand dollars a year for Yeshivahs abroad, if the work would be properly organized, and these thirty or forty thousand dollars could be collected with a minimum of expense and a minimum of effort. At present all that collectors may get for the Yeshivahs is not more than ten or fifteen thousand dollars per annum, and only one half of this money reaches the Yeshivahs.</p>
   <p>We say that this state of affairs is simply a disgrace, and we say that we have no right to waste good Jewish money, given for such important institutions as the great Yeshivahs in Eastern Europe are. We maintain that a city committee consisting of Rabbis and laymen, could easily be organized for this purpose, and the committee could do away with all the waste and with all those collectors who are not trustworthy, and could treble and quadruple the donations for the Yeshivahs.</p>
   <p>Our institutions of learning abroad are very much dependent on our help, much more so than in days gone by. We have to make a supreme effort to help them to continue their activities. As a matter of fact, we are not doing anything in this direction. We are relying on the activities of the collectors, and these collectors cannot do very much, because without an organization they can only [reach] a limited number of people, and even if they should reach many people, half of the funds would be spent for collecting them, and the only sufferers are the thousands of diligent students in the Yeshivahs.</p>
   
   <p>We therefore urge that the leaders of the Orthodox community take this matter into consideration and give it immediate attention. All the great Yeshivahs in Lithuania are again organized, and the attendance is said to be as large as in the prewar days. Lithunian Jewry cannot support them, because it is reduced in numbers, and it has not yet recuperated from the war. Nor can Polish Jewry give very much for these institutions. But we can help them a great deal if we do our duty. We propose that a committee of ten or fifteen men, consisting of Rabbis and laymen, be at once appointed for the purpose of organizing the work of collecting the donations for the Yeshivahs. The committee to be appointed will have to decide whether all the collectors be placed under its control, and whether to use local collectors and discharge the old ones. But this is a matter of minor consideration. The main thing is that there exist such a committee, and that the committee stimulate, supervise, and control the work of collection.</p>
