   <p>The Seders conducted by the Shelter Home and Jewish Culture Group were indeed interesting. The Shelter Home was host to more than 150 people. The Seder was conducted in traditional manner and with the greatest enthusiasm. The Jewish Culture group started its Seder in the traditional manner but then branched off in a manner alien to us. However it was Judaism as they wish it and as such can be accepted.</p>
