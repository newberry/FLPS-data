   <p>The Isaiah Auxiliary Sabbath School, conducted under the auspices of the Hebrew Sabbath School Association of Chicago, will begin its activities for this year at the Chicago Hebrew Institute, 485 West Taylor Street, on Sunday morning, November 1, at 9 A. M.</p>
   <p>Instruction in Hebrew, Jewish history, and the principles of religion will be offered free of charge by a staff of competent teachers to all Jewish children. The system employed in teaching Hebrew is the modern conversational one. This system has been used in the school for the past two years with admirable success. The course in Jewish history includes a study of the Biblical and post-Biblical periods. An effort is made, when teaching the child Jewish history, to impress upon him the significance of the inspiring events which occurred during Israel's historical career, and to inculcate within him a feeling of reverence toward Jewish institutions. The principles of the Jewish religion are studied in connection with the study of history.</p>

   <p>The Hebrew Institute generously allows the Sabbath School to use its halls free of charge. Last year over three hundred children were accommodated at the old place on Blue Island Avenue. Owing to the spacious quarters at the new place, we are hoping that we shall be able to accommodate many more.</p>
   <p>A class is graduated every year; some of the brighter pupils are selected to assist the teachers. A healthy spirit of emulation prevails in the graduating classes, each pupil desiring to excel the others in order to be eligible as assistant teachers.</p>
   <p>Much of the success of the school is due to the financial support given by Isaiah Congregation, and to the deep interest and activity of Mr. Joseph S. Hartman, the president of the Hebrew Sabbath School Association.</p>
   <p>D. P. Pollack, superintendent.</p>
