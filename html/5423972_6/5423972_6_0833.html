   <p>The report of the officers of the Hebrew Sheltering Home showed great success last year. The annual meeting of the officers was held last night at Arkins Hall and quite a large number of members were present. They were all very enthusiastic about the activities and good work of the sheltering society. The president, Mr. Israel Wolfson, and the secretary, Mr. J. Twery, read their reports which showed last year's income to have been $4,148.00 and an expenditure of $3,850.00, so it has a balance on hand of nearly $300.00.</p>
   <p>In addition to the financial report the officers showed that they accommodated or sheltered 990 Jewish people during the past year. Each one of them was served three meals per day.</p>
