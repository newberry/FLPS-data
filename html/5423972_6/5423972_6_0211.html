   <p>The Hon. Simon Wolf, of Washington, visited the Jewish Training School last week, and was greatly pleased with the institution. To show his appreciation of the excellent word done under Prof. Bamberger's superintendence, Mr. Wolf will award, yearly, gold medals to the boy and girl who are most earnest and skilful. The gentleman has also donated to the school a valuable wall map issued by the government, and some books.</p>
