   <p>Edward Katzinger, the well-known business-man and philanthropist, will pay for the land which is needed to erect a summer home for the children of the Marks Nathan Orphan Home. Mr. Katzinger, who is now in Carlsbad [New Mexico], promised this to Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt, whom he met there. Mr. Rosenblatt informed Mr. Charles Herron, the president of the home, of this offer of Mr. Katzinger.</p>
   <p>Mr. Katzinger wants the summer home to bear the name of his late wife. He told Mr. Rosenblatt that the latter, Charles Herron, Louis C. Berger, Louis Cohen, and Harry Goldstein should together select a few acres of land, right near Lake Michigan. Mr. Katzinger expressed his hope that a few Chicago Jews would be willing to shoulder the cost of erecting the building.</p>
   <p>There will be a meeting of the board of directors of the Marks Nathan Home as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>soon as Mr. Rosenberg returns to Chicago. It is very likely that the children of the institution will spend their next summer vacation in their own home on the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>
