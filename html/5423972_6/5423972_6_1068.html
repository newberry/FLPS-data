   <p>Many of our congregations have also ladies' societies, whose special mission it is to work for the interest of the congregation by arranging strawberry festivals, fairs, hops, balls, etc., for the benefit of the temple. The ladies always have some tickets to sell, and have very sharp eyes to distinguish their sure victims from a whole crowd. But besides this, there are in this city some more ladies' societies, independent of the congregations. Of these, I will mention at present the "Sisters of Peace," "Sisters of Harmony," "Johannah Lodge of the Treuen Schwestern," and the "Young Ladies' Benevolent Society." Many a poor Jewish family blesses the names of these dear ladies.</p>
