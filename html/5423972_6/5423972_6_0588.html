   <p>I hear that the Board of Education of the United Jewish Charities has elected seven Orthodox representatives to the Board. These seven men represent the Orthodox community of Chicago. It is not officially known as yet who the seven men are, but unofficially it is known that all the seven are truly pious Jews and real representatives of the synagogue. They all observe the Sabbath, they are very active in the synagogues, and they know what Orthodoxy means. I do not know, not knowing who the seven men are, whether they know Hebrew, whether they are educated people, and whether they know something about education. Anyway, it is very nice on the part of the United [Jewish] Charities to elect to the Board of Education Jews about whose piety there is not the slightest doubt. The [United Jewish] Charities prove by this act that they actually want Orthodox representation on their Board of Education. This will help to create harmony and peace in the community. I do not <span class="page-break">2</span>know whether the Hebraists of the city will be satisfied with the choice of the United Jewish Charities. We will learn about it when the names of the seven men chosen will become officially known.</p>
