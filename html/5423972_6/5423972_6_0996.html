   <p>The directors of the United Hebrew Charities held a special meeting last Sunday afternoon and adopted a resolution, repudiating the alleged interviews which appeared in one of the dailies of this city. Reports of these interviews were sent out and have been commented on considerable. They quote the officers of the charities as saying that the society was unfavorably disposed to the location of Russian refugee Jews in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The resolution adpoted read as follows:</p>
   <p>"It having come to our knowledge that certain pretended interviews were published in one of the daily papers of Chicago, and thence copied into the press of the country generally, representing that the officers of the United Hebrew Charities declare that the interviews do not represent the sentiment or views of the gentlemen said to have uttered them, nor of the Board as a whole, that the figures on our books show that the United Hebrew Charities has, as always heretofore, taken charge, even contrary to the rules of the work, of such applicants as have come before it, whether recent arrivals or not."</p>
