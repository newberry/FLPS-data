   <p>The Young Men's Federated Jewish Charities was organized as a result of a meeting which was held last Thursday evening in the Lawndale Club. More than two hundred of the Chicago Jewish youth became members. The purpose of this new organization is to unite the Jewish youth in order to create a better understanding among themselves, and, to support the Federation by soliciting and procuring subscribers.</p>
   <p>Al. H. Rosenberg acted as chairman of the meeting, Dr. Jacob Lebosky, Dr. Israel Klein, and Dr. Herman S. Meyer spoke on the necessity of a united youth for such an important cause as the Federation, and it was decided that a meeting should be held Sunday, February 9, in the Lawndale Club, at which officers will be elected. Al. H. Rosenberg, Arthur N. Hurvitz, Louis F. Jacobson, and Herman A. Schiff arranged this meeting.</p>
