   <p>We have reason to believe that the much discussed plan of establishing a Jewish intellectual center in Chicago will soon be realized, for there are a few public-spirited men, cultured and educated Jews, who are ready to undertake to carry out the plan, even if they have to make personal sacrifices. They have come to realize that Jewish Chicago cannot remain forever an intellectual wilderness. Something concrete must be done to remedy the situation.</p>
   <p>In a week or so, an appeal of a group of enterprising Jewish intellectuals in Chicago will be issued to their colleagues in the city to help establish, or to join an organization, the object of which will be to further Jewish learning, to foster Jewish scholarship, to help Jewish enterprises, and to create an intellectual atmosphere in the community. There are in the city of Chicago from <span class="page-break">\2</span>two to three thousand Jewish university men and women. It is true that all of them are not intellectuals and cannot serve actively a Jewish intellectual center, but many of them can. And those who can help will be invited to join and become active.</p>
   <p>We do not expect that all those who are in a position to render services to such an organization, will join right away. Like every new organization, the Jewish intellectual center in Chicago will have to overcome many difficulties; but we are hopeful that in the end it will succeed and become a factor in Chicago Jewish life.</p>
   <p>A Jewish community like Chicago should not only have an intellectual center for purely social reasons, but it should have such a center to actually further and cultivate Jewish intellectual life. There is no reason why the Jewish intellectuals in Chicago should not bring out every year an almanac, written by Chicagoans and for Chicagoans. There is no reason why the Jewish intellectual center <span class="page-break">\3</span>in Chicago should not organize intellectual affairs on a grand style: such as public debates and discussions, lectures, etc. There is no reason why the Jewish intellectual center in Chicago should not help Jewish education in the city. In short, the tasks of the organization to be established are manifold, and there will be plenty more to do. But it is necessary to bring it into life by a few public-spirited men.</p>
   <p>It may be new to many of our readers that there are not only in Chicago a number of young Jewish fellows who, if encouraged, can render yeoman scholarship to the cause of Jewish learning, but there are also in the city of Chicago a number of artists, poets, musicians, sculptors, etc., who are not only able and promising men, but who are also imbued with a true Jewish spirit. At present they are scattered all over the city and seldom have an opportunity to meet, and have no opportunity at all to meet the Jews. An intellectual center, or whatever the name of the new organization may be, will give our young artists in Chicago an opportunity to meet, to talk things over, and to plan things artistically. This <span class="page-break">\4</span>being the case, it is obvious that the organization to be established can do a great many things. It can render active services in the community and be a glory of the community.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, hope that the appeal to be issued to the numerous Jewish intellectuals in Chicago will meet with a warm response, and that the new organization will start with at least one hundred. One of the conditions of the success of the new organization is that it serve its purpose only, and that only such men and women be admitted as can be called intellectuals. The new organization must not be corrupted by politics, must abstain from doing anything that may not be compatible with its programs and with its dignity. But we are confident that the men who are heading the new organization will be the best guarantee, and that it will be deserving of this name, and that Chicago Jewry will have an intellectual center of which it will have reason to be proud.</p>
