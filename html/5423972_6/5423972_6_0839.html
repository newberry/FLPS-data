   <p>To Consolidate Public Charity Funds.</p>
   <p>Plans have recently been worked out by the various charity organizations on the West Side, to consolidate all orthodox charity funds. The plan is to form one big organization such as a United Jewish Charity and to secure enough members to raise the sum of $150,000, to be distributed to the Jewish charity organizations according to their needs.</p>
   <p>Those who have studied this question are of the opinion that a much bigger sum than $150,000 will be raised for the orthodox Jewish charity. A new system of collections initiated will be installed, hence a much larger sum is expected.</p>
