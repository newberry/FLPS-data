   <p>The formal opening of the new $30,000 addition to the "Home for the Jewish Friendless and Working Girls" of Chicago, 53rd Street and Ellis Avenue, was attended by a reception, yesterday afternoon and evening, to the supporters and other friends of the institution. Corporation Counsel James Hamilton Lewis delivered the principal address.</p>
   <p>The inmates of the new home, boys and girls under fourteen years of age, now number two hundred. The home was founded by Mrs. Emma B. Mandel, and at first was on the North Side, but the necessity for larger quarters caused it to be moved. The heirs of B. Kuppenheimer donated money for the erection of the main part of the present building.</p>
