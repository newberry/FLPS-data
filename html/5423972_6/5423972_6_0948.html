   <p>An examination of the excellent tables prepared by our superintendent, Mr. Kiss, and his assistant, Mr. Klein, will show a decrease from last year of one-third in the cases assisted, or 2,972. This year's cases comprise 5,165 adults and 9,084 children; a total of 14,249 persons, but on account of the principle of giving inadequate amounts during the first few months of our work, the average expenditure in each case is larger than heretofore. The preponderance of $5 to $10 and $10 to $15 grants is to be regretted: it tells the tale of alms-giving.</p>
