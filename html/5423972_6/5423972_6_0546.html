   <p>The largest attendance at any of the annual meetings of the Jewish Charities of Chicago since its formation in 1923 was present at the Standard Club last Sunday, when more than 1,000 members were present. George Z. Medalie of New York was the guest speaker.</p>
   <p>In his annual report President Kline stressed the permanent work of the Charities, which is gradually veering to rehabilitation work whenever possible.</p>
   <p>There are more than 1,000 new contributors now on the rolls of the Charities than last year, and more than 2,500 than in 1932, he said. The spring drive of the Charities brought in $197,000 in money, which, however, did not fully balance the Charities' budget.</p>

   <p>A large part of Mr. Kline's report was devoted to the formation of the Community Council, which he stated has thus far produced notable results, and of which even greater activities are expected in the future.</p>
   <p>THE TREASURER'S REPORT.</p>
   <p>James H. Becker, in his treasurer's report, noted that $1,543,903.82 was received by the Charities, of which $682,000 came from the Emergency Welfare and Community Funds; $1,565,323.71 was paid out, leaving a deficit for the year of $21,419.89. Constituent organizations of the Charities spent during the year $2,509,000.00.</p>

   <p>In his annual report, the executive director, Samuel A. Goldsmith, gave a brief review of the work of the Charities during the past year. He noted that among the accomplishments were a budget of $1,620,000.00 with a deficit of only $20,000.00. He said that the Jewish community of Chicago, as shown by the charity rolls, was not as hard bit by the depression as the general community, that 5 per cent of the Jewish families in the city were on the relief rolls, as against a general average of 13 per cent. Mr. Goldsmith again emphasized the fact that it was the aim of the Charities, whenever possible, to establish suitable agencies for co-ordination in the various fields, and also to work for permanent rehabilitation.</p>

   <p>JEWISH EDUCATION.</p>
   <p>In discussing Jewish education, Mr. Goldsmith said that a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Charities was now investigating the whole matter, and gave as his personal opinion that Jewish education was one of the matters that should be supported by the Charities' budget. Leo F. Wormser, counsel for the Charities, took strong exception to Mr. Goldsmith's recommendation, saying that there should be no attempt to prejudge the work of the investigating committee. Answering Mr. Wormser, Judge Harry M. Fisher strongly defended the subvention of the Charities to the Board of Jewish Education, and said that the tragic example of Germany had made "mayafess" Jews an impossibility for Jewry.</p>

   <p>At this point, when the interchange threatened to become acrid, President Sol Kline closed the discussion by declaring a resolution carried that the remarks of both Mr. Wormser and Judge Fisher be expunged from the record.</p>
