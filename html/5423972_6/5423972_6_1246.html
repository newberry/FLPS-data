   <p>About six months ago, the Jewish Welfare Board negotiated with us in the interest of organizing a Chicago division under our direction. This work has grown tremendously during this time. The fact that we are a large Jewish center attracted quite a number of ex-service men as well as soldiers and sailors in the service. They authorized our appointment of a special representative whose business it is to visit the hospitals in the city as well as vicinity, and to look after the welfare of the Jewish boys who are the inmates. Regular visits to these hospitals are made by the representative, and every attention is given to make those who are in need of personal service as comfortable as possible.</p>
   <p>Among the institutions visited by the representative are the following: The Great Lakes Radio School; the Great Lakes Hospital; The Fort Sheridan Station; the Waukesha Hospital; the Speedway Hospital; the Forty-Seventh Street Hospital; the Jackson Park Hospital; the Marion; and Indiana Sanatorium.</p>
