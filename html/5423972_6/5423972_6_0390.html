   <p>The first Friday evening lecture at the Hebrew Institute last week, brought many compliments to the management of the institution. The success of the lecture was without doubt due to our popular Rabbi, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch of Sinai Temple.</p>
   <p>It is predicted, that the lecture tonight by Rabbi Dr. A. B. Yudelson will be equally successful, for Dr. Yudelson is an excellent speaker and a learned, highly cultured man.</p>
   <p>Of the forthcoming lectures, the one on the American youth, promises to be unusually interesting.</p>
