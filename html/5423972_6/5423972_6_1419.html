   <p>The Michael Reese Hospital is the most beautiful monument of the Jewish non-sectarian charitable institutions in Chicago. It has taken over two years to build new additions, to make more room for the sick, and it is now one of the largest and best hospitals in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In this hospital are found all modern devices for performing operations of various sorts, and all modern surgical instruments. Everything that science has discovered for the curing of diseases has been adopted to lighten the work of the physicians and nurses. The hospital contains a synagogue, with a scroll of the Law and a holy ark. From the 1st of July, the opening day of the hospital, to the 1st of October, 340 free patients were treated and spent 4912 days under the care of the hospital doctors. 179 patients paid only half of the expense of board, nurses, and medicine, while they were in bed, a total of 2231 days. 118 patients paid all hospital fees and were in the hospital 1758 days.</p>
