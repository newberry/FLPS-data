   <p>The Maccabee Club of Chicago, located at 2735 W. Division Street, Chicago, Illinois, celebrated the opening of their quarters with great enthusiasm and with the same spirit as the other Zionist organizations.</p>
   <p>The secretary-treasurer of the Jewish Junior Soccer League, Mr. Jack Rose, well-known in circles where soccer football is mentioned, was the toastmaster of the evening and very delightfully expressed his opinion about the newly formed association. The crowd, although the place was not large enough to accomodate everyone, reached the century mark, both male and female.</p>

   <p>The activities of the club were described and as a proof of their success in sport a beautiful, gorgeous cup offered by the Superior State Bank of Chicago decorated the immense table, which was loaded with refreshments of all kinds.</p>
   <p>In his opening address Mr. Jack Rose emphasized the ideas, ideals, and program to be followed by the Maccabee and still a great deal yet is to be accomplished. The seed has been planted, says Mr. I. Nechton, president, and the fruit is yet to grow. Over in Europe, we were unable to practice sports, always over the siddur and no body development, but today there is no one stopping us. Play in the open air, develop your muscles, and obtain a sound body and sound mind. This is the object of the Maccabee.</p>

   <p>Other members and visitors were called upon to address the audience and they wished this new enterprise lots of luck and success.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Millman, vice president, is responsible for the affair of the evening and organizer of the "Maccabee" made it known that Chicago is in need of an exclusive Jewish organized club in order to compete with international sports and the body formed by the Maccabee has the talent which needs development. The Jewish element in the city will be surprised to learn within the next few years, how necessary it was to have such a group.</p>
   <p>The Maccabee has no support whatsoever and needs it greatly. Pennies, nickels and dimes had been saved by members and put together, and that is how the Maccabee started, but today with the increase in membership, the accomplishment of greater purposes is well under way.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>This was the gist of Mr. A. Millman's address and turning back to the ladies he urged them to become a group of girl Maccabees and give us all the encouragement they have which we need greatly.</p>
   <p>The speeches were over then and the Hatikvoh was played.</p>
   <p>Refreshments were served and after these were all disposed of, the floors were cleared and the crowd danced to their hearts content.</p>
   <p>This is the beginning of a new era for the Maccabee of Chicago.</p>
