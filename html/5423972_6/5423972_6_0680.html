   <p>Do you know that Motele countrymen have begun a campaign to aid our unfortunate brothers and sisters across the sea. If you do not know of this, we call to your attention that last Sunday a massmeeting was held in the Motele Synagogue, 1227 Washburne Ave., where a campaign committee was elected to collect funds so that they may assist especially our brothers and sisters in Motele and its envirous.</p>
