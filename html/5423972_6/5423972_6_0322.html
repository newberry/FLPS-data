   <p>There must be in Chicago in the neighborhood of two hundred Jewish clubs, the membership of which is composed mostly of young people. In addition there are several Jewish social and literary clubs, like the Covenant Club, the Sheridan Park Club, the Northwest Side Fellowship Club, etc. Each and every one of these clubs has an intellectual advancement committee, the object of which is, as its name already says, to advance intellectuality among its members. The most interesting study in Chicago Jewry would be an enumeration of the subjects of the lectures arranged by the advancement committees of the various clubs.</p>
   <p>The most popular Jewish club in Chicago, the Covenant Club, is also anxious to advance knowledge among its members, and its intellectual advancement committee is doing the very best to attain its goal. The only question is, what is its very best? The intellectual advancement committee of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Covenant Club often invites celebrities of the day to address its members. The last celebrity to address them was Eddie Cantor, the famous comedian. Eddie Cantor is a very fine comedian and a successful showman, but we would like to find out what Eddie Cantor has to say to the members of such a famous Jewish Club as the Covenant Club is. Is Eddie Cantor a scholar, a philosopher, a writer, a famous pulpiteer, a historian, a literary critic, an art critic, or what? We do not know whether Mr. Cantor is not an educated man. As a rule the showmen and entertainers are not intellectuals and have little to say to people who crave for intellectuality. Mr. Eddie Cantor can entertain people, but he can certainly not "intellectualize" people.</p>
   <p>However, Mr. Eddie Cantor is not the only celebrity of the day who is often invited by the intellectual advancement committees of our more popular clubs to address the membership. To other successful showmen and show-women and to celebrities of the day similar invitations are extended. Can one consistently <span class="page-break">\3</span>maintain that the members of the clubs gain more knowledge and enrich their minds by listening to pleasant stories of such celebrities of the day? Where does intellectuality come in? The Covenant Club in Chicago is a center of Jewish activities and a great center of Jewish philanthropy. Its leaders are deeply interested in matters Jewish, and some of them are excellent and able communal workers and all are responsible people. The intellectual advancement committee of such a club should do better than arrange short matinees featuring celebrities of the day. There are plenty of men of letters, scholars, and artists in the city of Chicago who would gladly accept invitations to address the Covenant Club, but they may not be as popular as the showmen and show-women are, although they certainly have must more to say than the latter.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the Covenant Club is not the only Jewish club in Chicago guilty of such errors of judgment. Nearly every Jewish club in Chicago is pursuing the same policies. The lecturers addressing these clubs have very little to say on matters Jewish and have very little to say on matters in general. Their <span class="page-break">\4</span>only merit is that they are more or less popular in their own field of work. If the members of the various Jewish clubs in Chicago are craving for intellectuality and are really anxious to enlarge their stock of knowledge or to enrich their minds, then the intellectual advancement committees should live up to their tasks and not invite entertainers to address the membership, but men of mind and intellect. But if the members of the various clubs are all anxious to be entertained, then intellectual advancement committees should be done away with and be replaced by entertainment committees. Unfortunately, our middle classes in Chicago are not too educated and certainly not overeducated, and the activities of the intellectual advancement committees of the various Jewish clubs are only contributing to develop poor taste--and what is more, a contempt for real intellectuality. Men and women who consider a successful showman an embodiment of real fame cannot and will not appreciate the real intellectual or real artist.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>It is for this reason that the activities of the various intellectual committees of the various clubs are doing more harm than good. We suggest that the intellectual advancement committees of the Jewish clubs in the city of Chicago take the task more seriously, or they give it up altogether. At present all the intellectual advancement committees of the Jewish clubs in Chicago are one huge joke, and all are sailing under a false flag. They are all amusement committees or entertainment committees, but not intellectual advancement committees. An organization like the Covenant Club can set a good example by instructing the intellectual advancement committee to do real work. Then the other Jewish clubs, we are sure, will follow its example, and the membership of the various clubs will have an opportunity to listen to men and women who have something to say in this world, although they may not be as popular as the famous showmen are. We know of a Jewish club the intellectual advancement committee of which has invited a fire commissioner to address the club on the question of how to prevent fires, and we could name a list of funny subjects of lectures given to the various Jewish clubs in the city. If <span class="page-break">\6</span>we should judge the intellectual standard of the Jewish community in Chicago by the lecturers and lectures delivered before the various Jewish clubs, we would be compelled to admit that the intellectual standard of the community is below par. Even if it is below par, must we admit it in this way, and must we exhibit our ignorance and our tastelessness? We do not believe, however, that it is below par. Although it is true that our middle classes in the city of Chicago are by no means overeducated, the intellectual level of the Chicago Jewish community is not below that of any other Jewish community in the States, and this being the case, it is not necessary to give the appearance that the intellectual standard of the community is below that of other communities in the States.</p>
   <p>We urge that the various Jewish clubs in Chicago instruct their intellectual committees to do real work, and if they are unable to do it because they are not fit for the job intellectually, that they be replaced by other committees or that they be abolished altogether, because a Jewish community like Chicago has no right to make a laughing stock out of itself.</p>
