   <p>A joint meeting of the ladies of the Jewish Training School of Chicago and of a large number of our best Jewish citizens and the committee of the Leon Mandel Gift of $20,000 for a Training School, met on Tuesday evening last, to hear the report of the committee heretofore appointed to present a plan for a common organization. Mr. Joseph Spiegel presided and Mr. Martin Bache acted as secretary. The committee reported as follows:</p>
   <p>That we adopt the present charter of the Jewish Training School and work under it.</p>
   <p>That its board of directors consist of eight ladies and eight gentlemen.</p>
   <p>That the president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer be elected by the association from the members of said directors at their meeting.</p>
   <p>That the objective shall be to maintain a training school for boys and girls under eighteen years of age - 1. To maintain a kindergarten; 2. Girls' serving and kitchen garden; 3. Manual training and trade school.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Said directors to have power to acquire by purchase or otherwise suitable property for that object.</p>
   <p>Membership. - Membership shall consist of three classes: General members paying $4.00 and upwards annually; patron members $125.00 and upwards annually; life members $500.00 and upwards annually, the amount already subscribed to be deducted from said $500.00</p>
   <p>Each of these resolutions was adopted. It will be remembered that the Ladies' Industrial School was organized some six years since; in 1886 a new charter was obtained under the title of The Jewish Training School of Chicago, and the organization will continue using, most likely, the same name.</p>
