   <p>For the past two years the Board of the U. H. C. have stressed the necessity of a new hospital. The R.A. also has tried to impress upon the community the absolute need of a new building to replace the present inadequate one. Dr. Hirsch has pleaded many times for funds for the erection of a new and modern building, and at last the project is assured.</p>
   <p>In December of last year, the Board of the U.H.C. met jointly with the Board of the A.J.C. and as a result it was resolved that the president of the U.H.C.H.F. Hahn, be authorized to appoint a committee of seven. This committee would be composed of three members from the Board of the U.H.C. and four from the Community-at-large. Mr. Hahn appointed Moses Born, M.E. Greenebaum, and Bernhard Rosenberg to represent the Board. Leon Mandel, W.N. Eisendrath, Harry Hart, and Julius Rosenwald were to represent the community. This committee met and organized with Leon Mandel as Chairman and W. N. Eisendrath as Secretary.</p>
   <p>At the second meeting of the Committee, it was decided that subscriptions should be solicited for the purpose of securing sufficient funds. As an incentive, $35,000. was subscribed among themselves. The subscription-work has only been in progress for two weeks and the sum of $300,000 is already promised.</p>
   <p>A modern institution to conform with the plans of the committee will require $50,000. to equip and furnish.</p>
   <p>After years of preaching,pleading and entreaty, we are to have at last a new and modern hospital.Chicago may well be proud of the liberality of her citizens.</p>
