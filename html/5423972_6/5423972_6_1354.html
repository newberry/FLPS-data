   <p>An institution for the care of the consumptive-poor will soon be built on a tract of land which the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society has just purchased for $10,000. It is pleasant to construct an administration building first at a cost of $15,000, and several shacks which will cost between $2,000 and $3,000 each. David Saul Klafter, the Architect, is at work on the place.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Association are: President, Mrs. I.J. Robins; Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. L.C. Barnett; and Treasurer, Mrs. Abraham Margolis.</p>
