   <p>The Council of Jewish Women was not the only accomplishment of Mrs. Hannah G. Solomon. She is also the founder of the Bureau of Personal Service. She conceived the idea of such an agency during the dark days of the winter of 1893, and 1894, when, as chairman of a committee of the Chicago Women's Club, she was in charge of an emergency work-room. Here she came in contact with real conditions, with suffering victims of the post- Exposition depression.</p>
