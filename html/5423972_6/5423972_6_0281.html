   <p>Lectures by prominent men on important topics of the day, as well as consecutive lecture courses on specific subjects have been given at the Institute almost from the beginning of its establishment. The Institute's very organization was due to the desire on the part of the founders to supplement their own education and that of the community by adult lecture and educational programs. This, at least in part if not in whole, was the motive that impelled them to make the sacrifice towards the organization of the Institute.</p>
   <p>When Clarence Darrow opened this year's Forum, all who knew the history of the Institute were reminded of the fact that he was one of the first speakers that addressed our audience in the early days. Nevertheless, it would be an error to assume that the character of our lecture program is the same now as it was in the first part of our operation. This, not so much, perhaps, from the point of view of the prominence of our speakers, or our <span class="page-break">2</span>attendance records, or the extent of our program, as from the point of view of the difference in the development and application of the program. The Forum idea, as developed within recent years, has definite merit along a number of lines. In the classroom, the teacher presents a definite course of study to his students and rationalizes his material, demanding a reaction from his pupils in the sense that an examination, and a certain amount of theme and home work is required for credit. The Forum lecturer relieves his hearer from all these responsibilities of a technical nature. He demands only one - that of thinking.</p>
   <p>There can be no question but that a systematic education for adults who have not had the opportunity of obtaining one before reaching maturity is highly desirable. An adult's education is not finished upon his completion of a regular course, either in secondary schools or even at the university. There is, besides a large number of men and women who have not had the benefit of a regular education and who, nevertheless, are anxious to receive supplementary knowledge to that which they have obtained in the <span class="page-break">3</span>making of their lives. The Forum, disjointed and unorganized as it may superficially seem to be, is, nevertheless, able to make a definite contribution to their education. In the first place, there is an emotional power for achievement developed by the speaker in the listener, which is very often lacking in the classroom. In the latter, one studies with the ultimate aim of finishing a course and also without direct contact to life. In the Forum, one is immediately directed to the problem of relating the facts presented, to one's own life. In our own Forum, with the opportunity that we offer for discussion on the part of the audience, there is a definite challenge made, both to the audience and the speaker. As a prominent lecturer once put it, "The discussion compels the speaker to rethink his position; simultaneously the speaker compels every member of the audience to rethink his position with reference to the problem presented. The lecturer is made more responsible by the discussion that he knows will follow, and very often also brings out in his answers such points as he may have failed to stress in his original address."</p>

   <p>He thus contributes definitely to the thought development of many who come to hear him. It must not be forgotten that the Forum stresses the major facts and movements of life: That the speaker is not, as is usual with the teacher, a more or less ordinary person, but in many instances an extraordinary individuality, and so because of the influence and because of the impact of his personality, he is able to give a momentum to the members of his audience which they could not possibly obtain in the classroom.</p>
