   <p>Forty-two trades and professions have been organized by the trades and professions division of the Community Council of the Jewish Charities of Chicago, according to a report recently issued by Lawrence Greenebaum, chairman of the trades division. Meetings of the various divisions are being held constantly.</p>
   <p>"We have been at it for the past three months," said Mr. Greenebaum. "In appointing the various committees which will represent the trades and professional division of the Community Council. Each committee is headed by a chairman who has affiliated with him a number of representative individuals in his particular trade. The personnel <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the committees organized to date exceeds 400. We hope to have a total of more than 600 representatives, in the trades and professions division within the next month. Our purpose is to conduct a program of enlightenment and education regarding the work of the Jewish Charities of Chicago so that we may urge every Jewish person in our community who is not affiliated, and bring about his affiliation.</p>
   <p>"The demands upon our hospitals, orphanages, old people's homes, our social service bureau and the many other agencies of social welfare affiliated with the Jewish Charities of Chicago have been tremendous. The support of these institutions is more necessary now than ever before. We are confident that with a large body of representatives in every trade and profession we should be able to present this message to the Jews of Chicago who are as yet un-affiliated with the Jewish Charities <span class="page-break">\3</span>and thereby spread the base of support of our charities to a point which will assure greater perpetuity."</p>
   <p>Membership in the Community Council now exceeds 700, according to a report rendered by A. Epstein, chairman of the membership committee. There are no dues or fees of any kind. The purpose of the Council is solely educational, and luncheon meetings will be held at intervals of about one month. Speakers of national and international repute are being sought to address the Council on subjects of economic, philanthropic, and sociological importance.</p>
