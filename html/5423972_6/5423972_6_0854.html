   <p>The Organization Hachnosas Orchim, (Shelter Home) announces that a committee will be at its offices constantly to accept applications of those who are unable to buy Passover necessities. In previous years the organization accepted as valid all Applications made to them. Last year the organization aided 250 families. Because of the expense involved we will find it necessary to investigate applications to determine their validity. No valid Application will be rejected. The committee may be approached every evening from now to Passover from six to nine P.M.
