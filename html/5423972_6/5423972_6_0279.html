   <p>The Five-O'clock Jewish Forum, which has been an institution since the building was opened, and which is now in its third season, is proving a great success in the interest that people exhibit in both their coming to hear the speaker and in their discussion following the talk.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday afternoon, Rabbi Felix S. Mendelsohn, who last year gave a very interesting talk on "Jewish Humor," that made all the people not only laugh, but think, will this year address the meeting on "The Present Status of Palestine." This is a second discussion of practically the same topic as was given last Sunday, but by different men. We think the topic is big enough and important enough to merit that treatment and the individual being different, his approach and discussion must be different, to an extent at least.</p>
   <p>Dr. Mendelsohn is a very fine speaker and all who are going to come should make it their business to come early to assure themselves a place in the hall, for it is always crowded by five o'clock when the speaker starts. There is no admission charge and everyone is welcome who comes early.</p>
