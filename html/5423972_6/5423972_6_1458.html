   <p>As we have informed our readers some time ago, we will soon have a new Jewish hospital in this city. The sums which have been appropiated for that purpose by the Reese heirs of this city are $50,000, by Mrs. Henrietta Rosenfeld and Mr. Jacob Rosenberg, and $30,000 by Messrs. Joseph and Henry Frank.</p>
   <p>The hospital fund of the U. H. R. A. amounts, besides this, to $12,000 and a plot of ground on N. La Salle St. Thus the sum of $192,000 is on hand for this, so greatly needed, benevolent institution.</p>
