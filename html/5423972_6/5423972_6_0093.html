   <p>Jewish mothers and all Jews will be interested in a Jewish training school for their daughters. There was a time when we felt that our Jewish girls did not need a Jewish education--that Jewish girls did not necessarily have to know anything about Judaism.</p>
   <p>Times have changed, however; and that idea is ancient history now. It is universally acknowledged that the training of children lies in the mothers' hands. It is, therefore, of the greatest importance for the future of our nation that the girls, the future mothers, should get the very best training possible.</p>
   <p>In order to give our Jewish daughters a proper Jewish training, the Chicago Association of Jewish Women has opened religious schools for girls. One of these schools is located in the Talmud Torah, 1253 Waller Street. A Mother's Day program is scheduled for Sunday afternoon at the Talmud Torah. All <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Jewish mothers are invited to come and to acquaint themselves with the work of the training school. Rabbi N. J. Budzinsky will address the mothers. The girls are planning an interesting program for this occasion. They will speak and sing in the Hebrew language. The subject of their speeches will be the meaning of Judaism and Jewish history. A reception for the mothers will follow.</p>
   <p>Although the girl's school is quite young, it has been attended by many pupils. The Association proposes to show on this Mother's Day celebration the importance of giving Jewish daughters a Jewish training school, and the necessity of establishing such training schools in all parts of the city so that all Jewish children could take advantage of this opportunity. The classes are held every Sunday. There are four different classes taught by very competent and experienced teachers. All activities in the training school are supervised by the well-known Jewish welfare worker, Miss Rose Bloom.</p>
