   <p>"Dear Sir: I beg leave to report to you the proceedings of the meeting held on Sunday June 16 on Milwaukee Avenue as announced in your able paper. This meeting was called for the purpose of organizing a school association. A fair proportion of the subscribers responded. Reverends Adler, Gerson, and Ollendorf were also present by special invitation.</p>
   <p>"The following were elected officers, pro tempore: Isidor Brother, president; A. Pike, secretary; and Joseph Leske, treasurer. Reverend Adler was called upon to address the assembly. He responded to the call heartily. Reverend Ollendorf followed him with a few able remarks. Both of these gentlemen spoke <span class="page-break">2</span>in the German language. Reverend Gerson then followed, delivering a very able address in the English language.</p>
   <p>"On motion, a committee of five was appointed to draft resolutions and by-laws and lay the same before the association at its next meeting for adoption, and to issue a special call to all the subscribers that at the next general meeting we intend to organize ourselves and elect permanent officers.</p>
   <p>"Yours,</p>
   <p>"A. Pike."</p>
