   <p>Libowitz Synagogue on Maxwell St. and Newberry Av. is having a benefit. This benefit is not intended for the synagogue but for the exclusive use of the "Bread for the Hungry Society."</p>
   <p>We hope that no Jew here in Chicago will fail to respond to this charity undertaking. You can now avail yourself of the opportunity of hearing Cantor Slossberg chant the "Halel" (Hallelujah) services. By so doing you will help the hungry with bread and the other poor with similar necessities. But you must hurry and get your tickets for this worthy benefit, as we are not selling any more tickets then we have seats. You can obtain tickets from the society and synagogue at all times. Both offices are open every day.</p>
   <p>Very Respectfully</p>
   <p>"The Bread for the Hungry Society."</p>
