   <p>Reuben Rosenberg died last week at his home. He came to Chicago in 1880, from Yurbereck, Russia, entering the metal business, in which business he was engaged until the time of his death.</p>
   <p>When the Lawndale District began to be populated with Jews, Mr. Rosenberg set out to build a synagogue which was needed very much. After considerable difficulty and great sacrifice the Congregation Shaara Torah was built.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenberg was president of Congregation Shaara Torah for a number of years, as well as superintendent of the Gomaley Chesed Shel Emes free burial society, donating a great deal of his time and money to both institutions.</p>
