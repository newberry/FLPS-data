   <p>At 6 o'clock last Friday evening (8-22-84), the Northside Hebrew Congregations dedicated their new temple. The temple is situated on the northeast corner of Rush Street and Walton Place. The edifice is built of white stone and the architecture is in the Gothic style. A few broad stairs lead to the front entrance of the temple. The interior of the temple is very plain but pleasant. There are no loud colors, no red paint and no gold stripes which make some of our temples look like butcher shops or theatres. An elegant carpet of a bright pattern covers the floor, the seats are of polished cherry-wood and oron ha kodesh (The Holy Arc of the Covenant), and the pulpit of black walnut.</p>
