   <p>The North West Young Women's Hebrew Association plans to do three or four times the work that was done last year. This young rapidly growing organization plans to realize this year their aim of building a Jewish Community Center on the North West side, which is a long felt need in that part of Chicago. This entire district has not now one suitable gathering place. The proceeds of their big program for their annual dance at the Parkway Hotel on December tenth and of their other social affairs have swelled their Building Fund considerably. A centrally located Community Center for the Jewish population of the North West side is much needed, and will be welcomed enthusiastically.</p>
