   <p>Henry Greenebaun was the first president and Joseph Frank the first secretary of the Concordia Club. This Jewish organization fostered patriotism in the hearts of its members during the war, and cultivated a public spirit among them. With the assistance of the Jewish non-members, it raised a company of volunteers for service. The company was sworn in and after electing Jacob La Salle, captain, and M. Frank, lieutenant, marched from the club to the railroad depot where they entrained for Camp Butler, near Springfield. There the company was incorporated in the 82nd Illinois with Fred Hecker as colonel. Col. Hecker was later succeeded by Col. Ed. S. Solomon.</p>
   <p>The Concordia Club also aided materially in the raising of the funds for the establishment of the first Jewish hospital in Chicago.</p>
