   <p>Dr. Emil G. Hirsch put on the carpet the officers and rabbi of the Congregation Anshe Emeth in the last edition of the Reform Advocate.</p>
   <p>It shows that the officers of the Congregation, wanting to raise a fund for a new synagogue, determined to sponsor a bazaar and ball. In order to increase their income they sent tickets to all political candidates accompanied with a letter in which they state that the Anshe Emeth Congregation is the oldest and largest synagogue on the North and Northwest Sides, and is supported by the Sisters of the True Charity Society, Menorah Literary Society, and The Young Peoples Auxiliary. Therefore, the politicians are invited to attend the bazaar and buy tickets, because "your candidature will immensely benefit by your presence there" as the people that will participate <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will consist of such a cosmopolitan class of voters that they can not be available through other means.</p>
   <p>The letter further states and assures the candidates "that our united efforts will be used to support you in the coming election," and it ends with a "promise" that "at our last meeting it was determined that a list of the names of all candidates, who will submit a prize, (money), shall be placed on our souvenir program and, in addition to this, the list of names will be mentioned in our synagogue by our rabbi, during the holidays.</p>
   <p>A copy of this "beautiful letter" was sent to the honored rabbi of Sinai Temple. It is not surprising that his blood began to boil and that he assailed such a congregation and such a rabbi in the Reform Advocate.</p>

   <p>Dr. Hirsch says:</p>
   <p>"Silence on our part in such a case would imply an approval for the condemned wisdom and for the writers of this letter who have taken a liberty which can not be for given by the good name of the Jewish religion.</p>
   <p>"They imperiled the reputation of every Jewish voter in this or in other Jewish congregations. They committed a horribly degrading act and a great sin, which is one of the sins that the Day of Atonement will not forgive.</p>

   <p>"The candidates, whose names will not appear on the list, will be recommended for the voters who do not want to sell their own vote, and do not want to sell someone else's vote."</p>
   <p>In conclusion Rabbi Hirsch says, "our synagogues were built in the past without humiliating the cause which they have in view. A congregation that can not build a new synagogue without such methods should dissolve. A 'rabbi,' who becomes a collector under such conditions as is enumerated in the circular, has, speaking mildly, peculiar ideas of the respectibility of his position, and the honor and teachings he pretends to preach."</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The rabbi of Sinai Temple is worthy of being congratulated by every righteous Jew for assailing the Congregation Anshe Emeth, although we do not approve of such attacks where they are addressed in English and given to the general press.</p>
   <p>The Daily Jewish Courier, does not become exhausted from time to time, to call the Jewish people's attention to the dissoluteness and irresponsibility of our leaders who sell the honor of their race for a pot of lentils.</p>
   <p>We do not believe the Catholic, or other Christian congregations on the North and Northwest Sides have distributed, at any time, such circulars.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch's present opposition to these disgraceful methods of raising money for religious and social purposes is very appropriate, because the election season is now taking place and many of our institutions are sponsoring various undertakings.</p>
