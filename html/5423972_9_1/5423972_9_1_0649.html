   <p>Synagogue presidents are surely honest Jews, fine and wise men, otherwise they would not be synagogue presidents. I, personally, as a law-abiding citizen have the greatest respect for the synagogue presidents--men who devote their time, money, and energy to public affairs. However, those synagogue presidents would be finer people if they did not have the nature of women--to talk a great deal--and from the pulpit at that.</p>
   <p>A rabbi should speak but the president should act. When the president undertakes the job of talking from the pulpit and neglects his own job of acting, then the rabbi has to do the president's job. It is a sad state of affairs when the rabbi has to act because the president has usurped his job.</p>
   <p>Translated into the language of journalism, the rabbi is the editor and the <span class="page-break">2</span>president is the manager of the business department. Imagine the effect upon a newspaper if the editor and manager would swap jobs--the editor would do the managing and the manager would write and edit the newspaper.</p>
   <p>A rabbi, even if he is not by nature a great speaker, always has something interesting to say: an interpretation of a passage from the Bible, a Talmudic quotation, a fine comparison between ideas or people, and so on. A president, even if he is a great scholar, has, at the best, no more to say than the rabbi. The president is not, in most cases, a great scholar and, therefore, he has nothing of importance to say. The president should and does have the right to make an announcement. If he has any respect for his own position, if he has any respect for his synagogue and for his rabbi, he will not seek to usurp the rabbi's place, and to deliver speeches from the pulpit because delivering speeches is not his business and it is a slight to the prestige of the rabbi, to the prestige of the synagogue.</p>

   <p>What I have just written is based upon the assumption that the president is at home in his knowledge of Yiddish grammar. However, it sometimes happens that the [synagogue] president is conducting a constant battle with grammar; he does not know how to begin or end a sentence. In such cases he delivers an illiterate speech and speaks as if he, himself, did not know what he wanted to say; his listeners, of course, have no idea of what he is driving at. A speech like that from the pulpit is a profanation of the Holy Name, because it arouses disrespect to the synagogue and to its representatives.</p>
   <p>I have decided, the facts being what they are, to petition Mr. Joseph Weil, the chief of our community, the president of the Association of Synagogue Presidents, to request the synagogue presidents of Chicago to stop delivering speeches from the pulpit and to let the rabbis speak. This will be best for everybody concerned.</p>
