   <p>Congregation Shaarei Thora Anshei Maarov, Sawyer Avenue and 13th Street, was destroyed by fire yesterday. Seven Torahs were saved, but sixteen of the twenty-one volumes of the Talmud housed in the synagogue, were burned. The children of the Talmud Torah located nearby tried until late at night to salvage some of the volumes of the Talmud which were scattered among heaps of burned wood, stones, bricks, and mud. The fire broke out about 1 P. M., and within fifteen minutes, only the four walls of the synagogue remained standing. The fire was put out by the firemen who arrived immediately and began pouring water from their apparatus.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the efforts of I. Becker, owner of a dry goods store at 1300 South Kedzie Avenue, Joe Rubinstein, owner of a delicatessen store two doors away, and the painter Eisenberg, the Torahs were saved from destruction. When the alarm was given in the neighborhood that the synagogue was burning, Mr. Becker was first to appear [on the scene] to rescue the holy scrolls. The <span class="page-break">\2</span>others joined him and all of them attempted to enter the synagogue but were prevented from doing so by the firemen. After a moment of hesitation, they told the firemen that the synagogue carried no insurance and a path was made for them at once. Smoke and flames leaped fiercely from all sides. The heroic rescuers marched forward to the holy ark.</p>
   <p>The holy ark was locked and in their haste they tore the Parokheth (curtain of the holy ark), broke open the doors, and, although it was extremely dangerous the scrolls of the Torah were taken out, one by one, and deposited with Mr. Soroka who lives nearby. They also rescued five Talmudic volumes.</p>
   <p>When the firemen had completed their work, the synagogue was a wreck, the holy ark was broken into pieces, sixteen Talmudi volumes were burned and trampled upon, the condelabras were destroyed; the platform, benches, tables and the steps to the women's gallery and the gallery proper were burned beyond repair. The windows were also broken.</p>

   <p>A large throng gathered around the synagogue and mourned its loss. The members of the congregation, and especially Rabbi A. Cardon, felt this loss more deeply than the rest.</p>
   <p>When Rabbi Cardon approached the ruins he wept bitterly. His first question was, "What has become of the holy scrolls of the Torah?" When he was told that the holy scrolls were safe, he calmed down a little, and then began to assist the children of the Talmud Torah who were collecting the torn pages of the Talmudic volumes.</p>
   <p>"The Congregation Shaarei Thora Anshei Maarov will hold its Passover services in its Talmud Torah nearby, but it will not be long" declared President Rosenberg to a reporter of the Courier, "before we will have a new synagogue." Rabbi Cardon expressed the hope that each of his 150 members would lend a helping hand.</p>
   <p>The Congregation Shaarei Thora Anshei Maarov was built ten years ago. It was the first synagogue in the neighborhood; it was also the first to erect a Talmud Torah for Jewish children there, and it was among the first synagogues <span class="page-break">\4</span>in Chicago to contribute large sums [of money] for charity.</p>
   <p>The synagogue was built at a cost of forty thousand dollars. It was insured for only ten thousand dollars. It is thought that the fire was caused by defective electrical wires. No candles or lamps were lit yesterday.</p>
