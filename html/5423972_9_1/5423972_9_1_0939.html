   <p>A meeting was held yesterday evening in the Hebrew School, at Waller Street, by the Chicago rabbis, to consider what steps can be taken in order to prevent the sales of unkosher meat for kosher meat, provided by the State Food Commission.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Zevin acted as chairman, and Rabbi Epstein was secretary. Rabbi Silber read a letter from the Illinois Food Commission, in which they declare what they will accept as the standard of kosher meat. The question was discussed by all rabbis, and it was determined to appoint a committee to organize the Rabbinate so that it may be officially connected with the State Food Commission.</p>
   <p>It was also determined to provide an official sanction to designate all kosher meats and to see that this sanction shall be recognized by the State Food Commission, in order to prevent any designation on unkosher meat.</p>
