   <p>At the annual meeting of the Chicago branch, some time ago, President Bernstein, of the national body, pointed out that during the last year $3,600,000 were sent to European Jews, through the Hias, thus saving American Jews $600,000 that it would have cost them had they sent their money to Europe through some other channels.</p>
   <p>In his annual report, Adolph Copeland, president of the Chicago Hias, showed that during the last year, the work of the local organization was very successful. Over 16,000 individual cases were given careful and diligent attention and hundreds of immigrants were met at the stations and told how and where to proceed. Over 6,000 affidavits were filled and sent to Europe, from Ellis Island and hundreds of men were helped to fill out their citizenship papers. 14,000 people were given food and sleeping quarters in the Jewish sheltering homes and $159,000 were sent to relatives of immigrants, in Europe, through the Hias.</p>
   <p>In the name of the board of directors, gifts were given to President Copeland, Mrs. Copeland, and Mr. Morris Taver, chairman of the House Committee, in appreciation of their work for this branch.</p>
