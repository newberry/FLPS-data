   <p>You are angry at me because I am not courteous enough to my opponents, to your opponents, to the Generation of the Wilderness. You are angry at me because I can distinguish between Ephraim and Judah and because I confer upon Ephraim the title he deserves. You say that that is not becoming to a modern person living in a modern age. You say that today one should even be courteous to one's opponent; that one should pat him on the back and tell him that he is a good fellow; that one should open one's doors to the disrupters and tell them all to enter. We are all Jews and we should all work together for our liberation.</p>
   <p>If you were sincere, you would know that in the first place, the doors are not closed and anyone who wants to, can enter. If an individual does not enter, <span class="page-break">\2</span>[it is because] he does not wish to do so; and if he is determined not to enter, then no invitations will help because he will not accept your invitation and you will only come to grief.</p>
   <p>Our opponents are bitter fanatics. Just as there are Jews who are ready to sacrifice themselves for their people, so there are Jews who are ready to do everything they possibly can to injure the interests of our people because they are the descendants of the Generation of the Wilderness....they are the internal enemies. Only morons would propose that we should be courteous to our internal enemies. Other nations that have much more political experience than we, treat their internal enemies much worse than their external foes, because the external foes constitute a danger only in time of war, whereas the internal foe is a constant menace to the existence of a people. Consequently, if you were conscientious Jews, you would not propose that we be courteous to our internal enemies.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>If you were sincere people, you would demand a definite statement from every Jew who is willing to join our ranks, and this statement ought to read: "I believe in everything that is Jewish. I am willing to sacrifice for everything that is Jewish, and I shall do nothing that might harm the interests of our people."</p>
   <p>We have, however, in our own midst people who carry on a double bookkeeping system. They go to the Temple and in the Temple they hear nothing about Zion and Jerusalem because the Temple is dedicated to the struggle against Zion and Jerusalem, and when they leave the Temple, they shout: "Zion and Jerusalem". When are these Jews acting as liars and hypocrites--when they are in the Temple or when they leave the Temple?</p>
   <p>One thing is certain: they are liars, and we cannot rely upon liars. Liars cannot assist in building the Jewish land and restoring [the homeland of] the Jewish people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Among us there are Jews who approved of the ban on Hebrew in the Temples, and who also conduct Hebrew schools where the children are taught Hebrew. Hebrew is taboo in the temples, although it is embraced and exalted in the Hebrew school. There people are hypocrites and liars. But the question is whether they are hypocrites in the Hebrew school or in the Temple.</p>
   <p>The teachers of Reform Judaism in America, Wise, Silver, Heller, Meyer, et al, are in our midst. What is more, the younger generation of Reform rabbis is more or less sympathetic to Zionism. Yet, Reform Judaism is a barrier against Zionism. Why? A Zionism that has two truths, one within the Temple, the other outside the Temple, cannot be productive. Zion....the final word of the righteous Prophets, is not compatible with falsehood and hypocrisy. A Zionism that is saturated with falsehood is meaningless. Even if all the Reform rabbis in America were to become Zionists today, and even if all the Reform Temples were to join the Zionist organization today, Reform Judaism would still remain <span class="page-break">\5</span>a dead branch on the living tree of Zionism because we cannot serve God and Baal at one and the same time.</p>
   <p>This, however, is not important now. The important question is our relationship to the worshipers of Baal, who wish to serve an idol rather than God. You say it is our duty to be courteous. I would like to know where you morons derive your Jewish inspiration. I derive my Jewish inspiration from the Bible, and when I read the Bible, I find that the greatest representatives of our people were not at all courteous to the worshipers of Baal. Did any of the righteous Prophets pat the prophets of Baal on the backs and say unto them: "Welcome, my brothers"? Did any of the righteous prophets show courtesy to Ephraim, to the assimilators and idol worshipers? Were the sages of the Talmud, the Prophets, the great Jewish leaders of history, courteous to the sinners and the rebels?</p>
   <p>I challenge you to quote one passage from the Bible, or the Talmud, or any <span class="page-break">\6</span>later Hebrew literature, which tells us to be courteous to sinners and rebels. Or do you believe that a Jew, who has effaced Zion and Jerusalem from his prayer book and removed the mezuzah from his door, is not a rebel and traitor?</p>
   <p>You say that we should stop fighting and make peace with our enemies, i. e., with the internal enemies of our people. Have you ever heard of a nation at war, which was surrounded on all sides by enemies, making peace with its internal enemy, as long as he remained an enemy? A nation which does that, must perish because the internal enemy will help the external enemy against the nation.</p>
   <p>You shout: "Open your gates". In the first place, they are not closed. In the second place, they should be closed because there are too many people in our camp who use a double bookkeeping system. We need only people who believe in one God, one people, one land, one Torah, one language. We don't need <span class="page-break">\7</span>people with dual personalities.</p>
   <p>It would be the greatest misfortune for Zionism if all the worshipers of Baal, all the Reform Jews, assimilators, and betrayers would suddenly join the Zionist Organization and swell our ranks, because they would kill Zionism from within; they would bring into Zionism the spirit of corruption and assimilation. The result would be the extinction of the whole movement.</p>
   <p>Since, however, you are thoughtless morons, you do not believe in any serious consequences. Instead you shout: "Let us be courteous". To whom shall we be courteous? Shall we be courteous to the internal enemy who stands upon the blood of his brother? Are you not morons?</p>
