   <p>The nationalistically minded and religious Jews will be happy to learn that the youth organization, Society of Sons and Daughters of Israel Mizrachi, has finally purchased its own institute at 1113 Ashland Boulevard, thereby insuring its permanent existence.</p>
   <p>The plight of the native-born Jewish children, who have grown up and have been reared far from Jews and Judaism, is tragic. Had their whole environment been non-Jewish to begin with, had the parents themselves lived under different conditions, had they been better assimilated into the life of the community, had the children been adjusted to their immediate surroundings and thereby estranged from Jewish national life, then at least they would be closer to the American mode of living. But the father, who wants to be known to the outside world as an American, conducts himself at home in the same manner as he did in the old country.</p>
   <p>The child, who has been brought up with no systematic Jewish education, has, <span class="page-break">2</span>nevertheless, noticed that his dad's conduct and way of life differ from that of his Gentile friend's father. If the child who neither accepts nor understands his father's way of life, has, nevertheless, made no effort to adjust himself to another [way of] life, he will grow up a wild, strange creature. Since he has abandoned his own [people] and has been unable to adjust himself to the others, because he did not understand his own and because the others were strange to him--we can easily imagine what will happen to such a child. They are merely the withered leaves on the Jewish national tree.</p>
   <p>However, there were Jews who were aware of this situation in Jewish life in America. They saw that if our children were permitted to follow this path, we would soon have no Jews in America....for if the younger generation should cease to exist in a nationalistic sense, then our national existence is over. Thus the decision was finally made to found an organization which would take the younger generation under its protection and would strive to give it a nationalistic, Jewish education. Such an organization would offer the children fresh inspiration <span class="page-break">3</span>and would convert them into loyal and devoted children of their own people, who would be in a position to carry on the emblem of Judaism in America. This organization is the Society of Sons and Daughters of Israel, which now numbers more than two hundred members, young boys and girls. It has three branches: one on the West Side, in the Douglas [Park] neighborhood, and on the North Side. This organization also has several branches of the so-called Youth Society Sons of Israel, which is made up of the younger group, who are being prepared to become members of the Society of Sons and Daughters of Israel when they reach a certain age.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. London, who is now in New York, deserves a great deal of credit for the founding of this organization. At first, the membership consited only of pupils of the [Hebrew] Theological College. Later, as the organization developed, it also admitted girls, who will be the teachers of the future generation.</p>
   <p>Apart from the basic principle of observing the Sabbath and other religious traditions, the Society of Sons and Daughters of Israel stresses the importance <span class="page-break">4</span>of cultivating a sound nationalistic sentiment among its members. Every Tuesday and Saturday the members meet and lectures are given on Jewish history, the Bible, Hebrew literature, and even a course in the Talmud. The unofficial leader of the organization is Mr. Z. Mathew but officially the organization has a general executive committee, consisting of all the chairmen and secretaries of each branch. They meet once a month to transact current business. The meetings are not held in common: the boys meet separately from the girls.</p>
   <p>In order to have a permanent headquarters for their ever-growing membership as well as a place for their ever-expanding library, the Society of Sons and Daughters of Israel purchased the building at 1113 Ashland Boulevard at a cost of $4,500.--$1,500 cash and a mortgage on the balance. A formal celebration will soon take place.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the local Orthodox Jews will realize the great importance of this organization and that will help it to carry out its plans. The</p>
