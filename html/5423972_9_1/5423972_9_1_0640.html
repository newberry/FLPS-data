   <p>Now that my dear friends from Liebawitch have their own synagogue [Congregation Anshe Liebawitch], the opening of which will be celebrated next Sunday, I want to remind them that a synagogue should have a Talmud Torah as well as a Mikvah [Translator's note: Swimming pool used by Jewish matrons for purposes of feminine hygiene]. I also want to remind them that besides its duty to the Talmud Torah, the congregation should also support other Jewish institutions, such as the Hebrew Theological College.</p>
