   <p>From the standpoint of the publicity agent and the public relations director the recent thirtieth annual convention of the "embattled hosts" of American Reform Jewry in Chicago was a noteworthy success. The deliberations of the assembled delegates were duly and reverently reported in the press. Reporters vied with one another in giving prominence to the utterances of such dignitaries as the former United States ambassador, Henry Morgenthau, and Dr. Lee K. Frankel, and news editors were more than generous in the amount of space they allotted to the conference.</p>
   <p>The City of Chicago did itself proud on the auspicious occasion. For one whole week "Judaism Must Live" reverberated through the corridors of the Hotel La Salle. Fifteen hundred strong, we are assured by the reliable and efficient publicity representative of the Union of American Hebrew Congregation--fifteen hundred strong--"men and women who are leaders in the religious and communal life in their communities, including some of the foremost leaders of the professional, cultural, financial, industrial, philanthropic, and political life of America, heard speaker after speaker discuss with utter frankness the condition of Judaism in America and the perils that confront it because of the rationalism, skepticism, and materialism which has swept over the country since the war".</p>
   <p>Although the slogan of the delegates was "Judaism Must Live," the conference showed that Reform Judaism was quite dead. Reform Judaism has hardly a spark of life in its body despite its 278 costly temples, its National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods, its National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods, its Department of Synagogue and School Extension, its Hebrew Union College, its rabbis, and its lay workers. It is practically dead for the sufficient reason that it represents an insignificant minority of the four million Jews in the United States, a scant 56,860. It has never succeeded in the past, and it is not likely to succeed in the future, in being anything except a German-Jewish movement--a rich man's cult--divorced from the pulsating Jewish life of this country.</p>
   
   <p>Were it not for the ladies of the congregations, the temples would be quite empty on Sunday mornings. And if it were not for the fact that in the hinterland, to borrow a word from Mencken's vocabulary, are onetime Russian Jewish immigrants who have now become prosperous, the total temple membership throughout the country would be cut in half.</p>
   <p>Reform Judaism has not taken root on the soil of America. It prefers to call itself "American Judaism," but it is today what it has been during the past seventy-five years--a German product. It bears the German tag. It was "made in Germany" and intended for home consumption; and the numerous efforts to adapt it to American needs have not succeeded.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Samuel Schulman, a leader of Reform Judaism in this country, was at one time an Yeshivah Bocher [theological student]. Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver, a pulpiteer of national repute, was born in the "old country," and spent his boyhood on the lower East Side of New York. Rabbi Enelow, another prominent Reform rabbi, in fact one of the most scholarly, hails from Russia. And so down the line. The scions of the German-Jewish families prefer the stock exchange to the Reform rabbinate.</p>
   <p>Reform Judaism began in Germany in the nineteenth century as a movement to aestheticize the religious service. On this score it has been successful all along the line. It has profoundly influenced synagogue manners, especially in America. There is hardly an Orthodox synagogue in the larger cities of the United States which does not owe much of its present decorum and attractiveness to the example of the original Reform temples. But when, beginning about 1844, it attempted to formulate a new philosophy of Judaism, or a new theology, it went off on a tangent, lost its equilibrium, and has been floundering ever since.</p>
   <p>Reform Judaism as an organized movement originated in Germany and was the product of the French Revolution. When Napolean struck down the shackles which had fettered the Jews for many centuries; when the political status of the Jews of Western Europe was transformed from disenfranchisement to enfranchisement, it was inevitable that their cultural and religious life would undergo a similar profound change. The admission of the Jews to full citizenship on a basis of equality with their Gentile neighbors in Germany and France was hailed by the leaders of the German Jews as the dawn of a new day--as the veritable fulfillment of the prophecy. The Jew was no longer to be distinguishable from the other members of the general community..... Away with his "freakish gabardine," his "uncouth Jargon," his ritual locks and ringlets, his long, untidy beard, and his peculiar manners and mannerisms. He was to identify himself wholly and completely with his environment--no, not completely: his religion was to remain, but it was to be a religion thoroughly cleansed and fumigated, shorn of its "superfluities" and "barbarities;" modernized, civilized, and pruned of its "extravaganzies". Whatever seemed to interfere with the assimilation of the Jew into his new environment must be discarded at all costs. This was the price a grateful Jewish people was to pay for its emancipation.</p>
   <p>The Jewish religion, grown "rusty" and "moldy" during the Middle Ages, was to be reformed. There was to be a revisal of values--long before Nietzsche invented the phrase. Rabbinical Judaism was to be divorced from "prophetic" Judaism. The Shulhan Aruh [religious code regulating the life of every Orthodox Jew] was thrown into the ash can. And along with it went such sentimentalities as the Jew's immemorial prayer for the restoration of his ancient homeland and the use of Hebrew in the liturgy. Many other things went besides. But if a great many things were taken away from the old Judaism, something else was substituted. The Jews were given a "Mission;" they were allotted a task, a purpose, a destiny. If the Diaspora were to be explained away in some way, why not on the theory that it was God's peculiar way of making His Torah accessible unto all mankind? "Israel was of old, and remains today, the bearer of the Ark of the Torah." In the words of the late Kauffmann Kohler: "We hold that Judaism represents the highest conception of the God-Idea as taught in our Holy Scriptures and developed and spiritualized by the Jewish teachers in their respective ages. We maintain that Judaism preserved and defended, amidst continual trials and under enforced isolation, this God-Idea as the central religious truth for the human race."</p>
   <p>Now why is it that so few East European Jews living in the United States have come under the influence of Reform Judaism?--referring, of course, to the religious Jews. One has only to visit an Orthodox synagogue in any part of the city on any Jewish holiday to realize that the majority of the congregation, while professing attachment to Orthodoxy, are anything but Orthodox in the old-fashioned sense of the word. And yet, these men will not hear of Reform Judaism!</p>
   <p>I have said that Orthodoxy has silently, almost imperceptibly, remodeled itself to a considerable extent in this country. Most of the prospective, ultra-Orthodox rabbis now attending the Yeshivoth are clean shaven, despite the admonition in the Pentateuch against removing the beard. Some of them get around the edict by using a depilatory; but others have openly invested in a Gillette safety razor. And if it's an English sermon that the modern Orthodox congregation requires, the Yeshivah is ready to supply that article.</p>
   <p>After sixty years of uninterrupted pulpiteering, the Reform congregations in the entire country number fewer than sixty thousand members. Why, there are more than that many German Jews belonging to Christian Science churches!</p>
