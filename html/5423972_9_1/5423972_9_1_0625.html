   <p>How much money do you think the Chicago Jews spent last year to build synagogues? They spent more than a million dollars. They are building a new synagogue on the North Side, which will cost three hundred thousand dollars. A beautiful new synagogue was built this year in Albany Park. New synagogues large and beautiful new synagogues, have been built on the West Side. New synagogues were built in all parts of the city last year. All those synagogues cost a pretty penny.</p>
   <p>This is splendid and proves that the Chicago Jews want to pray. However, how many new Talmud Torahs were built in Chicago last year? As far as I know, not one. If I remember correctly, it is written in the Holy Books, "The study of the Torah is above all."</p>
