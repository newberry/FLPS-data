   <p>Captain H. Weiss who is a veteran of the Spanish-American War, in which he was promoted to the rank of captain, has with great energy started the organization of a Jewish regiment of soldiers. This regiment is to be ready at a moment's notice when this country gets in to war and orders come for marching to the battlefield. The members of Knights of Zion and the Montifiore Guards have already joined the regiment and plans are made to form a whole Jewish brigade of volunteers for the United States Army against Mexico.</p>
   <p>Any Jewish young man desiring to volunteer in the Jewish regiment, may send in his application to Captain Weiss, Room one, West Side Trust and Savings Bank at Halsted &amp; 12th Streets.</p>
