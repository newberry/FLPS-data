   <p>Yesterday, a large crowd of men and women witnessed the opening of the new synagogue which the Congregation Anshe Liebawitch has built on Clifton Park Avenue and Fifteenth Street. The ceremony began with a big parade from the congregation's temporary home at Albany Avenue and Roosevelt Road. The members of the synagogue, carrying the sacred articles, marched to the new synagogue preceded by a band from the Marks Nathan Orphan Home. Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon marched side by side with the rabbi of the congregation, Rabbi Mordecai Zevin. Many pedestrians joined the march and many people rode in autos.</p>
   <p>Representatives of Congregation Beth Jacob Anshe Kros, whose synagogues is located right across the street from the new synagogue, met the paraders with scrolls of the Torah and with a band playing Hatikvah [Jewish national anthem]. This made a great impression upon the crowd and added luster to the occasion.</p>
