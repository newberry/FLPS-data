   <p>The Chicago Orthodox community can congratulate itself upon the fact that a man like Rabbi Benjamin Marcus, one of the most popular rabbis and Zionist workers of Russia, has become one of its spiritual leaders. Rabbi Benjamin Marcus has become rabbi of Congregation Anshe Lidau Pinsk, and one may assume that the congregation will develop very quickly with such a capable leader at its head. Rabbi Benjamin Marcus is an intimate friend of Ussishkin [a Zionist leader of Russia], and was for many years connected with the Zionist movement in Russia. He is a brilliant orator who speaks Hebrew with the same fluency as Yiddish. He has had an academic education, but he has no [intellectual] pretensions. We will have to watch the Congregation Anshe Lidau Pinsk and see how it grows with a man like Rabbi Marcus as its leader.</p>
