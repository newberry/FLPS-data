   <p>The Daily Maccabees Folk School.</p>
   <p>The daily Maccabees Folk School opened its classes in the Hebrew Institute a year ago; it now enters the second year, closing a chapter of wonderful experiments, in the field of free national and national education for the children of the Yiddish labor masses in whose interests this young institution was founded. There are already six classes with a daily attendance of 150 children. The curriculum represents a considerable list of subjects which make up the following departments of Yiddish culture:</p>
   <p>1. The Department of Yiddish. a. The Yiddish language, grammar, rhetoric and composition. b. The Yiddish literature, analysis, characteristics of the classical works.</p>
   <p>2. The Department of Hebrew. a. The Hebrew language, grammar, rhetoric and composition. b. The Hebrew literature (Biblical and modern).</p>
   <p>3. The Department of Yiddish History. a. Legends, sketches of historical heroes. b. History (ancient, medieval and modern).</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>4. The Department of Yiddish Folk Lore. a. Tales, fables, proverbs. b. Customs, traditions. c. Plays, games, dances. d. Folk songs.</p>
   <p>The medium of intercourse in all departments except the Hebrew proper, is the Yiddish language. In it are also conducted all matters concerning the work of the school, all documents and items being published in that language. The recognition of the administration of Yiddish as the official language, and the introduction of it as the medium of intercourse puts the education of the Jewish child on a sound basis. It is in this fact where the progress of that school lies. The Mother-tongue creates the Yiddish atmosphere, puts the pupil in normal conditions of mental development and makes him love the classwork. The children are really proud of their spiritual home. No wonder they love it with such an ardor, they study with such zeal.</p>
   <p>The pedagogical board which is under the supervision of the Federated committee of the Poale-Zion of Chicago may certainly be congratulated upon <span class="page-break">3</span>the success and progress which the Maccabees revealed in knowledge during the week of the examinations some months ago. The exhibition of the pupils' compositions in Yiddish, Hebrew, History and Singing, held in the Assembly Hall in the Hebrew Institute on the evening of the Flag Festival, was a marvelous occasion. These compositions concerning the standard works of classics, such as Y. L. Peretz, Sholom-Aleichem, M. Rosenfeld, Yehoash, A. Reizen, P. Slonimsky and others showed a high degree of intelligence which the pupils of the higher grades attained within comparitively a short time.</p>
