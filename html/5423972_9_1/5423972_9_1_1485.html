  <p>A final clarification of the relations of the Hadassah and the Zionist Organization of America was made at the 19th Annual Convention of Hadassah, held last Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, at the Palmer House here. Morris Rothenburg, president of the Zionist Organization of America, came from New York, empowered by the Executive Committee to work out a solution of a problem that has long vexed Zionist leadership in this country.</p>

   <p>It has long been contended by the Zionist leaders that the anomalous position of Hadassah had enabled that organization to retain its full autonomy, and at the same time to meddle at will with the affairs of the Zionist Organization of America. After a bitter fight, a subcommittee of Hadassah and Mr. Rothenberg worked out a solution of the problem, which was adopted by the convention after a heated debate.</p>

   <p>Resolutions adopted included one for a counter-boycott of Germany as an answer to the German boycott of Jews.</p>
   <p>SEEKS HOSPITAL FUNDS.</p>
   <p>A nationwide campaign to raise $200,000 for the building and maintenance of Hadassah University Hospital and a graduate medical school in Jerusalem was launched, following a report by Mrs. Halperin, who stated that the situation of German physicians made this step imperative.</p>
   <p>Hadassah, with a membership of 40,000 distributed throughout thirty-six states, Mrs. Halperin stated, was faced by the "unthinkable, unbelievable tragedy of the savage attack upon a loyal and devoted section of its own citizenry by the present Hitler leaders"</p>

   <p>Pledges of $30,000 were made by various chapters. These included Boston, $10,000; Chicago, $10,000; lower New York region, $5,000; Detroit $3,000 and smaller sums.</p>
   <p>Support for the campaign was pledged by the American Jewish physicians' committee, which informed the convention that Dr. S. Goldwater, former health commissioner of New York City, had consented to go to Palestine to help draft plans for the hospital.</p>
