   <p>What promises to be the most outstanding event Chicago Young Judaea has ever had occasion to participate in is scheduled for the middle of February. This will be a gathering of Young Judean leaders from throughout the Middle West for a conference. Leaders from as far West as Denver and from as far East as the State of Ohio will be invited to send delegates.</p>
   <p>It has been a great many years since Chicago has had an inter-city convention of any sort and this conference, it is hoped, will lead to the strengthening of the entire Middle West.</p>
   
   <p>Chicago's Young Judea has a big task before it in making all the arrangements for the outside guests, but Chicago is ready and willing to do this and promise all out-of-town delegates a conference which will be both educational and entertaining.</p>
   <p>DEFINITE DATE SOON</p>
   <p>While a definite day has not been set at this time, by next week the date will be forth coming. In the meantime leaders and workers in Chicago should be prepared to co-operate in every way, so that our visitors can point out Chicago as one of the strongest Young Judean Centers in the country.</p>
   
   <p>The Palestinian rally is to be in the hands of the South Side leaders, who have declared that they will make it one of the outstanding events of the year. The definite date has not been set and this is awaiting the decision on to the Mid-West leaders conference as it is possible that the rally may form a part of the program. In spite of the fact that the time is indefinite, the South Side leaders group has already started to plan the program in which clubs from the entire city will participate.</p>
   <p>DEBATING LEAGUE.</p>
   <p>When our readers receive this copy of the Jewish Courier, the winning teams in the semi-finals of the Intermediate Debating Contest will already have been chosen. Beth Gan debated B'nai Yehuda at Congregation Beth Itzchak on Wednesday evening, January 4, and on the same evening Marchavia debated Ain Harod as to whether the boys or the girls won and whether it was decided that the establishment of Jewish parochial schools should be encouraged by the Jews. In the United States we will have to tell our readers next week.</p>

The following people have been nominated for this position and one of them will be chosen by the Young Judeans at the Palestinian rally:- Jonas Meyers, Lena Brodsky, Ada Quiat, Lester Carmel and Fanny Slobod.</p>
