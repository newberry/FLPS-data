   <p>Should American Jewish Lads be Loafers in the Beth Hamidrash or in the Yeshivah? by K. Marmor.</p>
   <p>Because of the war between Soviet Russia and Poland, Chicago does not sufficiently appraise the war in their own territory. The warring armies are, on one side the attackers from the Courier, led by the Siamese twins, Dr. S. M. Melammed and Meyer Nolataroff, and on the other side, the defending holy Israel of the Rabbis, led by Ephraim Epstein and Rabbi Saul Silver. A glance at the events which preceded the war, makes it clear that it resulted from more material things than quarrels as to the relative value of the words Beth Hamidrash or Yeshivah.</p>
   <p>The events are as follows: First, on the eve of the national presidential campaign, the Courier group had planned to organize a Kehillah, whose existence would give its organizers and leaders a monoply of the Judaism symbol in Chicago. Secondly, the Rabbinate were not enthusiastic about this plan and <span class="page-break">2</span>opposed its realization. Thirdly, the Jewish Courier suddenly began attacking the Rabbis, in the language of a Billingsgate fishwife, as disturbers of the Kehillah.</p>
   <p>For many years past, a cabal has been organized, whose program consists of a triple unity: of professional Judaism, boodle politics, and wealth. It is understood, of course, that this cabal had a tremendous influence on the orthodox synagogues.</p>
   <p>During campaign periods, the members of the cabal, among whom are several gentile politicians, would come to the synagogue, climb to the altar, even on Yom Kippur, and deliver a sermon on the necessity of obeying this new clique. The pious Jews were strongly disgusted and considered these acts as hateful. But their protests were of no value, because the Jewish orthodox synagogues are not organized in a Kehillah as in Europe, but privately, belong to a congregation which is controlled by the presidents of the various synagogues. These officers, <span class="page-break">3</span>who are usually well to do, are adherents of the trinity and opponents of the Torah of Moses, which condemns usury, rent profiteering, and all other forms of exploitation.</p>
   <p>The Rabbis are regarded by these well-to-do leaders of the congregation as servants of the Golden Calf. A Rabbi of such a synagogue may speak of Kashruth, but not of justice. He may condemn non-believers in Kashruth, but he must say no bad word regarding exploiters. He may revile the radicals, but dare not criticize boodle politicians.</p>
   <p>For the bystander, to whom it appeared that the Rabbinate and the cabal lived happily together, and that the former appeared to be quite satisfied in their capacity of servants to the Golden Calf, it may be astonishing to observe the bitter quarrels between the two sides. It is evidently due to the fact that the cabal, which peddles the Jewish vote made such humiliating demands for the coming campaign, that the Rabbinate was forced to fight for its honor, or as they say, for "the honor of the Torah," which they so long disregarded.</p>
