   <p>Next Wednesday, the Congregation B'nai Zion, 1715 Lunt Avenue, will be formally opened. The building is not a new one, but is one that has been transformed from an Episcopalian church into a Jewish house of prayer. Congregation B'nai Zion paid thirty-five thousand dollars in cash for the building. There was an additional cost of ten thousand dollars to remodel it.</p>
   <p>The Messrs. Herman Spivak, Joseph Friedman, Joseph Z. Wilner, Edward Shteif, Moses Von Gelder and Nelson M. Stein are among the most active members, and they promise that the synagogue will be a strictly Orthodox one. They will soon bring a modern young rabbi from the East [to officiate] at their synagogue.</p>
