   <p>The long-neglected problem of organizing the Orthodox synagogues in Chicago is showing signs of life again. A reorganization committee has worked out an effective organization plan. A meeting has been called for next Monday evening at the Hebrew Theological College, at which the plans will be discussed and approved. Every president of a Chicago synagogue who takes his office seriously, should attend that meeting. The presidents of the Chicago synagogues will certainly be able to accomplish something of lasting value, something worth while, if they all attend that meeting. Whether or not the Chicago synagogues are to become the driving force of the community, is the responsibility of the presidents of the synagogues. The synagogue presidents can become the leaders of the city if they have sufficient will power and sufficient intelligence. We will find out next Monday evening whether they possess those two qualities.</p>
