   <p>Only fifty years ago American Jewry was just a colony of European Jewry. The Jewish center of gravity was Europe, especially Eastern Europe. The intellectual Jewish center was Lithuania for the conservatives and Germany for the progressives. Today, European Jewry is, although not numerically, but certainly economically, a colony of American Jewry, and we can witness with our own eyes how the Jewish center of gravity is being transferred from Europe to America. Even without a Jewish immigration on the pre-war basis there will be from six to seven million Jews in America in 1935, and American Jewry will then become not only economically the strongest but also numerically the strongest Jewish group in the world. America is becoming the Jewish center of the world, but when we speak of America as a Jewish center, we only have North America in mind and not South America, but there are also Jews in South America and the Jewish settlements in South America, <span class="page-break">\2</span>too, are developing rapidly and are growing in size and volume from day to day. There are today some one hundred to one hundred twenty-five thousand Jews in Argentine, twenty-five thousand Jews in Chile, fifty thousand Jews in Brazil, and probably fifty thousand Jews more scattered over the South and Central American states. The only country on the American continent that has only a numerically weak Jewish group is Mexico, although Mexico can admit more Jews than many other countries on the American continent.</p>
   <p>It was a Chicago Jew, Mr. Paul Rottenberg, who visualized the strength of an American Jewry set along the Northern and Southern Atlantic and extending from New York to Buenos Aires, who has conceived the idea of populating Mexico with Jews. To be sure there are at least in Europe two million Jews who are forced to leave the countries of their nativity because of terrible economic and horrible political conditions, but they do not emigrate just because they have nowhere to emigrate. America would admit only a certain number of them and Palestine is <span class="page-break">\3</span>not yet in a position to admit all of them or even a considerable fraction of them. Mr. Paul Rottenberg understood that since there are millions of Jews, mostly refugees, who need some sort of a political asylum, and since a country like Mexico needs more men-power to lift her treasures from beneath her soil and develop her industrial possibilities, to bring the former in touch with the latter would be of benefit to both, and would certainly be a blessing to those unfortunate Jews who are at the mercy of the mob in the Ukrania and at the mercy of pogroms in Roumania and at the mercy of anti-Semitic Poland. The fact that the Mexican government has expressed its willingness to admit Russian Jews and grant them all sorts of privileges with the view to facilitating their settling in the country, was conceded by Mr. Rottenberg as a stimulating factor in his move to open the rich Mexican territory for politically oppressed and economically starved Eastern European Jews. He went to Mexico City, negotiated with the President of the Mexican Republic, negotiated with various members of President Obregen's (sic) cabinet, and secured an assurance from them that under certain conditions, Mexico would gladly admit any number of Russian Jews and <span class="page-break">\4</span>enable them to settle in the country. The question as to whether the Mexican government was sincere in its offer or not may not be discussed now. Two facts, however, are clear--that the Jewish refugees all over Eastern Europe would gladly emigrate to Mexico if granted certain concessions, and that Mexico is in need of more men-power. As soon as the assurance was received from the Mexican government that it is ready for negotiations, it was the duty of American Jewry and its leaders to continue the work started by Mr. Paul Rottenberg, but instead of following up the preliminary negotiations of Mr. Rottenberg and to come down to business, the leaders of American Jewry have until recently ignored the whole affair. Only after such pressure was brought to bear on the American Jewish Committee did they admit it advisable to consider the proposition theoretically. Whether the American Jewish Committee will do anything practical and substantial in the work inaugurated by Mr. Rottenberg we do not know. The probability is that it won't, first because the proposition comes from Chicago and then because the man who first visualized with remarkable clearness the possibility of a Jewish settlement in Mexico does not belong to the upper four hundred, to the sworn <span class="page-break">\5</span>leaders, but just a humble Chicago Jew.</p>
   <p>We do not say that Mr. Rottenberg's plan is the very best one. We do not say that Mexico is a country fit for Jewish immigration, but we do say that the plan was worth while considering and is still worth while considering, and it is nothing short of criminal to ignore it. After all the Jewish refugees in Austria, in Bessarabia, in Rumania, in Germany, in Ukrania, all other parts of Eastern Europe would fare much better in Mexico no matter how hard they would have to struggle for their existence than they are now faring in the Eastern European countries. Maybe that in Mexico too their ways would not be strewn with roses in their first years, but the sword of Damocles would not hang over their heads and they would not be threatened with pogroms every day. Mr. Paul Rottenberg has visualized an American Jewry extending from North New York to Buenos Aires with a Jewish settlement in Mexico to connect North American and South American Jewry, but the leaders of American Jewry either having less power to vision than Mr. Rottenberg or animated by political motives or carried away by false ambitions have failed to participate in the <span class="page-break">\6</span>work which might have saved hundreds of thousands of our people from starvation.</p>
   <p>Now after the American Jewish Committee has, we understand, taken up the Mexican Jewish question, we wonder whether the clear and wonderful vision of Mr. Paul Rottenberg will remain a vision or whether some definite action will be taken to secure a place of refuge for our maltreated and martyred people in Eastern Europe.
