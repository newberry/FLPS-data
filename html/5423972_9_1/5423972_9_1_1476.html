   <p>A movement is on foot to organize what may be termed the Jewish Boy Scouts. It will resemble the Boy Scouts of America, but will be composed entirely of Jewish youths.</p>
   <p>It is not generally known that for several years past there have been similar organizations on the West Side, called the Volunteers of Zion, the Herzl Scouts, and the Rothschild Guards. These boys have regular drills and follow the lines of strict military discipline in conducting their societies.</p>
