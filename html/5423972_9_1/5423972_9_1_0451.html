   <p>Last Friday, the Courier published a proclamation by Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon, entitled, "Who is with God, follow me". This proclamation contains a decision of far-reaching consequences. We published this document only because it was given to us as the decision of a great rabbinical authority, and we, who accept the tenets of rabbinical Judaism, could not refuse to publish the decision of a rabbinical authority. We are convinced that Rabbi Gordon would never have rendered such a decision if he had been better acquainted with conditions in Chicago. We have sufficient grounds to believe that certain people persuaded him to render that decision, which had the affect of a cannon shot not at the enemy, but at his own people. However, the cannon shot has been fixed and now the people who helped Rabbi Gordon make such a decision, must abide by its consequences.</p>
   <p>In his statement, Rabbi Gordon says, among other things:" [To permit] Jews with <span class="page-break">2</span>whom we can neither eat together nor pray together, because they have erased the words 'Zion and Jerusalem' from their prayer books, to permit such people to become the guardians and educators of our children--is something unheard of among Jews.</p>
   <p>"My dear brethren! I say to you once more that according to the law of the Torah we must not entrust the souls of our people, of the children of the community, upon whose shoulders rests our Jewish future, into the hands of those who are themselves alien to our traditions and our hopes."</p>
   <p>It is obvious that if this is the final decision with regard to this problem, we cannot co-operate with the United Jewish Charities. The Talmud Torahs whom they support, must not accept any more money from the Charities. This is the first practical result of the decision.</p>
   <p>The Talmud Torahs, which are supported by the Charities, must have seventy thousand dollars a year. The rabbis must now go out and raise this sum, <span class="page-break">3</span>otherwise the Talmud Torahs will have to close. Since it is absolutely impossible for the rabbis to raise even a half or a third of that sum, the Talmud Torahs will have to close, and two thousand children will be surrendered either, to the radical schools, or to the missionaries, or to the demoralization of the streets. These are the consequences of the decision, but a decision remains a decision.</p>
   <p>We foresaw the consequences of the decision as soon as we read it. We begged the esteemed rabbi to defer the publication of his decision at least until the next meeting of the rabbinical council, or until the meeting of the Committee of five who had been elected by prominent citizens and rabbis. Rabbi Gordon, however, maintained that it was a rabbinical decision and that it must be published immediately.</p>
   <p>This decision, if it is carried out--and we fail to see how the rabbis can avoid carrying it out--has far greater and more dangerous consequences than the destruction of the Talmud Torahs. This decision, considered as an answer <span class="page-break">4</span>to an agreement reached by prominent citizens and rabbis with the educational committee of the United Charities, destroys the influence of the rabbis and destroys Orthodox Jewry as a factor in our community life. When the leaders of the Charities, who are the elected leaders of the community, hear that the representatives of the Orthodox community, headed by three rabbis, made an agreement and then broke it, or that the agreement was broken by this decision, they will cease to seek the advice of the rabbis, they will no longer take them into consideration, and, henceforth, they will go their own way. They will also begin to pay scant attention to the opinions and decisions of the Orthodox citizens. We called the attention of Rabbi Gordon to these dangers, but he insisted that it was a rabbinical decision, and, as such, had to be published at once. He did not leave the office of the Courier until he had seen the printer's proof of his written decision.</p>
   <p>We explained to the honored rabbi that the basis of his decision was erroneous; that the Charities do not want to, will not, and must not interfere in the internal affairs of the Talmud Torahs because, according to their constitution,</p>
