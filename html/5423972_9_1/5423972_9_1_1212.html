   <p>Louis E. Delson is active in the work of furthering the organization of those who served during the war, into a league to be known as The Liberty War Veterans.</p>
   <p>Emblems to be worn by the veterans have been designed by Mr. Delson and approved by the National Security League and they may be, at an early date, officially adopted by the government. Formal organization and the election of officers will take place as soon as the treaty of peace is signed.</p>
