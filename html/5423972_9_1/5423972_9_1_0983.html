   <p>The Committee appointed to consider the financial plan for a new Temple, made a report in which was outlined a tentative financial scheme. The proposed seating capacity was estimated at 2,100 single seats, of which one-third should be sold at $300.00 each, one-third at $200.00 each, and one-third at $100.00 each, making a total of $420,000. It was further estimated that the present Temple Building would realize $65,000, making a total of $485,000. From this would have to be deducted the present exchange value of the pews in the present Temple, amounting to $167,000, leaving a balance of $318,000, exclusive of such amount as might be realized from premiums on the sale of desirable rents. It was also proposed that the payments for seats in the new Temple might be in installments of one-fifth cash, and the balance in one, two, three and four years, with interest at 5 %. To take care of the cost of the building, it was proposed that members loan to the congregation as required, and receive five per cent scrip, due on or before five years. This scrip could then be retired from the payments made from year to year on the seats sold.</p>
