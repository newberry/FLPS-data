   <p>After a great deal of effort and much delay we were successful in purchasing the beautiful French Church on Center Avenue, near Taylor Street, which we will now transform into a Synagogue, to be used by the Congregation - Yaakov Anshe Droheimstien.</p>
   <p>We hope to make it a true center of worship, study, and the dissemination of good deeds.</p>
   <p>We now appeal to our friends and landsleit to aid us in our worthwhile endeavor to make this the finest and most beautiful synagogue in Chicago. As you can readily understand, this will require a good deal of money. When you are approached by a committee from our synagogue, help them as much as you can, so that we can achieve our goal.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
