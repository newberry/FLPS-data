   <p>The question was submitted to the convention for discussion yesterday, whether this order shall continue to operate as a secret society. The debate that followed disclosed that the delegates to the convention, were divided into three camps. The liberals, in favor of discontinuing the rituals, a second group, favoring the continuance of the present ritual, and a third group which insisted, that the old Hebrew customs should be even more pronounced at the ritual than it has been. This last-mentioned group was victorious, although by a small majority. But this is not considered to be final. This subject will be discussed again during this week's sessions.</p>
   
   <p>The program dealing with changes to be undertaken, includes the important one of electing the president. Up to the present time, this official was elected by the executive committee. The recommendation has been submitted, that in the future, the president should be elected by the convention. This change in the constitution, has been submitted by the younger element of the order, with the sole purpose of giving a younger man, worthy of the honor, a chance to assume such responsibility, and to bring about more activity, which is the privilege of the young.</p>
