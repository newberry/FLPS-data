   <p>(Special to the Courier, by a staff correspondent), Pittsburgh, June 24: The leaders of the Zionist Organization of America, at the first session of the convention, celebrated their victory in instituting district committees. The system of district committees, under a central body, will replace the present system of independent organizations, such as the Federated Zionist Societies of the Middle West, Etc.</p>
   <p>Charles Koven, chairman of the constitution committee, proposed that all central organizations unite in one body and create district committees. Mr. Jacob De Haas, secretary of the provisional committee, immediately moved that the convention first take up the question of uniting all the central organizations. His motion was carried, and then a heated discussion took place.</p>
   <p>Mr. De Haas attempted to show that the Unity Plan would bring true democracy <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>into the Zionist movement. He bitterly attacked his opponents, calling them "street-corner demagogues". He concluded with pathos, "He who is not for us, is against us!"</p>
   <p>This statement aroused a great deal of resentment. Mr. Jacob Fishman was the first to rebuke Mr. De Haas. He pointed out that it was too brazen to assert that one who does not agree with the administration is not a Zionist.</p>
   <p>Judge Jacob Strahl, president of the Order Bnai Zion, declared that he was not opposed to the plan of uniting all the organizations; but with regard to his Order, he would like to have a committee of four from each side work out the legal aspect of this question, since not all the members of his organization are Zionists. He, therefore, proposed an amendment to the motion, to omit the Order Bnai Zion from the unity resolution; but the amendment was voted down 300 to 37. A motion was then made to declare the vote unanimous. At first, Judge Strahl objected to the motion, but when several delegates began to cheer Justice Brandeis, who was sitting in the gallery watching the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>procedure [and apparently approving it], Judge Strahl withdrew his objections.</p>
   <p>The convention then acclaimed Justice Brandeis, and the vote was declared unanimous.</p>
   <p>The Unity Resolution</p>
   <p>In essence,the following is the resolution to unite all central bodies of the American Zionist movement into one great body.</p>
   <p>The [Balfour] Declaration of the British government favoring the Zionist aims, which has the support of the Allies and the good will of the government of the United States and the Zionist Administration Committee in Palestine, has considerably increased the responsibility and work of the Zionist movement. In order that the Zionists of America shall properly be able to assume their new responsibilities, it is necessary that the delegates, gathered here at <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the convention, found a central Zionist organization for the whole United States. In order to obtain [the best results], all existing organizations should be dissolved, with the exception of those whose existence was directly sanctioned by the World Zionist Congress.</p>
   <p>By this act the following organizations would be dissolved! The Provisional Zionist Committee, The American Federation of Zionists, The Federated Societies of the Middle West, The Hadassah, The Intercollegiate Zionist Association, The Order Bnai Zion, and The Territorial Organizations.</p>
   <p>Even though the Unity Plan came under a separate heading, it, nevertheless, a great deal to do with the District Plan which Judge Brandeis is determined to put through. This can be seen from the debates which the motion of Attorney Allen Davis of Pittsburgh called forth. Mr. Davis pointed out that this convention had no right to carry through such plans; he demanded that the above-mentioned Unity Plan be referred to a referendum, to be passed only by a two-thirds majority. He pointed out that even the Congress of the United <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>States cannot change the Constitution unless the proposed change is ratified by a two-thirds majority and then by a similar majority in the state legislature,</p>
   <p>Louis Lipsky, chairman of the convention, stated in his reply that the constitution of the Zionist Organization declares that the convention can by a two-thirds vote, change the constitution. This did not satisfy Attorney Davis, and so he appealed against Lipsky's interpretation.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wise then took the chair [to enable Mr. Lipsky to participate in the discussion]. Mr. Davis again urged that the Plan be referred to a referendum on the ground that the general public [at the convention] knew very little about this plan and needed a great deal of time to become acquainted with it. The result was the same. Dr. Wise put Mr. Davis' motion to a vote and it was defeated by a vote of 320 to 93.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon session, the well-known philanthropist Nathan Strauss <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>appeared and greeted the convention. He also appealed for unity.</p>
   <p>At the evening session, David Werner, professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, read a very interesting report on the work in Palestine. He suggested that the convention should immediately occupy itself with constructive work and should deal with each question as soon as it arises. He also read a scientific treatise on the future of the Jewish State: what it should be like, and how to create it.</p>
   <p>A Report from Our Colonists</p>
   <p>The following is a cabled dispatch that was received from Professor Chaim Weizmann, head of the Zionist commission now in Jerusalem. "In the name of the Jews of a liberated Palestine, and in the name of my colleagues here with me, I send you greetings from the land of our fathers. The four years of war have wrought great havoc here, yet our institutions, that were built by hard labor, are still standing, sound as ever.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>"Of all the Zionists in the world, most credit is due to the colonists [in Palestine], who have protected and plowed their fields, under the most harrassing conditions. Now we have great faith that the American Zionists will fulfill their sacred duty and will help to maintain the local [Palestinian] colonies and their pioneers.</p>
   <p>"The English government is doing everything it can to aid our Commission in its relief work in Jerusalem, in Jaffa, in Hebron, and in other places where help is needed.</p>
   <p>"The Turks robbed the pioneers of their stock and machinery. We must replace them. And this we hope to do with the aid of the Zionists of America, to whom the eyes of everyone are now turned.</p>
   <p>"With Zion's greetings,</p>
   <p>"Chaim Weizmann."</p>

   <p>Attorney Max Pam a Zionist</p>
   <p>From the prominent Chicago lawyer, Max Pam, brother of Judge Hugo Pam, the convention received the following telegram: "Honorable Louis D. Brandeis: Permit me on this occasion of your convention to express my heartiest sympathy for the Zionist ideal and movement. Permit me also to say that I have carefully studied the Zionist ideal and am convinced of the possibility of its fulfillment, just as it is the hope of all idealistic, sincere, and conscientious people.</p>
   <p>"I wish that together with other nations, we may obtain the right to national independence in the land of our national birth; that we may get the support and help of the Great Powers; and that the country may grow, thrive, and prosper.</p>
   <p>"I am convinced that the Jews, once they are established in their own land, will show great statesmanship, will know how to cherish their independence dearly, and will take their place in the family of nations.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>"My heartiest greetings to the friends of the Zionist cause.</p>
   <p>"Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>"Max Pam"</p>
   <p>Delegation of Roumanian Jews Before Justice Brandeis</p>
   <p>This morning, Justice Brandeis, Nathan Strauss, Rabbi Stephen Wise Jacob DeHaas, Louis Lipsky, and Dr. Friedenwald, of the Zionist Provisional Committee, received a delegation of the Federation of Roumanian Jews in America. The delegation consisted of Judge Aaron J. Levy, Abraham Brill, Samuel Goldstein, Solomon Suffrin of New York, and Joseph Gross of Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>The delegation called the attention of the Committee to the betrayal of the Jews of Roumania in regards to their emancipation. They were betrayed in the treaty with the Central Powers. Now the delegation requested that the <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>Committee advise them what to do to free the Roumanian Jews politically.</p>
   <p>In its reply, the Committee informed the delegation that the question of the Roumanian Jews was now under consideration by the government in Washington, D.C. And at the same time, the delegation was assured that the Provisional Committee would do everything in its power to bring about the emancipation of the Jews in Roumania.</p>
