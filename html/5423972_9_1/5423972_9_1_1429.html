   <p>At their special meeting, the directors of the Z'ire Adath Israel of Chicago, Mr. Philip Stone, chairman, decided to organize twenty-five new Z'ire branches in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Last Tuesday, a meeting was held in the Kalegrav Hebrew school, Mr. A. Rubenstein, principal, where a hundred children of twelve years of age and older, have formed a separate branch of the Z'ire of Chicago. Mr. Solomon J. Robins of Northwestern University delivered a brilliant address and explained to the children their duties as members of this important organization. Meetings, during the next few months, will be held in different parts of the city. We solicit the support of all the Jews in Chicago.</p>
   <p>[Editor's note: The Z'ire Adath Israel represent the extreme Orthodox Jews of America, who were opposed to Zionism, and the establishment of a national homeland in Palestine.]</p>
