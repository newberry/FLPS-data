   <p>The cultural program of Avukah for the year has been initiated through the launching of a series of six discussion meetings for the Summer months. At each of these meetings, papers by various members are read, followed by a general discussion on the part of the audience. The subjects have been carefully selected by a committee, and they cover chiefly two broad ideas - problems of modern Palestinian life.</p>
   <p>The first of these discussion meetings took place on Wednesday evening, 8 p.m. July 13, at the Hadassah Club Room, 8 S. Dearborn St., Room 915. Mr. Aubrey Mallach read a paper on "A Perspective of American Jewry." On July 27, the Hadassah Club Room was the scene of the second discussion meeting. Here Miss Jeanette Rubin read a paper on "American Jews and Zionism" while Mr. S. William Halperin followed with a paper on "American Jews and Zionism." At both these meetings the attendance was excellent, while throughout a very intelligent discussion was maintained. The next discussion meeting will take place at the Hadassah Club Rooms on Wednesday evening, August 10, at 8 p.m. Mr. Harry Iseberg will read a paper on "A History of Jewish Youth Movements in America," and Mr. Simon Agranat will present a paper on the subject, "What <span class="page-break">2</span>can Avukah do for Zionism and Palestine?" All Jewish young men and women are invited.</p>
   <p>On Monday evening, August 1, a meeting of the Avukah Executive Committee took place, with Mr. S. William Halperin presiding. A number of important matters were discussed with reference to enlarging the scope of Avukah's educational and practical program for the coming year.</p>
