   <p>We are pleased to announce that the Colonel commanding E. B. Knox, First Regiment I. N. G., has rescinded his action in the affront offered to the four young Jewish recruits, which, as we surmised, was inspired by some mug-wump of an imbecile German fanatic in Company K now in course of formation.</p>
   <p>The following is a letter addressed to the four gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"I am directed by the Col. Com'dg. to say that if you will come to the armory on Friday night next, the sergeant in charge of the new company now being organized will reinstate you in said company.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>J. M. Eddy Jr.</p>
   <p>Capt. 1st Inf. I. N. G.</p>
   <p>Adjutant.</p>
