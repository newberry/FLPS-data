   <p>Modesty and humility are great qualities, when they are in place. It is all right for a rabbi to be modest but it would be out of place for a general or a diplomat to display humility or modesty, just as it would be out of place for a representative of religion to rattle the sword or to use threatening language. We admire a rabbi who continues the great old rabbinic traditions, that is to say, who manifests humility and modesty, and is not too eager to impose his own will on his fellow Jews, as long as they are doing their duty. But we have no admiration at all for a rabbi who manifests modesty and humility when he ought to display severity, will power, and energy, because after all, a rabbi has certain definite functions <span class="page-break">\2</span>to perform, and modest though he be, he must at least show that he is anxious to uphold his own authority and the authority of the Jewish law. When a rabbi, instead of enforcing the law as he ought to by upholding his own rabbinic authority, is only meddling and making a mess of things, he cannot possibly expect to be admired for this sort of modesty.</p>
   <p>In days gone by, people used to complain of too much rabbinic authority. Whether the complaint was justified or not, is a matter of secondary consideration but it is a fact that the rabbis viewed everything in life from a purely legal point of view, and acted accordingly. Today, the Orthodox Rabbis in America view things not from a purely rabbinic point of view, but from the point of view of expediency, and people have reason to complain of lack of rabbinic authority. The fact of the matter is that <span class="page-break">\3</span>the rabbis in America, viewing things mostly from the point of view of expediency and practicability, do not do justice to the institution of the rabbinate, because they do not make a serious attempt to enforce the law wherever the opportunity arises. They are too modest in a sense, have little confidence in their own authority and position, and are often negligent of their duty, though perhaps not intentionally so. They are not animated by the virile spirit of the rabbi of old, who, when it came to a matter of law, would never make any concessions or any compromises.</p>
   <p>The Schitah business in Chicago is a case in point. According to the law, the Schochtim must be controlled and guided by the rabbis. It is up to the rabbi to say who is and who is not a Schochet. The law about this is so clear that it is not even debatable. But in Chicago, the <span class="page-break">\4</span>Schochtim are not under the control of the rabbis, but under the control of a union that is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, and that is immediately affiliated with a group of workingmen of outspoken irreligious tendencies. Such a state of affairs is too disgraceful and too shameful for words. It degrades the Schitah, to the level of profane labor, while in fact it is a religious function. The rabbis, if animated by a truly rabbinic spirit, could make an end to this disgraceful state of affairs, but they do not, either because of false modesty or because of weakness. Both qualities are injurious to the rabbinate and injurious to the religious life of the community. Besides, they tend to undermine the very basis of Jewish religious life in the city of Chicago. The rabbis have it in their power simply to dissolve the union of the Schochtim, <span class="page-break">\5</span>because it is only up to the rabbis to say who can and who cannot, who ought and who ought not to exercise the function of a Schochet, and if the Schochtim do not accept the verdict of the rabbis, then the rabbis can put them out of commission in five minutes.</p>
   <p>Can any one tell us why the rabbis in Chicago, twenty-five or thirty in number, do not do this plain and simple duty of theirs? Can any one explain to us why the rabbis tolerate a union of Schochtim in this great city of ours? Can any one tell us why the rabbis instead of giving orders to the Schochtim as to what to do and what not to do, negotiate with them, meet them on equal ground, and act as if they were dependent on the Schochtim, while in fact the Schochtim are dependent on them? Is it weakness on the part of the rabbis, or is it false modesty, or what? What have the rabbis to say on the subject? What have the rabbis to say in justification of their attitude?</p>
