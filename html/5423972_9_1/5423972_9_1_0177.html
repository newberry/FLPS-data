   <p>Your so-called leaders have sordidly intrigued against you; they want to impose upon you an everlasting, ignominious stain which will go down in the annals of Jewish history. They want to isolate you (the soundest part of our people) from our sacred undertakings. They want to exclude you from Jewish polities!</p>
   <p>Will you permit this? Will you obediently and naively bow before the will of intriguing leaders? Will you act as blind tools in their hands?</p>
   <p>We hope not! We trust that your interest in your people and your volition to aid them in these unpredecedented times is as fresh and strong now as it has been in the past. We are therefore certain that you will support the Jewish Congress.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Jewish workers will be represented at the Jewish Congress. The National Socialist Workers Committee will attend the Congress, representing 400 progressive labor organizations and 150 organized Jewish workers.</p>
   <p>Jewish workers of America! Join this Committee. Come to the Jewish Congress regardless of your leaders and participate in it with your entire energy and see to it that it expresses the historical world of the Jewish people in America, concerning the destiny of the Jewish people throughout the world.</p>
   <p>Jewish workers! The Jewish people are depending upon you. The Jewish people are awaiting your word.</p>
   <p>Awake!</p>
   <p>Fraternally yours,</p>
   <p>National Socialist Labor Committee</p>
