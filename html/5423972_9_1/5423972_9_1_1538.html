   <p>The following is a schedule showing the number of applicants cared for by the department, who applied for service, either in acquiring their first papers or their final naturalization papers: From 1914 to 1917, 2,000 applicants were taken care of; in 1919, 1,100 were assisted in securing first papers and 2,500 their second papers; in 1920, 2,200 persons were interviewed during the year. Out of these, 700 were assisted in obtaining their first papers; 500 for second papers and 1,100 were given miscellaneous advice. In 1921, 1,464 persons applied to the department; in 1923, 303 individuals applied for naturalization service; in 1925, there were 450 new registrants and a total number of 1,600 visitors; in 1926, there were 572 new registrants and an attendance of 1,466 for the year; in 1927, the registration was 280 with an approximate yearly attendance of 2,500.</p>
   <p>After the passage of the Cable Act in 1920, women do not assume the rights <span class="page-break">2</span>of citizenship upon marriage with an American citizen, but are privileged to file application for second papers without first making a Declaration of Intention.</p>
   <p>The following case cared for by the Bureau is illustrative of this: Mrs. B. a married woman of fifty-five, whose husband was to receive his final naturalization papers within about three months, refused to wait for filing her second papers after her husband became a citizen, but wished to go through the whole process of naturalization herself, even to the extent of waiting two years for her second papers. She rather desired the experience of becoming a citizen in her own right and did not worry about passing the examination or being held up by the court, but had full faith that her intention would be realized.</p>
   <p>Many interesting cases of a similar nature have come to the attention of the Bureau. In a Citizenship Class, one of the students seemed extraordinarily happy to learn the fact that while the President of the United States must be a natural born citizen, the son of an alien may be President.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>His teacher was inclined to think that the man was the father of some bright son, or more than one child. To his amazement he discovered, upon inquiry, that the man was an old bachelor who had no children, but who still was delighted with the opportunities that may have been his, or of one in his position.</p>
   <p>Since 1920, the people who have come to this country seem to be much more anxious to become citizens than the immigrants who came here before the war. Aliens who have arrived at these shores after the war, neglect no opportunity in filing their Declaration of Intention and making application for their final papers as soon as possible. We do not seem to know exactly where we are with references to our immigration status. The whole immigration situation is a muddle. It is bad enough at its best and we hope the time will come, let us hope it will come very soon, when this entire immigration situation will be stabilized. Literally hundreds of bills have been brought up in Congress during these eight or more years. Hardly a day or week passes by when some Congressman does not introduce <span class="page-break">4</span>a new bill in connection with the immigration problem. A new bill combining the two per cent quota law on the basis of the 1890 census and the National Origins Act was introduced in the Senate by Senator Watson of Indiana. The bill, while it introduces the quota system for the Western Hemisphere, would change the immigration law to provide greater flexibility so that separation of families may be avoided and would authorize the Department of Labor to admit 10,000 immigrants from Canada and the endorsement of Secretary Davis. The new feature of the bill is the creation of family vises. A provision is incorporated by which immigration vises would be allowed to families as a unit. A man would not be allowed to get a vise unless it included also his wife and minor children under eighteen years of age. One year is the maximum length of time that would be allowed for a vise, except that it would not be allowed for a longer period than the vise granted to the father.</p>
   <p>The minimum quota would be fixed at 2,000 for Canada and Mexico, Newfoundland, <span class="page-break">5</span>Nova Scotia, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and the Independent countries of Central and South America. Otherwise they would be permitted a quota each year fixed at not exceeding ten per cent of the total number of the nationality of each country in the United States in 1890. An alternative basis is provided for fixing quotas from other countries, by which they may be determined either at two per cent of 1890, as at present, or on the basis of the national origins, whichever admits the greater number.</p>
   <p>Students would be treated as non-immigrants instead of non-quota immigrants, as at present, and the matter of a bond for them would be within the discretion of the Department of Labor. Wives and dependent minor children of aliens who were admitted to the United States for permanent residence prior to July 1, 1924, would receive non-quota status to the extent of 30,000 in number. This is to take care of a situation in which many families become separated. Applications would have to be filed by relatives on this side.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Additional classes that would receive preference in the quota law would include those in whose behalf contract labor provisions of the immigration acts have been waived and members of the recognized learned professions, their wives and dependent children. Preference would be granted only where authorized by the Secretary on the showing that their services were needed in the United States.</p>
