   <p>A meeting of the delegates of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations was held in the Beth Hamidrash [study room] of the 85th Street Synagogue on Wednesday evening. Dr. Drachman is the rabbi of the congregation. There were a few out-of-town rabbis.</p>
   <p>Many subjects were discussed, but only a few resolutions were adopted. Dr. Mendes praised the Albert Lucas classes and deplored the meager support given to the religious centers started by Dr. Lucas. Mr. Hirschfield criticized the downtown Orthodox Jews for their indifference to the Talmud Torahs. Mr. Hirschfield was appointed a committee of one to investigate the subject.</p>
   <p>Speaking about kasruth [observance of the dietary laws] Dr. Mendes said: "The high vitality of the Jewish race is due to the fact that our laws are stricter than the state laws with regard to the care and slaying of animals. It is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>suggested that a special sign be issued to those keepers of restaurants who will allow inspectors appointed by a committee of rabbis to visit their places. A kosher restaurant will then be distinguishable from a nonkosher one.</p>
   <p>"We have discovered," continued Dr. Mendes, "that the marriage and divorce laws are being infringed upon by certain rabbis--particularly those who arrived recently from Russia. In different parts of the United States, for example, cousins are not allowed to marry; under Jewish law this is permitted. No rabbi may grant a divorce unless it has been previously sanctioned by the State. Some of our rabbis are ignorant of this fact also. We have appointed a committee to deal with the present conditions."</p>
   <p>[Rabbi Mendes also pointed out that] "unless our hospitals and orphanages are conducted in accordance with Jewish requirements there is no reason for their separate existence: they should not pose as Jewish institutions. To do so is false. This matter should be acted upon with vigor."</p>

   <p>A survey of all the activities of the Union was then presented--Dr. Mendes adding explanations. When the assembly was ready to consider the internal affairs of the Union the hour was late; it was time to adjourn the meeting.</p>
