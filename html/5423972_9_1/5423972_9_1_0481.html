   <p>Ground for the splendid new House of Worship for Temple Mizpah will be broken this coming Sunday, June 3, 1923. The Temple will cost a quarter of a million dollars.</p>
   <p>Temple Mizpah is one of the youngest of Chicago's Jewish congregations and one of the most enterprising. Its membership is drawn from the newer Jewish settlement in Rogers Park. The Temple is located at Morse and Ashland Avenues.</p>
   <p>The unique feature of this occasion will be the Sunday School children, numbering over three hundred, participating in the ceremonies of digging, all dressed in overalls and with shovels in hand.</p>
   <p>David Labowitch is president of the Congregation and Maurice Spitzer is the architect for this new edifice.</p>
