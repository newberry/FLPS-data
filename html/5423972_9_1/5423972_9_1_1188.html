   <p>Plans are under way for the organization of a Chicago branch of the Hebrew Veterans of the Wars of the Republic. It is an organization composed of veterans of the Jewish faith who served in the Civil War, the Spanish War, the Philippine Insurrection, the Boxer Rebellion in China, and in the great World War.</p>
   <p>It was originally founded by the Jewish survivors who fought for the Union during the Civil War, and was the outgrowth of a storm of anti-Semitism which swept this country in the eighties, when the Jew was assailed as a coward, and as one who reaps all the benefits and privileges from a liberal government; but never aids nor offers his life or fortune to defend his country in time of war.</p>
   <p>To repudiate these malicious and slanderous aspersions against the Jews, this organization was founded. It is neither military nor semi-military in character. It is an after the war organization of all who served during any of the wars of the nation.</p>
