   <p>Dr. Emil G. Hirsch opened the winter season for the People's Synagogue in Ziegfeld's Theater where services are held every Sunday, and a prominent rabbi lectures on Jewish questions.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch dedicated his sermon to the youth who have discarded orthodoxy and are sailing upon the waters of paganism without a religious anchor, and he made a strong appeal to those who are not associated with any synagogue, that they should, at least, study the Jewish literature, acquaint themselves with the Jewish past, with Jewish morale and conditions, before digressing from Judaism.</p>
   
   <p>"Perhaps you, youth, will find something in Judaism worth while clinging to; there are so many attractions in the reform or liberal Judaism, that it should justify every man, with a will to be good, to remain within the ranks and help to triumph," the Rabbi of Sinai Temple declared to his audience.</p>
   <p>"Do not think," he continued, "that Judaism merely consists of the temple, dietary food laws, circumcision, or other rituals that you may or may not follow. Judaism delves into righteousness, morality, doing right, and other things to which every Jewish young man can devote his life, as Isaiah and Amos declared in their Godly books.</p>
   
   <p>"There are many eaters of pork among orthodox and reform Jews but this does not make them reformed and liberal Jews. I, myself, do not eat any swine, but this does not make me an orthodox Jew. The difference between reformism and orthodoxy is a matter of Judaism, whether it is a mission to the world or a remembrance of the past.</p>
   <p>"To the former the getting of Palestine is not a necessity. If they will be able to attain that goal - so much to the good, if not, Judaism can be spread in any other place. Orthodoxy is merely a remembrance of the past, and it is understood that everything that is old is very dear. Palestine is requisite to orthodoxy, because every step there is a remembrance of the ancient Hebrews. Political Zionism is separate from the orthodox will, and it is not related to the religious will of orthodoxy. Reform Judaism does not pertain to these two wings of Judaism.</p>
   
   <p>"Let us devote to these two classes that which is neglected by them both. Let us spread God's word far and wide. Let us adhere to the Judaism preached by Isaiah and Amos. May everyone do good in his own way and all together make Judaism complete, which can be called true Judaism."</p>
