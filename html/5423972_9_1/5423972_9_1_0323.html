   <p>In the editorial notes, Dr. Hirsch comments on the Congress of Jewish women, which is to convene here in September, in connection with the Parliament of Religions.</p>
   <p>He mentions it is perhaps the first time in our history that Jewish women will take part in religious conferences. It would not be to our credit if the voice of Jewish women were not heard giving witness to their faith, when all other denominations will call to the platform the chosen representatives of their women.</p>
   <p>The program of the Women's Congress is so arranged as to present in essays and papers the history of Jewish womanhood, its work and its share in the Jewish home and religious life and its duty and outlook now.</p>
