   <p>Please print the following in your children's section:</p>
   <p>We, the pupils of Shaari Tzedek School, 3221 Altgelt Street, which is under the supervision of Samuel Schnitzer, have organized a club under the name of Bnai Israel Club. It is our aim to become interested in Jewish problems and, above all, to learn what other children are doing for the war victims. We have decided to take some money from our treasury and send it to our unfortunate brothers and sisters abroad.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>The Officers.</p>
