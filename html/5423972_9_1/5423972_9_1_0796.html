   <p>Now that the Kehilah has a formal existence and an administrative machinery which could be active, its chosen representatives must begin to function. When the iron is hot, strike.</p>
   <p>The elected executive of the Kehilah should lose no time, nor should it neglect its work. An office must be opened at once; a diligent and capable secretary, or bureau director, should be engaged immediately to prepare the groundwork for the large transactions which the Kehilah must undertake.</p>
   <p>As soon as these technical difficulties are solved, the executive of the Kehilah must direct its attention to three outstanding problems--finances, a membership drive, and a home for the Kehilah--in order to inject blood and life into the new organization.</p>
   <p>It is self-evident that the Kehilah cannot exist from the income of the present per capita tax. On the other hand, the congregations cannot be called upon for larger contributions until they have seen some practical work. And even should the congregations offer to treble their per capita tax, still the new organization would not be able to exist on this alone. Naturally there will and must come a time when the Kehilah will be self-supporting and will not have to depend upon the kindness of private individuals.</p>
   <p>Thus far, it is forced to accept aid from individuals in order to start the work, and the quicker it obtains the necessary assistance, the better. The main responsibility for finances rests now with the executive, so that the representatives of the Kehilah will not be dependent upon, nor under the influence of anyone. It means that the Kehilah must be financed by many persons who will contribute relatively small sums, rather than by a few individuals who will give large contributions. It is easy to find in Chicago a hundred Jews, willing to contribute a hundred dollars a year to the Kehilah for a period of three years, and fifty Jews who would be able to give fifty dollars a year.</p>
   <p>This is hardly enough to finance the Kehilah because it needs larger sums. But, as soon as it begins to function, new and legitimate sources of income will be found which will enable the Kehilah to proceed with its work.</p>
   <p>Of course, we hope for the best; we hope that the problem of finances will be solved and that the wheel of the Kehilah will begin to turn. Then what? As yet the Kehilah represents only five or six thousand orthodox individuals who are organized in congregations. But there are in Chicago 250,000 Jews, and if the Kehilah is to become powerful, it must represent many more Jews as they are organized now, in orthodox congregations, or it will remain merely a clique. To represent large groups of Jews, a membership drive must be made, and we are convinced that it will not be at all difficult to double the membership of the congregations. So far, there are only between five and six thousand orthodox families identified with organized congregations. Figuring five persons to a family, it would mean that the Kehilah represents approximately 25,000 persons, which is one tenth of the whole Jewish population of Chicago. Should the Kehilah, as a result of the drive, double its membership, it would then represent 50,000 Jews and would become numerically, therefore, the most powerful Jewish organization in Chicago and the supreme authority in Jewish public life. Then its numbers would gradually increase, for it is the weakness of human nature to join the numerically superior group. The Kehilah, therefore, has the opportunity of becoming the "assimilative power" i. e., the power that would attract and assimilate many indifferent Jews to its fold.</p>
   <p>To become the assimilative power, it must, with all of its energy, immediately undertake the task of doubling its membership; in this way, it would, of course, improve its financial, not to mention its moral situation because the strong, successful and powerful command respect. This, however, does not yet complete the work.</p>
   <p>The Kehilah cannot be content merely with an office, a secretary and a few stenographers. It must have a home, a beautiful home. The Beth Din, the library of the Kehilah and the meeting place of the executive officers of the various branches, such as the board of education, the board of Kashruth (dietary laws) and that of the Beth Din (religious court) should all be concentrated within the Kehilah home. It must be the gathering place of men of knowledge and science, authors and Jewish civic leaders of Chicago. It must be a sort of a Jewish "city hall". Each congregation must become a partner in the home of the Kehilah and must contribute a certain sum of money in order to participate in its activities. Each congregation must consider itself a partner in all of the property of the Kehilah. Sometimes a partner becomes irritated and angry for a moment; he feels as though he has been insulted. Nevertheless he sticks and does not abandon his property. Through the mutual partnership of each congregation in the property of the Kehilah, the relationship of the individual congregation to the Kehilah will be placed on a concrete basis and both will become an organic entity.</p>
   <p>These three problems: financing the Kehilah, doubling its membership and giving it a home, must be solved immediately. If its representatives are energetic and wish to strike the iron while it is hot, they will undertake the work without delay.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the chairman of the convention to call a meeting at once in order to elect officers, to organize an advisory board, and to proceed with the work. When the masses see that the executive of the Kehilah is producing results, it will give sufficient moral and financial support to enable the executive to appear before the delegates who elected it, with a consciousness of pride [in their work].</p>
   <p>[Editor's note: Kehilah is the Hebrew term applied to the organized Jewish community of any city or town.]</p>
