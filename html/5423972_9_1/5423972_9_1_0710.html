   <p>Human progress never moves in a straight line. It is always zigzagging, because human passions and human sentiments are subject to the influence of a thousand and one anonymous forces. Neither the masses nor the classes follow any abstract principle, but are moved by certain occurrences which cannot be foreseen by any statesman, for destiny has its own reason, that cannot always be understood. History has witnessed the most peculiar spectacles. It certainly was an extraordinary happening when the French feudal lords volunteered to give up their prerogatives and privileges; and it is also a queer spectacle, a peculiar exhibition of historical unreasonableness, to see workingmen defending the interests of the higher classes, or to see atheists making common cause with the church and defending it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>All these things are possible, because human beings never follow abstract principles and because life has always proven to be stranger than mere theories. As a matter of fact, humanity is never moved by an abstract principle but by certain psychological motives which in their turn are the product of overdoing or of underdoing things, and hence the reactions in history. Only 13 years ago France passed a law separating the church from the state and abrogating the Concordate concluded by Napoleon with the heads of the Roman Catholic Church. As a result of the adoption of this law, France confiscated the wealth of the French church, limited the powers of religious associations, expelled thousands of monks and nuns from her territory and made the clergy powerless. The liberals were jubilant, and the clericals, were infuriated, and the belief was prevalent that France and the church would be separated from one another. But now, France, atheistic, anti-religious, and irreligious, has again made up with the church, and only the other day a Papal Nuncio arrived in Paris to take <span class="page-break">3</span>charge of the diplomatic business of the church in the French capital. The French government has sent an ambassador to the Vatican, and the Catholic Church and the French Republic are again on friendly terms.</p>
   <p>England, where Roman Catholicism was taboo only a few years ago has also made up with the church. There is an English representative at the Vatican and a Vatican representative in London, Hungary, Austria, Germany and all the other newly established republics, although anti-religious or at least estranged from the church, are today on the best of terms with the Vatican. Two years ago, a Jewish liberal statesman was at the head of the Bavarian government and Bavaria was to all practical intents and purposes a radical country. Today there is a Papal Nuncio in Munich and it is this Papal Nuncio who is determining and shaping the course of Bavarian politics. From the point of view of diplomatic standing and diplomatic associations, the Roman Catholic Church has never been so strong as it is today, after so many catastrophes and revolutions.</p>

   <p>The reaction in every country is affecting every country's relation with the Vatican, and the Vatican is making the most of this reaction against the radical currents. Of course, it is none of our concern whether the Roman Catholic Church wields great power or not. It is none of our business whether the Vatican is on friendly terms with all the nations or not, because we as Jews are not interested in the Catholic Church at all. We have no relation with its dogmas and its articles of belief, its policies and its method of action, just as we have no relation with Buddhism or any other religion of salvation. However, the Roman Catholic Church has some relation to us. The Roman Catholic Church has always pursued a certain policy towards the Jews and this policy was always one of hospitality. It is for this reason that we ought to take notice of the rise or decline of the powers of the Vatican. After all, it cannot be immaterial to us whether the most powerful organization in the world, holding its grip on tens of millions of believers, is powerful politically or not. If it were not for the anti-Semitic traditions <span class="page-break">5</span>of the Roman Catholic Church we would not be at all interested in its political development and its accumulation of power, but since the Roman Catholic Church is a source of anti-Semitic energy, we must take notice of its accumulation of power at the time when anti-Semitism is supreme all over the world. While we have no relation to the Roman Catholic Church as a religion, and we are disinterested in it from a purely religious point of view, we are not disinterested in it from a political point of view; we cannot possibly be enthused by its power because the more power the church accumulates the more the Jews suffer in Roman Catholic countries.</p>
   <p>The political rise of the church is symptomatic and indicative of the general political reaction in Europe, and we are very much afraid that we will be the first victims of this reaction. That is the reason we have to take notice of this development and to be on the watch.</p>
