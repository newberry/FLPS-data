   <p>The Jewish representatives, ministers, and rabbis were duly assembled at Columbus Hall, Art Building, Lake Front, last Sunday, when they were greeted by the Chairman, Dr. Charles C. Bonney, who directs all religious denominational congresses (for the World's Fair.)</p>
   <p>It was a gathering of great moment for the Jews. Never before in the world's history have they been invited to come out openlyand proclaim before the other religions of the earth the faith that is in them. This fact, and the toleration and growing spirit of brotherhood which it indicates, were favorably commented upon by all speakers.</p>
   <p>President Bonney was accompanied to the platform by Rabbi I. L. Leucht, New Orleans; Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, Chicago; Rabbi Isaac M. Wise, Cincinnati; Rabbi G. Gottheil, and Rabbi K. Kohler, New York.</p>
