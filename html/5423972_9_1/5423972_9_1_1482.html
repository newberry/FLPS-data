   <p>The history of how the Jewish pioneers of Chicago settled and expanded, building along strict Jewish community life, reads like an endless story. Every step these pioneers made was connected with self sacrifice, the true idealistic sacrifice.</p>
   <p>The obtaining of matzohs, for instance, was for the Jewish pioneers of Chicago one of the most difficult tasks. The method of baking matzohs in those days was very primitive. Sometimes they had to be imported from other cities many weeks or months in advance.</p>
   <p>The Manishevitz's Matzoh firm, of Cincinnatti, was the first to supply the Chicago Jews with matzohs [unleavened bread] and other matzoh products.</p>
   <p>Thirty-six years ago, when the Manishevitz's Matzoh bakery was first founded and became known far and wide among the Jews in America, Chicago was one of the first communities to send for many orders of its products.</p>
