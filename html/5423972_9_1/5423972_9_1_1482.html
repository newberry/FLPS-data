  <p>A year ago the Jews of Chicago celebrated the 70th anniversary of their community.</p>
  <p>The Chicago Jewish Community is one of the oldest ones and the history of its development clearly reflects the remarkable feats and events which have glorified the entire history of the American Jewry.</p>
  <p>Seventy years ago Chicago had but a handful of Jews, who laid down the foundation for its present quarter million Jewish population.</p>
  <p>The first Jewish pioneers of Chicago brought with them not only the wish and ambition to fortify themselves materially, but also the idea of implanting the beautiful Jewish traditions and the ancient ways of living which they had borne in their hearts.</p>
  <p>The Jewish pioneers of Chicago no sooner had started in business than they began organizing synagogues, societies, Talmud Torahs [Hebrew schools], and
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> the faster the Jewish population grew the stronger the Jewish spirit became and the more sincere their consciousness.</p>
   <p>The history of how the Jewish pioneers of Chicago settled and expanded, building along strict Jewish community life, reads like an endless story. Every step these pioneers made was connected with self sacrifice, the true idealistic sacrifice.</p>
   <p>The obtaining of matzohs, for instance, was for the Jewish pioneers of Chicago one of the most difficult tasks. The method of baking matzohs in those days was very primitive. Sometimes they had to be imported from other cities many weeks or months in advance.</p>
   <p>The Manishevitz's Matzoh firm, of Cincinnatti, was the first to supply the Chicago Jews with matzohs [unleavened bread] and other matzoh products.</p>
   <p>Thirty-six years ago, when the Manishevitz's Matzoh bakery was first founded and became known far and wide among the Jews in America, Chicago was one of the first communities to send for many orders of its products.</p>
