   <p>The inevitable took place. The two basically different factions who comprised the National Labor Committee in Chicago split in two at their convention on Sunday.</p>
   <p>One group consists of free, independent, nationally conscious Jewish workers who seek above all to solve the involved Jewish Question. For this reason they wish to convoke a Jewish Peoples Congress at which the people, the broad Jewish masses, shall be able to decide their own fate.</p>
   <p>The opponents are Jews who in their hearts think they are Gentiles--Jews who deny their racial origin--Jews who seek to "fraternize" with Wall Street to spite the Jewish democrats - or Jews who play politics at the expense of their own group interests.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The resolutions themselves emphasized and reflected the sentiments of the two groups.</p>
   <p>Now the speeches! [There were explanations and analyses of] the resolutions of the majority who are the opponents of the Congress, and of the minority, the nationalistically minded workers.</p>
   <p>In their speeches the defenders of the minority opinion voiced their support of a Jewish Congress where the united [Jewish masses can seek the solution for the problems and conditions created by the War].</p>
   <p>In the opponent's speeches however, could be heard this idiotic argument, "We need not merge with anyone. Neither with Wall Street, nor with the Peoples Congress." In simple language this means, "I'll risk the chance of losing one eye provided you lose both."</p>
   <p>On the other hand, their earlier flowery [statements about "unity"] were merely a piece of rhetoric that no one takes seriously. [Perhaps they mean] that the <span class="page-break">3</span>people should be united like a herd of oxen under the leadership of the Baranovs and the Goldfarbs - the "pious cats" of the Jewish speaking working class - united [like oxen in dumb submission and acquiescence].</p>
   <p>Naturally [such "unity"] could not be imposed upon free people, or upon loyal, radical Jews, and the split took place.</p>
   <p>Certainly, the Forward (Jewish newspaper) Jews will seek to eliminate this half of the Jewish working class. They will try to ridicule the minority. They will spit on them with their anti-Semitic derision, their venom, and their [malicious] "Kibitzing." They will do all this as is their habit.</p>
   <p>Yet we have great faith in the sober intelligence of the Jewish workers who will not allow themselves to be deceived by idiotic arguments, and will not allow themselves to be dragged into such a political concoction. This is neither a matter of party principles nor even of class. This matter concerns the interests of the entire Jewish nation, of all classes and parties. Personal squabbles are now out of place. The worker, the banker, [every sincere Jew] must ask his <span class="page-break">4</span>leaders to postpone their "spite" conferences and congresses until more appropriate times. Let them play politics at their own expense, or at the expense of their parties, but positively not at the expense of Jewish tears, Jewish anxiety and Jewish blood.</p>
   <p>We are not in need of any leaders regardless of what parties they represent. We don't need such "cosmopolitan idlers" now. Now we are Jews first, and Jews above everything. And the unfortunate Jewish nation must have its word now.</p>
