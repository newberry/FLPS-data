   <p>should be no confusion between the Orthodox rabbis, or as he calls them, "West Side Rabbis", and the Reform. He fears that the Gentiles may forget the difference between synagogue and temple. And he raises his voice in the following amusing manner:</p>
   <p>"Little or no notice at all was taken by the daily press of the Decoration Day services that were held by the Reform congregations of Chicago; yet glaring and blazing headlines topped the newspaper columns reporting the services that were held on the West Side in the Orthodox synagogues. Here is proof that the West Side element has the 'ear' of the press and has access to the 'keyholes' of the newspaper. We have no objections to this, if the press will only realize the situation, and if the public does not get the impression that the Chicago Jewry consists only of the Jews on the West Side."</p>
   <p>That would in truth be a fatal danger! Imagine what would happen if, God forbid, the Gentile public were to forget for one moment that the West Side Jew is of the same extraction as the South Side Jew or the North Side Jew! Is there any question as to what Gentiles can do--they may even fabricate a <span class="page-break">\3</span>story that all Jews come from Shnipishok (a satirical name for a Russian town) and that there are no Bavarian or Luxemburg Jews; or they can invent another, that all Jews are opposed to oysters and to American pork; and that would be very unpatriotic in the present war days. And so the learned rabbi comes and makes the following precautionary statement: "Fear not, Your Majesty, we are not West Siders; we are cleansed, combed, decorous Jews of the 'temple'. And you, gentlemen of the press, should know that you must differentiate between them, the West Side Jews, and us of the 'temple'. And the fact that you have not mentioned our services but instead have loudly publicized the services on the West Side, proves that you listen too much to the West Side."</p>
   <p>And as the venerable rabbi assures us, a calamity has already occurred. No less a personage than Mr. Jenkin Lloyd Jones has actually made such an error. Mr. Jones seems to think that all the rabbis of Chicago participated in the summons to a convocation at the synagogues on Decoration Day for prayer and fasting, which summons was printed in the daily newspapers! On the other <span class="page-break">\4</span>hand, listen to what Mr. Jenkin Lloyd Jones writes in his Unity:</p>
   <p>"The Jewish rabbis have given credence to the President's proclamation by a special appeal to the Jews of Chicago to make this Memorial Day a day of fasting and prayer. With a somewhat marvelous sense of appreciation for exchanging spiritual values for material ones, they presented the commercial equivalent of the traditional expression of piety--giving charity instead of fasting. They decreed that the one who cannot or will not fast, should contribute money to a certain war fund."</p>
   <p>Mr. Jenkin Lloyd Jones finds an analogy in the enactment of the rabbis to the enactment of the Pope in the time of Luther, who sold "condonation, forgiveness, absolution" written on pieces of parchment. He thinks, however, that a "commercialized prayer" may have a certain spiritual value.</p>
   <p>The remarks of Mr. Jones evidently cut Rabbi Schoenfarber to the quick. The idea of accusing Reform rabbis of such a thing! Therefore, in the very earnest manner of such a rabbi, he assures Mr. Jones that the Reform rabbis <span class="page-break">\5</span>are not guilty of dealing in "commercialized prayers"; and had Mr. Jones taken the trouble to investigate the matter, he would have found that it was the West Side rabbis who committed this dastardly act and not the Reform rabbis. And he further says that it is high time that the press knew the difference, etc.</p>
   <p>We can to some extent understand why Mr. Jenkin Lloyd Jones does not see the connection between fasting, and giving "redemption money" (in form of charity) in lieu of a sacrifice. Mr. Jones is a Christian, and the Christian religion is based mainly on faith alone: "Faith brings eternal bliss". But with a Jew, faith without good deeds holds no value. To substitute an essentially good deed for a prayer is quite in keeping with the spirit of good Judaism. If Rabbi Schoenfarber knew the passage in the Scriptures "And each one shall give the redemption of his soul" (Kofer means redemption by substituting something else in its place), he would not need to go to such extremes to make excuses before Mr. Jones. Nor would he consider the acts of the West Side rabbis so improper as to need excuses. It seems to us that it is not at all fitting that he should excuse himself before Mr. Jones with the words: "We <span class="page-break">\6</span>were not the ones; the West Side Jews did it." Instead it would have been much more fitting to say to Mr. Jones that the West Side Jews did a fine thing in accordance with the spirit of Judaism, which places the good deed above the good intention; and that his analogy of the "condonation, forgiveness, absolution" slips (of parchment) of the Pope during Luther's time is as much in place here as is a square peg in a round hole. But the excuses do not come from the West Side.</p>
