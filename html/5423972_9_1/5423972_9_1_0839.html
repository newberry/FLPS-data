   <p>In the Kneses Israel Shul (synagogue), 1500 N. Maplewood Avenue, they will today install Rabbi Buruch Zundel Margolin who for sometime has been Rabbi in Brooklyn. He was invited to accept the spiritual leadership of this congregation. He brought with him splendid recommendations from fellow Rabbis in Greater New York who expressed the hope that Kneses Israel Congregation will appreciate his worth and respect him accordingly.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Margolin is a Rabbi from the "Old Home" (Europe), a God-fearing person, and a good speaker. His settling in Chicago is a decided gain for the local Orthodox Jewry. The local Rabbis will certainly not fail to attend the installation ceremony, which begins sharply at three o'clock, to be followed in the evening by a banquet given at the Talmud Torah Hall.</p>
