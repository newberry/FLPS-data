   <p>Jewish life in the United States has entered a new phase. With the sudden cessation of immigration and the practical disappearance of the green horn, the Jewish masses are rapidly becoming Americanized, not assimilated, acclimatized best describes what is going on. If by assimilation we mean the sloughing of those pecularities that constitute our Jewishness, if the word is taken to mean intermarriage and all that this conveys then we are just as far from that as we were thirty years ago. Acclimatized, however, is another thing.</p>
   <p>Wherever Jews have lived for the past two thousand years and more, they have not failed to acclimatize their Jewish life. Living under the Romans and the Greek was different from being in ancient Palestine. Jewish life in Spain, in France, in Italy, in Poland, and now in America, has borne the unique characteristics of every age and every clime.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>And yet the golden chain was not broken. Each generation continued to carry on. The Jews have changed their language many times, adopting and adapting new Jargons suited to their peculiar needs; they have changed their manners and their occupations, their gebardines and their ideas, but they did not cease to be Jews. We have little to fear from acclimatization in America. The American Jews will doubtless look, talk, and act differently from their Polish or Russian brethren, but only outwardly. Intrinsically and essentially the Jew in the United States will be just as Jewish as the Polish or Russian Jew.</p>
   <p>But this process of acclimatization is not a painless one, nor is it unattended by grave dangers, unless care be exercised. When old wine is poured into new bottles, something of the precious bouquet is lost, if the work be not done by patient and loving workers.</p>
   <p>It is to the credit of the Workermen's Circle the great Jewish Fraternal <span class="page-break">3</span>order, that it has seriously tackled the problem in a way that augers well for its solution. Alone of the many Jewish orders the Workmen's Circle has attacked the job in a workmanlike manner, courageously and sanely.</p>
   <p>A bridge must be built to open the river of time which separates the European born fathers from their American-born sons. A technique, somehow, must be evolved, a way found, to unite present day American-Jewish life with the idealism of the older generation of Jewish radicals. How shall such harmony be produced between two generations, two distinct, if not conflicting, worlds? How make the father understand his native American son and how prove, to the modern Jewish youth, that his father brought from the Old World spiritual values which deserve to be respected and preserved? Upon the answer depends a great deal.</p>
   <p>With all my soul, I am convinced that the American-Jew of the future will be a poor individual indeed, unless he becomes imbued with the ideals his father bore so gloriously and unselfishly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>American-Jewish life of the next twenty-five or fifty years will be vulgar and stupid, devoid of beauty and meaning, if the children of the first generation come empty handed into the national life.</p>
   <p>It is by no means surprising that the Workmen's Circle has undertaken the task of building the bridge between the old and young generations, forging the golden chain that shall unite in a bond of mutual understanding and love the fathers and the sons, the immigrants and the natives. For what other Jewish organization of national scope is so suited to do this work than the Workmen's Circle?</p>
   <p>From every part of the United States the demand has arisen among members of the Workmen's Circle that junior leagues be organized at once for the purpose of training the future membership of this splendid Jewish order. This demand is growing more insistent daily. At the last convention a resolution empowering the home office to begin the work was almost unanimously adopted and this decision was ratified by an overwhelming majority of the membership.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>There are too many indications that the native-born children of Jewish immigrant will fall a prey to cheap "Americanization" unless they be taken in hand at an early age. The moral obtuseness of so many native-born Jews, their indifference to ideals, lack of understanding of politics, economics, literature, music, and social movements; their apathy to the finer things become all the more glaring when contrasted with fine sensitiveness of the Jewish student youth in Russia.</p>
   <p>To teach the Jewish youth in America to understand the world we live in, pride in the pioneering work of their fathers, a humanitarian point of view, - such is the task before the Workmen's Circle.</p>
   <p>Therefore the Jubilee Convention authorized the home office to set its machinery in motion organizing junior leagues. Membership in a junior league is now open to sons and daughters of Workmen's Circle members over the age of sixteen. The activities of these leagues should be exclusively social and educational and auxiliary to the parent organizations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The gatherings should be devoted to literary discussions, debates, entertainments, dances, theater parties, hikes and so forth. The home office is prepared to help the branches organize junior leagues with special literature, lecturers, organizers, and so forth. In this work the Labor Lyceum can be of the utmost assistance by providing necessary accomodations for the activities of these groups.</p>
   <p>Sons and daughters of Workmen's Circle members! prepare yourselves for the great task. Make yourselves worthy of taking over the magnificent endowment, the cherished ideals of your fathers; may they be safe in your lands! The Workmen's Circle of the future is beckoning you. Will you not respond to the call?</p>
