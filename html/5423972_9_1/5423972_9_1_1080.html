   <p>A special meeting called by Anshai Maariv Congregation, last Sunday afternoon, to inspect the new temple, drew nearly every member. The examination of the handsome structure, which is about ready for use, gave the highest satisfaction to all. No business was transacted. It was decided to resell all seats within four weeks of Rosh Hashonah. Until that time, commencing with, Shabbuoth, the directors will assign seats to pew-holders, corresponding as nearly as possible in position to their old seats. Diagrams of the seating arrangement will be sent to all members in due time, to enable them to choose the location of their pews in accordance with the appraisement that the directors will put thereon.</p>
