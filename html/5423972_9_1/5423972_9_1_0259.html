   <p>The first annual National Convention of the intercollegiate Menorah Societies was held at the University of Chicago during the recent Christmas vacation. On January 22d the banquet of the Convention took place. Among the guests were Rev. Jos. Stolz and Schanfarber and Emil Leipsiger, the latter of Terre Haute, Indiana; Mr. Max Blumberg, also of Terre Haute, Indiana; Mr. Hugo Friend, and Dr. A. Pedott.</p>
   <p>The Menorah Society of Chicago owes its present existence particularly to the untiring efforts of Mr. Ben Blumberg, its President. The Society is indirectly an outgrowth of the Maimonides Club, organized by Dr. Joseph Pedott in 1905. As far as we are informed, it was the first Jewish-Student organization at the University of Chicago. The Society did very effective work for some four or five years. We wish the present Menorah at the University of Chicago, great success.</p>
