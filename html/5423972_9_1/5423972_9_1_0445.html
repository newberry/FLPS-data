   <p>One of the big obstacles to a merger between the two charity organizations, the Federation of Jewish Charities and the Associated Jewish Charities was the problem of the Talmud Torahs, which received support from the Federation but in which the Associated was not interested. The representatives of the Federation succeeded, after a good deal of negotiation, in convincing the Associated Charities of the necessity to support the Talmud Torahs, of doing something for Jewish education in Chicago. The two charity organizations amalgamated under the name of the United Jewish Charities of Chicago. One of the main points in the program of the new organization was the development of Jewish education. The Charities started to work immediately. It appointed a committee of seven to devote itself to this work. This committee brought to Chicago the well-known Hebrew pedagogue and organizer, Dr. [Alexander] Dushkin, who had been the superintendent of Hebrew education in Palestine and had a national reputation as a pedagogue and an educational organizer. Dr. Dushkin, an Orthodox Jew and a Zionist, made a survey of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Talmud Torahs. He submitted his program to the board of directors of the Charities. The board adopted his program. He also made certain recommendations to the Charities about improving the existing Talmud Torahs. His recommendations were accepted.</p>
   <p>The rabbis suddenly became interested in the Talmud Torahs and attempted to form their own educational council.</p>
   <p>To the people who had watched the activities of the rabbis in connection with their educational council, it became clear at once that the activities of that council were directed against Dr. Dushkin as superintendent of the Talmud Torahs, and against the committee on education of the Charities. Rumors suddenly began to spread over town which indicated that the rabbis' opposition to the new order, which does not affect education itself, but only the physical and financial organization of education, was getting stronger, and that that opposition was causing bitterness among the representatives of the Charities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Some of the complaints of the rabbis were not entirely unjustified. The Charities should have called a conference with the representatives of Orthodox Jewry, to consult with them about the new order, to elect a city educational council, and so on. The representatives of the Charities, in their haste to introduce the new order, committed a few tactical blunders. All this contributed to the growth of bitterness against the Charities, and a strong opposition to their whole educational program arose.</p>
   <p>The publisher and the editor of the Courier, who wished to straighten out the differences and to bring peace, met two weeks ago with the representatives of the educational committee of the Charities at the chambers of Judge [Harry] Fisher, and discussed the situation with them. It was decided to call a conference of the representatives of the Talmud Torahs, rabbis, and prominent, influential citizens of the city. The conference was scheduled to take place last Tuesday at the office of the Joint Relief Committee. The conference took place under the chairmanship of the editor of the Courier. The problem was discussed at the conference, clearly and <span class="page-break">\4</span>sincerely, by Rabbis Saul Silber and Ephraim Epstein, and by Messrs. B. Horwich, James Davis, Mendel Zevin, Judge Fisher, and others. Rabbi Silber spoke on the organizational aspect and Rabbi Epstein on the religious. Both spoke sincerely and to the point. Rabbi Epstein declared that he was in favor of a theological education. Rabbi Silber demanded a community educational council because education is a community affair, rather than the affair of a single group.</p>
   <p>There was a long, heated, and interesting debate during which Messrs. Davis, Fisher, Horwich and Dr. Dushkin explained the point of view of the Charities. They steadfastly declared, innumerable times, that the committee on education of the Charities has no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of the Talmud Torahs because according to the constitution of the Charities, it has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of the institutions with which it is affiliated.</p>
   <p>After listening to this declaration, the conference adopted the proposal of <span class="page-break">\5</span>Mr. H. Steinberg that the conference appoint a committee of five--four prominent citizens and one rabbi--and that this committee shall agree upon a list of twenty names, out of which seven shall be selected by the Charities as members of the present committee on education. Everybody voted for the proposal, the rabbis as well as the laymen. Judge Fisher asked Rabbi Silber if the rabbis would now accept the program of the Charities for the reorganization and improvement of the Talmud Torahs. Rabbi Silber's reply to that question was a clear and distinct "yes". Rabbis Ezriel Epstein and Ephraim Epstein said nothing to the contrary. What is more, they voted in favor of the above-mentioned motion. Rabbi Ephraim Epstein then gave his blessings to the newly elected committee.</p>
   <p>The agreement was thus arrived at in an open, honest way after a frank debate on the whole problem. If the rabbis were not satisfied with the agreement, it was their duty to vote against the motion of Mr. Steinberg and to state what they wanted. They did not do so but voted for the motion. The Courier could congratulate itself upon the success of its efforts to bring peace.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Three rabbis, instead of getting busy at once with constructive work, went to the Lomza rabbi, Rabbi [Judah Leb] Gordon, who, being a newcomer to Chicago, is not yet well acquainted with local conditions, and informed him that a betrayal of Jewish youth to Reform Jewry is being contemplated, that the surrender of the Talmud Torahs to Reform is being considered, and so on. One of the rabbis who gave this report to the Lomza rabbi was one of the three rabbis who were present at the Tuesday conference and voted in favor of the peace agreement. The result of their visit was the decision of Rabbi Gordon, which was published in the Courier.</p>
   <p>The Courier worked for peace and it had reasons to believe that its efforts were successful. A new situation, however, arises as a result of that decision.</p>
   <p>Let the readers of the Courier now pass judgment upon this sad affair.</p>
