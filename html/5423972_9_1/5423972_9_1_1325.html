   <p>PALESTINIAN RALLY.</p>
   <p>The curiosity of the hundreds of the Young Judaeans, who have been awaiting the Palestinian Rally, will soon be satisfied. On Sunday afternoon at the Northwest Jewish People's Institute, 1243 North Wood Street, the secret will be let out. The editor after much persuasion, was let in on the secret, but she has sworn not to give it away.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>However, the secret is a nice one and the Young Judaeans will enjoy it. Just see that your leader gets you there and be on time as the program starts promptly at 2:30 p. m. After the rally is over the leaders will be entertained by the members of the B'nai Yehuda and Junior Dagania clubs and they are therefore requested to remain after the program is over. Remember the day, Sunday, February 12; the place, the Northwest Jewish People's Institute, and be prepared for one of the most entertaining events of the year.</p>

   <p>DEBATING LEAGUE.</p>
   <p>Are girls better debaters then boys? Is America destined to become the greatest Jewish educational center in the world? What center will have the honor of holding in its midst a champion debating team? Who will win the silver loving cup? All these questions will be answered next Sunday at the Palestinian rally, when the Beth Gan girls led by Bertha Degan, and the Ain Harod boys led by Sidney Acberman, will debate in the final round of the intermediate league.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Miss Degan and the other members of the clubs at Beth Itzchok are certain the girls will carry away the honors. The members of the Emek and Mr. Aikerman are just as certain that the honors will fall to the boys. It doesn't matter for whom you are rooting, the urgent item is to be there. It has taken several weeks to go through the elimination contests but now everyone is ready for the climax. Be sure to be present.</p>
   <p>REUNION DANCE.</p>
   <p>Former Young Judaeans and present workers and friends are looking forward with great eagerness to the evening of Saturday, February 18, for it is on that evening that Chicago's reunion dance will be held.
