   <p>In his annual report of the Hias in Chicago, the national president, Mr. Abraham Herman, declared that the agreement between the Hias, Ita, and the Emigdirect, in the joint work on immigration and emigration activities in the European countries and in the new immigrating countries, especially in the South American Republics, has been renewed for three more years. The uniting of these three organizations, known under the name of Hikess, brought such wonderful results to the Jewish wanderers, and proved such great possibilities for more active work in the near future, that the Hias overlooked the financial burden connected with this work and determined to continue the good work under the same agreement.</p>
   
   <p>At this occasion, happy reports were given of the many Jews who have settled in the new countries of migration, and who in a short time have succeeded in bringing across their families, and nearly all of whom are earning enough to send help to their relatives in Europe.</p>
   <p>In the European countries the immigrants are being helped, not only in preparing the various documents, contacting their consuls and arranging for their transportation, but also in teaching them a trade and a new language which will fit them for their new homeland.</p>
   
   <p>In the migration countries offices are operating that arrange to meet the wanderers, in the same manner as which the Hias acted in the United States for many years. They are given sleeping quarters and food, employment is found for them, and then they are assisted in settling down in the provinces. Courses in language and trades are free for them. They are helped with cash loans, (without interest) to buy tools, or to establish a small business.</p>
   <p>In the old homeland offices operate in the following countries. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Rumania, France, Belgium, and Holland. The wanderers of Russia are receiving service through the Riga and Charbin offices. In the new migration countries, offices, bureaus and committees are available in Cuba, Brazil, and Uraguay. In Canada the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society is connected with the Hikess.</p>
   
   <p>In normal times the immigration total reached to over sixty thousand a year - now on account of the limited quota, the total is about forty thousand each year. It would be much above this figure were it not for shortage of money and other hardships in the majority of cases. A half million dollars is needed for rescue work this year.</p>
   <p>The Hias needs no less than forty thousand dollars a year to serve immigration properly.</p>
   <p>The Hias now has a deficit of one hundred thousand dollars accumulated during the last few years. This year the Hias must have a half million dollars not to be forced to decrease its rescue work.</p>
   
   <p>Among the recommendations of President Herman are to demand the legalization of those who entered here before July 1, 1924, for whom there are no records of legal entrance.</p>
   <p>To protest against the planned registration laws the aim of which is to establish a passport system in the United States.</p>
   <p>To demand the acceptance of bills that are now in the hands of Congress, for the purpose of making immigration laws more humane.</p>
   <p>To take necessary steps to grant that half million dollars needed by the Hias to fulfill its task and to be relieved from its deficit.</p>
   
   <p>About forty thousand Jewish wanderers were served through the offices in Poland, Danzig, Latvia, Lithuania, Rumania, Belgium, Holland, Charbin, and China. All necessary documents were prepared for them.</p>
   <p>Ninety thousand dollars travelling expenses was saved for them. Offices are available in all the important cities of these countries.</p>
