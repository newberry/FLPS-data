   <p>The regular services are held daily with a very fair attendance. On Sabbath morning the attendance is unusually large. The Friday night services have been inaugurated and are held at 8:30 P.M. Rabbi David Almond of the Congregation will give a series of lectures on the subject (Zion Key to World Reconstruction). This series of lectures will be published shortly in book form. The daily Hebrew school classes have been recognized with a larger and more efficient staff of teachers. All residents are requested to enroll their children as soon as possible and avoid confusion. To our Sunday school classes have been added a few very able and competent teachers and we would hail all new pupils with the best results.</p>
