   <p>The Young People's League of the United Synagogue, Midwest Branch is a new organization in Chicago. It had its first conference here less than a year ago.</p>
   <p>The major problem facing Judaism and Jewry in America today is bringing the younger generation to the synagogue. That is the task of Y. P. L., and its efforts are receiving the co-operation of the conservative rabbis of Chicago and their congregations.</p>
   <p>A Youth's Night will be held on November 26, in all the conservative congregations in the city.</p>
