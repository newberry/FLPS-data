   <p>With the appointment of Chicago as the headquarters of the National Zionist Convention on September 14, the four Zionist districts here have become active. A vigorous membership campaign has been promoted in each district.</p>
   <p>A meeting of all active Zionists was held Monday evening at the headquarters of the Lawndale District, with Mr. Abrams acting as chairman.</p>

   <p>Various plans were proposed and accepted.</p>
   <p>A campaign committee of fifteen were chosen with Dr. Rosenzweig as chairman. The committee immediately decided to have a meeting of the best workers in the district on Thursday evening, to interest them in the campaign. The enthusiasm with which the Committee accepted responsibility gives us cause to hope for good results.</p>
   <p>Tuesday evening a meeting of the West Side District was held. Problems of the election of district officers and the election of delegates to the coming convention were discussed as well as the membership campaign.</p>
   <p>A membership committee of seven was elected with Philip P. Bragstone as its chairman; he was given full responsibility for the campaign. The campaign committee will hold its first meeting Thursday evening. A program of procedure will be outlined so that work may be begun immediately.</p>

   <p>Wednesday evening a membership meeting of the North West District was held, presided over by Mr. Lieberman.</p>
   <p>The secretary read a report of the district activities for the past few months. Considering its weak position, the report was very good.</p>
   <p>After the nomination committee read the names of those nominated for the coming election, the meeting was turned over to the membership director.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Steinberg appealed to those present to become active members from now on, not to be satisfied merely with paying two dollars a year. His words obtained the desired results. A large number of those present joined the active workers' ranks and took registration books.</p>
   <p>Following this appeal, Mr. Meyer Goldberg of New York was introduced. He asked that all those pledging their services should not neglect [the performance of] their duties.</p>

   <p>That same evening there was also a meeting of the Executive Committee of the South Side District. Mr. Phillips presided.</p>
   <p>In this district, too, the membership campaign was discussed with enthusiasm. After Mr. Samuel Blitz of New York explained the necessity for the campaign at this time, a committee of twelve was immediately elected for this purpose. Mr. S. W. Aidleman is chairman.</p>
   <p>Well, Chicago Jews are beginning to bestir themselves in order to raise themselves to the level for the Convention.</p>
   <p>June 29 has been set for the election of delegates to the coming [Zionist] Convention. Also, for the election of officers of the [Chicago] districts.</p>
   <p>All Zionists should know that delegates and officers may be nominated by petition. Twenty-five registered Zionists may nominate and bring their petition into their district [office] not later than next Tuesday evening.</p>
