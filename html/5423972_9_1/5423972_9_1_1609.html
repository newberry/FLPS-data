   <p>At a conference Thursday night at the Labor Lyceum, representatives of various labor organizations determined to carry on the work of helping people learn how to become citizens, and to begin a protest movement against the immigration laws that the reactionaries of this country are preparing to pass through Congress.</p>
   <p>Comrade Silverstein, delegate of branch 391, was elected chairman. Morris Siskind, delegate of the United Hebrew Trades, and comrades Rosenblum, Blumin and Yablonka comprise the Credential Committee. Comrade Levitas reported on the work of the Naturalization Aid League and comrade Weinberg gave a financial report. Comrade Siskind spoke on various bills proposed by both Houses of Congress restricting immigration and urging the deportation of immigrants who are not citizens. He strongly emphasized the necessity of organizing a strong protest movement against <span class="page-break">2</span>the passage of these laws.</p>
   <p>The conference accepted the following resolutions: We, the representatives of the labor organizations of Chicago, in conference assembled, express our protest against reactionary bills that are being laid before the Congress to restrict the immigration quota.</p>
   <p>All these laws propose to lock the gates of America to thousands of families and relatives of American citizens who want to enter this country and be saved from religious and political persecutions.</p>
   <p>We are also protesting against the movement going on in this country, to register immigrants in the United States, because every system of registrations is also a system of spying and persecution. All these planned immigration restrictions are un-American and contrary to American traditions.</p>
   <p>We call upon all organizations that are affiliated with this conference and all those who sympathize with the movement and urge them to start a <span class="page-break">3</span>strong campaign through the representatives of Congress and of the Senate and through other helpful sources to join us in the campaign against the planned cruelties of reactionaries.</p>
   <p>Comrades Yuretz Klapman and Gold, the lawyers who spent much of their time in the officer of the Naturalization Aid League to help the new citizens get their papers, have demonstrated the great importance of the league and the benefits derived from it and the necessity of keeping up this work in a period when unfriendly forces are trying to enact laws against those who are about to become citizens. A motion was passed that the newly elected Executive Board must start a campaign to raise $3,000 for the Naturalization Aid, which will enable them to start doing essential work which will help those who contact them with the intention of becoming citizens and to establish classes in civics which will instruct those becoming citizens through the league, how they can fully understand the meaning of being a citizen and the duties of a citizen towards his fellow Americans.</p>
