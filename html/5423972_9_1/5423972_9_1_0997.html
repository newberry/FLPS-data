   <p>President's Annual Address.</p>
   <p>So far as my knowledge goes, this is the first time in the history of a Jewish congregation that the ladies have been asked to join with husbands, fathers, or brothers in a participation in the deliberations of a congregational meeting. It remained for Sinai Congregation.....to inaugurate this new feature of such meetings.</p>
