   <p>Justice McGrott, correspondent of the Universal News Service, telegraphed from Washington the following:</p>
   <p>"Accusations of pacifism against the Jew certainly will cease when facts of participation of the Jew in the present War are made known.</p>
   <p>"The American Jewish War Record Committee, which gathers statistics of Jewish soldiers in the Army and Navy of the United States, possesses the records of 120,000 Jewish soldiers. When all returns come in, the mark is sure to reach 200,000, which is five per cent of the entire Army and Navy of the United States."</p>
   <p>What an enormous record this is, can be understood when we consider that the Jewish people here are only three per cent of the entire population.</p>
   <p>The number of Jewish heroes who fell in battle already reaches the 7,200 mark. It may be expected, when all details are received, that the figure will swell to ten or twelve thousand. Four hundred Jews have received honors of distinction.</p>
   <p>The greatest Centers, naturally, contributed the greater number of soldiers. For instance, New York City and State furnished almost a third of all the soldiers. To the present time, the figures are 33,210, of which 26,666 are of New York proper. Illinois had 3,459, of which 2,670 are of Chicago. Massachusetts had 3,777, of which 650 are of Boston, and San Francisco had 912 Jewish soldiers.</p>
