   <p>During the Zionist convention, to be held in Chicago, September 14, the Zionist women's organization, Hadassah, will hold a special conference of Hadassah delegates to discuss the special role of Jewish women in the Zionist movement. As is known, every member of the Hadassah must belong to the Zionist district. But the Hadassah has an independent existence as a separate body of Zionist women. During the past year, many new chapters were started, and the general membership has increased from 5,619 to 7,935. The conference of the Hadassah promises to be very interesting since many women delegates are expected to attend the Zionist convention in Chicago.</p>
