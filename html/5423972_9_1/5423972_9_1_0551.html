   <p>The [Chicago] Sinai Congregation, of which the late Emil G. Hirsch was the spiritual leader, is now somewhat in a dilemma as to the appointment of a successor to this departed rabbi. The late Emil G. Hirsch was the advocate of the most radical reform imaginable, and for a certain time it was hard to distinguish between the Sinai Temple and a Unitarian Church. Everything that was of a Hebrew character was banished from the Temple, and the Sunday services conducted by Rabbi Hirsch had more the character of a forum. Needless to say that not all the members of the Sinai Temple were wholly satisfied with this process of de-Judaization, and they often gave vent to their feeling regarding the progressing de-Judaization of the Congregation. The growing dissatisfaction on the part of the membership resulted in the return to a more conservative policy, but as a whole the Sinai Temple, under the leadership of the late Emil G. Hirsch, has never become a synagogue even in [the] Reform meaning of the term.</p>

   <p>Now that Dr. Hirsch has gone, the Sinai-ites are somewhat embarrassed because they do not know which road to follow. Even those who liked the late Emil G. Hirsch did not subscribe to his principles and policies, and they are not anxious to perpetuate the sort of Reform he introduced, but on the other hand, they do not want to create the impression that by extending a call to a rabbi who is less radical than the late Emil G. Hirsch, they are repudiating his doctrines, principles, and methods. But they do not want a spiritual leader who is ultraradical. As a matter of fact, the Sinai people find it hard to make a choice because they do not know actually what they want. They are anxious to get a man who is a great orator and a great scholar, and who is at the same time radical and conservative, but such birds are very rare. We do not know in America of one Reform rabbi who is at the same time a great orator and a great scholar. The only logical man to succeed Emil G. Hirsch would be Dr. Stephen Wise of the New York Free Synagogue, but it is very unlikely that Dr. Stephen Wise will leave New York and go to Chicago, especially since he is now committed to the development of his institute for religion, a sort of Rabbinical Seminary <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to produce ultraradical rabbis. He cannot very well serve Sinai Temple and at the same time attend to this business of his institute for religion, and therefore it is very unlikely that he would follow a call from Chicago. The other logical man to succeed Emil G. Hirsch would be Rabbi A. H. Silber from Cleveland. He is a great orator from a certain point of view, but he is a Zionist, a nationalist Jew, and, therefore, not elegible for the position. To elect him as a successor to the late Dr. Hirsch would mean to repudiate all the doctrines advocated and defended by Dr. Emil G. Hirsch in the course of his long ministry. If these two men are not available for the position for one reason or another, the Sinai Congregation will have to be satisfied with a lesser luminary, with a man who is not as outspoken a personality as was the late Emil G. Hirsch or as Dr. Stephen Wise, and to do this would hurt the pride of the Sinai-ites. They imagine that because they give the highest salary to a rabbi, their rabbi must be the chief and leader of the American Reform rabbinate. They will soon find out that there are only a very few talented rabbis in the Reform camp, and indeed very few men able to continue the work of the late Emil G. Hirsch because a young man, able, gifted, and with an inclination toward <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>scholarship, does not embark upon the career of a Reform rabbi. The American Reform rabbinate is intellectually sterile and has not produced one man of real importance for posterity. The so-called fathers of American Reform, the late Gottheil, the late I. M. Wise, the late Emil G. Hirsch, etc., were all foreigners. They came over here from Europe, bringing with them European traditions of learning. American Reform has only produced a generation of speakers and not of scholarly rabbis, but the Sinai Congregation will not be satisfied with a mere speaker. It is anxious to get a rabbi who is somewhat of a scholar as well, or at least an outstanding personality, and since such men are not obtainable, the Sinai Congregation will have to look around for some time to come before it will be able to fill the position left vacant by the late Emil G. Hirsch.</p>
   <p>The late Emil G. Hirsch was actually the only real attraction of the Sinai show, and since the attraction is gone, the Sinai-ites will feel a great deal of ennui and will have to make the best of an unpleasant situation.</p>
