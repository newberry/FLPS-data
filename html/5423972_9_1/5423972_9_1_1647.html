   <p>The committee on immigration of the House of Representatives approved the new immigration bill, which reduces the quota from three to two per cent on the basis of the 1890 census. This means that the immigration from Eastern Europe has been reduced so much that, for all practical purposes, we can no longer speak of immigration to the United States. The only country that will not suffer from this new bill will be Germany because, instead of 87,000 German immigrants, 51,000 immigrants will be permitted to enter this country. The fact that last year less than 51,000 entered [this country from Germany] seems to indicate that the Germans will be little affected by the established quota. All other countries, however, will suffer from the new quota.</p>
   <p>According to the new quota, 213 people may enter from Lithuania each year, 5,000 from Poland, and 1,003 from Austria. Relatives of American citizens are not included in the quota, but most of the American Jews who had close <span class="page-break">2</span>relatives in Europe have already brought them over. Distant relatives are included in the quota. Only rabbis and men who have an academic education, and perhaps Jewish journalists, will be permitted to enter outside the quota. According to the new quota, no more than 15,000 Jewish immigrants a year will be permitted to enter from all of Europe. This means that, according to the new quota, Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe will be reduced to one-fourth the present immigration.</p>
   <p>By this act, America has ceased to be a center for Jewish immigration, and if conditions in Europe do not improve, we shall have two courses open to us: either to establish a new center for Jewish immigration in the Diaspora, or to make Palestine the chief center for Jewish immigration. The latter course is, naturally, better. But in order to take this course, we will have to adopt an entirely different attitude toward financial aid to Palestine. There is no doubt but that in a very short time, Palestine can become so developed that it will be able to admit from thirty to forty thousand immigrants a year. This, however, will require a yearly budget of fifteen million dollars.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Are the Jewish people ready to contribute this sum? We need not be ashamed to face the truth. We do not believe that it is possible at this time to get from the Jewish people, namely from the Jews in the Anglo-Saxon countries, fifteen million dollars a year for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. The Jews in Anglo-Saxon countries will not contribute such a vast sum to the Keren Hayesod, because although they are well able to do so, they do not understand the situation. Perhaps when the new quota is enforced, the Jews will recognize the need, and give more to the Keren Hayesod than they do today.</p>
   <p>As long as the partially or totally assimilated Jews in America do not look upon Zionism as an ordinary question of immigration, they will not contribute to Palestine, and the sufferings of our people in Eastern Europe will have to be outrageous before these Jews in America will do as much for Palestine as they have done for war relief.</p>
   <p>From the standpoint of our national interests, the new immigration bill is <span class="page-break">4</span>not disastrous because it will force the non-Zionist Jews to support Zionism. However, we not only have our future interests [to think of] but our present interests as well. From the standpoint of our present interests, the new immigration bill is disastrous for the persecuted masses of our people in Europe.</p>
   <p>Every other Jew in Poland, every other Jew in Hungary, and in Latvia, every other Jew in Lithuania is a prospective immigrant because he knows that there is no future for him in his native country. Now the gates of America are as good as closed to him.</p>
   <p>We do not have to be great statesmen to foresee that America will soon cease to be a center for immigration, not because America no longer needs immigrants, but because the new American nationalism seems to be inimical to the old, liberal immigration policies. It was, therefore, a vulgar political error, on the part of Jewish leaders in America, to ignore the proposal of the Mexican government to Paul Rothenberg of Chicago last year. [Editor's note: President <span class="page-break">5</span>Obregon had offered a tract of land in lower California for Jewish immigrants.] Instead of investigating the proposal to see what could be done with it, it was not only ignored but everything possible was done to minimize its significance.</p>
   <p>If the American Jews do not contribute to the Keren Hayesod that which must be contributed in order to make Palestine a center for immigration, the leaders of American Jewry will have no alternative but to accept the plan of Mr. Rothenberg, because if a part of the Eastern European Jews are to immigrate, we must establish a new immigration center for them.</p>
