   <p>In his appeal to Jewish organizations abroad, on behalf of the Congress Organization Committee, Justice Louis Brandeis says, among other things, that one of the objectives of the Congress is to "establish a permanent organization which shall always protect Jewish interests, assume financial responsibility and carry its work to a successful conclusion". Justice Brandeis ought to have inserted this sentence at the beginning of his appeal, instead of at the end. Until now, the supporters of the Congress have not put enough weight on the question of permanency. If permanency had been stressed to a greater extent, this question would be more widely discussed and more clearly understood. Many opponents of the Jewish Congress would become ardent supporters of it; many who are indifferent to it would become more interested in it.</p>
   <p>I am convinced that opposition and indifference to this question can be traced to the fact that we do not comprehend the far-reaching opportunities of the Jewish Congress. The popular conception of the forthcoming Jewish Congress is chiefly: first, to demonstrate against the persecution of Jews in Europe; second, <span class="page-break">\2</span>to demand equal rights for Jews.</p>
   <p>Even with such a superficial understanding of the matter, the Congress succeeded in gaining many thousands of supporters. Although they should know better, the chief opponents of this movement envisage in it no more than a demonstration by the masses. A short time ago, at the Kehilah Convention, Mr. Cyrus Sulzberger, in comparing the Kehilah with the Congress, found the former to be a permanent organization, whereas the latter was only a temporary one. Consequently, the opponenets of the Congress can present strong arguments against it. Of what avail is a demonstration against the persecution of Jews? Haven't we demonstrated enough? Besides, why give some irresponsible hot head an opportunity to say something, in a demonstration, that might do us more harm than good? How can we demand equal rights for the Jews? We have neither an army nor a navy. We shall only make fools of ourselves. "Then why not leave it up to us [the opponents]? We have done this before--let us continue!" Thus, many intelligent people, who are unable to see anything of greater value in the Congress movement, are influenced by the above-mentioned arguments and refuse to lend support to the <span class="page-break">\3</span>movement. In regards to the second objective of the Congress, i.e., equality for the Jews, they [the opponents] maintain that it is only a question for the impractical idealist. They [the opponents] are only concerned with the practical results of the Congress.</p>
   <p>If, however, by the Congress movement, is understood the establishment of a permanent institution, not the practicing of theatrical protest meetings, then the movement assumes a different aspect. It is, therefore, highly important that the concept of permanency should be definitely conveyed to the people, because it not only strikes a death blow at the arguments of the opponents, but it also possesses the power of bringing into the movement many sensible and responsible people who now stand aloof from it.</p>
   <p>As a permanent institution, the Jewish Congress will gain considerably in repute, and will become a power with which the world will reckon. The outside world must look upon it as the bona fide organization representing the Jews, because the latter have established it in a democratic manner. When the non-Jewish world seeks to determine Jewish aims and opinions, it will not have to turn to people who, though they may appear to be Jewish leaders, <span class="page-break">\4</span>are in reality alien to Jewish life. The Jewish Congress and its leaders will be officially recognized by the world as the proper spokesmen for the Jews, when Jewish affairs are in question. For the Jews themselves, the Jewish Congress will be their security against misrepresentation, which is so frequently practised at their expense. Can anything be more necessary for the introduction of Jewish politics than a profound knowledge of matters pertaining to Judaism? In my opinion this comes before everything else.</p>
   <p>Until now a deep, far-reaching interest over the plight of their coreligionists would be awakened in Jews only in troubled times. But no sooner had their plight been alleviated, or as soon as Jewish troubles became a daily occurrence, they [the Jews] immediately became indifferent and hardened to the plight of their coreligionists. Most Jews are what Dr. Nordau at one time called them, "Catastrophe Jews". However, it is vitally important that Jewish interests should be protected at all times. It is high time for a change in the psychology of most Jews in matters pertaining to the needs of <span class="page-break">\5</span>their own people. Their interest in their own people must, without question, become a permanent condition. At present the anti-Semites, by heaping a number of catastrophes upon us, give us reason to manifest interest in our problems. Another way of insuring a constant interest in our people's destiny is by creating an institution in Jewish life so broad, so comprehensive, and so influential that it would be capable of holding the interest of the Jews, and, at the same time, would receive the support from them which is indispensable in these disastrous times. Therefore, if democracy is desired in this Congress, it will not only be an academic or an idealistic desire, but the very foundation on which the institution will be built, because the authority that the Congress will have, will not come from individuals, but from the masses. True, we possess no cannons, but there are other elements of force which we can utilize, if it becomes necessary to mobilize our forces. The time must come when the decisive element will take the form of righteousness rather than brute force. Autocracy and secret diplomacy have always been the worst enemies of world peace. In the end, nations have always resorted to the sword.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The Jews, particularly in this country, where public opinion is a power, must cultivate this power. And the source, whether it be the necessary material or moral support, must come from the masses, not from individuals. The Jewish Congress, as a permanent institution, will be capable of deriving the greatest benefits from this source. The American Jews must now establish an institution that shall be able not only to cope with the present crisis, but also with every situation. The major problems confronting the Jews must now pass into the hands of American Jewry. Our loyalty to America should not prevent us from establishing an institution which would express our devotion to the Jews all over the world.</p>
