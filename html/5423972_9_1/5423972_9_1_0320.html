   <p>The several sessions began Sunday, the 27th, and lasted until Wednesday, the 30th of August. The address by Rev. Charles C. Bonney, a Christian divine, sounded the keynote for the Jewish people to claim its right as a cult for its religious, moral and humane precepts and tenets, and that as good citizens of this benigh nation enjoy the same privileges and rights with other denominational Christian bodies and organizations, and so forth.</p>
   <p>The programs for each day comprised many thoughtful subjects which aimed to apprise the non-Jewish peopleof the time status of the Jewish people, and of its religion, hopes and aspirations. Not a few were devoted to connect the false impressions and senseless prejudices, and misrepresentations.</p>
   <p>The congress, the first of its kind ever held anywhere, has not urged by protests, resolutions or other demands upon the regular established church organizations that abrogation of its erroneous conceptions regarding Judaism. The congress, with its authorized representatives have simply spoken their pieces.</p>
