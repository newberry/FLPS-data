   <p>The People's Synagogue Association of Chicago has recently been organized forthe purpose of providing Jewish religious services on Sunday afternoon in the loop district. The services will be conducted under the leadership of Dr. Hirsch and Dr. Gerson B. Levi. It is the intention to attract principally those Jews who are either attending non-Jewish down-town churches or who are entirely unaffiliated. The movement has thus far, met with the greatest enthusiasm by all classes of Jewish people in all parts of the city.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge consists of Leo Kaul, chairman, Chas. I. Lorb, treasurer, Mrs. Henry Solomon, Miss Julia Felsenthal, and Samuel Richter.</p>
