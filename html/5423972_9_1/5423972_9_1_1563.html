   <p>But where? Wohin? America bars them with the quota. Canada? Restrictions- limitations- quotas! Mexico? No opportunities. And so much for the places where Jews want to go. Where then shall they go? Wohin?</p>
   <p>Numbers are answering that question by going to South America. Some to Argentine. Some to Brazil, Uruguay, Peru.

   <p>This is what Hias, Ica and Emig - have united to do. It will take $500,000 to do this work this year. Hias is your representative in the field of Jewish immigration. It has acted for you during the past forty years. Help it now to extend its activities to meet the new Jewish world need. Chicago is asked to contribute $50,000.</p>
   <p>The New Year will soon be upon us. It will be brighter for you if you will help to make it brighter to multitudes of your brethren to whom without your help it offers little hope or encouragement. Greater than to have is to share. Greater than to ask blessings for self is to scatter blessings to others. Greater than any individual's position in life is service to the needy of his brethren and all mankind. As you meditate on this noble New Year message, we ask you not to forget Hias.</p>
