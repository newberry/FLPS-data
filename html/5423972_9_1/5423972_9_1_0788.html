   <p>A survey of the history of the human race brings out the fact that certain inherent impulses and tendencies have been characteristic of mankind in each varying phase of his development. Among these, that impulse called religion has defied the long sequence of changes from elemental caveman up to modern civilization, and is still as strong a motive in the lives of individuals and of groups as it has ever been.</p>
   <p>People are prone to say that religion is dying out; that the world is no longer religious; that the church is losing its hold upon its members. Even without considering conditions as they actually exist today, the probable fallacy of such statements may be inferred from a study of the past. It was out of an upheaval much like the present that Christianity grew from a beginning as one <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the many attempts to substitute something new for a worn-out system. In other words, when a given religion no longer fills the spiritual needs that have developed under a new social order, then its adherents fall away and people say that religion is dying out. Paganism had failed to meet the demands on it and Christianity took its place. But just so did Greek mythology fall, amid a chorus curiously like the one that was sounded at the beginning of this present century. Then another and a stronger religion took hold upon the people, and so out of eras of religious decadence have grown the heights of frenzy that marked the crest of the most religious expression.</p>
   <p>Just at a time when the world, lulled by a sense of its security, had decided definitely that it had no further need for religion, an unexpected reaction was brought about by the beginning of the Great War. In the trenches, men who had never before thought about a philosophy of life, suddenly felt the need of one. As a result of their reasoning, soldiers of any and all creeds came to believe absolutely that men who died in action went straight to heaven, regardless of their past records. Six months before, they would have scoffed <span class="page-break">\3</span>at the mere suggestion that there was a heaven to go to. And more: these same men, and their families at home, pounced upon the fantasy of a poet, and the angels of Mons became to them a reality as intense as any miracle of the Bible had been to the fanatics of a hundred years ago.</p>
   <p>Among the Jews the conditions are the same. A few generations ago people began to feel cramped by the rabbinism which was no longer an expression of Judaism, but the reflex of the medieval superstitions under which it had developed. The spirit of the law was being crushed under the weight of the letter. The study of the Talmud was no longer an inspiration, not because the Talmud had changed, nor yet the people themselves, but because the conditions under which they studied it did not fit their newer point of view. Then came Reform Judaism, which in a few years no longer resembled the thing its founders had intended it to be. Aborted in its attempt to be the link between a half-forgotten past and a none too clearly comprehended present, this new form also failed to give the inspiration that the people needed.</p>
   <p>It is not the form in which we pray that makes for spiritual uplift, but <span class="page-break">\4</span>something else, too fine to be caged in any special form. Yet one thing is certain. In order to satisfy the demands of any people, whether during times of peace or in transition periods like the present, the form of the religion must allow for growth and change, and for the active, personal participation of each individual member. In the past, discussion of the history of the Jews, of passages in the Bible, of the Talmud, formed a normal phase of social conversation. Cultured Jews discussed these laws or customs as naturally as we today talk about some new piece of legislation or the relation between given conditions of the moment and their historical background. In other words, religion was not a profession for a selected group of men, nor the concern of the women and children, nor yet a form of intellectual gymnastics to be indulged in only by scholars. People lived Judaism. The Jews went out to the Babylonian captivity in utter disregard of their religion and their history, but they came back ardent students of the Law in all its branches. Evidently they had begun again to live their religion, which grew and expanded under this new impetus.</p>
   <p>Human nature craves a spiritual expression, even though throughout long periods <span class="page-break">\5</span>this phase of life is neglected. When the change comes, the demand is awakened simultaneously in great masses of the people. They begin to think and talk about it; the old forms change and religion once more begins to be a vital factor. Today the whole world is facing the reappearance of this phenomenon. How the Christian world will solve its problem we cannot guess, but for the Jews the tendency is already too marked to be mistaken. In the nationalist ideal, the Jews are coming back into their own.</p>
   <p>Since sacrifice, temple ritual, and many ancient ceremonies have alike no hold on the modern mind, those phases of our religious growth that most demand our own activity and help are beginning to make a more intense appeal. The number of young, active, intelligent men and women who, after long neglect of their Judaism, have suddenly become alive to the inspiration of Zionism would be amazing were it not that this is the inevitable result of present-day conditions. National consciousness has swept over the world. Every people has come to see clearly that its salvation lies in its freedom to develop its national genius unhampered by the point of view of a foreign ruler.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>So, too, the Jews. What for centuries has been a dream, half mystic in its import, has suddenly become a scientific problem, to be worked out as such. The Third Return from exile no longer seems an absurd denial of modern world politics. On the contrary, to the minds of the statesmen of the Great Powers, it is as little to be scoffed at as the thought of a unified Slavic group or an independent Poland. It is only to a certain type of Jew, whose obsolete point of view is too deeply ground in for any change, that the return to Palestine seems unbelievable. To the Jewish scientist, the engineer, the economist, the problem is merely another Panama Canal, another transcontinental telephone. Science can do it and science will.</p>
   <p>Of course, as in the return from Babylon, only a portion of the scattered Jews will go back. The rest will stay where they are, but theirs is the privilege and theirs the opportunity to help those to return who find in the homecoming that peace and safety which they cannot know in exile. To us here in America and to this generation who shall see with their own eyes the fulfillment of the Prophecies will come an opportunity such as comes but once in any era. Like <span class="page-break">\7</span>their forefathers of old, they who remain may pour forth their gold and their knowledge in order to make Palestine a fitting home into which to welcome the returning wanderers.</p>
