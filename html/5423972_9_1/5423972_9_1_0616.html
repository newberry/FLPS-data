   <p>When a Russian or Polish Jew enters a German or French synagogue for the first time, he decides that the Jewish religious practice of the German or French Jews is basically different from the religious practice of the Eastern European Jews. Everything seems funny and foreign to him, and if he happens to be a narrow-minded person, he will conclude that the German or French Jews are heretics because their style of prayer is quite different and their customs and practices are different. On the other hand, when Western European Jews come in contact with Eastern European Jews for the first time, they feel as though something were wrong.</p>
   <p>Judaism assumes different forms in different countries, although in essence it always remains the same.</p>
   <p>It stands to reason that in America, Judaism cannot have the same form it has <span class="page-break">2</span>in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe. In due time it must change its form even though it does not change its content.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Orthodoxy in America is, at present, the same in form as it was in the Old Country. If it has changed to a certain degree, the change has not been for the better. Jewish youth in America does not realize the influence of the Old Country and of Jewish life in general upon the Jewish religion, and, naturally, cannot have any love for that which is so dear to their parents, i. e., certain forms of religious life.</p>
   <p>Likewise, the Orthodox German Jews have no conception of the forms of Eastern European Judaism, yet, the Orthodox Jews in Germany are certainly pious.</p>
   <p>In practical life, there is no abstract Judaism. Judaism is something concrete. Everything in life which is concrete assumes different forms in different places, and Judaism is no exception to that rule. In America, Judaism will naturally assume an American form, which will differ basically from the forms <span class="page-break">3</span>of Eastern or Central European Judaism.</p>
   <p>One of the many reasons why the Jewish youth in America is so little attracted to the Judaism that has been transplanted here by the Eastern European Jews, is that it has no understanding of those forms. The forms which appear to be noble to the older generation, do not appear noble to the youth; often they seem ridiculous.</p>
   <p>When the Eastern European Jews in America began building their synagogues and developing their Judaism, they did not take into account that a new generation would soon grow up, to whom that sort of Judaism would be foreign in its forms. The American Jewish Orthodoxy is now realizing that whatever it has built, in the course of the past thirty years, has been only for the benefit of the first generation. Youth stands aloof from that form of Judaism. It is obvious, however, that as long as the Jewish youth in America is not attracted to the Orthodoxy, the Orthodoxy in America will have no future. If we wish to utilize the Jewish youth in America for traditional Judaism, we must serve Judaism to <span class="page-break">4</span>it [youth] in a form which will be attractive, at least, in a form with which the youth will sympathize.</p>
   <p>Jewish youth in America will never understand a Judaism that is severed from life, i. e., a Judaism which consists essentially only of attendance at the synagogue for the purpose of worship. Jewish youth in America will only understand a Judaism which is connected with life. This was actually so in the Old Country. Judaism did not mean only the synagogue. The synagogue simply stood in the center of Jewish life. Around the synagogue, there were various institutions for all sorts of Jewish activities. Here [in America], however, the synagogue is practically isolated. Only recently has the synagogue begun to take an interest in general Jewish activity.</p>
   <p>In order to attract the youth to Judaism, we must create the form of Judaism with which they will be sympathetic, and that is a synagogue not isolated from life but organically connected with life. A synagogue--but in addition to the synagogue, there must be a lecture hall, a library, classrooms, a recreation <span class="page-break">5</span>room, etc., and that means a Jewish center for the Jewish youth.</p>
   <p>If the Jewish young man or young woman spent a large part of his or her time around a synagogue, they would, on their own initiative, become interested in the synagogue and in religious life. It seems to us that only centers for the youth in every Jewish neighborhood can save the Jewish youth. The center must express the new form of Orthodoxy in America.</p>
