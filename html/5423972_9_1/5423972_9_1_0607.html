   <p>Reform Judaism has always had an inclination to ape the Christian Church. The attempt to isolate religion from nationality and to declare Judaism to be a religious creed only, is already proof of the fact that Reform Judaism is anxious to create a Jewish Church independent of Jewish nationalism. The Reformers know that Judaism is not merely a religious proposition; they know that the Jewish religion is not a religion in the sense that Christianity is, but is organically interwoven with Jewish life and cannot be separated from it, but since the Christian Church is their ideal, they try to put Jewish religion into the same position as is held by the Christian religion. Just as Christianity is only a religion, so is Judaism, say the Reformers. Taking this as their starting point, they have to be logical and do nearly everything the [Christian] Church is doing. The Church has proclaimed Sunday as the day of rest and so the radical Reformers, aping the Church, have done likewise. The Church has introduced <span class="page-break">\2</span>confirmation for girls and the radical Reformers, aping the Church, have done likewise. The Church in America has developed Christian Science, and Reform rabbis are also now busily engaged in creating a Jewish science. Rabbi Lichtenstein of California is working hard to convince his fellow Jews that Jewish science in the sense of Christian Science, is not only feasible, but is an actual necessity to prevent the Christian Science Church from capturing the many Jews it seems to be getting into its fold, and to this end he has introduced Jewish science.</p>
   <p>Now that it is fashionable for ministers of the Christian Church to exhibit their heresy, Jewish ministers are doing likewise. After Reverend Grant has gone on record that he disbelieves in the Divinity of Christ, Dr. Stephen Wise has gone on record that he denies the divine origin of the Ten Commandments. Just as Reverend Grant says that the Divinity of Christ is a childish myth, so Dr. Wise says that he feels in honor- and duty-bound to proclaim as a teacher and preacher in Israel that the divine origin of the Ten Commandments is a myth, and a childish myth in addition. Just as Reverend Grant challenged the conservative <span class="page-break">\3</span>forces of the Church to excommunicate him for his display of heresy, so the Very Reverend Dr. Stephen Wise, of the New York Free Synagogue, challenges the conservative forces in his synagogue to banish him from the Jewish religion for his heresy.</p>
   <p>We can only say that this aping of the Reverend Grant is very vulgar, very much out of place, both unnecessary and ungentlemanlike. Even if Dr. Wise had not announced to the world that he did not believe in the divine origin of the Ten Commandments, nobody would have suspected him of believing in them anyway. Dr. Wise, like many another of his colleagues of the ultraradical Reform school, deny the divine origin of the Ten Commandments and everything in which they ought to believe as religious representatives of Judaism, but no serious-minded Jew who can distinguish between a real rabbi and an imitator of the Church would take the confessions of the Reform rabbis, seriously. No serious-minded Jew considers them real rabbis, and exponents of the Jewish religion, and no serious-minded Jew will pick up a quarrel with them on account of their beliefs and disbeliefs. They have made such a mess of Judaism that it is already immaterial <span class="page-break">\4</span>to the masses of our people what they believe and what they do not believe, and the sudden appearance of Dr. Wise as a radical heretic will not make any impression on anybody. If he hopes to become a martyr by his profession of heresy, he cherishes a false hope. If the masses of our people were to take these Reform rabbis seriously they would have to declare long ago that they are no more rabbis in Israel than the representatives of the Christian Theistic Church are representatives of Christianity. The fact of the matter is that the sort of Reform Judaism in which Rabbi Stephen Wise and his colleagues believe is not Judaism at all, and that the Free Synagogue is no more a synagogue in the religious meaning of the term than the clubs in ancient Greece called synagogues were places of worship.</p>
   <p>The Reform rabbis of the type of Stephen Wise are only concerned with one thing--to imitate and to ape the Church. We are sure that if a Christian heretic should come out tomorrow with a statement denying the historical existence of Christ, Dr. Wise would lose no time in coming out with a statement denying the historical existence of Moses, but still there are tens of thousands of Jews in America who believe that men like Dr. Wise represent the Jewish religion.</p>
