   <p>A counter current of feelings of displeasure was created on last Tuesday by the "interviews" of representatives of our leading daily papers with the Rev. Dr. Kohler. The "interviews" were published at length. They had taken place because the secular press had been desirous of knowing why the Rabbi had resigned his position. If the Rev. Dr. Kohler had not mixed up things which did not belong to his resignation, with the statement of facts - the matter might have been taken as a "matter of course," and would probably not create any bias for the action of the congregation, or in the sentiments of the members of the Sinai Congregation at the meeting of last Tuesday evening. But, unfortunately, the Doctor, speaking to the gentlemen of the press, forgot that every sentiment he uttered was to come before the public at large, and to expression of sentiment, he yielded himself entirely. Two points which he has mentioned were taken by the public with great displeasure. He mentioned his predecessor in office, the Rev. Dr. Chronik, and described him as an atheist, and as one without any oratorical abilities. What had the belief <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>or the unbelief, the abilities or disabilities of Dr. Chronik, whom Dr. Kohler does not know personally, and with whom he never had any connection - what had they to do with Dr. Kohler's resignation? The fact that Dr. Chronik has still so many friends in the Sinai Congregation, proves that he is a man of no mean abilities. The fact that the Reform Congregation of Berlin had recently entrusted to Dr. Chronik the revision of their ritual, proves that he is not considered an atheist in Germany.</p>
   <p>The second point which the Doctor has universely touched upon in speaking to his interviewers, was that of the financial affairs of the congregation. It is not on account of money difficulties that the Doctor has resigned. For the last five years the congregation has paid him $1,000 annually, besides his salary as per contract, and free use of the parsonage. He surely had nothing to suffer by the indebtedness of the congregation, and would not have to suffer by it if he were to remain here until the term of his contract with the congregation would expire. To what purpose, and for what reason did he speak to the press about the finances of the Sinai Congregation, remains inexplicable.</p>
