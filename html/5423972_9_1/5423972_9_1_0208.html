   <p>Last evening a meeting was held of the Executive Committee of the Middle Western [Jewish] Congress Association, where questions concerning the latest peace plan in the Congress movement were discussed. An agreement was drawn up between the Jewish Congress Committee and the American Jewish and National Labor Committee.</p>
   <p>Following a heated discussion, the final decision was to approve this agreement, but on one condition, viz., that one fourth of all the delegates at the Jewish Congress shall be representatives of national organizations, and the remaining three fourths shall be elected directly by the people.</p>
