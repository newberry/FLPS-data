   <p>The Congress Election. by a Contributor.</p>
   <p>The American Jewish Congress idea, which seized Chicago Jewry so firmly from the moment the nominating convention was held at the Auditorium, on May 20, found its termination at the Chicago Hebrew Institute on June 10. It was to be expected that the American Jewish Congress idea would stir Chicago Jewry from center to circumference. From the moment the nomination convention opened its session at the Auditorium on May 20, the people manifested the most profound interest in the Congress. Almost every synagogue, lodge-room, social center, and Jewish meeting-place was made a forum for free expression on the necessity of the movement and on the importance as to which of the nominated forty-six should be elected on June 10.</p>
   <p>Not a few of the candidates themselves had entered into the campaign, each one seeking to enlighten his audience as to his merits. It must be said however, that the campaigners laid more stress on the necessity of bringing out the voters than on the importance of their candidacy. The intensity of the campaign became more manifest, however, the week previous to election day. Passing through the streets, largely populated by Jewish people, one could notice groups of men and women discussing the Congress and the candidates concerned. Not infrequently, one could observe the exhibition of printed cards, which the skeptics say, were slates, distributed among the people by one or another of the rival factions.</p>
   <p>It was never thought at first that factionalism would ever develop in connection with the American Jewish Congress. While the idea was being advocated in Chicago by a few during the past two years, it seemed that the general Jewish public was little concerned, but no sooner were the nominations announced, when each section of the West and North West Sides were stirred with enthusiasm for the election of a man coming from their midst. Nor was the factionalism manifest according to the geographical location of the nominees.</p>
   
   <p>It was rather according to the organization to which they belonged. These, in a brief time, were whipped into line: Zionists, National Socialists, Shule Jews Fraternalists and other such factions, all professing loyalty and advocating the support of the candidates belonging to their respective organizations.</p>
   <p>When the evening of the final day arrived, Chicago Jewry was ready to give expression to the pent-up energy which had been developed during the previous week. Every Shule, every hall and center, was made a polling place. Boxes and ballots were distributed everywhere, and as soon as the first star made its appearance in the sky, announcing the expiration of the Sabbath hour, throngs were moving to these voting places to cast their ballot for those whom they felt were most fit to represent them at the Congress to convene in Washington next September. There was an earnest expression on the faces of the men and women as they performed their task. Old and young, rich and poor, seemed to be affected with the importance of the moment. Many older people, upon receiving the ballot sheet, paused for a moment in silence, which betokened the profound feelings which stirred their hearts. It was for the first time in their lives and for the first time in the history of their people, for thousands of years that they took into their own hands their right to ascertain as to whom should be their representative and their spokesman. Especially was this picture frequently to be noticed in the synagogue, and among the older men and women. These people approached the ballot box with a prayer in their hearts and a clean hope in their eyes. To them the voting meant not only the duty of the day, but also a hope of a tomorrow to which this day was a mere beginning. As many of the older folks expressed it - I want my vote to determine the destiny of K'lal Israel (The Jewish People). The younger element, while taking the Congress idea and its final execution very seriously, instead of approaching the ballot box in a spirit of piety as did the elders, walked towards it with erect stature and firm step. Here, one could see a spirit of pride and dignity. They may, perhaps, not have had the broad view that their fathers have taken of K'lal Israel, but they were virtually interested as to who should be the people of their choice - the representatives whom they would send.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hebrew Institute - the solar plexus of Jewish activity in Chicago - could not possibly escape being the scene of profoundest interest of all that was manifested anywhere in the city on behalf of the American Jewish Congress, on June 10. The Institute was by common consent made not only a special voting place, but also the place where the votes were to be counted and from where the final decisions as to results of the election should be given.</p>
   <p>The grounds of the Institute were invaded at sunset Saturday by the "Block." A plain chair assumed the role of a platform, in the center of the grounds, and a fiery speaker enthused the thousands of hearers with the loyalty they owe to the radical wing of Jewry and the support that the audience should give to their own. The workingmen, they insisted, composing the bulk of the Jewish population, must be represented in the Congress. If democracy is to be the keynote of this national movement, the working classes, above all, must have their say in it.</p>
   <p>Speaker after speaker emphasized the solidarity of the "Block" and the necessity that each of its members cast his vote. The vast audience finally retired to room twenty-six, which was made a new polling place. But the radicals took complete possession of that room, and there at the ballot box flurried a young fellow with a red badge on his laped, mustering into line all that came in, distributing ballots, and directing all to leave immediately after voting, so as to make place for others.</p>
   <p>There was no slate making, of course, they said, and yet, here and there, one could see the voters pull out of their pockets a little memorandum upon which just so many names had been written, and they carefully marked upon the ballot the names in accordance with the memorandum. There was system in the midst of the confusion, and while there may be no such a thing as Jewish solidarity in other things, there certainly was evident a spirit of unity of purpose among the constituents of the "Block."</p>
   <p>There was another polling place in the Institute, in the Assembly Hall. As it happened - who knows whether accidentally or not - the young Zionists gave an entertainment and dance on the evening of the election. There were upwards of eight-hundred people in the hall, and in one corner there was a table upon which was a ballot box and along which stood two election clerks. Of course, no one would suspect that these two great events, occurring simultaneously, bore any relation to one another; and yet, they say that the Zionists had it all well thought out before hand and captured the hall for a purpose.</p>
   
   <p>As was to be expected, candidates soon made their appearance at the Institute, just to see how things were getting on. They were not concerned in themselves particularly, of course, but just to see, and some say, to be seen. There were no votes canvassed, except here and there perhaps, and merely on behalf of this or the other nominee that appeared on the ballot. The Zionists were not to be talked into anything. They knew whom they were for, whom and for what they were voting. There was no system in this confusion. The dancers did not stand in line, and the ballot box was not besieged by crowds, but, now and then, between the acts and between the dances, couples would approach it, cast their vote, making the procedure a part of the program of the evening.</p>
   <p>June 10, was a bright sunny day, caressed by balmy breezes coming from Lake Michigan. It was indeed a holiday, particularly on the West Side. In the synagogues, at the early morning prayer, the devoted worshippers made it a part of their devotion to cast their ballot at the close of the service.</p>
   
   <p>To them it was a pious act and a sacred privilege. These same people upon whom the Fraternalists, and the Zionists may have counted, took the synagogue into consideration while voting. The Rabbis were not to be left out, for to them they were the pillars upon which rests the House of Israel. Special meetings were called in all the lodge rooms. The attendance, however, was not as large as was expected, for many already had voted in the Shules (Synagogues).</p>
   <p>The heavy vote was cast later in the day in the general voting places. It took some hours to develop the momentum and the enthusiasm of which the balloting was to be the climax. So it was everywhere, but particularly so at the Institute, which seems to have been a neutral ground to all comers, regardless of party or faction. It was the Jewish Congress and the Jews came to vote in a Jewish institution. But the tightest grip by which the Institute was seized came the morning following the election, and this grip was to continue until the last moment, when the announcements were to be made at the close of the counting. This lasted almost an entire week. The Institute was invaded at an early hour Monday morning, June 11. The social Hall on the third floor was converted into a counting house. About the many tables were seated men and women chosen from among all the ranks of Chicago Hewry. There was not to be any partisanship, but work was to be done by disinterested individuals, but since such could not be found, one of every party interested was chosen and among them a neutral, or as much a neutral as was possible under the circumstances. One portion of the large hall was given to the disposition of the ballat boxes which were distributed among the counters at the tables. It was an exceedingly inspiring scene to see these people bent over the large tally sheets and with eager eyes, scrutinizing every name, calling, marking and repeating, so as to insure a square deal for everyone. From early morning until midnight every day, counters working in two shifts, were riveted to their chairs, not even allowing themselves time for their meals. Sandwiches and bottles of pop were brought up at meal time. The counters continued their work while eating their food and gulping it down with a draught of carbonized fluid.</p>
   
   <p>This strenuous work continued without interruption during the day. Not so, however, in the evenings. After eight o'clock, there would stroll in, now and then, an anxious candidate. There was a strange expression in the faces of many of them. They realized that their fate lay in the hands of the young folks about the tables, and that the outcome, who knows, may depend on a vote or two when the final counting is done. But this was not to be so. From the very start it was evident that those to be elected were drawing a large vote, while the others were rapidly falling behind as the day's count was over. So, that after the first few evenings, the visits by the anxious candidates ceased, and the counters were left to themselves to follow the strict rules of the Election Board which was in attendance all of the time, and whose labors were incessant. There were not only instructions given, but also strict watch kept, and now and then some of the counters were changed from table to table, or entirely dismissed, because of possible leanings that they might have had to one or the other candidate. Toward the end of the week, some of the candidates had passed the ten-thousand mark.</p>
   
   <p>Interest in the watching of the blackboards which were distributed throughout the halls, grew more and more intense, and visitors from all over the city flocked into the Institute to watch returns. The people had practically taken possession of the entire Institute. Its office, its telephones, its halls, were taken over as though there were no other activities going on. But the climax finally came on the Thursday night following the election, when it was announced in the Press that complete returns would be given out that evening. All the candidates were telephoned to appear for the returns but no element was as largely represented as the "Block." They took possession of the Assembly Hall, and while waiting for final returns to come down from the third floor, and guided by the tentative accounts on the large blackboard which was placed on the platform, the radical wing instituted an impromptu celebration with which the final returns were to be greeted: Their first task was to compose rhymes which were set into melodies about candidates whose defeat was certain. There was a reader on the platform who read the poem newly out of the pen of the poet, and when he was through, a chorus of several hundred throats joined in the song, and since there were forty-four candidates of which twenty-five were defeated, there were twenty-five such melodies sung in succession and followed by a chorus; the wording of one being more humorous than the other. This lasted until midnight, when the chairman and the secretary of the Election Board finally appeared on the platform, and announced the official returns. The crowd then left the Institute after a siege of a week, with their echoes still reverberating through the halls of the building.</p>
