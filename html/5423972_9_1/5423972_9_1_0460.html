   <p>The new administration of the Association of Synagogues, under the chairmanship of Mr. Sam Ginsburg, is working systematically and industriously, and is holding its meetings regularly. Every administrative problem of public significance should, therefore, be brought up before this association. As the problem of administering Ma-oth Hitim [practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy] is a problem of public significance, it should, therefore, be brought up before the Association, and should not be taken care of by a committee. If each community problem is to be considered by a special committee, then the Association of Synagogues might as well dissolve because it will not have anything to do.</p>
   <p>I understand that the executive committee of the Association of Synagogues will meet next Monday to consider the problem of Ma-oth Hitim. If the standing <span class="page-break">2</span>Ma-oth Hitim committee wants to accomplish more this year than it did last year, it should co-operate with the executive committee of the Associations of Synagogues. If this is done, it will be possible to accomplish more this year than last year.</p>
