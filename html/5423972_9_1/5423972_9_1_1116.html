   <p>A printed circular from Kehillath Anshe Russia was read and found to contain a statement of the depredations committed at their synagogue on which occasion their Sefer Torah, Machevrus, etc., were destroyed. Said communication also contained an appeal for aid for the restoration of these articles. On motion it was resolved that this communication be referred to the next general meeting as the Board had no power to pay out money not provided for under the budget.</p>
