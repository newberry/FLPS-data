   <p>The Thirty-third Annual Council of the Union of American Hebrew congregations was a good illustration of what Reform Judaism really is. It had more the appearance of an annual get-together of some fraternal order than an important convention of representatives of the Jewish religion. To the casual observer it did not look a bit Jewish. It lacked the intensity of a real Jewish convention. There was something lacking. It moved too smoothly. One could detect lack of interest and idealism. The caution with which Reform leaders moved. The only one to do a really good job was Judith I. Stein, the first woman to handle publicity for such a convention. In spite of the prevailing cold atmosphere, she succeeded in getting some really good and hot publicity.</p>
