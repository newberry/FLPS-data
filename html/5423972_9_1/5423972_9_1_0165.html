   <p>The interest of the Chicago Jewry for the Jewish Congress was demonstrated in yesterday's election for delegates, during which a large number of votes were cast. Although it is too early to say who were elected, the returns so far show that the voters did not follow the orders of the so-called bosses, but voted according to their own convictions and knowledge.</p>
   <p>The Jewish district was yesterday the scene of a holiday. Jews were busy all day with the election, selecting the best qualified candidates to represent them at the Jewish Congress.</p>
   <p>The outstanding feature of yesterday's election was the interest taken in it by the Jews. The vote was much larger than expected, and this certainly added glory to the Congress movement.</p>
   <p>It was also pleasing to see how deeply interested were the Jews in <span class="page-break">2</span>choosing the ballots. Each voter took ample time to study the names of the candidates before casting his vote.</p>
   <p>Votes were cast in all authorized polling places and synagogues. The most remarkable thing about the election was the calmness and good order that prevailed.</p>
   <p>The cry of "double-crossing" was heard, but it was expected, because no group or party could vote for more than 19, therefore eliminating 25 candidates.</p>
