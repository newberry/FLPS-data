   <p>Several Talmud Torahs (Hebrew Schools) in Chicago have been in existence for a number of years, and one will soon celebrate its fortieth anniversary. Not hundreds but many thousands of Jewish children have been educated in these schools. I would like to know how many of these children became members of synagogues and how many of them understand Hebrew and observe Judaism. If the theory of the older Orthodox Jews is correct, i.e., the primary function of the Hebrew school is to rear pious Jews, (to study Hebrew is secondary), I would like to know how many Orthodox Jews the oldest Talmud Torah has reared and how many of them are today members of Orthodox synagogues in Chicago. My dear friend, Mr. Lazerovitz, will do this city a great favor if he will furnish the correct answer to this question. Then we will know how to conduct our Talmud Torahs, because all [of us] want them to be productive and yield the best results.</p>
