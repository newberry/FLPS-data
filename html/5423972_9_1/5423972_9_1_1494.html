   <p>The exhibit of works of art of the Bezalel School of Palestine, which was the feature of one of the official Art Days, July 29, at A Century of Progress at the Illinois Host Building, drew wide-spread comment. The exhibit consisted of Bezalel and Palestinian art objects, including etchings, illustrated books, ceremonial objects, olive wood novelties, and other handicraft. The notable program included many well-known speakers, and the Bezalel Chapter of Avukah served as host.</p>
   <p>An exhibit of Palestine art objects is now being shown during the month of August on the eighth floor of the Fair, State &amp; Adams streets. Palestine is represented by Bezalel works, as well as by other artists.</p>
