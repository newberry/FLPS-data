   <p>It was at the Midwestern Zionist convention, held quite recently at the La Salle Hotel, that I first heard that there were Young Judea Clubs in Chicago; for until then I was under the impression that this organization had no members whatever in this city. At the convention, however, I met some of the older members of the club, and also Mr. Haluskah, the director of Young Judea in Chicago. The description he gave me of Young Judea activities was intensely interesting, and I did not hesitate to accept his very kind invitation to visit the clubs that meet every Saturday night at the Talmud Torah at Rockwell and Hirsch Streets.</p>
   <p>It was not a very fine night for going out, when I visited the Young Judea <span class="page-break">\2</span>a couple of weeks later, and I expected to find at the utmost twenty or thirty members present. I was, therefore, very pleasantly surprised to find at least a hundred there; boys and girls of all ages from twelve to eighteen were contributing their share in making the Talmud Torah building a hive of Jewish and Zionist activity. What surprised and greatly delighted me, at almost the first minute of my entrance, was the sight of two boys, neither of whom above fourteen, heatedly discussing Mr. Zangwill's then recent speech in New York; and they argued about it with a knowledge of Judaism and Zionism that would have been commendable in someone twice their age. I felt that even if the Young Judea movement had done no more than to teach these two boys what they knew, it had a good reason for existing, and that there was also a good reason for the older members of the Chicago Jewish community to so support them as to make then the strongest body of Jewish Youth in the city. Mr. Haluskah then saw me, and after asking me to go round the building and see the club working, he had to leave me; the numerous duties he had in taking care of the fourteen clubs that met there would not <span class="page-break">\3</span>allow him to stop long.</p>
   <p>The first room I entered happened to be occupied at that moment by the Young Judea Council, and I decided that I would "listen in" on the proceedings for a while, so as to get some idea as to what the clubs as a whole were doing. The Council consisted of two representatives from each club; it was, therefore, a rather mixed gathering, and I was prepared to hear some unusual opinions, and I was not disappointed. They were at that moment discussing the constitution of the Council, that had been submitted by a committee of the Council formed for that purpose. Everyone took part in the debate, from young girls of twelve or thirteen to young men of eighteen, thus making it extremely interesting.</p>
   <p>I left the meeting and went across the hall to another room. A boys' club was meeting there, boys of about thirteen or fourteen. There were about twenty-five present, and as this meeting promised to be interesting, I <span class="page-break">\4</span>thought that I would stay there for a while and see what they did. They were having their business meeting, and their president, a boy of about fourteen, was in the chair; he conducted that meeting far better than I have seen some people, who are old enough to be his grandfather, do. After all the business had been concluded, the literary part of the evening commenced. Their leader, Mr. Rushkin, spoke to them on the future political state in Palestine (a subject that I, in my ignorance, would have pronounced as far too high above their heads, for them to understand intelligently). They, however, understood it very well and afterwards discussed it with almost the experience of veteran Zionists. I have visited this club since then, and I have seen that this was not an exceptional evening. I have heard them argue about the action of Flavius Josephus in leaving the Jewish ranks, and going over to the Romans, as if they had actually lived at that time, and were trying to convince Josephus himself of the error or otherwise of his ways.</p>
   <p>I never expected to find the children so well versed in things appertaining to Judaism and to Jewish history, and I came to the conclusion (afterwards <span class="page-break">\5</span>proved to be erroneous) that this club was far better than the rest, and I thought that if I visited the other clubs, I would find my opinion to be correct. It was hard to believe that young boys and girls would spend their Saturday evenings, week after week, to learn things appertaining to Judaism. It was only later that I understood that because of the system on which the organization is worked, because of a judicious admixture of work and play, and because of the method in which knowledge is imparted to the members, the work is made really attractive to all concerned.</p>
   <p>From the club above-mentioned, I went to a club composed of girls about thirteen years old. When I came in, their leader was reading them a story from the Young Judean, the official organ of the American organization. The children were listening with rapt attention, and drinking in every word that was being said; they were intensely interested in everything that their leader was saying, even my entrance hardly caused them to look round, let alone lose attention.</p>
   <p>Now I was beginning to believe; I had seen that Young Judea is making Judaism <span class="page-break">\6</span>and Zionism matters of vital importance to these boys and girls; it is making them feel the true value of everything that is Jewish. But I was not yet quite convinced; I thought that the movement is only interesting to the younger children, I thought that when they grow older, when they begin to take an interest in more things, when their outlook upon life becomes broader, they would no longer be attracted by Young Judea. I learned that this idea too was erroneous when I visited another club, this time a club composed of almost young men, boys of sixteen or seventeen years of age; and that is where I saw what may be called the results of Young Judea work, not the final results, however. There I saw the members themselves giving talks on Jewish affairs, not a leader this time, but the boys themselves. One boy that I heard, was speaking on the prospects of Zionism under the new British cabinet; another I heard speak on the Jewish relationship with the Arabs in Palestine. I also heard one of them give his first of a series of talks on Biblical history. The speakers all displayed a wonderful knowledge of their subjects.</p>
   <p>I then realized what a fine thing Young Judea is; I realized how important it <span class="page-break">\7</span>is that every Jewish child should be given the opportunity to become a Young Judean, because I realized that these boys and girls are our future Zionists, these are the men and the women of the future who will be the governing factor in the renaissance of the Jewish life in Palestine.</p>
   <p>It is the imperative duty of every Jewish parent to see that his sons and daughters, from the age of twelve to the age of eighteen, join the Young Judea, whose object ought to be known to everyone; it is "to advance the cause of Zionism; to further the mental, moral, and physical growth of the Jewish youth, and to promote Jewish culture and ideals in accordance with Jewish tradition". No persons with anything like a Jewish upbringing can have anything against this aim, not only can they not have anything against it, but it is their duty to help Young Judea to extend itself so as to embrace the whole of the Jewish youth in Chicago within it.</p>
   <p>Meetings are held every Saturday evening at the Talmud Torah at Rockwell and Hirsch Streets, and also at the Temple Judea Community Center at 1227 South <span class="page-break">\8</span>Independence Boulevard.</p>
   <p>An appeal is made to all those boys and girls who are interested, or those who think that they may become interested in the Young Judea, to come to the meetings. Everybody will be welcome.</p>
