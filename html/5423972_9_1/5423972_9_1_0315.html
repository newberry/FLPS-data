   <p>Mrs. Henry Solomon of Chicago, has come to N. Y. direct from Washington, with all her honors thick upon her. Notwithstanding the halo of glory with which she was invested, because of the magnificent reception of her "National Council of Jewish Women" at its triennial congress, she brought with her all the charm of her naturalness.</p>
   <p>An informal reception was held for her, limited to the directresses of the N. Y. Section of the Council and to the Rabbis of the city, altogether over fifty visitors. Mrs. Solomon will remain in the city until Mar. 7th.</p>
