   <p>The presidents of synagogues will hold the most important meeting of the year tonight. They will find out at this meeting which synagogue is with them and which is against them. The presidents are organized in an association called the Association of Synagogues. This organization must be more solidly organized; it must have a greater degree of discipline in order to solve the big problems of the Orthodox community. The synagogues have proved what they can accomplish when they are even slightly united. They proved it last Tuesday evening at the great Keren Hayesod banquet at the Capitol Building. They would have been able to accomplish much more if they had been more united, better organized. I am firmly convinced that, if it were strongly organized, the Association of Synagogues could raise every year big sums of money for Jewish <span class="page-break">2</span>education in Chicago, for Jewish education in Europe, and for the administrative purposes of the community; it would also be able to raise every year two hundred thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod. Do not forget that the seventy-five thousand dollars which the Association of Synagogues has raised this year during three days for the Keren Hayesod, was raised by only fifteen per cent of the members of the synagogues. Eighty-five per cent of the members of the synagogues did not give anything for the Keren Hayesod. Chicago would be the first Orthodox Jewish community in the world if the Association of Synagogues were a strong organization. If the presidents of synagogues are serious people, serious Jews, serious synagogue leaders, they will not fail to attend this evening the most important meeting of their organization.</p>
