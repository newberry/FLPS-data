   <p>I imagine that if, a hundred years from now, a Jewish historian obtains a circular issued by the Congregation Tiphereth Zion, and on the basis of that circular, forms an opinion of the cultural life of the Jews in Chicago in 1922, he will decide that the presidents of the Orthodox synagogues of Chicago were Irish-ized. The circular I am speaking of is signed "Jzo Jzei Marok," by the Orthodox president of an Orthodox synagogue. What do "Jzo" and "Jzei" mean? Have you ever heard of an Orthodox synagogue president signing an official document "Jzo" and "Jzei"? Aren't the names "Gershon" and "Zorach" better than "Jzo" and "Jzei"? Lithuanian "Irishmen" who cannot pronounce "Joe" and "Jay," call themselves "Jzo" and "Jzei". Anybody can call himself whatever he pleases in a saloon or in a hall, but an official document of an Orthodox synagogue should be signed by its president by his correct Jewish name, so that his friends and customers won't call him a greenhorn.</p>
