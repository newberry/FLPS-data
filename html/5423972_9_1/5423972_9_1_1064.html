   <p>The book is intended for general adoption by the Jewish congregations who use the English language in worship, as well as the Hebrew. It is being arranged by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, composed of 100 ministers. This work was assigned to the Ritual Committee by the Conference at its session in Baltimore, last July. The committee met in New Orleans in January, and passed upon the whole form of worship for Sabbath and the three festivals, Passover, Weeks and Tabernacles.</p>
   <p>To the Editorial Committee was intrusted the revision and composition of the Ritual in all its details. This was accomplished in our city this week.</p>
