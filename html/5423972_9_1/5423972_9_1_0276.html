   <p>The Order Knights of Zion is making preparations for its twelfth annual convention. There will be representatives of various Zionist organizations from the West, to compare the accomplishments of each area, and to prepare plans for future constructive activity. The greatest difficulty which previous conventions have experienced, was the absence of a suitable place in which to assemble. The sessions were held in one place, the receptions and entertainments in another and the delegates and the Zionist friends met in still another. It was also impossible sometimes to find proper locations. In spite of this, even the previous conventions of the Order of Knights of Zion have won a name as the highest social order in the life of Chicago's Jews. Thousands of Jews in Chicago and other Western states realize the significance of a Zionist convention, something which cannot be forgotten very soon.</p>
   <p>The twelfth convention, however, will excel all previous conventions because of the desirable place it has secured, the very thing the previous <span class="page-break">\2</span>conventions lacked. Gratitude is due the Jews of Chicago, who have equipped themselves with an institution like the Hebrew Institute, located in the heart of the West Side's Jewish settlement. Owing to this, the Zionist convention will have a grand meeting place and the delegates will have the privilege of viewing an institution which Chicago Jews can well be proud of having.</p>
