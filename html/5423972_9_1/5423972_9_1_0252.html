   <p>The independent nationalistic sentiment is growing among the Jewish masses who are being urged to arouse themselves to national consciousness and become a nation again equal with all other nations and to cease to be a wanderer among the nations by turning back to his own land.</p>
   <p>The grandmaster then called on the secretary of the Mizrachi, Rabbi Berlin, who was greeted with thundering applause. He spoke of the present Jewish situation, the general condition of the Zionist movement, and as the leader of the Mizrachi movement in America he indirectly pointed out the aims and the principles of this orthodox Zionist alliance. He also pointed out that the sooner Zionism will take to more practical work in Palestine, the sooner this sacred ideal will be materialized.</p>

   <p>After the secretary's report on the past activities of the order the treasurer reported on the financial conditions. Mr. Schulman, the grandmaster, started reading telegrams and letters of prominent men of the Zionist movement such as from the young Straus, in the name of his father, the well known social worker and lover of Zion, Nathan Straus; a second letter from the famous Boston lawyer and Zionist, Louis Brandeis, and one from Professor Boris Shatz of the Bezalel Art School in Palestine, who is now in New York.</p>
   <p>The question then arose as to the language to be taught in Palestine, and it was unanimously agreed that Hebrew shall be the language.</p>
