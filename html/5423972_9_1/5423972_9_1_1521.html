   <p>More than 5,000 delegates and friends attended the 36th annual convention of the Zionist Organization of America. Dr. Chaim Weizmann, world Zionist leader, was the guest of honor of the convention.</p>
   <p>The plight of German Jews was deplored in forcible language in the report of Morris Rothenberg, president of the Zionist Organization. A message from the executive of the Jewish Agency, the supreme governing body of the Zionist movement, also expressed sorrow over the persecution of German Jewry and the slaying three weeks ago at Tel Aviv of Dr. Chaim Arlosoroff, head of the Jewish Agency in Palestine.</p>

   <p>DR. WISE DENOUNCES NAZIS.</p>
   <p>Denunciation of Chancellor Hitler and other leaders in the anti-Semitic campaign in Germany as "a group of intellectual perverts and paranoiacs" was delivered by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were passed to begin a campaign to raise $8,000,000 in the next four years to settle German Jews in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Dr.Wise also denounced the Reform rabbis for certain actions at the recent Reform meetings in Chicago and Milwaukee.</p>

   <p>This denunciation resulted in a terrific fight on the convention floor at the Tuesday session when Rabbi William F. Rosenblum of New York City offered a resolution which stated that the convention viewed with satisfaction the growth of Zionism among the Reform rabbinate. The resolution was attacked from many quarters, and finally withdrawn.</p>
