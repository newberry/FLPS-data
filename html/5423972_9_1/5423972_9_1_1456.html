   <p>Mr. Goodman and Jack Robbins spent many days discussing the formation of a boy's club. Finally, a meeting was held with seven boys in attendance. The work of organization was then begun and in about six months, on May 8, 1914, a club governed like a municipality and named the Boy's Brotherhood Republic was instituted.</p>
   <p>The Boy's Brotherhood Republic is non-sectarian and at the present time composed of two hundred boys, ninety per cent being Jewish. It has its own mayor, city clerk, treasurer, coundil, judge, prosecuting attorney and chief of police. The various branches of the work are divided among boards including the citizenship, investigating, and employment committees. The aim of the Boy's Brotherhood Republic, is to do uplift work among boys.</p>
