   <p>A new attempt has been made to unite all Chicago Jewry into one powerful union.</p>
   <p>There is already in Chicago a rather weakly constituted union of Orthodox congregations, which includes, of course, chiefly religious people only.</p>
   <p>The Jewish public in general is still unorganized and has no religious or national affiliations, with the result that in recent years the Jewish name has become cheapened and profaned. Every charlatan, every good-for-nothing, every swindler and crook is blaspheming it; every cheap and petty politician desecrates and peddles it in political campaigns and on other occasions. During the last mayoralty election in Chicago, the cheapest and lowest things took place in the camps of two different groups of petty Jewish politicians eager to sell votes to their parties.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>One Jewish group sold itself to William H. Thompson and the other to Anton Cermak. Each group tried to make these leaders believe that it represented the entire Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>The motives of the two groups were one and the same: money, honor, and prestige, for themselves and their families. The crookedness went so far that Republican Jewish politicians bribed the editor of the Daily Jewish Courier to publish a series of articles about the virtues of the Republican candidate for Mayor. The Courier went so far as to issue a special edition decorated with many portraits, with the purpose of bringing Chicago Jewry into the fold.</p>
   <p>Dr. Solomon Goldman, rabbi of the Anshe Sholom Temple (sic) in Chicago, was the first Jew to protest against these petty Jewish politicians who peddle the Jewish name as if it were junk or second-hand wares.</p>
   <p>He unmasked a good many fakers who claimed to be interested in the welfare <span class="page-break">3</span>of the Jewish community. Dr. Goldman advised these self-appointed Jewish leaders to sit behind the oven in the synagogue and sniff tobacco. Dr. Goldman is not satisfied with protests alone; he intends to organize a union of Chicago Jews similar to those of Berlin and Warsaw.</p>
   <p>Such a union would include all aspects and problems of Jewish life. This type of union would concern itself chiefly with Jewish activities and social problems having a direct or indirect bearing upon all Jews, such as Anti-Semitism, discrimination against Jewish employees by Gentile firms, and vice versa. A remedy would be found to exterminate the licentiousness that permits any person or group of persons to sell the Jewish name every Monday or Thursday. With such a union no part of the Jewish population would lose its freedom, individuality, and independence; everyone will be as free as before and will act according to his beliefs, traditions, programs, and aspirations. The only change will be that no single group of Jews will be allowed to speak in the name of all the Jews of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The central body, the Union of all Jewish Congregations, representing every <span class="page-break">4</span>Jewish organization in the city, will have the sole power to discuss certain problems pertaining to Jewish life in general. This central body, however, is forbidden to participate in political campaigns or elections if its purpose is to misuse or sell the Jewish name.</p>
   <p>The central body of the union will have the authority to speak for Chicago Jewry when the united voice of all the Jews is on some occasion absolutely necessary. In order to discuss the details of this plan, Dr. Goldman and a committee called a meeting at the Covenant Club, to which were invited the rabbis of Orthodox synagogues, Conservative temples, and Reform temples; and the representatives of synagogues, temples, and other institutions that bear some sort of Jewish character. Representatives of the Jewish press and several radical leaders were also invited, not to take part in the deliberations, but merely as guests. This was understood by everyone.</p>
   <p>The Orthodox Jews did not send their representatives.</p>
   <p>Very interesting topics were discussed concerning the proposed union, and <span class="page-break">5</span>every phase of the condition of Chicago Jewry was very intelligently analyzed.</p>
   <p>The gathering was composed chiefly of very earnest people who have great respect for Jewish traditions, and whom it really hurts to see charlatans trade the Jewish name for a pot of lentils in order to satisfy their epicurean appetite.</p>
   <p>The meeting gave the impression of earnest and honest people eager to do earnest work.</p>
   <p>It was also understood, since a definite plan had not yet been drawn up, that at least temporarily no statement shall be given to the press.</p>
   <p>However, the Daily Jewish Courier, now feeling guilty and bothered by a troubled conscience, publicised this undertaking with the foulest language available.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>It cursed and accused the sponsors for wanting to unite Chicago Jewry. The editor of the Courier, although a Democrat, now claims to be a Republican, in order to profit by selling the Jewish name; and since this enterprise might weaken his source of income, he is very much opposed to such a plan.</p>
