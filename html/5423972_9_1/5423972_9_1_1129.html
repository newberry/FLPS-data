   <p>This congregation was organized and incorporated in 1852. Mr. S. Harris was the first president, and Henry Greenbaum, Esq, the well-known banker, the first secretary; these together with Mr. Summerfield and a few others belong to the congregation at its inception, and are yet living; others either have removed, or have passed that "bourne whence no traveler returneth."</p>
   <p>Their first service was held in a building corner of Washington and Dear-born Street. Next they worshipped on Clark Street and then they entered in 1865 a fine building, corner of Fourth Aveune and Harrison Street, where they remained until the "great fire" of 1871, when they were burned out. For six months the congregation worshipped in the house of Mr. I . Glogasky, when they removed tothe building, corner of Eldridge Court and Wabash Avenue, now St. Mary's Church. Next they entered a building on Hubbard Court; where they remained until 1875, when the Michigan Avenue Temple was built at an expense of $30,000.00. The following ministers have officiated since the inception of the congregation:</p>

   <p>Rev. Alexander Loewenthal, Rev. Simon Glogasky, Drs. Messing and Spitz. Loewenthal, Goldsmith, Schever, and Samuel Marks the present incumbent. At present the congregation contains between sixty and seventy members, with a constantly increasing membership. The society has a burying ground at Lake View. There is a Ladies Social Society as well as the Sisters of Peace, connected with the congregation as auxiliaries. There used to be a Literary Society, but it suspended some months ago.</p>
   <p>The financial condition of the congregation is in a promising state. The Ladies Society with private collections, enabled them to pay up the amount of building expenses, but there yet remains a debt of $12,500.00 on the lot.</p>
   <p>A Fair is to be held on the 12th of next month, to assist in Liquidating the expense. The mode of worship is moderately Reform. There is a Sabbath School over which Rev. Samuel Marks presides, with Miss Tina Metz and Miss Fannie Goldstein as assistants.</p>
