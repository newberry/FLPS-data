   <p>Four sessions of Chapter Four of the Young Maccabees were held during August, three literary and one social. We succeeded in opening a class with Dr. Max Dolnick as instructor. History is taught each week before the beginning of the meeting. Anybody may enroll in the class, even those who do not belong to the club.</p>
