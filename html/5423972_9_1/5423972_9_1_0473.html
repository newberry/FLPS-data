   <p>Scholars, Zionists, community workers and representatives, will gather today, at three o'clock in the afternoon, at the First Hungarian Congregation to witness the installation of Rabbi Jacob Sonderling, former Chief Rabbi of Hamburg [Germany]. The installation of Dr. Zanderling as rabbi of the First Hungarian Congregation should be considered an event of signal importance in the Jewish life of our city.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sonderling is a Western European Jew, whereas most of the members of the First Hungarian Congregation are Eastern European Jews. During the last one-hundred years, very rarely has an Eastern European community engaged a rabbi from Western Europe, and vice versa. In America, this, certainly, has happened very seldom. It is only possible in the case of Dr. Sonderling because he, <span class="page-break">\2</span>himself, has the soul of an Eastern European Jew, and because he has spent many years in Eastern Europe and is as well acquainted with the Eastern European Jews as with the Western Europeans.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sonderling is also, as far as I know, the first rabbi in Chicago whom the Zionist leaders will officially greet at his installation because he is a great Zionist worker, who occupies a place of honor in the Zionist movement. A notable group of Zionists will be present tonight at a banquet given in honor of Dr. Sonderling.</p>
