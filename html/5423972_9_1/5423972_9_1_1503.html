   <p>With a message of "cordial greetings and best wishes" from President Roosevelt and a declaration that "the calamity that "the calamity that has overtaken the six hundred thousand Jews (600,000) in Germany has cast a shadow over everything in Jewish life." the Zionist Organization of America opened its convention.</p>
   <p>Morris Rothenberg, president of the Zionist Organization of America, denounced Chancellor Hitler's anti-Semitic drive in a report to the National Executive Committee.</p>

   <p>"The calamity that has overtaken the 600,000 Jews in Germany has cast a shadow over everything else in Jewish life," he said. "Its colossal character and the terrible consequences accompanying it become more apparent with the lapse of time.</p>
   <p>"German Jewry, distinguished by its productivity and services to German, Jewish and general culture, stands hopeless and homeless, their life made unendurable in their own land, and the opportunity to seek refuge elsewhere denied them.</p>
   <p>"In this tragic situation, aggravated by a world depression which has effected Jews as other peoples everywhere, the progress of the Jewish National Home during the past year takes on new significance for the Jewish people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"The past year was one of steady economic growth in Palestine. In the main the advance is to be attributed to the uninterrupted flow of Jewish energy and Jewish capital into the country, so that today Palestine stands out as one of the few lands which is relatively prosperous and which shows every sign of increasing absorptive capacity."</p>
   <p>Mr. Rothenberg praised highly the present High Commissioner of Palestine, Sir Arthur Grenfell Wauchope, for cooperation with the Jews in Palestine.</p>
   <p>At the same time he deplored the failure of the Mandatory Power to allot a greater number of immigration certificates to meet the need of the persecuted Jews of Germany and other lands, who were looking to Palestine as a haven. He announced that negotiations were in progress for a substantial enlargement of the immigration schedule.</p>

   <p>FORTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS BEQUEST IS ANNOUNCED.</p>
   <p>Reporting on the activities of the organization in aiding American Jews, Mr. Rothenberg stated that from July 1, 1932 to June 1, 1933; the organization had cleared the cases of 1,662 people who wished to settle in Palestine. There persons, he said, brought a total capital of $3,138,046 into that country.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rothenberg also announced the receipt of a bequest of $40,240 from the estate of Rebecca and Albert Zundelevitz of Los Angeles and Wichita Falls, Texas, as a specific trust for distribution in the upbuilding of Palestine.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Reviewing the progress in Palestine, Mr. Rothenberg said that 20,000 Jews had entered the Jewish national home in the last eighteen months. As an indication of the capital influx into the country he reported that in 1932 new investments in Palestine were more than $12,000,000.</p>
   <p>SECOND SESSION.</p>
   <p>Denunciation of Chancellor Hitler and other leaders of the anti-Semitic campaign in Germany as "a group of intellectual perverts and paranoiacs" was delivered by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise of New York City.</p>
   <p>In his address to the 5,000 delegates and their friends, Dr. Wise termed as "accursed" any Jew who uses the term "Jewish Nazi."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"There are no Jewish Nazis," he exclaimed. "There are Jews and Nazis, and there is a great gulf fixed between them. The Nazis are would be destroyers of Jews. Let any Jew beware in using Nazi Jew. God forbid that any Jew can stoop so low, even in the midst of controversy, as to bring Jew and Nazi together."</p>
   <p>This attack was accepted as being directed against Joseph Brainin, one of a committee for minority Jewish rights in the American Jewish Congress, who wrote in a widely circulated article that "Revisionism is Jewish Hitlerism." The Revisionists are one of three groups composing the Zionist Organization of America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>DR. WISE CRITICIZES RABBIS.</p>
   <p>After Louis Lipsky, chairman of the United Palestine Appeal and former president of the Zionist Organization, who presided, had praised Dr. Wise for his "fine and chivalrous work in behalf of German Jews," Dr. Wise began his address by criticizing the Council of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Central Conference of Rabbis, who recently held conventions in Chicago and Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>He took exception to statements he said were made at these gatherings that "Jewish nationalism is a form of Jewish assimilation."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>"It is a false and misleading antimony which has been set up," he said. "No loyal Jew may for one moment allege that anti-internationalism lies at the heart of Jewish nationalism.</p>
   <p>"At the Chicago assembly Jewish nationalism was demned. In Milwaukee the rabbis damned both Jewish nationalism and Jewish racialism, both these noble deeds being performed by two East European underlings of their Bavaro-Prussian temple masters. Apparently excommunication has been taken over by Reform Judaism and has now become its chiefest weapon."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Dr. Wise stated that Dr. Albert Einstein, the German scientist, who has accepted the honorary presidency of the World Jewish Congress to be held in Prague in August; Justice Louis Brandeis of the United States Supreme Court, "The greatest among American Jews," and Dr. Weizmann "are declared not to be Jews because they do not recite the Jargon of the Reform Temple Prayer Book."</p>
   <p>He said that the "answer to the Hitler pogrom is a Jewish program, and the Jewish program is Zionism, or Jewish nationalism."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>"The answer to Hitler must be two-fold," he said. "It must be spoken by the judgment of mankind, out of the conscience of Christendom, in some such way as England has spoken by the lips of Sir John Simon, its minister for Foreign Affairs and the Archbishop of Canterbury; as America has spoken by the lips of Senators Robinson and Wagner and their associates; by Al Smith, Bishops Manning and Mc Connell, and William Green. The further answer to Hitler and Hitlerism must speak out of the resolution of Israel to create and to develop, to maintain, to magnify and to perpetuate the Jewish National Home.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>"Without entering into honors of discrimination, disability and extermination, which together constitute the atrocity of atrocities against the Jews in Germany, since the 5th of March, surely we are agreed that Jews cannot permanently remain in Germany, unless there be an early change in the regime of the Third Reich; unless Hitlerism becomes a ghastly memory to all the German people. Even in that not improbable eventuality, not unlikely, the youth and children of Germany have, alas! become perhaps incurably infected by the terrible poisons of hatred.</p>
   <p>"Such is the fate of the Jews of Germany, that they cannot, dare not, even, ask the question 'wohin' (whither). The answer to every Jewish question in Germany, must ultimately be 'heraus.' The Jews of Germany must migrate. Hitler has said it and Germany, to its shame, has assented to the eviction of 1 per cent of its population, the members of which, by their mothers and fathers, have fought and died for Germany for a thousand years.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>"Let it not be imagined that this convention of American Zionists holds, or that the 18th Zionist Congress at Prague will hold, that Palestine is the only solution to the Germany Jewish question with which we are to occupy ourselves. Relief there must be in Germany, and for German refugees outside of Germany, in the surrounding countries. Migration every whither must be facilitated.</p>
   <p>"But in the last analysis, there will be two dominant forms of relief. One, I repeat is 'heraus.' Unless by the prompting of the voice of civilization, Germany de-Hitlerizes itself into civilization, 'heraus' will be the only course left for self-respecting Jews.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>"The Jews of Germany must struggle for their rights as men, as Germans. In the end, I venture to serve notice in the name and the spirit of the American Jewish Congress, that long after our brothers of the Central Verein will be moved to compromise and to yield, we will stand firmly unyielding and deny to the bitter end that Jews are strangers or aliens in Germany."</p>
   <p>THIRD SESSION.</p>
   <p>Lively scenes, in which presiding officers and delegates dragged at one another's arms to avoid threatened fisticuffs and shouted, marked the closing sessions of the annual convention of the Zionist Organization of America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>Two uproars took place in the afternoon and evening deliberations after peaceful early sessions in which Dr. Chaim Weizmann had announced that Dr. Albert Einstein had made peace with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and agreed to accept a chair at that institution.</p>
   <p>An outbreak of the late afternoon meeting came with the introduction by Rabbi William F. Rosenblum of Temple Israel, New York City, of a resolution saying that the Zionist Organization "views with satisfaction the growing sentiment of friendliness toward Zionist aims in the ranks of the Reform Rabbinate."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\15</span>
   <p>Rabbi Rosenblum's reference to the Central Conference of Rabbis, which was attacked by Dr. Stephen S. Wise of New York City on Sunday, brought boos and hostile cries.</p>
   <p>When the uproar subsided momentarily, Rabbi Rosenblum continued the reading of his resolution, which declared that "Zionism is an all inclusive program to effect the solution of the Jewish problem and welcomes the support of Jewish leadership of every type."</p>
   <p>Another chorus of scorn greeted his statement. James W. Wise, son of Dr. Wise, took up the battle for his father and attacked the Rosenblum resolution.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\16</span>
   <p>"I urge you to pass no such resolutions as would be interpretted as a rebuke to anyone who insists upon Jewish nationalism," he said.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Wise finished Charles Bender of Texas tried to elbow Judge Lewis from the microphone. Instantly he was surrounded by Dr. M. J. Robbins of Nashua, H. M; Abraham Goldstein of Hartford, Conn., secretary of the convention, and others who tugged at one another in effort to restore order.</p>
   <p>Dr. Robbins finally won the privilege to address the convention. "I still feel the harm that has been done to us by the Reform Rabbis." he said. "The wounds are still too fresh."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\17</span>
   <p>Mr. Bender then told the delegates that passage of the resolution would be an insult to "prince of Jewry," meaning Dr. Wise. Rabbi Solomon Goldman of Chicago declared it would come with ill grace from the Zionist Organization to censure Dr. Wise.</p>
   <p>Here Rabbi Rosenblum withdrew the resolution, saying that there "was no intention of rebuking any individual, particularly one who has served the cause so many years."</p>
   <p>The second clash came over efforts of friends of Captain Abraham Tulin of New York City to include his name among the nominees for the organization's administrative committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\18</span>
   <p>Delegates crowded around Louis Lipski, the presiding officer, seized his gavel and dragged at one another's coat-sleeves. A resolution was finally adopted adding him to the committee.</p>
