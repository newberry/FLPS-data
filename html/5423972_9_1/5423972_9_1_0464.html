   <p>The reorganized Association of Synagogues will hold its first important meeting tomorrow evening at the Hebrew Theological College. Mr. Sam Ginsburg is chairman and Mr. B. Bronstein is secretary of the Association. At the meeting, an executive committee, a constitution and bylaws committee and a president for the South Side district will be elected. The new administration of the Association of Synagogues is taking its duties very seriously and is working diligently for the growth of the organization. Every synagogue president should give the administration his support, and, most important of all, he should attend meetings. All the synagogue presidents of Chicago should be present at tomorrow's meeting because important problems affecting all the Orthodox Jews of Chicago will be considered. Every representative of organized Orthodox Jewry should take <span class="page-break">2</span>part in the solution of those problems.</p>
   <p>Do not forget to come tomorrow evening and to come on time. If you are cold, wear your fur overcoat.</p>
