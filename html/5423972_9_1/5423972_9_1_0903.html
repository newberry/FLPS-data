   <p>Rabbi I. Marcus, the rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Anshe Dorum Congregation, will leave Chicago shortly. The venerable rabbi was appointed as the spiritual leader of a large Jewish settlement in Richmond, Va.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Marcus returned here to accompany his family to Richmond. It is to be hoped that he will be a blessing for that Jewish community in the South. May he have good luck at his new post, and a hearty farewell.</p>
