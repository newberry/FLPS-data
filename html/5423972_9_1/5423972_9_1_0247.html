   <p>Welcome.</p>
   <p>It is eminently fitting that the Chicago Hebrew Institute - a great Jewish center of intellectual activities, whose fundamental idea and corner-stone was supplied by Zionists - should now again make room in its halls for the Zionists of the Middle West, gathering for a convention. On these spacious grounds every one of you fellow Zionists should feel at home for this place is consecrated to Jewish People. Here you are all welcome.</p>
