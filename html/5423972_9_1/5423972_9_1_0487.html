   <p>One of my one hundred and ten thousand readers, a man by the name of Abraham Shapiro, writes me a lengthy letter in which he reproaches the auxiliaries of the various Orthodox organizations of the West Side for arranging public affairs, such as luncheons and banquets, at which trefe [not kosher] food is served. Mr. Shapiro is quite right and the auxiliaries are totally wrong. To help kosher [Orthodox] institutions by serving trefe is just like helping a friend by stealing. If the Orthodox institutions in the West Side and in other sections of the city wish to observe the dignity of Judaism and remain as Orthodox institutions, they must not feed their customers and supporters trefe. As for the rest, the United Rabbinate of Chicago ought to investigate these charges and put an end to this scandal. The United Rabbinate is strong and influential enough to do this.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the New York Free Synagogue, has written an article <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the American Jewish Weekly under the very interesting title: "May Jews and Christians Pray Together?" The holy rabbi rules that they may, but says that sincere or pious Jews will not do that. The holy Dr. Wise also says that the Christian prayer, "Paternoster," is meaningful to him, but not so significant as the Jewish prayer "Shema Israel" (Hear, Oh Israel).</p>
   <p>As you see, Reform Judaism is steadily progressing. First it removed from the prayer book Zion and Jerusalem; then it did away with kosher and trefe; then it substituted the Christian Sunday for our Sabbath; then it acclaimed Jesus of Nazareth to be a great Jewish prophet; and now it is discussing the possibility of uniting the Jews and Christians in prayer. It won't be long before it will discuss the all-important question: Why a temple? If Jews and Christians may pray together, they can pray in the Christian church. If they pray together in church, then why shouldn't the Jews gradually convert themselves? Reform Judaism is progressing and that progress leads directly to the cross.</p>
