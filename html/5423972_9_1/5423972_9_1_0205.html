   <p>The conference of Zionist organizations of Illinois, which was held yesterday in the Hebrew Institute, indicates the remarkable progress that the Zionist movement has made in America. This movement is no longer confined to large Jewish centers only, as was the case a few years ago. It has gradually attracted the attention of Jews in small communities, and new [Zionist] societies are sprouting up in places where little Zionist activity could have been expected. This shows that Jews are sowing fertile fields for Zionism everywhere. It took time, however, before the seeds of this [Zionist] propaganda were planted in those fields.</p>
   <p>With the growth of the societies in small communities, it becomes more difficult for one central office to serve the demands of all the organizations in a large territory. A Zionist organization is necessary in each individual state, to <span class="page-break">2</span>disseminate propaganda, and look after the welfare of nearby societies. State organizations will make powerful links in the Zionist chain of the western states, of which the main organization in Chicago is the center.</p>
   <p>The delegates who came to this conference grasped the significance of this situation. The earnestness and enthusiasm with which they approached the work of organizing the Illinois State League of Zionist Societies reflects honor upon their intelligence and their understanding of the goal of their people.</p>
   <p>From the beginning of the first session yesterday morning, in the Hebrew Institute, to the end of the banquet in the Ashland Clubhouse at about midnight, the conference was well regulated and intelligent; it was almost an ideal assembly, from which emanated a spirit of ardent devotion to the great ideal of the Jewish people. The officers who were elected accepted the duties of their offices not for the honor, but to do the work and to serve the cause which lies close to their hearts.</p>

   <p>All in all, the conference accomplished a fine piece of work for the Zionist movement in Illinois.</p>
