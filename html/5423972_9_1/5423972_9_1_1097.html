   <p>The Jewish congregations are fewest in number of any of Chicago's prominent religious organizations. They number among their divines a degree of talent seldom found in recognized religious bodies. The average Christian, be he Protestant or Catholic, the free thinker, the infidel, the careless, the indifferent scoffer - but few of these know anything about a Jewish synagogue. The most devout of communicants in the Christian faith never enter a synagogue. Yet there are four or five Jewish congregations in Chicago, which in point of numbers, wealth, intelligence, religious devotion, appreciation of the faith of the fathers, and liberality to the accepted expounders of their doctrine, cannot be surpassed by any other denomination in the city. The first organization of a Jewish society in Chicago was in 1845. It was called the Kehilath Anshe Maariv. Two years later they purchased a burial place north of the city limits, and in 1849 built a synagogue on Clark street, between Adams and Quincy streets. In 1885, they moved to the <span class="page-break">2</span>corner of Adams and Wells streets (now Fifth Avenue), and in 1868 to the corner of Wabash avenue and Peck court. The ministers of the congregation have been:</p>

   <p>The services were then conducted by itinerants until 1861, when Dr. Liebman Adler was called, and remained for nearly twenty-two years at the head of the congregation. Three years ago the doctor was pensioned, and is still living here at a ripe old age. Dr. Adler was born in 1812, at Stadt Lengsfeld (Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach). His father was a teacher. Up to thirteen years of age, the boy was taught by his father. Then he went through the rabbinical schools at Gelnhausen, at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and at Weimar. He taught in the German schools for several years, and came to America in 1854. Not long after he received a call to preach to the Beth E1 Congregation at Detroit, and there he remained, until he came to the oldest congregation in Chicago, in 1861. Dr. Adler is a great man in Jewish councils, but very <span class="page-break">3</span>orthodox. Among the intelligent and educated Hebrews of the city, Dr. Adler is regarded as the last of the orthodox line. They revere him, honor his greatness, cherish him with affectionate regard, but his teachings no longer "fit the times." The more intelligent of Jewish worshippers are intolerant of the older Jewish traditions as handed down for every-day use.</p>
   <p>The successor of Dr. Adler in the Kehilath Anshe Maariv, Chicago's oldest congregation, is Rev. Dr. Samuel Sale. Prior to this, however - even long before Dr. Adler's retirement - the Kehilath Anshe Maariv Congregation was impregnated with reform. Several smaller congregations like Sinai, wandered off and set up temples of their own. Among these were the B'nai Sholom, which went farther North, but this was more of an orthodox offshoot carried off by force of geography. The old congregation is now located at 26th street and Indiana avenue. It is, perhaps, the largest congregation in the city. It leans toward orthodoxy, but the society as a body stands by Dr. Sale. The latter is an ultra-reformer, and is making headway in teaching his advanced ideas. He is a young man, not more than thirty-five, but has wonderful elements of popularity. He is a progressionist in every sense.</p>

   <p>He was a delegate to the Pittsburg Jewish convention, organized to urge the reform movement. He was on the committee to draft a set of declarations. The reform movement among religious Jews of this day, seeks to do away with many things long recognized by them as humbug and which ought, as President Cleveland says, to be invested with "innocuous desuetude." That platform was certainly liberal, and to give an idea of its scope, three of its planks are given below:</p>
   <p>3. We recognize in the Mosaic legislation a system of training the Jewish people for its mission during its national life in Palestine, and today we accept as binding only the moral laws and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives, but reject such as are not adapted to the views and habits of modern civilization.</p>
   <p>4. We hold that all such Mosaic and rabbinical laws as regulate diet, priestly purity and dress, originated in ages and under the influence of ideas altogether foreign to our present mental and spiritual state. They fail to impress the modern Jew with a spirit of priestly holiness; their observance in our day is apt rather to obstruct than to further modern spiritual elevation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>5. We recognize in the modern era of universal culture of heart and intellect, the approaching of the realization of Israel's great Messianic hope for the establishment of the kingdom of truth, justice and peace among all men. We consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious community and therefore expect neither a return to Palestine nor a sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron, nor the restoration of any of the laws concerning the Jewish state. Compressed into the language of every-day thought, this means: 1. The Jewish Sabbath shall be merged into the Christian's Sunday. 2. Circumcision is a relic of barbarism and should be abolished. 3. The doctrine that we are again to inhabit Palestine as a nation is no longer in the light of modern thought, tenable. The Jews, henceforth are religionists - no longer nationalists. 4. As a religion only, we receive and accept the teachings of our faith, these in their application being subject to the changes, modifications and growth of an advanced and modern civilization.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sale is an active exponent of his doctrine. The old congregations have not quite reached him yet, but they have faith that he is a coming man. Dr. Sale came originally from Louisville. He is a hard student, a great Talmudist, and is in the van of progress and reform in Judaism.</p>

   <p>$5,000 and give him donations, trips abroad, etc. Dr. Hirsch's benefice from his Sinai admirers is not less than $10,000 a year and yet the young divine is not more than thirty-three years old. Dr. Hirsch was born in Philadelphia. He is the son of Rev. Samuel Hirsch, a noted Reform Jewish divine of that city. He was educated in this country and afterward went through one of the leading rabbinical institutions in Berlin. He speaks German, French and Spanish fluently, but invariably preaches in English. He is described by his admirers as being one of the most eloquent young men in the country. The Occident, the leading Jewish paper here, some time since printed a series of twelve of Dr. Hirsch's sermons in pamphlet form and they attracted the attention of advanced Hebrews everywhere. Dr. Hirsch has almost overthrown the old-fashioned ideas of Judaism. He retains none of the outward forms and traditions of the past. The doctor is married, his wife being a daughter of the celebrated Dr. David Einhorn, of New York, one of the first and most eminent reformers of the Jewish clergy in the United States. The first clergyman of the new Sinai Congregation was Rev. Bernhard Felsenthal. Dr. Felsenthal was born in Bavaria and was educated as a rabbi, but at the time of the split he was simply a worshipper with the old congregation, but he was among the seceders from his allegiance, and so when Sinai was organized in 1860, he was chosen to officiate. This he did with great <span class="page-break">7</span>success until 1864, when a new congregation was formed called the Zion Congregation, composed of the most advanced reformers of the Sinai. Dr. Felsenthal was in sympathy with this movement, and when the split occurred he went with the seceding faction and set up a pulpit on the West Side, where he now is. It was not altogether, change of faith which led to this split, however, geography had a good deal to do with it. That congregation is now one of the largest in the city. They have just erected a beautiful new temple, at the corner of Ogden avenue and Washington boulevard, which has cost a deal of money. The congregation has not the concentrated wealth and perhaps not the enterprise of Dr. Hirsch's flock, and hence it is not Dr. Felsenthal's fortune to enjoy Rev. Hirsch's income, but Dr. Felsenthal is yet a great man and high in Jewish councils and literature. He is a renowned expounder of the Talmud. He has compiled one or two Hebrew grammars, and written several works that are destined to live in modern Jewish history. His first important writing was published in 1859, entitled Kol Kore Bamidbar, and this was one of the first prints issued in the interest of Jewish reform. It was originally written in German, but Dr. Felsenthal caused it to be published in Hebrew, and soon it was reprinted in every modern language.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>In 1866 he published Jewish School Matters in America and in 1869 Criticisms on Christian Missionaries, a work designed to reveal some of the follies of attempting to proselyte the earth all at once. He followed this up in 1878 with a work on Proselyting in Judaism. Every one of these writings has been translated abroad. Dr. Felsenthal has been married twice. He has two daughters and a son. He has a fine library, and is known at home and abroad as one of the most profound writers of Jewish literature. But for a slight impediment in his speech, which militates against his oratory, he would be one of the greatest speakers in the country. Dr. Felsenthal is an advanced reformer. His services are conducted in English and on Sunday - not Saturday - the old Jewish Sabbath. He is assisted on alternate Sundays by Rev. Max Heller, a man only twenty-three years old, a student and graduate of the Jewish College at Cincinnati.</p>
   <p>Rev. Dr. Norden of the North Side, has been in charge of the Hebrew Congregation in that division of the city for about sixteen years. He, too, is a reformer, but his congregation has not yet reached the point of Sunday services. They will come to it gradually. Dr. Norden is an earnest man and progressive. He is, however, of the older school of rabbis, and his methods <span class="page-break">9</span>and instincts are conservative. His congregation is a large one, but of the humbler class of worshippers, and the doctor's congregation is far from aristocratic. Altogether, as has been said, the Jewish churches of the city, considering their number, compare well with other religious denominations.</p>
