   <p>The year 1927-1928 promises to be a year of outstanding achievements for Chicago Avukah. Under the leadership of its president, S. William Halperin, an intensive education and practical program is being worked out. A marked improvement has been shown in the calibre of the material presented at the bi-weekly discussion meetings at the Hadassah Clubroom, where carefully prepared papers by various members of the organization are read and discussed. A new feature of Avukah work has been the organization of a Hebrew class for beginners under the direction of Mr. Chizuk, who with Mr. Simon Agranat, the chairman of the Discussion Group, deserve the hearty commendation of the organization for their excellent work.</p>

   <p>Mr. Arthur Goldberg and Mr. Harry Iseberg, our debating managers, are both hard at work making preparations for an active year. Miss Ruth Fish, at present serving as temporary corresponding secretary in the absence of Miss Jeannette Rubin, is actively endeavoring to organize an Avukah weekly seminar under the leadership of a widely known scholar in Jewish philosophy and history. Mr. Hymen Smoler, last year's president and one of our most active members, is busy working out plans for the presentation of an Avukah cultural forum. Mr. George Fisher, one of the hardest-working and reliable workers in Avukah, heads a committee to complete preparation for an excellent series of Sunday monthly meetings.</p>
   <p>In addition to these excellent co-workers, Mr. Halperin has to aid him group of faithful and devoted officers and Executive Committee members. With such cooperation and enthusiasm the year should be one of unparalleled success in every way.</p>
