   <p>Esteemed Editor of the Courier:</p>
   <p>Please permit me to say something about the building of new synagogues, with special reference to the undertaking [the contemplated construction of a synagogue] of the Luknik fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>The readers of the Courier who are interested in everything that is happening in the little world of the Chicago Jews have undoubtedly supported and will always greet with pleasure such arguments as Dr. S. Melamed has presented regarding the building of a synagogue by the Luknik immigrants.</p>
   <p>Among the many practical arguments which he presented, Dr. Melamed forgot to include one which is of great importance, namely: that the Lawndale district <span class="page-break">2</span>has enough synagogues, both large and small, but that the foundations of those houses of God are becoming weaker every day because the old members, those who are financially able to maintain such institutions, are moving away to various parts of the city and the few members who remain in the Lawndale district find it difficult to keep up the existing synagogues.</p>
   <p>The building of a synagogue is very dear to the Jewish soul. There will always ring in our ears the Cantor's prayer on Saturday, calling the blessings of the Lord upon those who build and maintain houses of prayer. But we, as well as the Luknik and other fellow countrymen, have to consider cold facts, unavoidable conclusions.</p>
   <p>We have grounds to believe that when the few Luknik "citizens" in Chicago will calmly and painstakingly make a survey of the institutions in the Lawndale district, they will find that they can perpetuate their names by helping Jewish education that cries out for immediate aid, by supporting our orphans, our aged people and our sick.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"But," a Jew who was born about two miles from Luknik will say, "the great holidays are approaching; where are the Jews to go?" Every sensible Jew will agree that rather than worry about persons who throughout the year are cold and strange, hard and far removed from everything that has to do with our daily life and who come only once a year to the synagogue, it is much better to help maintain the existing synagogues which need rabbis who can adapt themselves to American life, spiritual leaders who can understand the demands of our children.</p>
   <p>By the way, it is worth while to note that not only do "we" occasionally make a mistake, but even "they," the cream of our Jewish community, cannot sometimes open their eyes a little wider to see the true condition of their surroundings.</p>
   <p>We all know that the Jews of the South Side, as well as those of the West Side, keep on moving to the North Side. The South Side Jews have even a stronger desire to wander because they move to Evanston, Winnetka and further north. The lambs of Dr. Hirsch's Congregation now have a branch in Winnetka--Congregation of Sinai.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The negroes keep encroaching further and further south, and the two temples of Dr. Stolz and Dr. Schoenfarber were sold to become negro churches. The negroes will remain on the South Side and will soon reach the lake. However, the "realistic" directors of the two temples cannot foresee the near future and they are going to build two big temples, one mile away from the negroes, who now wink their eyes and think: "soon, soon we will come to buy your new temples." The psychology of the rich directors is the same as the psychology of the Luknik Jews who are honest and sincere. They want to perpetuate something of their own and they refuse to understand that everything which is Jewish, which has to do with the interests of our people, is also theirs.</p>
   <p>The writer of these lines will never forget the time when he called the attention of Mr. Jacob Loeb to the fact that the Jews of the West Side were moving to the Lawndale district, and that the Hebrew Institute was surrounded by a large Italian community. This was before the building which was to serve as a gymnasium for the Hebrew Institute was built.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Lawndale now has about eighty thousand Jews, and the Institute is a great distance from them. Mr. Loeb refused to see the situation. Dear and beloved to him was the ground of the Hebrew Institute and his desire was to beautify that ground with a splendid building, even though it was far from the Jews; in this sense, he was a Luknik countryman.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that our brothers will develop the art of thinking and analyzing to a greater degree, and that they will utilize their strength for big achievements instead of wasting it in their own two-by-four area.</p>
