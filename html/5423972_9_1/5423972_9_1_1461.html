   <p>Young Judea.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday and Sunday evenings, September 20-24, conferences of Jewish clubs were held for the purpose of organizing a Young Judea Council. The Young Judea movement proposes to awaken the Jewish consciousness of boys and girls by interesting them in the reading of Jewish literature, the study of Jewish history, the celebration of the festivals, the observance of Jewish traditions and participation in Zionist activity. The movement has made considerable advance during the past few years, securing the affiliation of 340 clubs, totaling a membership of over 8,000 boys and girls between the ages of twelve and twenty-one years.</p>
   <p>Mr. David Schneeberg, the national secretary of Young Judea, is making an extended stay in the city in order to establish Young Judea in Chicago.</p>
