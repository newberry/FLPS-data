   <p>Federal officials are expecting a huge emigration movement of the foreign-born in Chicago to their old homes in Europe. War restrictions for aliens have already been practically removed. All that is necessary is to secure a passport to leave the United States and a permit from the consul of the country to which the alien desires to go.</p>
   <p>According to the new order of the State Department passports will be issued to all countries except Russia and Hungary. About two hundred applications for passports were filed in Chicago yesterday. Federal officials expect to be flooded with applications in the next few months. It is said that twenty-five thousand aliens in Chicago, mostly Italians, Greeks, and Czechoslovakians, are prepared to return to their old homes with money earned in American factories. A large number of Chicago's Germans are also ready to leave.</p>
