   <p>(Sinai Temple Religious School)</p>
   <p>Four hundred dollars ($400.00) worth of thrift and Savings Stamps have been sold by me to the pupils. This, of course, simply supplements the work of the Public Schools. We could, therefore, not realize a larger amount.</p>
   <p>Two of our teachers, Mr. Solomon Marx and Mr. Maurice Markowitz have entered the service of the United States, and are at present in the Army.</p>
   <p>Now for the first time in years, the Special Children's Services held in the Temple, as well asthe celebrations of Chanukak and Purim were omitted. All in line with the expressed wish of the Government for conservation. This was made clear to the pupils as a Lesson in Loyalty. National Songs were sung at every session, and everything said and done to promote patriotism.</p>
