   <p>Jewish declarers, who officially represent the Alliance of Declarers and Future Citizens, appeared before the Immigration Commission of Congress and made a heart breaking appeal to accept the bills brought up in Congress to ameliorate the present quote law, that relative of citizen declares may be permitted to enter America out of the quota.</p>
   <p>The delegation made such an impression on the members of the Immigration Commission that there is now a hope that the bills will be approved. Those who appeared before the Commission are Joseph Danofpsky, president of the Declarers organization, a Hebrew teacher, who came here from Poland in 1922, and left a wife and three children; Paul Schucht, vice-president of the organization, who came from Estonia a year and a half ago and left a wife and three children. Schucht, a young man, touched the hearts of the Commission when he told them that he has never yet seen his youngest child, who was born when he was on his way to America. Hyman Abel, a man of fifty years, a Hebrew teacher, who came here in 1923; Wm. Prince, who also left a wife and children in Europe; Moses Liebman, importer of watches, who left a wife and four children in Galicia; Philip Reis, who came to America from Vienna and left a wife and child.</p>

   <p>All citizens who want to influence Congress to modify immigration laws, permitting women and children of those who have first papers, have an opportunity to help materialize the demand of thousands of immigrants, who are turned away from their families as a result of the bad immigration laws.</p>
   <p>The declarers, those having their first papers have organized into an alliance, which sent out a petition asking Congress and the President of the United States to adopt the Perelman Woodsworth bills, and the House and Senate to amend the Immigration Law of 1927, in the following manner:</p>
   <p>An unmarried immigrant under twenty-one years, a man, the wife, the father, the mother, of a citizen of the United States or of a former soldier, or sailor of the American Army or Navy of the World War, or of an immigrant, who legally entered America before July 1, 1924, who has declared in accordance with the law, the intention of becoming a citizen of the United States and is still in this country, shall be permitted to enter America. The contents of this petition are being spread among all organizations, and it is the duty of each citizen to sign this petition and help to get as many signatures as is possible - that Congress and the President shall see that there is a great demand of the citizens to change the brutal immigration laws that break up families and create many hardships and much suffering.</p>
