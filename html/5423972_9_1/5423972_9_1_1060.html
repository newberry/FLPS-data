   <p>On April 21, 1878, an orthodox synagogue was started on the North Side, (Anshe Emeth.) Services were held for the first six months at the residence of S. Bernheim, on Larrabee Street, for the next ten years years in a hall at 262 Division Street.</p>
   <p>During the term of thirteen years as president, Mr. J. H. Hollander, Jacob Levy, and Elis Rosenbaum, purchased the lot and frame house at 349 Sedgwick Street, for $2,600. It cost the congregation $800 to convert it into a house of worship. A cemetery was bought at Waldheim for $3,000.</p>
   <p>The congregation was released from all debt. It has now a membership of over seventy. On Sunday, May 14, 1893, the corner stone of the new synagogue was laid with impressive ceremonies.</p>
