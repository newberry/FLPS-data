   <p>The Chicago Branch of the Women's League was organized in November, 1918 by a small group of women, who elected Mrs. Benjamin Davis as chairman, and Mrs. Joseph Hevesh as Secretary. With the assistance of Mrs. Joshua Ginsburg, nine Sisterhoods were enrolled in the League at the close of the first year. Due to the efforts of Mrs. Joseph Hevesh, Mrs. Leon Waldman, Mrs. Jacob Glasser, and Mrs. C. Wecker, much progress was made. In May, 1920, Mrs. Leon Waldman was called to lead the growing organization, which now consists of fourteen local Sisterhoods numbering thirteen hundred members and one hundred members at large. A scholarship at the Jewish Theological Seminary in memory of Professor Israel Friedlander has been established by the Chicago Branch and it has assisted in all other lines of endeavor. It is now co-operating in giving a benefit for Jewish war orphans on Monday evening, November 21, at the Princess Theater, under the able chairmanship of Mrs. Louis Pitzele and an efficient committee.</p>
