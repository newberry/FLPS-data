   <p>The Zionist organization of the Federated Zionist Societies finds it necessary to publicly announce that it is expressly against making any "slates" of candidates for the Jewish Congress elections.</p>
   <p>On the list of nominated candidates there are many Zionists. Whatever the slate of the Zionists may be, it will humiliate good Zionists. Also the Zionists do not wish to play politics with a great Jewish undertaking.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, publicize that if a slate is issued in the name of Zionists, it is of no authority, it is against justice and against the interests of the Zionist movement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We protest especially against a slate that is now being circulated and that bears the signature of the Chicago Zion League. This "slate" was made without the approval of the Zionist societies.</p>
