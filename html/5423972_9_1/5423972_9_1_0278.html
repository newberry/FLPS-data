   <p>The Order Knights of Zion is now making preparations for their tenth annual convention. As a prelude to the assemblance of delegates, the Chicago Zionists will give a Ball on the November 9th at the Brooks Casino. Everyone interested in Chicago Jewish Life is invited to attend.</p>
   <p>It is highly appropriate that the tenth annual convention of this organization be celebrated with a grand parade followed by an impressive Ball.</p>
   <p>A decade is perhaps, a short period of time when referring to the existence of a fraternal organization. The Orders and Lodges which pay sick benefits, burial expenses, and insurance exist because of the inherent interest of its members in the organization and its activities. Their existence, has a natural foundation.</p>
   
   <p>The mass of people can often lift itself out of its maize of daily problems and dwell for a short time in a higher spiritual world. However, this high plane is lost, as the day, today problems again assume their natural weight. The masses must see actual results, and when they fail to see results, their interest in a movement lags and often dies.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the ten year existence of the Order Knights of Zion is of great importance. In the course of the last ten years, this organization acquainted the Jews of Chicago with Zionism thru mass-meetings, conventions and the printed page. The Order founded Sabbath Schools, supported them, sponsored and took part in any function which would improve the lot of the Jew. And when an organization succeeds in kindeling and keeping alive the interest of the masses in a purely idealogical movement it has accomplished a great deal.</p>
   
   <p>The first ten years, we believe, have been the hardest. The Order has earned the right to celebrate this jubilee. We hope that its future activities will earn for it the privelege of celebrating another jubilee which another successful milestone in the activities of the Zionist movement.</p>
