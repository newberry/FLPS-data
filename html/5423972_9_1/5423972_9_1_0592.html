   <p>An apostate and informer, who at one time testified that Jews use Christian blood for ritual purposes, has served as a rabbi in New York and occupied the pulpit of a legitimate congregation. As his trial was heard before the Union of Orthodox Rabbis, we have the right to assume that he was a rabbi of an Orthodox Congregation at that. Such a scandal could only occur among the American Jewry. It would be impossible for such a thing to happen in Europe because no community there would engage a rabbi unless the community knew all about his life, his past, his intellectual and moral qualifications, etc. In America, however, the rabbinate is disorganized. Any ignoramus or scoundrel can easily become a rabbi in America--even a man like Tillinger, who has now been unmasked as a former apostate and informer, was able to get a rabbinical position in America--and if he had not accidentally been recognized, he would probably have remained a rabbi for the rest of his life and would perhaps have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>occupied a prominent niche among the American rabbis.</p>
   <p>We are afraid that Tillinger is not the only scoundrel who has found a place of asylum in the American rabbinate. In America there are several such Tillingers--and there are people who are capable of doing what Tillinger did and who are today acting as Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform rabbis--and no one denounces them.</p>
   <p>If we were to examine our Chicago rabbinate, we would find a fine selection of "rabbis" [among them]. Just yesterday we heard of a remarkable case of an unauthorized shohet who plays the role not only of a rabbi, but of a great rabbi, a man of genius. He even grants rabbinical licenses to others, although he himself is an illiterate, irresponsible cynic. It is no exaggeration to say that many "rabbis" in America are not rabbis but common swindlers and charlatans. Some of them are ordinary criminals and many are probably worse than that. We know of "rabbis" in America who admit quite frankly in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>private that to them, the rabbinate is a "game" and they admit that they are in the "rabbinical game".</p>
   <p>The degree of moral corruption and irresponsibility that prevails in the American rabbinate has existed at no other time and in no other country where Jews have lived. The Conservative and Reform, as well as the Orthodox Jews, suffer from this chaotic condition. Among American rabbis, both Orthodox and Reform, there are many former anarchists and social democrats who were at one time as sincere anarchists and socialists as they are now sincere rabbis. Among American rabbis there are all sorts of filthy, wicked, and degenerate elements. As far as the American rabbinate is concerned, everything [and anything] goes. Any parasite can adopt the title "rabbi" and get away with it.</p>
   <p>This is not, and never has been, the case in Eastern or Western Europe. In England, where Jewish life does not differ a great deal from that in America, no one would dare to adopt the title "rabbi," if he did not have <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>either a rabbinical degree conferred by noted Eastern European rabbis, or a degree conferred by the London Rabbinical Court. This is also true in Germany, Italy, and France. But in America, any scoundrel, any good-for-nothing who would otherwise be completely useless, can adopt the title "rabbi"--and most congregations would be willing to accept him as their spiritual leader, if he had enough "pull" with a few members of the congregation.</p>
   <p>The Tillinger incident should be a lesson to the American Jews, especially to the large Jewish communities in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Reform Jews have already recognized this evil, and at their last convention in New York, they adopted a resolution which states that no congregation which is affiliated with the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, shall recognize a rabbi who is not a graduate from the Cincinnati Hebrew Union College or from an accredited European institution of learning.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Hitherto, the Orthodox Jews in America have not acknowledged the evil of a disorganized rabbinate and have permitted anyone who claimed to be a rabbi to practice. The Tillinger case will perhaps encourage the Orthodox Jews in America to take certain measures to safequard the honor of the rabbinate and to prevent every scoundrel and impostor from becoming a rabbi.</p>
   <p>The only way that this can be done is through the consolidation of all the Orthodox communities in America into one concrete organization. Each Orthodox community should be pledged to refuse to accept a rabbi without the approval of either the central authority of the Union of Orthodox Congregations or the Union of Orthodox Rabbis. This can be accomplished. It will take time and energy before all the Orthodox communities in America will consolidate into one large Alliance--but it can be done--and sooner or later it must be done, else the American Orthodoxy will suffer great disgrace.</p>

   <p>The anarchy in American Jewry must be eradicated if Judaism is to exist in this country.</p>
