   <p>Had Chicago twenty-five large synagogues instead of eighty small ones, then those twenty-five synagogues would have been able to keep up twenty-five Talmud Torahs, they would have had twenty-five prominent rabbis, they would have had twenty-five good cantors and there would have been twenty-five fortresses of Judaism in Chicago. But ninety little synagogues are doomed to inactivity. A little synagogue that has about fifty or sixty members cannot have a rabbi but must have a "little rabbi" who is half preacher, half circumciser, half jester and entirely a beggar. A little synagogue cannot keep up a Talmud Torah, a little synagogue cannot engage a good cantor--in short, a little synagogue can do--nothing. The existence of so many little synagogues explains the political and moral weakness of the Chicago orthodoxy.</p>
   <p>When the forces of a certain group of people are divided, then the group can accomplish nothing--it cannot even fight in the struggle for existence. The Chicago-Jewish orthodoxy stands before a triple enemy: Reformism, radicalism and indifference. To be able to overcome this triple enemy it must unite its forces, but instead it scatters them from day to day. The curse of the little synagogue and the spirit of the little synagogue rest heavily upon the orthodox <span class="page-break">\3</span>Jews of Chicago.</p>
   <p>There are already ninety little synagogues in Chicago--that would seem to be enough, but it is still not enough. Various other little groups are going to build new little synagogues. The Luknik people are going to build a synagogue, the Goroditch people are going to build a synagogue and so are a score or so of Jews who come from the small towns of Poland and Lithuania--and they are going to build them in districts where there are enough synagogues, large and beautiful synagogues.</p>
   <p>Whence comes this accursed little synagogue spirit? There is only one answer to this question: Greenhorns.</p>
   <p>Many Jews in Chicago who have lived here a few decades, whose roots here are deep, and who live here with their families, are still unable to understand that now they are Chicago Jews, not Luknik, Goroditch or Anikst Jews. But instead of considering themselves Chicago Jews, with a sense of responsibility for Judaism in Chicago, they live with their memories of their youth, they live <span class="page-break">\4</span>in the past and do not think about the present. They live in the spirit not of Chicago, but of their small towns in the Old World.</p>
   <p>There are also many little men with big ambitions who dream about becoming presidents of synagogues, and are ready to build their own little synagogue or to help build little synagogues so that they may become the "big shots" in their own little circle. In general, these little men are the parvenus who have no sense of responsibility for the present Jewish generation and for the Jewish needs in the Jewish city where they live. As far as they are concerned, Judaism may perish in Chicago so long as they are presidents of little synagogues.</p>
   <p>This "little synagogue" spirit is ruining Chicago Jewry and, on top of that, it is very expensive. The little synagogues cannot do anything for themselves and they cannot do anything for the city. It is difficult to organize them to do general Jewish work. The relief committee has to communicate with ninety little synagogues, instead of twenty large ones; so does the Keren Hayisod, the Federated, and so on. Not all of them can be coordinated into <span class="page-break">\5</span>the work. Twenty large synagogues may represent the voice of the community but one hundred little synagogues represent nothing. Nobody considers them in the least because, as a rule, they have no opinion and do not care at all about general Jewish problems.</p>
   <p>It is about time that the leaders of Chicago began an energetic fight against this "little synagogue" spirit and opened a campaign for the concentration of all the orthodox forces in Chicago and not their disintegration. New little synagogues are not needed in Chicago, but the amalgamation of fifty little synagogues into ten large ones is needed. Only then will we have in Chicago more Talmud Torahs, a stronger orthodoxy and a Jewish public opinion which will carry more weight.</p>
