   <p>Department of Civics and Citizenship.</p>
   <p>The total number of new registrations in the Civics and Citizenship Department for the past year was 572. For the same period last year there were 450. Taking into consideration the fact that out of the 450 a considerable number were listed under new registrations, when as a matter of fact they had visited the Department before, but were so listed because the Department had been reorganized, and the new Director found it necessary to register every applicant, the number of registrations this year showed, nevertheless, a substantial increase over those of last year.</p>
   <p>This is not at all surprising, in view of the fact that citizenship is no longer a matter which must be sold to those who have as yet not acquired it - it is sought for. A number of things have happened, during the past twelve months, in immigration interest. The House Immigration Committee definitely decided to accept and report favorably Congressman Dickstein's proposals to legalize and permit the permanent stay of all aliens who entered America illegally prior to July 1, 1924, and also those aliens who arrived between July 1, 1924 and July 1, 1925, provided the government does not deport the latter prior to July 1, 1927. The Bill also provides for naturalization without producing a certificate of arrival of those aliens who entered illegally prior to July 1, 1924. It was hitherto impossible for such aliens to obtain citizenship. The aliens who thus entered between July 1, 1923 and July 1, 1924 may become naturalized after July 1, 1927, if the government has not previously deported them according to the Bill.</p>
   <p>The Committee also accepted Congressman Dickstein's proposal to take away the Czaristic powers originally granted by the Deportation Bill to Immigration Inspectors, and instead, to grant aliens a hearing before a special Board, and make deportations subject to appeal, and to be approved by the Secretary of Labor. An alien is also to have the right to subpoena witnesses.</p>
   
   <p>The House Immigration Committee, instead of taking action on the Wadsworth Amendment, for admission of 35,000 wives and children of declarants, has stumbled upon a number of obstructions. At one of the hearings, Royal C. Stevens, representing the Patriotic Citizens Civic Association of Philadelphia, appeared against the Wadsworth Amendment. He protested against the admission of additional aliens to America on the grounds that they do not become sufficiently Americanized. He described conditions in large areas of alien population, especially in Philadelphia, asserting that they are a menance on account of their failure to become Americanized.</p>
   <p>The total number of aliens that come into the United States, as recorded in the report of the Commissioner of Immigration was 304,488. Of this number 10,267 were Jewish. In the face of these facts, we learn that there may be a reduction of 11,126 in the number admitted to the United States annually; this is indicated in a report sent to the Senate by President Coolidge on the "National Origins" quota provided for in the Immigration Act of 1924.</p>
   
   <p>It is unwise to be too sanguine regarding the alien's position in the United States. At a meeting of the Industrial Relations Association held Monday, February 8, 1926, a marvelous and dramatic address was given by the Honorable John P. McGoorty, Judge of the Superior Court of Cook County, on "What Are Our Immigration Problems?" On this occasion Judge McGoorty spoke most vehemently against the present stringent immigration policy. During his address he paid special compliment to the Institute (He knew nothing of my presence there at the time) I quote here from his statement.</p>
   <p>"I remember one evening at the Jewish People's Institute in Chicago, hearing a young Russian Jew speak of his Race and of the tribulations of his people in far off Russia, and it seemed at though the very soul of the people was finding expression through this speaker. And I again felt a profound feeling of what a wonderful thing it is that our country can awaken such sentiments, such loyalty and patriotism as has been manifested in our several wars by our foreign born, as seemed visualized to me when I stood in the American Cemetery at Belleau Wood and saw the 6,000 white crosses there, and the flag of our country floating overhead."</p>
   <p>The Judge carefully analyzed the present proposed immigration measure, and stated that during the year 1925, according to the report of the United States Census Bureau, 85% of the 145,000 immigrants who were admitted to the United States came from Northern Europe and he stated further that if the provision of the law referred to goes into effect July 1, 1927, 58% of the quota of immigrants will come from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, leaving but 27% to come from all of the remainder of Northwestern Europe. Judge McGoorty did not deny our right as a nation to adopt any policy of immigration that seems most conducive to our interests and our country's future and well being, emphasizing, however, that it was to be hoped that our country will never adopt a policy that will be a departure from its tradition of justice and equity in its treatment of immigrants nor one that would be regarded by other countries as unfair and discriminating, and which might result in possible reprisals.</p>
   <p>It is pleasant to be able to call to your attention a few other excellent statements made by this broadminded jurist. "It at once," he says, "becomes manifest that if we adopt a policy by which a certain number of any particular nationality - a majority, if you please in this instance, shall be regarded as a favored group, and that our immigration shall consist of a majority of such nationality, we at once may say in effect that that group is race superior, and when we think of the great artists, sculptors, poets, philosophers and scientists that the various countries of Europe have given to the world, how can it be said that any one race is superior or that people living in some other part of Europe? Who would say, for instance that Dante, Galileo and Michael Angelo are not among the world's great? Who will say that the great scientists, poets and scholars of France and Germany have not contributed to greatness of the world, and shall it be said that we shall adopt, for the first time, as a permanent policy, that there is a certain race superiority or that it is the policy of our country to impress upon its people and upon its future, the characteristics of any particular race? Is it not wiser statesmanship to say that while we have the right to determine the terms upon which immigrants shall be admitted to our shores, seeking citizenship, that the test of their qualifications shall be character, honesty, health, and self-maintenance, comprehending those rugged and fine qualities that go to make desirable men and women, and to strengthen and enrich the body of our citizenship?" The Judge here referred to the fact that beginning July 1, 19 27, three out of every five immigrants will come from Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He asked, "Why should Great Britain and the north of Ireland be given a preference over the south of Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Serbia, and all of the other countries that go to make up Europe?"</p>
   
   <p>In the report of the United States Immigration Bureau, reference is made that the enforcement of this portion of the Immigration Law is regarded as impractical, for the report says, "Beginning July 1, 1927, the allotment shall be determined according to National Origin. The Bureau feels that the present method of ascertaining the quotas is far more satisfactory that the proposed method of National Origins." It is our hope that Congress will follow the recommendations of the United States Immigration Bureau.</p>
   <p>The Judge, in his closing remarks said, "I hope that the time will never come in this country, when class will be arrayed against class, when the Jew, the Pole, the German, the Frenchman, and the Irshman will feel that there has been, by law, the stamp of inferiority placed upon him or on his race, but that we shall always adhere to the policy that regardless of the man's place of birth, or of race, or of creed that he is welcome to our shores, along the lines we have outlined, based on justice and equity, and that the only test will be is he fit and qualified to become an American citizen, one who is willing to serve his country."</p>
