   <p>The historical Zionist Convention to be held the end of June in Chicago, the first annual meeting of all Zionists in the country, will have all the indications of a Zionist Congress. Leading Zionists of Europe, headed by Dr. Chaim Weizmann, will be here to attend. A heavier load of activities than is even carried at some of the Zionist Congresses is on the program.</p>
   <p>This year's Zionist Convention in America must lay the cornerstone for an "old-new" Jewish home in Palestine. Its particular duty will be to furnish financial means to start this tremendous task.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>During the War Jews of Europe were economically ruined. We cannot, therefore, expect any financial aid of them. In fact we have to assist them so that they might exist.</p>
   <p>Relief work from America will have to continue for years unless the plan of Dr. Shmrihu Levin is adopted i.e., to create a national loan of a hundred million dollars to help the European Jews.</p>
   <p>American Zionists will have to exert every effort to finance the immense plans for Palestine. To actuate these, more than thirty million dollars are needed for the first few years. As soon as peace is settled, thousands of Jews from all corners and ends of Eastern and Central Europe will migrate to Palestine. Because of the desperate conditions of Jews in Poland, Rumania, and Galicia this migration may assume the proportions of a second Egyptian <span class="page-break">3</span>exodus. There may not be enough ships to carry them across the sea. But, at the present time, Palestine cannot accept many immigrants, not only because as yet the necessary economic terms for mass immigration have not been arranged, but, simply because there is a lack of homes or tents to house the people. Should the immigrants settle in Palestine, in the course of the first peace year, in numbers of twenty thousand souls they would need at least 5,000 houses and 5,000 houses are not built in a day. To set them up would cost at least $5,000,000. Then again, homes alone are not enough. Settlers must have fertile ground to work on, domestic animals, and machinery for farming. Skilled industrial workers must have factories to work in, to earn a living. Besides, roads, bridges, and local railroads must be built in order to <span class="page-break">4</span>develop the commerce of the country. Schools for children must be established immediately, as well as certain philanthropic institutions which are an absolute necessity in every country. All this requires hugh sums of money and considerable working efforts. If Zionists do not wish to create a panic or catastrophe in Palestine with mass immigration for which the country is not ready, they must get to work immediately and raise this huge sum of money and organize the essential constructive forces.</p>
   <p>These gigantic demands which time makes on the Zionists cannot be fulfilled by using old methods. The last Zionist Convention pledged to raise three million dollars for the Redemption Fund. But alas! To the present day, not even half has been secured; we greatly doubt if they have a third. Chicago's quota was a quarter of a million <span class="page-break">5</span>dollars. In spite of all efforts, exertions, and campaigns, they secured less than fifty thousand dollars. We believe Chicago is not the only Zionist city in America and if results were so tragic here, other cities were no more successful. We do not wish to place the blame on anyone. We merely desire to say this: that the next Zionist Convention must discover new methods to make American-Jews fulfill their duties to Mother Zion.</p>
   <p>Besides this, the Convention must solve many political and organizational problems pertaining to the Zionist Movement. It is about time the Chicago Jews set to work to make this convention the great convention that it is expected to be.</p>
   <p>If Chicago's convention is not a local success, it cannot be any success at all. This is so obvious that it is unnecessary to say much about it. Rather it is the duty of Zionists in Chicago to not <span class="page-break">6</span>only double their exertions but to increase them tenfold, so that the convention may reach the heights of a Congress. Members of the convention must know that Chicago, the second largest Jewish Center in America, is a Zionist city having a large Zionist membership which is ready to bring great offers to Zionism at this great historical moment. Should Chicago set the inspiring example, the rest of the country would follow in its footsteps and would respond in like fashion. In regard to the convention, how could Chicago invite a convention with only eight thousand Zionist members out of a population of a quarter million Jews?</p>
   <p>But now that they have accepted, they must begin immediately on this important work. Should their leaders be found lacking in energy then the rank and file must be industriously set to labor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>If this task is not commenced now, it will be done, when?</p>
