   <p>This magnificent Jewish house of worship is situated on Indiana Avenue, corner of 21st Street, and is an imposing structure. It was built in 1874--1875, and was dedicated on the eve of Passover in 1875. The architect who made the plans and superintended the erection of the building, was Mr. Dankman Adler, the same ingenious architect who designed so many of Chicago's monumental buildings, and who at present is superintending the erection of the grand "Auditorium."</p>
   <p>The temple covers an area 91 x 125 feet and is wholly constructed of Joliet stone. The architects have shown therein the Romanesque style, with many details, at once pleasing to the eye. The basement is divided into spacious school-rooms for the Sabbath schools and vestry meeting-halls. The main auditorium is lofty and grand. In the west-end is the pulpit, and above that the choir and organ are located; the latter is an excellent instrument containing upwards of thirty registers. The decorations are elegant and attractive. During late years, and since the ministration of Dr. Hirsch, it was found that the temple had not sufficient seating capacity, hence the congregation had a gallery constructed which projects around the main auditorium on three sides.</p>

   <p>In this connection it may be proper to give some points from the history of the Sinai Congregation. This congregation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois in the spring of the year 1861. About the same time the young congregation acquired by purchase from a Christian congregation, a church building which was located on Monroe street, between Clark and LaSalle streets. The first Jewish services therein were held on June 17 and 18, 1861, and the dedicatory sermons were preached by the Rev. Samuel Geller, of New York. At the same time Dr. B. Felsenthal entered upon his office as Rabbi of this congregation, and remained efficiently connected with it, until the month of June, 1864, when he withdrew and accepted a call from the Zion Congregation, in your city, which had then been called into existence.</p>
   <p>The Sinai Congregation thereupon remained for about two years without a regular Rabbi, and during this time its divine services were conducted by"Readers." In May 1866, Dr. Isaac Chronik, who had been invited to become the Rabbi of the congregation, had come over from Berlin, Germany, and entered upon his functions. Dr. Chronik returned to Germany after he had served the Sinai Congregation for about five years and six months. His successor was Dr. K. Kohler. This gentleman who had previously been officiating as Rabbi for two years in a congregation <span class="page-break">\3</span>in Detroit, commenced his official life in Chicago in November 1871, and remained here for nearly eight years. In the Fall of 1879, Dr. Kohler left for New York; a congregation in that city having tendered him a call to become their teacher and spiritual advisor. Again the congregation was "Rabbi-less" and remained so until September 1880, when the present incumbent of the rabbincial office, the Rev. Dr. E.G. Hirsch, came here from Louisville, Ky. and began labor in the field to which he had been called in so honorable a manner. Dr. Hirsch's labors were crowned by great success, and since his coming here the congregation grew very much in number of members and in influence.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of this short historical sketch, it was said that the first house of worship which the congregation owned and occupied was situated on Monroe Street. In the summer of 1864 that house was sold and the congregation brought from the "Plymouth Church Congregation" their meeting-house, located on the northwest corner of Third avenue and Van Buren street. In September 1864 this new house of worship, the second temple of the Sinai Congregation, was dedicated to its sacred purposes by the late Dr. Maurine Mayer of New York City. On Oct. 9, 1871, it fell a prey to the great fire. The congregation worshipped now, at first, in the Methodist church building on Wabash avenue and 22nd street; until, as stated above, in April 1875, the new temple had been completed and dedicated.</p>
