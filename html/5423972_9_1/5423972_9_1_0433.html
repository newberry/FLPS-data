   <p>Can you tell me why a Jewish father will take care of the Jewish education of his son but will not do anything for the Jewish education of his daughter? The sons of the Jews of Chicago, as it is, do not know too much about Judaism, but the daughters, even of strict Orthodox parents, know absolutely nothing about Judaism. When they grow up and mingle among Jews, they consider everything Jewish in the nature of a bad joke. How can Judaism in Chicago last if an entire generation of Jewish mothers knows absolutely nothing of Judaism? I would like to bet that out of a hundred Jewish girls in the Lawndale district, there are not five who have read the Bible, and who are acquainted with the most elementary facts of Jewish history.</p>
   <p>And Chicago is considered the most Jewish city in America!</p>
