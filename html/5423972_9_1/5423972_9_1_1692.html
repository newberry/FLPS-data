   <p>The office of the Joint Relief Committee of Chicago received a reply from the State Department as to whether American Jews may bring their relatives from Eastern Europe.</p>
   <p>The letter states, that the State Department does not know why they could not do so. Relatives of those living in America will be permitted to enter providing they do not belong to the class of aliens who are excluded under the immigration laws.</p>
   <p>Those who wish to come to America now, the letter states, must secure a passport from their government and bring this passport to the American consul in their locality. The American consul cannot, however, help them secure a passport from their government.</p>
