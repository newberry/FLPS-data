   <p>M. M. Gerstley has retired from the presidency of the Kehilath Anshe Ma'arab congregation.</p>
   <p>The prosperity attained by this congregation, the high standing maintained at all times are clearly due to the rare tact, zeal and care exercised by Mr. Gerstley. When 31 years ago he assumed his office, he was confronted by great difficulties. The waves of party dissensions ran high and the outlook was not encouraging.</p>
   <p>The 31 years of his administration are a brilliant record of signal fidelity.</p>
