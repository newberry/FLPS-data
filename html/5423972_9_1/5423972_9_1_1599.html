   <p>Three Chicagoans recently made a journey to Washington to present a petition to the President on the behalf of the stranded Jewish immigrants. They were Abraham Liebling, A. B. Messer, and Herman Elenbogen. Their connections with official Washington and the close acquaintance-ship of the first two with Mr. Coolidge gave them a valuable entree. They succeeded in laying before the President the plight of those would-be immigrants who had been given their visas, broken up their homes and made ready to come to America, only to be stopped by the quota restrictions.</p>
   <p>Much is to be hoped for from the efforts of these gentlemen. In the meantime, however, other Jewish bodies have expressed their disapproval of this "freelancing" junket. With our Chicago gentlemen asking the President for one thing, the Marshall group petitioning Congress and the Courts for another, and P. O. W. and like organizations making efforts in still other directions, the result is sure to be harmful, say the Eastern leaders. And yet, if Messrs. Liebling, Messer, and Elenbogen should suceed in opening the President's eyes to the injustice that America is perpetrating on invitees to this country, they will have done more than has so far been accomplished by powerful Jewish bodies in years of work.</p>
