   <p>The Young Maccabees.</p>
   <p>The retaining of the Jewish youth within its folds is what stamps the Hebrew Institute as a Jewish institution. Practically all of the children's activities can be and are duplicated in settlement houses and other social centers like the Institute. There is, however, one juvenile organization among the multitude of other children's activities at the Institute which is distinctly and purely Jewish in its work, aims, and aspirations. We have reference to the Young Maccabees.</p>
   <p>They aim to implant and perpetuate a knowledge of and a love for all that is Jewish, its language, literature, history and traditions in the hearts and minds of the American Jewish youth. From the day the Maccabees came to the Institute, to the present time they have received almost paternal interest and care at the hands of the Institute officials. We have watched them take root on Institute soil and grow to the splendid organization it is today. Through able leadership <span class="page-break">2</span>and good work the Maccabees succeeded in establishing similar clubs on the South Side and the Lawndale District.</p>
   <p>The Maccabees have a history of their own and each step gained was wrought with difficulties and obstacles. The beginning was very humble indeed, in comparison with what it is now. Indefatigable industry, perseverance and faith in the good there is in the work, are the factors which account for our success. About three years ago the Poale Zion and Jewish National Workers Alliance had first conceived the idea of establishing a "Yiddish Folks Shulle." This was started under the initiative of B. J. Shapiro with the cooperation of influential and prominent men in the community, such as Mr. Harry Lipsky and others. For a while we used the John M. Smyth Public School for our meetings. The enthusiastic support of these two organizations ensured the success of the Young Maccabees as they started out on their onward march.</p>
   <p>Due to financial difficulties this activity was given up and the workers for <span class="page-break">3</span>this idea were discouraged and broken in spirit. At this critical period, Mr. Elias Kipnis, the able and energetic leader of the young Maccabees took up the leadership of the disorganized Maccabees, brought them again to life, and succeeded in building up an organization of which the Maccabees, their friends and the Institute are justly proud. Mr. E. Kipnis' first far sighted policy was to bring the Maccabees under the proper and logical environment and a Jewish atmosphere and so he organized them at the Chicago Hebrew Institute the natural home for such a distinctly Jewish organization. They started the organization with as few as ten members. Today the Young Maccabees count ten clubs with a total membership of over five-hundred. Eight of these clubs meet at the Institute and more are to be organized in the near future.</p>
   <p>The affairs of the clubs are conducted by the Federative Committee, consisting of the supervisor, the teachers and representatives from the various clubs. The object of the Maccabees as stated in their Constitution is to develop a knowledge and a love for the Jewish nation and Jewish culture and tradition.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In order to develop this they teach the children to read, write and speak in Yiddish and in the advanced classes in Hebrew, they take up Jewish history, literature, folk songs, Jewish drama, etc. The clubs meet on Sundays, morning, afternoon and evening. The age of the children vary from nine to sixteen.</p>
   <p>The Young Macabees have extended their work outside the club room. They have organized a Children's War Relief Conference and succeeded in getting the cooperation of a number of other juvenile organizations. These conferences are held semi-monthly at the Institute. The proceeds go to the children of the war zone. The loyalty and devotion displayed by the children in their collecting, was worthy of admiration. This fine spirit of self-sacrifice will go a long way towards building up the character of the children. A successful tag-day brought in as much as $1,500. From time to time the Young Maccabees present Jewish plays. One of these was very successfully presented on March 18, Purim, and another one on April 19. Both plays were entertaining and interesting. The Poale Zion and the Jewish National Workers Alliance have <span class="page-break">5</span>grown to be quite influential of late in the Jewish community, and the support given by these two organizations to the work of these clubs is valuable and helpful.</p>
   <p>After the holidays, the Young Maccabees will greatly extend their activities at the Institute. Four extra rooms were engaged for special club work. A large staff of club leaders has been provided for and the work promises to be more intense than ever before. The teaching will be conducted in accord with the program adopted by the Hebrew Teachers' Federation. A Jewish library will in all probability be installed by the Young Maccabees at the Institute. Mr. E. Kipnis is also planning to establish a Jewish kindergarten, provided the necessary funds can be raised for its maintenance. The registration for the Summer took place on Thursday, the 20th, and all day Sunday, April 23.</p>
