   <p>What are the problems which will confront the forthcoming Zionist convention in America? One has only to glance at the world situation to realize the conditions of the Jewish people at the present time, and to surmise accurately which problems will be of primary importance at [the Zionist Convention] to be held in the Auditorium Theater in Chicago during the week of September 14. In the shadows which the convention casts before it, can be seen the formation of the character of the convention, even to the principal ideas which will dominate it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Everyone will note that at the coming convention the platform to be adopted regarding Palestine will be entirely different from those of previous conventions. For the first time in the history of Zionist congresses and conventions, the attitude will be one of "Our Palestine", and not of a "prospective Palestine". The difference between these attitudes is sharply defined. It is the difference between [the attitude of] the man who wants to buy a lot and the man who has made a down payment, has an option, and needs only to settle the details of the contract to become the owner.</p>
   <p>If, after the Balfour Declaration, there is still any doubt as to the intention of the British government, then the practical negotiations of that government since the Declaration can leave no room for doubt. Palestine is to be our home, a Jewish home.</p>
   <p>To those Jews who ask, "How soon will Palestine be ours in fact, as well as <span class="page-break">\3</span>Athens until I saw how quickly you walked?"</p>
   <p>And so it is with us at the present time. The length of time it takes to make Palestine actually ours depends on the speed with which we work. There is no doubt but that we will work rapidly, whether we want to or not.</p>
   <p>Just this week we read a cable from Isaac Don Levine, one of the most capable and most reliable foreign correspondents of the Chicago Daily News, [to the effect] that at least one million Jews are looking forward to the time when they will be able to leave Russia and go to Palestine.</p>
   <p>We know that Palestine, in its present condition, is not in a position to admit a million or even a tenth of a million, at one time. But Jewish need will force the American Jews and those in countries spared by the war, to concentrate all their constructive energies upon Palestine in order to prepare <span class="page-break">\4</span>it to admit the greatest possible number of Jews, and to hasten the preparations to receive even greater numbers.</p>
   <p>What, must be done to prepare the land? Buildings must be erected, gardens must be planted, the machinery for exports and imports must be set up, a steady supply of food, clothing, and machinery must be established, and industries must be started immediately, in order to offer work to as many as possible. This will be the convention's first problem.</p>
   <p>In the last few days the cables have informed us of the attitude of the mandate committee of the Peace Conference which is in session in London, under the leadership of Lord Robert Cecil. The Committee notified the Palestinian military administration that the Balfour Declaration must be carried out to the letter and the spirit. The Balfour Declaration is to make Palestine the homeland of the Jewish people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Members of the Palestine Committee who are now returning from that country are Judge Brandeis, Jacob De Haas, Dr. Friedenwald, Robert Szold, and others. These gentlemen will be in a better position to report the attitude of the military administration of Palestine, the methods they are adopting to make Palestine the Jewish homeland, and the methods we Jews must employ to lessen the duties of the military administration of Palestine. This will be the second point on the agenda of the Zionist convention in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The sea of misery and misfortune which has spread over the Jewish people has everywhere awakened the Jewish [feeling of] mercy, as well as [the Jewish talent for] organizational aid. Millions have already been expended, and many more millions will be spent. Up until now, our aid consisted, almost entirely, in sending as much food and clothing as we possibly could. This was done with the hope that as soon as the war ended, everything would become settled, and no further aid would be necessary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Recent conditions in Eastern Europe show that the great need, such as the lack of shelter for great masses of people, is more urgent than ever. Homes must be provided immediately, and there is no other home than Palestine. The forces that helped to alleviate the situation temporarily, must exert some of their energy in order to build a home in Palestine. In other words, it means that the relief work for the war sufferers must be co-ordinated with that of the Zionist organization so that Palestine will be able to admit a good percentage of Jews in the immediate future. This is another point for the convention to take up.</p>
   <p>The main point of the convention will be the personal appeal of Mother Zion to American Jews, an appeal against which there can be no opposition. Mother Zion stretches forth her arms, calls her children back to her, and the homeless, lonely children will return to their mother. The Gentile world approves, it remains only for us to help.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>This will be the subject of all subjects at the coming Zionist convention in the Auditorium Theater.</p>
