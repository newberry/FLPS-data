   <p>Last Wednesday the Congregation Anshe Sholom, one of the oldest congregations in Chicago, bought ground on Independence Boulevard and Polk Street to be used for a synagogue, a community center, and a Talmud Torah. Mr. Joseph Weil, president of the Congregation Anshe Sholom, thinks that the new synagogue will be one of the most beautiful in the city and that it will help greatly to develop the religious, national, and communal life of the neighborhood. The new synagogue, center, and Talmud Torah will cost about three hundred thousand dollars. The construction of the building is to commence soon.</p>
   <p>The officers of the [Congregation] Anshe Sholom are Joseph Weil, president; J. Goldberg and S. Marshall, vice-presidents; Meyer Gitlitz, treasurer; H. Nomberg, secretary; W. Farber and M. Goldstein, superintendents.</p>
   <p>The committee to buy the land was composed of Zelig Morris, Charles Cohen, H. Morris, Philip Lazar, and Henry Levy.</p>
   <p>The lots were bought by Mr. Louis B. Cohen, of the firm Cohen Brothers Furniture House.</p>
