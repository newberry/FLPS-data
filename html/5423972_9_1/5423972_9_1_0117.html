   <p>(Special to the Courier from a Staff Correspondent), Pittsburgh, June 23: The [Zionist] convention was formally opened at 3:30 P. M. by the president of the American Federation of Zionists, Dr. Harry Friedenwald. The hall was packed with delegates and visitors. Among others sitting on the platform were Justice Brandeis, Mayor Babcock of Pittsburgh, and Mr. Sevasli of Boston, chairman of the Armenian National Union of America. The platform was beautifully decorated with Jewish flags and flags of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>In his opening address, Dr. Friedenwald said that since England had issued its declaration in favor of a free Jewish state in Palestine, the American Zionists, as well as the Zionists of other lands, were given new duties and <span class="page-break">\2</span>fresh work to perform. This convention, he said, must lay the plans for this work.</p>
   <p>Mayor Babcock greeted the delegates in the name of the city. He praised the Jews very highly, and expressed his hope that Zionism would soon realize its ideal.</p>
   <p>The greatest enthusiasm was called forth by the Armenian leader whose people will soon become our neighbors [when we are established in Palestine].</p>
   <p>"I came to express to this convention, the good will and congratulations of the Armenians in America.</p>
   <p>"Palestine and Armenia are very similar cases," he said. "The peoples of both countries have been oppressed and both are entitled to national autonomy. Both nations, thanks to their unity, idealism, culture, civilization, and the strong <span class="page-break">\3</span>faith which each had in the future, continued to exist, despite the extinction of other [and stronger] nations."</p>
   <p>He declared that he was opposed to a separate peace with Turkey; and said that he was very happy that the movement for a separate peace with Turkey had come to naught, thanks to [the efforts of] the Zionists. He said that it would be a disgrace to civilized humanity if Turkish Rule were to remain in Constantinople; and he prayed that the Sultan, with all of his councilors and wives, would be exiled to their ancestral home in Asia.</p>
   <p>Sevasli looked proudly at the large Jewish flag hanging in the auditorium, praised it, and expressed his hope of seeing it flutter soon over Jerusalem, and the new Jewish State--Palestine. He expressed his hope that Palestine, together with America, would work side by side in the Near East, for the progress of the human race.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Judge Julian Mack proposed the following resolution: "Zionists of America, gathered at their annual convention, renew your pledge of allegiance to the government of the United States, and to the cause of Democracy and Justice, and the rights of small nations, for all of which our country is now carrying on a great war.</p>
   <p>"The Jews of the United States, in wholehearted co-operation with their fellow citizens, will continue to dedicate their lives and their wealth to the American cause without limit or stint.</p>
   <p>"We all hope for an Allied victory, under the leadership of Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States; through this victory we shall be able to establish a just and noble civilization."</p>
   <p>When Judge Mack mentioned Wilson's name, a storm of applause broke out in the hall, which lasted for several minutes. Everyone rose and waved small Zionist <span class="page-break">\5</span>flags.</p>
   <p>This scene was repeated when Dr. Stephen Wise finished seconding the resolution. Then they sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "Hatikvah" ["The Hope"--Jewish national anthem].</p>
   <p>Dr. Shmarva Levin took the floor next, and delivered a deeply moving speech in memory of Professor Tchlenov [possibly Chelnov].</p>
   <p>Greetings from Europe</p>
   <p>Proper greetings came from Europe. Nahum Sokolov wrote, in his telegram of congratulations, that in the name of the English Zionist Executive Committee, he had appealed to the English Foreign Minister Balfour with regard to obtaining full emancipation for the Jews in Roumania. The following is the reply he received:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"England In Favor of Complete Freedom for the Roumanian Jews</p>
   <p>"His Majesty's government realizes that the rights guaranteed to the Jews by Roumania under the recent [Bucharest] treaty, are less liberal than those to which the previous Roumanian government had openly obligated itself. The government avails itself of this opportunity to assure your organization that it is prepared to do all in its power to effect a just and permanent solution of the Jewish question in this country (Roumania)."</p>
   <p>Greece In Favor of Zionism</p>
   <p>H. Semos, Greek Minister of Defense, granted an audience to Dr. N. Levy and other Zionist leaders of Janina. He told them that M. Venizelos, the premier, and the ministers of the Greek cabinet will do all in their power to make possible the fulfillment of the Zionist program. Semos emphasized the fact <span class="page-break">\7</span>that the Greeks and Jews should consider each other brothers, because both nations have been fighting for thousands of years against ignorance and Paganism, and that both have written the most brilliant chapters in the history of the human race.</p>
   <p>From the Legionnaires</p>
   <p>Plymouth, England, June 18: The Jewish Legionnaires, who are now on their way to regain the Jewish fatherland, wish to see the next convention in a liberated Palestine. This statement was signed by the first and second divisions of the Jewish Legionnaires from America.</p>
   <p>Six Hundred and Thirty-seven Delegates Present</p>
   <p>The credentials committee reported that two hundred and thirty-three organizations sent six hundred and thirty-seven delegates to the convention: one hundred <span class="page-break">\8</span>and thirty-three branches of the Federation sent three hundred fifty-two delegates; thirty-two Hadassah chapters sent sixty delegates; forty-one camps of the Order B'nai Zion sent twenty-three delegates; twelve intercollegiate societies sent fourteen delegates; the Jewish Welfare Board sent one delegate; Young Judea--three; Order B'nai Sholom--one; Jewish Organization Conference of New York--four; and the Zion Commonwealth--two.</p>
   <p>The Great Parade</p>
   <p>Pittsburgh, Pa., June 23: The great parade was a wonderful prologue to the opening of the "Redemption" Convention. The weather was very nice. Over ten thousand people, men, women, and children, marched through the streets of the city, dressed in holiday clothes, carrying flags of all the nations, while bands played national songs. The children and the Hadassah members were dressed in blue and white--the Jewish national colors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Nearly all of the local organizations, with the exception of the extreme radicals and the Reformed Jews, participated in this parade. The Poale Zion and all the lodges were very well represented in this parade. The Louis D. Brandeis Gate of the Order B'nai Zion was led by its president, Judge Strahl; and the lodges of the Independent Order B'nai Sholom were led by their Grand Master, Dr. Robinson, who is the representative of this Order at the convention.</p>
   <p>The strongest impression was made by the Mothers and Children Division. Jewish mothers marched with great pride. These were the mothers who had sons in Uncle Sam's army and navy; and all of them wore stars, some one, some two, and some even three.</p>
   <p>Jewish professionals also marched in this parade, wearing their college caps and gowns. And in the Charity Division were found orthodox Jewish women who wore wigs and marched with a religious holiness [the very strictly orthodox Jewish women cut their hair off after they are married and wear a wig].</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>The parade was miles long and lasted for three hours. It was reviewed by Justice Brandeis, Mr. Sevasli, Mayor Babcock, and other prominent individuals.</p>
   <p>The Opening of The Convention</p>
   <p>The convention was opened shortly after the parade reached Memorial Hall, where the convention is being held. The hall had been packed from one o'clock in the afternoon, when the parade began.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The following is a repetition of material already translated.]</p>
   <p>Louis Lipsky was elected chairman of the convention. He won the election by a close margin because he is one of the strongest advocates of the "district plan", <span class="page-break">\11</span>which will be taken up tomorrow morning, and concerning which a very bitter fight is anticipated.</p>
   <p>At a secret session the provisional committee had worked out plans for the reorganization of the whole [Zionist] movement, and had decided to carry through a plan whereby all central Zionist organizations should be dissolved, and in their place, district committees should be organized. When these committees have been formed, then the old organizations may reorganize, but not with their old status. To a certain degree, however, they will have the power of self-government.</p>
   <p>At the same session it was also decided to make certain specific recommendations to the Palestine Commission.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>Appeal of Bessarabian Jews</p>
   <p>A committee representing Bessarabian-Jewish organization was received. The committee came to request the Zionist organization to aid the one hundred thousand Jews in Bessarabia, who in accordance with the Treaty of Bucharest, had come under Roumanian rule and had lost all the civil and political rights that they had enjoyed under the Russian Revolutionary Government.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stephen Wise, chairman of the provisional committee answered the request, saying that his committee, which represents all the Jews in America....is prepared to do everything possible to liberate the Jews in Bessarabia. A special subcommittee will be appointed to take up the question of the Bessarabian Jews. Tomorrow morning, Mr. Jacob DeHaas, secretary of the provisional committee, will meet with the Bessarabian delegation to work out a memorandum which will be presented to the government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>Service Stars from Chicago</p>
   <p>At the first session of the convention, the Chicago delegation presented the assembly with a Service Flag containing two hundred and thirty stars--in honor of the two hundred and thirty Chicago Jewish Legionnaires.</p>
   <p>Official Buildings in Pittsburgh Handsomely Decorated</p>
   <p>In honor of this convention, all official city and county buildings were handsomely decorated with American and Zionist flags. The authorities appropriated twelve hundred dollars for this purpose. The homes in the Jewish quarter,as well as the stores on Fifth Avenue, were decorated even more, with both kinds of flags. The hotels where the delegates to the convention are stopping, were similarly decorated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>Memorial Hall, where the convention is being held, is a large building, with smaller and large halls, as well as rooms where the various committees and Zionist groups hold their meetings and caucuses. Justice Brandeis has a special room there with a guard in front of the door. The delegates and guests are greatly impressed with the beauty and convenience of Memorial Hall. In front of the hall are two cannons. And Dr. Stephen Wise jokingly remarked that one cannon is for the Poale Zion and the other, for the Mizrachi.</p>
   <p>[Editor's note: Poale Zion--radical labor wing of Zionist party; Mizrachi--orthodox conservative.]</p>
