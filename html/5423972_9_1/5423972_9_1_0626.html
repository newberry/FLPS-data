   <p>Our whole civilization is built upon the principle that whatever the public decides, must be done. All cultures have formulated this principle in the same way. The old Hebrew culture had an ethical and a poetic formula for this principle. The ethical formula read: "Follow the voice of the majority." The poetic formula was: "The voice of the people is the voice of God." The old Romans had their own formula for this principle: "Vox populi vox dei." The French say: "La majorite est l'autorite." Whatever a group of people may or may not do, one thing it must do, and that is respect and abide by its own decisions. A group undermines the foundations of its own life if it shies away from its own decisions.</p>
   <p>I am neither a rabbi nor an interpreter of the law among Jews, but when I hear that a majority of the rabbis and synagogue presidents have decided <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>upon something, I feel that it is my duty, as well as the duty of every other member of the community, to respect that decision as if it were a law, neither more nor less. Sometimes one or another individual will disagree with the decision of the community, but he has to abide by that decision just the same, otherwise chaos instead of order will prevail.</p>
   <p>The rabbis and the synagogue presidents of Chicago have unanimously resolved that dead bodies should no longer be brought into the synagogues. We must abide by that decision, otherwise what will happen to our whole community life? If an individual does not respect the will and decision of the community, we might as well remove ourselves from civilized society.</p>
   <p>We have a right to expect the representatives of the community, particularly the rabbis and the leaders, to respect the decision of the community, the more so since the decision does not lay down any new law but merely <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>affirms an old Jewish law.</p>
