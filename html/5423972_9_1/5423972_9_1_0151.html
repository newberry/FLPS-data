   <p>(Special to Courier New York, June 19: After a very heated debate, the convention of the Red Moggen David [Shield of David: six-pointed Jewish star] decided that it would not merge with Hadassah or any other Zionist organization, but would remain instead a neutral body.</p>
   <p>Mr. Louis Lipsky, of the American Federation of Zionists, pointed out that the English government recognized Zionism as the only body [authorized] to carry on work in Palestine. Therefore the Red Moggen David will not be able to do anything in the Holy Land unless it joins the Zionist movement. The convention, however, did not accept his opinion.</p>
   <p>The convention then resolved to co-operate with all organizations that work for the rehabilitation of Palestine; and to establish a correspondence bureau in order to maintain close contact with Jewish Legionnaires.</p>

   <p>It was also decided that the minimum dues should be one dollar a year; and that the executive committee should be made up of twenty-five members and the administrative committee of eleven.</p>
