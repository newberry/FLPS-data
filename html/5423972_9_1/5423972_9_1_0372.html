   <p>At the meeting of the Board, a suggestion was made that a Rabbi be elected to the Board. The committee gave thought and consideration to this suggestion and realizing the difficulties of pleasing the community as a whole and the danger of causing ill feeling by the selection of any particular Rabbi, asked the Chicago Rabbinical Association to name three Rabbis. They did this, and the committee considered these names and selected from them, Rabbi Gerson B. Levi.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the committee spoke to Dr. Levi, to make clear to him the situation - that if he were elected he would become a member of the Board, not as a representative of the Rabbinical Association, but of himself and the community, that if he failed to be an active Board member, the Board would feel free to replace him without consulting the Association and without necessarily replacing him with a Rabbi.</p>
