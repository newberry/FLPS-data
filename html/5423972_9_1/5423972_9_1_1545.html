   <p>The speech held by President Adolph Copeland at the annual banquet of the Hias in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Friends and Co-workers: Instead of that detailed report that I give at our yearly assemblies, I will limit myself a short suitable treatment of our activities in the past year 1928. My report will be short, not because our work has decreased, but on the contrary, our activities have increased to such an extent that it would take me much more time than this evening affords me to stop and explain all the work of the Hias, and yet, I would like to give you a more fundamental detailed idea of the all world activities of the Hias and place before you such Hias accomplishments as would touch the heart breaking realities of Jewish life with which the Hias comes into daily contact.</p>
   
   <p>I only wish you were with me when I made my last tour in Europe last year, then you would, as I have, seen with your own eyes, the need and the indescribable tragedy of our brothers, who being driven by merciless economic and political powers are helplessly seeking a place merely to rest their heads.</p>
   <p>There is not a man whose heart would not break, seeing our helpless and often hopeless wanderers stranded on the roads of the unfriendly and intolerant Europe.</p>
   <p>A bitter result would await our wanderers, were it not for the friendly Hias were they come to ask for help. They know that the Hias has helped thousands of wanderers to get to a secure home. And if the Hias can not help them at present - then who can help them?</p>
   
   <p>I would also like to acquaint you with the great work of the Hias. That, can be seen in the countries where the immigrants are brought by the Hias. Take Canada, for instance, where I spoke with men and women who felt very fortunate that the Hias had taken them from the European hell and brought them to a land of peace and safety, after years of misery across the sea.</p>
   <p>Such experiences remain with us constantly, they make us feel that we should thank the Lord that there is such an organization as the Hias in this world to take up these gigantic problems of the wanderers and the Hias attempts to solve them sincerely.</p>
   
   <p>The immigration laws that have almost locked the gates of America for the immigrants instead of decreasing, have doubly increased the Hias duties and activities.</p>
   <p>The Hias is now an international institution. You will now find Hias offices in the far corners of Japan, Argentine, Brazil, Africa, Australia, and throughout Europe, in fact in every country where our wanderers exist.</p>
   <p>We now help out our wanderers before they leave their old home until we have them settled in their new home, and in every way, manner, or form we help the immigrants, lead him in his way, teach him a trade, teach him the language, prepare him for his new home, assist him in finding suitable work, make it possible for him to get a small credit, we find and correspond with his relatives and friends, we don't leave our wanderer even after he has settled and become a full pledged citizen, where ever he may go, wherever he may be, he will find the Hias greeting him, ready to serve him offering to render him and aid or assistance he may need, without limit and with no expense to him.</p>
   <p>What other organization, outside the Hias and its affiliated organizations in the whole world do so much for our wanderers and with such a willingness and whole heartedness.</p>
   <p>Besides our immigrant relief work, we provide for various homeless with a home for a limited time. We also give travelers, and homeless a place to sleep and food for a short time until they can afford it themselves or until we can find work for them.</p>
   
   <p>My friends, I beg of you that are here to night, just imagine yourself on the other side, and please serve them as you would expect to be served, if you were in their place, let us create a better life, of light and hope for those unfortunates. Thank you.</p>
