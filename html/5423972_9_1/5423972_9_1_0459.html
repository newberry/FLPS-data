   <p>Rabbi Ezriel Epstein, rabbi of congregation Beth Hamedrosh Hagodol Ubnai Jacob Anshe Luknik, is a Zionist. The president of the synagogue, Mr. Balaban, is a Zionist. The leading members of the Congregation are also Zionists. My friends, the Luknik countrymen are of course Zionists. May I ask, then, why Congregation Beth Hamedrosh Hagodol Ubnai Jacob Anshe Luknik has not organized a Zionist district? If the leaders of this synagogue want to know what a Zionist district can do for a synagogue, how it can wake up a synagogue, how it can draw the youth to the synagogue, how it can make the synagogue a center of Jewish activity, let them take a look at the Knesses Israel Nusach Sford Synagogue. There is life and activity at that synagogue. The Synagogue is always open. One can always find people, committees, and meetings there. It looks as though that synagogue is not only a house of worship, but also a community house, a house of study--which is what every Orthodox synagogue should be.</p>
