   <p>The delegation that appeared yesterday before the Congressional Immigration Committee made quite an impression with its protest against the newly-planned immigration cruelties. This protest was full of brilliant claims and facts of American history and American life; the spearhead was that it is wrong to make any new cruelties against immigration. Speaking in general on the question of immigration, the Jewish representatives sharply and courageously pronounced the Jewish side of the aggravated question, and pointed out that no new limitations should be made.</p>
   <p>The principal speakers for the united Jewish delegation were Louis Marshall and Rabbi Stephen Wise. They have distinguished themselves and surpassed all others with their arguments. Both these speakers appeared at former <span class="page-break">\2</span>immigration hearings, but this time they made an excellent job of it.</p>
   <p>Louis Marshall was the first speaker at the forenoon hearing. He began by first declaring that his utterances against the planned immigration cruelties do not aim at this or the other immigrant foe, but do aim at a certain reactionary principle that is practised by the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
   <p>Marshall, in his talk, proved that many of the clauses in the new bill resulted precisely from the reactionary endeavors of the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan, Marshall declared, wants white, Protestant, and Anglo-Saxon immigrants only. The new limitation bill leads to the same goal; also, the resolution that the quotas shall be based on the American census of 1890 are in line with the principles submitted by the Klan.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Marshall further proved that the new bill will reduce the present immigration total by fully 250,000, and nine-tenths of those restricted and not admitted will be those from the Eastern and Southern countries of Europe.</p>
   <p>They are trying to establish a brand new law, Marshall cried out; just because one was born in a different country, he is not as good as the other.</p>
   <p>Marshall especially attacked the clause of the new bill which calls for the establishment of a two per cent quota, and the one requiring the quota to be based on the census of 1890.</p>
   <p>Marshall strongly protested against the other planned cruelties. He shouted, "You are trying to establish a law that will require every male immigrant to present a certificate of his military record. Here in America, I, as many others, were under the impression that the military spirit is dead!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>He further pointed out that the clause requiring that each immigrant shall procure a certificate before boarding the steamship taking him from his native country would perhaps be an improvement, "but," he thundered, "if so, then why do you demand in addition that an immigrant shall furnish a passport from his own government, along with a visa from an American Consul?" Then comes the clause, the most insulting clause, requiring that every immigrant must have his fingerprints on his certificate.</p>
   <p>This clause demanding the fingerprints Marshall condemned with most powerful words, pointing out what an insult this will be to every immigrant.</p>
   <p>In his powerful speech Marshall proved that four immigrants have accomplished more in the electrical field for the United States, than all others. These four are: Nikola Tesla, the late electrical wizard; Carl Steinmetz; Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy; and Professor Michael Pupin. These four, Marshall concluded, would <span class="page-break">\5</span>positively have been refused admission into the United States, had this new bill been in effect at the time.</p>
   <p>The members of the committee put many questions before Marshall which he answered simply and clearly. To the question about the selective part of the planned immigration bill, Mr. Marshall answered; "The immigration law that went into effect in 1917 is selective enough in this respect; according to this law, those who are physically, morally, or spiritually unfit, are not permitted to enter this country, then why a new 'selective' law, when we already have such a law?"</p>
   <p>He also protested against the examination of immigrants in Europe, on the grounds that this will create a line of American czars in European countries, who will not be influenced by American public opinion. That will be a grave danger, entrusting them to judge which immigrants are fit to enter America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Rabbi Stephen Wise, the second spokesman for the Jewish delegation, distinguished himself with his impressive appeal. Everyone present at this hearing realized the strong impression his speech made on the members of the immigration committee. He stood for the American traditions and ideals. He pointed out that it would be the greatest insult to American history to show partiality to some countries, permitting their emigrants to enter America, while discriminating against other countries, barring their emigrants from entering America.</p>
   <p>"Those who are for the planned law to further limit immigration," cried Rabbi Wise, "are still under the influence of the hysteria that prevailed during the time of war, and with violence, want to force on the other people the idea that one race stands higher than another."</p>
   <p>Touching on the Jewish side of the question, Rabbi Wise spoke of Jewish life in America, and praised the Jewish press.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>His speech was so impressive that the chairman of the immigration committee and creator of the new bill, Congressman Johnson, arose and said to the Jewish delegation that he and his colleagues have no race discrimination in mind.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Wise is positive that the new bill will bring race discrimination.</p>
   <p>The hearing lasted a full day; other protests against the planned cruelties arose during the day. M. Kalaf, a Slavic representative; Joseph Cantrovitz, of the B'nai-B'rith; Jacob Fishman, and others, also appeared at the hearing.</p>
   <p>It is reported in Washington that Secretary of Labor Davis is willing to give up the clause establishing registration for immigrants. This means that one of the greatest evils of the new bill is about to be sidetracked.</p>
   <p>It is also said that many senators are against the new bill, and it is expected that when the bill is brought before the Senate it will be killed.</p>
