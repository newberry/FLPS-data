   <p>We congratulate the Chicago Federation of Synagogues on its decision to conduct noon-day services in the Loop between Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur. The Woods Theater, which Mr. Aaron Jones has turned over to the Federation to hold their communion in, during noon time on September 13 to 17 inclusive, should be packed to overflowing on those sacred days and during those devotional hours.</p>
   <p>Some people may object to the idea of holding Jewish religious services in so secular, and in the original sense profane, place as a theater, but when they do they display a gross ignorance of the fundamental attitude of Judaism, for according to the original tenets of Judaism, any place may be rendered sacred, if they who inhabit it open their hearts and unburden their souls in direct communion with the Highest of the high.</p>
   <p>Dr. G. George Fox has been selected by the Rabbinical Association to arrange the services and provide the rabbis.</p>
