   <p>At yesterday's meeting the County Board of Commissioner's decided to give the necessary space in Oak Forest to establish a synagogue and center for the Jewish incurables.</p>
   <p>President Peter Reinberg, Commissioner Bartly Berk, and Commissioner Frank Ryan were the strongest advocates favoring the grant of space in Oak Forest to build a spiritual home for the Jewish patients. Had it not been for their great efforts and support, the plan would have failed.</p>
   <p>And now, as to these uncurable Jewish patients, the committee will set to work to obtain funds for this synagogue and center.</p>
