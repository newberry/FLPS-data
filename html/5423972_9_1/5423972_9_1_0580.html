   <p>In the life of every normal nation only the dynamic forces are active--the whole life of the nation, in all its phases, aspects, and ramifications, is one uninterrupted process of motion--but among us Jews it is different. In our life the static forces are also active--they hinder and forcefully restrain every normal process of development--and these static forces emanate from two different and diametrically opposed directions, from two extreme poles--from the extreme Orthodoxy and the extreme Reform--from extreme idealism and extreme materialism. The one [idealism] stimulates the normal development of our life by means of a fixed theology--the other [materialism] by turning that which lacks principle and character into principle--and by following blindly the slogan of Jeroboam [ancient King of the Hebrews who worshiped an idol]: "My God is the God of Israel."</p>

   <p>Jews who are unfamiliar with the ever-changing yet glorious past of their people believe that the present structure of our life is a product of our modern culture. They believe that after the walls of the ghetto were destroyed, as a result of the French Revolution, the Reform and the assimilation movements developed. When we examine the Bible (Pentateuch, Prophets, and Hagiographa) carefully, we soon recognize that what goes on among the Jews today [is similar to what] took place twenty-six hundred years ago--on the one side, Yehudah, the nationalistically inclined group--and on the other side, Ephraim, the Reformers and assimilators; on the one side, the semiactive priesthood and their extreme theology, on the other side, Baal--the unscrupulous principle. Throughout the centuries of Jewish history, these two basic tendencies, these two forces can be seen; the dynamic and aggressive force, and the static--the fixed and motionless force. The static force paralyzes the movement of the dynamic force. The whole history of our people is one continuous conflict between these two forces--static and dynamic--and the result of this conflict is that we remain rooted to one spot and do not move.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The Jewish mind has fabricated countless reasons in answer to the question: Why has the Diaspora lasted so long? The only rational and real reason is that owing to the permanent conflict between the static and the dynamic forces, we could not move. In both ancient and modern times, the static force, as represented by either an extreme theology, a metaphysic that impeded action, or the unscrupulous principle, that is, either the priesthood or the false prophet influenced the course of Jewish history. The prophets of righteousness and justice carried on a fruitful struggle against both forces because they were men of progress; they represented the dynamic force. The righteous prophet fought against the inactive priesthood as courageously and self-sacrificingly as he fought against the prophets of Baal, against the representatives of Reform and assimilation. What were then the inactive priests are today the inactive theologians--Sonnefield and Diskin in Jerusalem. Brayer and Frankfurt, in Warsaw, are the only faithful ones among Israel. And what was then Baal is now Reform Judaism--the Golden Calf.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Now, as then, their lack of character, their [moral] cowardice, as well as the lust of Baal are expressed in their hedonism. Here in America everything runs smoothly; we enjoy [civil] rights and we are prosperous. This is our Zion, and Jerusalem and every recollection of true Zion fill the hearts of the Reform Jews with fear. What will the Gentiles say? Perhaps they will say that we are not good Americans, or good Englishmen, or good Germans, etc. Whether or not we are loyal to our people, the Gentiles will always look upon us as Jews.</p>
   <p>Israel had money; Yehudah, idealism. Today it is exactly the same. The Israelites have money; the Jews retain their idealistic tendencies to the extent that they are not obscured by a fixed theology. But what good are idealistic tendencies if we are unable to put them into practice? Today, just as twenty-eight hundred years ago, gold and silver are in the hands of the assimilated Israelites [the Reform Jews], rather than in the hands of the Orthodox. We do not progress because our spiritual and material forces are not united; they are separate, each in a different camp, which <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>has no relationship with the other. What good are all our nationalistic efforts, what good are all the great opportunities which we now have if the static force in the life of our people--the assimilationist philosophy on the one hand, and a fixed theology on the other--stands like a huge dam across the current, obstructing any movement?</p>
   <p>Palestine could today be populated by three hundred thousand Jews, and the future of those Jews could have long been secured, if it had not been for this static force, if it had not been for the effective restraint exercised by the static force.</p>
   <p>While Jewish life on the one side is full of motion, full of aspirations, while tens of thousands of Halutzim stand and knock on the gates of Palestine, while millions of Jews all over the world have one goal--Palestine, a Palestine populated by Jews--there is no movement at all on the other side. The priesthood of Baal, like the representatives of the fixed <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>theology, is blocking and paralyzing the whole process of development. The priesthood of Baal controls either the money bags or the large masses of people and withholds both factors from the Jewish historical process--and with spirit and idealism alone on the part of a portion of our people, we cannot accomplish a great deal. It is true that we are making some efforts, but we are not accomplishing anything. We are merely swaying [from side to side] and, therefore, we think we are progressing. After four years of hard work, we brought thirty thousand Jews into Palestine, but we should have brought at least one hundred thousand. Haven't the Jews enough money to finance the rebuilding of Palestine? No one has ever claimed this to be true. Then why is the process so slow? A dead hand holds back the process. A corpse lies in the way and is obstructing progress. This corpse is the static force which I have already spoken of: Baal and the priesthood--Reform Judaism, which means assimilation; Agudoth Israel, or the "only faithful ones in Israel"; and the disrupters, the "comrades". These three factors make up the static force in modern Jewish life just as they did in ancient Jewish life.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>And today, on the eve of liberation, we again face the age-old question: How can we destroy this static force? How can we remove the corpse that impedes our progress? This question is more vital today than it has ever been.</p>
   <p>The whole future of the Jewish people depends upon the victory of one of these two forces. Should the static force triumph, we may perhaps prolong our existence for a few more generations--but in the long run we will be crushed by the millstone of world history. Suspended between liberation and the Diaspora, we are impeding the workings of both these forces. We are standing in the way; we are preventing them from accomplishing certain things and forcing them to do certain other things. This, naturally, antagonizes them, and, from time to time, they make us feel their burning wrath.</p>
   <p>At the present moment, these two forces are diametrically opposed--now it is either to be or not to be. If Jewish nationalism fails, the Jewish nation will perish.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>From this point of view, the present, inner politics of the Jews can be understood. Put into a concrete formula, the struggle becomes one between charity and Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. All the static forces in our life are now taken up with the curse of charity in order to conceal and cover up their [the Reform Jews] moral and internal corruption. Charity is their new idol. Since philanthropic activities have developed to a considerable degree among the Jews in the course of the past generation, they [Reform Jews] are devising new and artificial charity objectives in order to separate charity from our nationalist tendencies. This is the meaning of the two- and one-half-million-dollar Community Building Drive in Chicago, which the Yehudim [Reform Jews] are now planning. Their intention is very clear, viz., to paralyze the dynamic forces in the life of our people and to destroy them entirely.</p>
   <p>I, together with all other Jewish journalists, warn the Jewish public: Do not allow yourselves to be misled by the ideal of charity; it was put up <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>only to paralyze and destroy our dynamic forces. A two-million-dollar drive for Palestine would make possible the emigration of fifteen thousand Halutzim there--and a two-million-dollar drive for a nurses' home for the Michael Reese Hospital and for a Hebrew Institute for the West Side in Chicago would be wasting two million dollars.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every nationalistically inclined Jew to be on guard--because a decisive struggle is now being waged between the two antagonistic forces in our life. For us Jews, ultimate victory will mean liberation; defeat will mean destruction. England will not wait one hundred years for us to rebuild Palestine; she will wait another five or ten years, and then--nothing. Instead of liberation--the grave--and Ephraim's old dream of bringing destruction upon Yehudah will have been realized.</p>
