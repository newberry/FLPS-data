   <p>From an article entitled "Liberating Judaism" and published in "Unity.</p>
   <p>"Last Sunday was a memorable day in the history of Sinai Congregation. With music, ritual and oratory, they celebrated the 25th anniversary of the institution of Sunday services. The great auditorium was filled with two large audiences, one for the forenoon exercises, the other for the evening session. Dr. Kohler of N. Y., Dr. Sale, St. Louis, Dr. Landsberg, Rochester, Dr. Levy, Phila., and Dr. Mayer of Pittsburgh were among those present who made addresses.</p>
   <p>'Unity' extends its congratulations to the local congregation and expresses its admiration of the ability and consecration which this celebration represents. But there is more than a local triumph here. The event is of profound significance, not only to the Jew, but to the student of religion in all phases. It is probably one of the most important steps taken by a religious organization within the last quarter of a century toward spiritualizing religion. There is a lesson in this celebration to the gentile world and the Christian religion."</p>
