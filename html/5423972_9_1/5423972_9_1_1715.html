   <p>The chairman then introduced Friend Nathanson who addressed the conference. Friend Nathanson pointed out the importance of adopting the true revolutionary character in progressive nationalism.</p>
   <p>He showed the reactionary character of the conservative element of Zionism and he strongly emphasized the necessity of remembering, that the conference is a labor conference and must stand on revolutionary grounds, that it must demand national cultural rule, wherever Jews are located, and the right to a territory for Jews. Only Palestine is the place where the Jews should have their Jewish state.</p>
