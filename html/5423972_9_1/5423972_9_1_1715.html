  <p>Approximately four hundred delegates assembled yesterday in the West Side Auditorium to deal with the question of Jewish workers having a Congress with the object of supporting a home for the Jews in Palestine.</p>
  <p>M. Schuchter, Federative Committee of the Chicago Poale Zion, opened the conference by declaring that this conference was not a Poale Zion one, and not a partial one, but one entirely in the hands of the labor organizations that have sent delegates to the conference. They must determine the objectives of this movement.</p>
  <p>He opened the nominations for chairman and Mr. Tabbac of Local #144, Amalgamated, was unanimously elected. A. Herman, delegate of the United Hebrew Trades, was made vice-chairman.</p>

   <p>The delegates Schuchter, Shaffer, Kominsky, Berenstat, and Feinblatt were appointed on the Credentials Committee. Delegates Botkin, Katz and Kysnis were appointed as secretaries.</p>
   <p>The chairman then introduced Friend Nathanson who addressed the conference. Friend Nathanson pointed out the importance of adopting the true revolutionary character in progressive nationalism.</p>
   <p>He showed the reactionary character of the conservative element of Zionism and he strongly emphasized the necessity of remembering, that the conference is a labor conference and must stand on revolutionary grounds, that it must demand national cultural rule, wherever Jews are located, and the right to a territory for Jews. Only Palestine is the place where the Jews should have their Jewish state.</p>
