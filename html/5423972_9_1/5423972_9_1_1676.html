   <p>One of the dramatic features of the big Zionist parade that was held last Tuesday afternoon in the Lawndale district in honor of the visiting Zionist Commission, took place in front of the Herzl School, named after the founder of modern Zionism. There, amid inspiring surroundings, Dr. Weizmen and Mr. Ussischkin, led by a group of girl pupils of the Herzl School, placed a wreath before a statue of Herzl placed in front of the school.</p>
   <p>To all who looked on, and felt it a high honor to be priviliged to do, the incident carried with it one regret, the regret that the size of the bust of Herzl was so out of proportion withthe great event.</p>

   <p>Why isn't there in the City of Chicago, in Douglas Park, which traverses the very heart and center of Chicago Jewry, a statute of Herzl worthy of the great leader, the greatest Jew of modern times. Practically every race in Chicago's cosmopolitian population is represented in our parks, except a statue of Herzl.</p>
