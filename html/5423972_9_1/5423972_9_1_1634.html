   <p>Mr. Morgenthau was the former American ambassador to Constantinople, and as such, he did a great deal for the Armenians and Greeks, and for the Christian missionaries. The Christians in Old Turkey have good reason to be grateful to Mr. Morgenthau. The Jews in Turkey have no reason at all to be grateful to him because he did very little for them, notwithstanding the fact that he was sent as an American ambassador to Constantinople because he is a Jew and because the American government believed that it had done the Jewish people a favor when it sent a Jew like Mr. Morgenthau as ambassador to the Turkish Sultan.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Morgenthau returned from Constantinople, he began to criticize <span class="page-break">2</span>Zionism. Later, when the American government sent him to Poland to find out the truth about the pogroms, he did everything to conceal the truth and to whitewash the Poles so that he might stand in well with them. Instead of bringing comfort and hope to the Polish Jews, he poured salt upon their wounds and spoke to them in the language of the Polish anti-Semites. At the time he was in Poland to find out the truth about the pogroms, pogroms took place, but he was blind to them. Instead of protesting against the Polish brutalities, as was his duty as a man, a Jew, and an American, he had the audacity to approach the Jews of Minsk, which is not a Polish city, and to offer them advice about Polish patriotism. Minsk is not a part of Poland; Minsk now belongs to Russia. The Poles themselves have recognized the Russian sovereignity over Minsk, and if the Jews of Minsk had, at that time, accepted his advice, and declared themselves Polish patriots, how would they have appeared to the outside world?</p>
   <p>After Mr. Morgenthau returned from his famous Polish mission, he found the <span class="page-break">3</span>American Jews so aroused that he did not dare to publish his anti-Semitic report. The American government also thought it was unwise to publish the report because it felt that something about it was not entirely kosher. The reports of the English Investigating Commission were already known and differed basically from the report that Mr. Morgenthau had dared to present to the American government. The report [Mr. Morgenthau's] was published later, and simultaneously evoked rejoicing in Poland and sorrow among the Jews throughout the world because every Jew realized that a Jew was serving the interests of Polish pogromists. Sharp protests against the report were heard even in liberal American circles because the deplorable facts about the bloody pogroms in Poland were known to the whole world.</p>
   <p>The next thing that Mr. Morgenthau did was to associate himself with every enemy of the Jews and to participate in every political intrigue against Zionism. The Zionist organizations, however, were alert and did not become alarmed. The American Zionist Organization found out that Mr. Morgenthau <span class="page-break">4</span>was connected with a certain group of oil magnates and missionaries, who are opposed to Zionism, because it [Zionism] hinders their plans of plundering the Orient for their commercial and political purposes. When Mr. Morgenthau learned that the American Zionist Organization was aware of the facts, he kept quiet and was not heard of for some time.</p>
   <p>Now Mr. Morgenthau is again "busy" with the Jewish question. He is the publisher of the magazine, The World's Work, which was founded by the late Mr. Walter Page, a noted statesman and philanthropist. This magazine is now either totally or partly controlled by Mr. Morgenthau, and the editors of the magazine are very friendly with Mr. Morgenthau. This influential magazine publishes vile propaganda against the Jews, particularly against the Russian and Polish Jews. The writer of these anti-Semitic articles is the same Mr. Hendrick who wrote or "edited" Mr. Morgenthau's book on the World War. From the fact that he [Mr. Hendrick] is so friendly with Mr. Morgenthau, we can take it for granted that if Mr. Morgenthau did not want <span class="page-break">5</span>these anti-Semitic articles to be written and published, they would not be.</p>
   <p>What does Mr. Morgenthau have in mind with this anti-Semitic campaign? A movement to stop immigration completely is now on foot in America. There is a bill in Congress at the present time, which proposes to limit immigration so that, each year, only from ten to fifty thousand Jews would be permitted to enter the United States. As we understand the situation, Mr. Morgenthau wishes to aid the foes of Jewish immigration, and the best way of doing so, is by smearing the Eastern European Jews with calumnies.</p>
   <p>It is high time that the Jewish organizations in America unmasked Mr. Morgenthau and declared him to be what he is--an enemy of Israel. Then, he will no longer be able to appear as a Jewish representative and his anti-Semitic activities will be of value only to the anti-Semites.</p>
