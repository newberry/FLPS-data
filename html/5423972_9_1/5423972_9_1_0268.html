   <p>Every seat in the hall was occupied by 7:30 o'clock, and by 8 o'clock the chairman of the arrangements committee had to order the doors closed for the evening. Promptly at 8 o'clock the introductions began. Mr. A. Goldberg and Dr. Sirkin were two of the first speakers. They spoke mostly on socialism and unionization, assuring the public that in union there is strength. Never before, in the history of any Jewish organization has such stormy applause been received.</p>
   <p>Congressman A. J. Sabath was the next speaker. As a Jewish congressman he spoke on the future of the Jewish nation.</p>
