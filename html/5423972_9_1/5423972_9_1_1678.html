   <p>Sir: Permit me in the columns of your valuable paper to say a few words on a subject which I believe is of burning importance to the Jewish people, not only of our community, but throughout the entire America.</p>
   <p>In this great war, which has just happily ended, no race has suffered as the Jews have suffered. Persecuted as they have been in foreign lands, robbed of their birthright, pillaged and plundered, the end of the war has brought no relief to them. Starvation, massacre, and pogroms are daily taking the lives of thousands and tens of thousands who have survived the war, and these millions of our brethren today wistfully look to us and stretch forth their hands to us in America in the greatest and saddest appeal in the history of the world.</p>
   <p>America is the land of hope--America is the land of promise. This is the hope <span class="page-break">2</span>which today sustains them in the terrible trials and sufferings which are theirs. They remind themselves that those relatives who have succeeded in breaking away from the old world and reaching America, are in a land of promise and in a land of opportunity, and they dream daily that the day will come when they themselves will pass by the Statue of Liberty and tread the soil of the greatest land of freedom that the world has ever known.</p>
   <p>But it seems that a great cloud now appears on the horizon of their hopes. A small group of selfish and narrow-minded men who for years have been trying to close the gates of America, are now making special efforts to close the gates of opportunity to the stricken people in foreign lands. They forget that America has been the great melting pot of the world and that the men and women who came here from foreign lands have given America the best that was in them and have reared a structure which bids the admiration of mankind.</p>
   <p>This great movement is more serious than we can possibly imagine. The men who <span class="page-break">3</span>would deny to others the opportunities which America gave to them, are pointing out particularly the restlessness throughout the world. They point to the form of government in Russia and insist that unless the gates of immigration are closed, America will, in a short time, imitate the policies of the government now in control in Russia.</p>
   <p>These arguments and other arguments are being used and poison propaganda is now under way and unless the Jews of America are aroused, they will wake up in the very near future and find that this land of America has become a land of restricted opportunity to those who are here, and the hopes and the dreams of our suffering brethren who look to us as the only hope, will be crushed.</p>
   <p>This is a matter of vital importance to every Jew. In almost every household, arrangements are on foot to bring here to America a father or a mother, an uncle, a niece, a nephew, or a child. These people here have done everything in their power to assist their brethren across the seas. They have sent money--they have sent provisions, but ofttimes these have never reached the persons <span class="page-break">4</span>for whom they were intended. There is but one practical solution and that solution is to bring the relative here to America, and this is being done in tens of thousands of instances, as evidenced by the fact that the accommodations at Ellis Island have become inadequate to take care of the ever-swelling tide.</p>
   <p>I desire to point out to the readers of this paper that one man in Congress has stood like the rock of Gibraltar against the efforts of the narrow-minded statesmen who would have America depart from the policy that it has always adhered to. This man has been in Congress for twelve years. He is now a member of the Immigration Committee. Year in and year out, he has raised his voice in favor of keeping our gates open to the unfortunate people of the world, and despite the desperate efforts that have been made in the past to close the gates of America, the liberal policy of America has been maintained and our people, as well as the unfortunate people of other races, continue to come and help to make our land a greater and grander place to live in. That man is Congressman A. J. Sabath.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>It is important that the Jews awake to a full realization of the danger at the present moment. It is necessary that they do everything in their power to uphold the arms of those who have given splendid service in the past in keeping our land of liberty and opportunity open to all.</p>
   <p>The people of the Fifth Congressional District of Chicago, in particular, now have a splendid opportunity of proving of great service not only to themselves but to all the Jews of America.</p>
   <p>Congressman Adolph J. Sabath has proved himself a great power in the past and a friend of suffering humanity. By reason of his length of service in Congress and his vast experience, he is better enabled to meet the attacks in Congress within the next few months, which will be directed toward closing the gates of hope to our brethren across the seas, and it is our duty that we show our thanks and appreciation for these splendid services in the past by making it possible for Congressman Sabath to continue this same service in the future.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>This is a duty that we owe ourselves. This is a duty that we owe our brethren in Europe who rely upon us. It is not a question of politics. The call of humanity has reached our ears and we forget our political differences and we act as men determined to do everything in our power to keep aflame the great light of liberty which enlightens the entire world.</p>
