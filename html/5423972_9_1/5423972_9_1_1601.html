   <p>Since America has closed its door to immigration, we cannot bring our relatives here to us. But, if the plan now afoot here succeeds, we can, in a sense, bring America to them.</p>
   <p>A group of Chicago Zionists are promoting this plan, which is to found a colony in Palestine, to be named Chicago. It will be built by money of Chicago Jews, in conjunction with the funds of Chalutzim to whom that money will be lent on long term loans, through a revolving fund. The colony will take its color, as its name from American views and methods, and will be modern and democratic in consonance with the best traditions of America and of Palestine.</p>

   <p>If this venture comes to fruition, it will be an energetic example to other American cities, and doubtless will form the beginning of a colonization movement that will find colonies dotting the Holy Land named after American cities.</p>
   <p>The many advantages that will accrue from this are manifest. It only remains to be seen whether it will work out successfully, whether it will pan out as well in reality as on paper, and this only time can tell.</p>
