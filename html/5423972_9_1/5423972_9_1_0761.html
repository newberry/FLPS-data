   <p>The Friday evening lectures [at Congregation Rodfei Zedek] are becoming very popular on the South Side. An exceptionally large attendance listened to Dr. [A. B.] Yudelson's lecture last Friday, and a very large audience is expected for this Friday, October 29, when the rabbi [of the Congregation] will speak on "Intermarriage". The Ladies' Study Circle meets on Saturday afternoons at 2:30 P. M. at Sinai Center. The Hebrew school has a very large enrollment this year, and a competent staff of instructors has been engaged by the rabbi.</p>
   <p>A Young Judea Club is in the process of being organized, and those who are interested, will please call the rabbi at Kenwood 3818.</p>
