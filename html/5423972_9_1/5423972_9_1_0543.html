   <p>Mr. Louis Marshall is the recognized leader of the American Jewish Committee and as such, he is one of the recognized leaders of American Jewry. His position on a certain question is quite often considered authoritative by people of his own class. For many years Mr. Marshall was either wholly negative or neutral in his position on the question of a Jewish Palestine. Recently he changed his attitude toward this question. Last year, for the first time, he expressed his sympathy for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. On numerous occasions last year, he had the opportunity to speak openly on the question of rebuilding Palestine, and his words are now being repeated by all the Keren Hayesod workers in the country.</p>

   <p>At a banquet which was held night before last in New York, in honor of Dr. Chaim Weizmann, Mr. Marshall made an eloquent appeal on behalf of the Keren Hayesod, and personally contributed three thousand dollars. His speech made a profound impression upon his listeners.</p>
   <p>We are delighted that such an influential and strong personality as Mr. Marshall has come into our ranks and has spoken in behalf of the Keren Hayesod. We are also convinced that his words will find an echo throughout the country, but it would be stupid to believe that by Mr. Marshall's entrance into the ranks of Keren Hayesod workers, we have captured the fortress of assimilation. Mr. Marshall was never an assimilationist, in the general sense of the word, even when he was negative in his position on Zionism. He has always been a devoted Jew, even though he did not want to be considered a nationalist Jew. At heart, he has always been a sincere Jew, but false traditions and false advisers have often obscured his clear Jewish outlook.</p>

   <p>It would be an injustice to Mr. Marshall to assert that he is the leader of assimilation in America, and, therefore, his entrance into the ranks of the Keren Hayesod does not mean the capturing of the fortress of assimilation in America. Many semiassimilated and misled Jews will now follow him and join the Keren Hayesod, but the real assimilationists will not follow him, nor will they accept his advice because no one can convince them. The real assimilationist is not susceptible to new ideas and the inclination toward assimilation is in his blood. The leader of the assimilationists in America is not Mr. Marshall, but rather Mr. Bernheim of Louisville, Kentucky--the man who recently proposed that the synagogue change its name to the American Israelite Church; the man who declared that the Jews are only a religious sect, and that the American Jew has no relationship whatever with a non-American Jew. Assimilationists are those Jews in America who claim that all Jews who are not willing to give up their Judaism, are aliens and as such, they are a menace to the country. Mr. Marshall was never the leader of these assimilated Jews and his conversion to Zionism, therefore, does <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>not, and cannot mean that the ice of assimilation has been broken. It would be the greatest mistake on the part of the Zionists in this country to draw false conclusions from Mr. Marshall's appearance in favor of Zionism.</p>
   <p>We believe that when Mr. Marshall becomes more at home in Zionist circles and more devoted to Palestine, he will plunge into Keren Hayesod work with the same enthusiasm and the same diligence as he has shown in relief work, and it is certain that thanks to his efforts, the Keren Hayesod will collect vast sums of money in America. Mr. Marshall is certainly a great asset for the Keren Hayesod, but he is not the man to break the ice of assimilation. Whenever Mr. Marshall appealed for relief, he spoke of the Jews in Europe as "our brothers". He spoke of "our people" and he considered relief work "national work". But to the real assimilationists, giving money for relief meant giving aid to foreigners, and Mr. Marshall, with all his grand eloquence, will not change the Jews who are of this opinion. They [the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>assimilationists] represent the contemporary "Generation of the Wilderness" and an inexorable fate dictates that the "Generation of the Wilderness" must perish in the wilderness.</p>
   <p>The Keren Hayesod need only appeal to those Jews in America in whom the spark of Judaism still exists. To these Jews, Mr. Marshall can appeal with great success. To appeal to the assimilationists on the ground that Mr. Marshall has entered our camp would be an insult to Mr. Marshall because he never was an assimilationist in the ordinary sense of the word. It would also be a waste of energy.</p>
   <p>We can congratulate ourselves upon gaining such a strong and influential personality as Mr. Marshall. But the ice of assimilation is still unbroken because that ice is polar ice which never melts, and upon which the sun never shines. It is a perpetual frost and perpetual darkness. Our mission is to concentrate our energy on the Jews in whom the spark <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of Judaism still exists, and leave the "Generation of the Wilderness" to its own fate.</p>
