   <p>For a number of years, Chicago Jews have been planning to establish a regular judicial council, which would represent the highest rabbinical authority in the city. Many [other] plans have been worked out, and often it seemed that the plan of a judicial council was going to be realized, but a new obstacle always arose which prevented the realization of the plan. Either the organizational formula was wrong, or the rabbis could not agree among themselves as to who should appoint the members of the judicial council, or the problem of financing the judicial council could not be solved.</p>
   <p>All the plans to create a judicial council in Chicago came to nought, but there is, nevertheless, a judicial council in Chicago at the present time. The rabbis, however, who gather periodically to listen to claims, to hand down verdicts, to pass judgment upon certain affairs, are not known as a judicial council. One reads quite often in the pages of the Courier that <span class="page-break">2</span>the rabbis of Chicago have gathered at a certain place, at a certain time, to consider Jewish public problems, religious, moral, community, and so on.</p>
   <p>This is a new order in Chicago which should be greeted enthusiastically by every Jew. The responsibility for this new order rests upon the old and respected Jewish tradition of paying honor to a great scholar and treating him with respect.</p>
   <p>This great scholar is the rabbi of Lomza who settled in Chicago not long ago, and became rabbi of the Congregation Tiphereth Zion. He enjoys an international reputation as a great man of the Torah. His greatness was recognized as soon as he arrived in Chicago. Thus we now have something that we haven't had all this time: a man of great authority. Rabbi [Judah] Gordon of Lomza represents a great rabbinical authority. He was rabbi of Lomza--a great Jewish city--for many years. During his long rabbinical career he became known as one of the great men of this generation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>His appearance in Chicago has made a deep impression upon all those who have come in contact with him, even if they did not agree with his opinions on Jewish public problems. For the first time, Chicago has welcomed a truly great rabbi of the old type, a man who has broad shoulders and who can take upon himself the great responsibility of being a teacher and a leader.</p>
   <p>A judicial council in Chicago could have arisen either in a purely organizational way or by the appearance of a great rabbinical personality. The organizational way was tried but it was unsuccessful; there were too many obstacles which could not be removed. But now, there has appeared on the scene a great rabbinical authority, an authority who is recognized by everybody. This has made possible the new order. Officially, there is no judicial council in Chicago. Actually, there is a judicial council in Chicago which meets periodically, investigates claims and complaints, hands down verdicts, tries to regulate certain community problems which are related to the religious life of the Jews, seeks to introduce order, and strives to be an inspirational force in the life of the Orthodox Jews of Chicago.</p>

   <p>We hope that in the course of time there will arise in Chicago an official judicial council. The meetings of the rabbis are very useful but a city like Chicago must have an organized judicial council, because it must have archives and records of the council, and as long as Chicago rabbis are not organized officially in a judicial council, there can be no such archives.</p>
   <p>Chicago is a great Jewish city in which thousands of things happen every day, remarkable things. Sometimes problems arise which should be considered by rabbinical authorities. Furthermore, the city is disorganized so far as religion is concerned. Anyone who wants to perform the marriage ceremony, can do so; anyone who wants to be a circumciser, can be one; anyone who wants to grant a divorce, can do so; anyone who wants to sail under the flag of kosher, can do so without asking permission of anyone. In short, Chicago is, from a religious point of view, completely disorganized. Only a judicial council, after long and arduous labor, would be able to organize religious affairs in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Now that we have a new order in Chicago, it would be no more than right for <span class="page-break">5</span>the Chicago rabbis, under the leadership of Rabbi Gordon, to organize themselves into a judicial council and undertake the work and the responsibility of organizing the Jewish religious life of Chicago. If Rabbi Gordon is able to accomplish this, he will crown his lifework with a great achievement, for which a great part of our people in America will be eternally grateful.</p>
