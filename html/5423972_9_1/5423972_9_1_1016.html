   <p>The Rev. Georges Bergmann is a youthful but already an accomplished orator. He conducted the religious services last Saturday in the newly erected temple of the South Side Hebrew Congregation. The congregation was deeply touched by his impressive sermon. Rabbi Bergmann will give a lecture next Thursday at the Knights of Zion Society. The subject he chose is Children of the Ghetto by Zangwill.</p>
