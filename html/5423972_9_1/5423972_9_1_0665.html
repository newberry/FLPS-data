   <p>Last night there was a meeting in the La Salle Hotel of Chicago rabbis and synagogue presidents. The question considered was the way in which the Orthodox Jews of Chicago are to fulfill their duty in the campaign for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of the World Zionist Organization] that will soon open in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Samuel Neveleff proposed, and it was decided that the Chicago synagogues, as a unit, should give a special banquet for the Zionist delegation, and should turn over a check from the synagogues to Nahum Sokolow.</p>
   <p>It was also decided that next week the Association of [Synagogue] Presidents should hold a meeting to work out the details of the banquet. Mr. J. Weil was chairman of last night's meeting.</p>
