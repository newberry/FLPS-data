   <p>The last number of the Jewish Advance devotes much space to the "indifferentism" of the Israelites toward religious matters, and a consideration of its causes. It is complained that the synagogues are empty. Few care to support them, fewer still to visit them; the Rabbis preach to empty benches.</p>
   <p>Is not indifferentism the cause of this?</p>
   <p>The Advance is inclined to ascribe the emptiness of the synagogues to other causes. The greatest of all those causes is the inadequateness of the Rabbis to their present position, or rather their losing sight of the rabbinical situation as it ought to be. No one can assert that the Israelites, as a class, are indifferent to intellectual recreation. Large numbers of the brethren flock to hear Unitarian preachers, lecturers on liberal subjects, and on the philosophy of the times. It is informed that the temple of Drs. Huebsch, Mensez, and others, of New York, are very well attended on the Sabbath. Even in this city it will be found that Rabbi Asler's temple is always filled with an appreciative audience on a Sabbath.</p>

   <p>Those Rabbiswhose temples are not popular with the people, are the cause of this evil. Some that are learned, are too anxious to display their vast information. Others that are not as well informed, are too anxious to be considered scholars.</p>
   <p>The former give the people that which is too lofty to become popular, which only specialists can appreciate; the latter indulge in vagaries and nonsense, which no commonsense man can enjoy and no one can be edified by. Is it a wonder then that the temples are empty? Or should the people at large be accused of indifferentism because they are too earnest about religious matters to enjoy in the synagogue what savors of aggrandizement on the part of the Rabbis?</p>
   <p>Young people are summarily dealt with by most of our ministers; they are simply scolded because they will not live like ascetics, entirely or partly, - because they will comply with the practical demands of life. Old age is upheld as an example of decay and sober reflection at once; youth is represented as a fleeting shadow, a withering flower; the enjoyments of life are spoken <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of as transient things, which bring evil consequences in their trail and idealism, vague and undefined (which naturally cannot be understood on account of the vague expressions in which it is represented) is glorified as soul-saving and redeeming. This is the reason why the young men shun the shrines of worship. This is the reason why they do not come to listen to the Rabbis. This is the reason, moreover, why they will flock to listen to an Ingersoll, whose jokes and bon-mots they can at least understand. This is the reason, why the practical ethics of Prof. Asler are appreciated by them, and why they do more good than the vague and undefined religious twaddle of the brethren of the cloth.</p>
   <p>If the Rabbis would fully understand to live with the people, and to preach out of and directly for the natural religious cravings of the masses, they would find sufficient listeners, the synagogues would not be empty, and "indifferentism" would not be so much talked about.</p>
   <p>Is it indifferentism, which dots the land with shrines of worship, with benevolent institutions and lecture-halls? Is it indifferentism which keeps ministers in office?</p>

   <p>Can members of a congregation be accused of indifference if they raise issues on matters of principle among themselves, and on one side and the other, advocate the recognition of their views with equal zeal and ardor?</p>
   <p>Even those who will not join a congregation, advancing the reason that the same is not adequate to supply their religious wants, or simply telling you "If I want to pray, I can do so at home!" - even such persons should not be called indifferentists, for by advancing such reasons they do not deny their adherence to and their respect for religion. There are in reality very few genuine indifferentists among us.</p>
   <p>There is no religious code of religious prescriptions suitable for the present.</p>
   <p>The Rabbis have as yet no system to supply the want of such an institution. But there is an inward religious conviction prevailing with the large majority of the brethren. They feel that every man can be, and actually ought to be, his own priest.</p>
