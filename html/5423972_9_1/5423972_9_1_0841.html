   <p>That aid be given first to infants, is a duty accepted by civilized and uncivilized peoples alike. Helping the helpless child who cannot fight himself the battles for existence, is an elemental instinct among living beings. The wildest animal will sacrifice herself for her helpless cub; the most barbaric peoples, those nearer to the animal world than to man's, will defend their young at the price of their lives. And the slogan "Babies First" is not a moral principle, but an elemental instinct of all peoples, as well as of all animals.</p>
   <p>In this case, what is true of the individual is true of the community. A group with healthy instincts will primarily care for its helpless infants. Should you desire to know if certain groups are well established socially or operate on healthy social instincts, then investigate their attitude toward their small helpless manhood, that small humanity which cannot as yet speak or walk and is entirely dependent on the succor of others, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>then inquire, too, of the organization of the orphanages, their management, and the treatment accorded their children.</p>
   <p>If the treatment accorded this helpless youth is the basis of our judgment for the social solidarity of the group, then what opinion must we form of a group of three million Jews in America who year after year permit thousands of Jewish infants to be lost to Christian institutions for lack of sufficient Jewish institutions?</p>
   <p>There are many complaints that thousands of Jewish children in America grow up without a conception of Jewish Torah or respect, that these thousands of Jewish children in America are sent yearly to Christian institutions to be reared as Christians. On this score, no one says a word; our civic leaders are quiet on this problem as if they trembled to approach it.</p>
   <p>What takes place in the large Judaism of America occurs also on a smaller scale in our beloved Chicago. We have here in Chicago an orphanage for children who can help themselves, but for orphaned helpless tots, for babies, <span class="page-break">\3</span>there is no institution. When a poor Jewish workman loses his wife, there is but one place that will provide for his small helpless orphans; the Christian institution, because a Jewish one does not exist.</p>
   <p>To call this scandalous is a mild expression. Especially when we have an Associated Charity that cares and must care for the unfortunate children of fate.</p>
   <p>During the last influenza epidemic, hundreds of Jewish infants lost their mothers and even their fathers. We do not know yet definitely the number of these unfortunate Jewish babies, but we do know that it is estimated in the hundreds. What have Chicago Jews done for these unfortunate infants?</p>
   <p>How many of them will go to the Gentiles and grow up Christians? Have our social and civic workers no feelings for these unfortunate Jewish babies? Can they answer to their Jewish conscience, should these unfortunate babies <span class="page-break">\4</span>be reared as Christians?</p>
   <p>Here we have not simply the question of emergency measures arisen because of the influenza epidemic, which has merely made the problem more acute than previously, but the problem as such is one of normal times. The Jewish workman who loses his young wife through death, or has to separate from a wife who is not suited to him, can by no means, alone, care for the small orphans. He cannot hire nurses for them; neither can he place them anywhere. He has no choice but to place them in Gentile hands. And what about illegitimate children? There are also Christian institutions that accept Jewish illegitimate children. A Jewish institution to care for such unfortunate children does not exist.</p>
   <p>It is quite scandalous when no one can be found in such large Jewish communities as Chicago to espouse the cause of these infants and to desire the establishment of a Jewish home that will give them a Jewish uprearing. It is more than scandalous when a group of people are willing to do this noble work but are hindered <span class="page-break">\5</span>by the social workers.</p>
   <p>This is exactly what is occurring at present in our beloved Chicago.</p>
   <p>A group of Jewish women from the West Side are working to secure a home for these unfortunate Jewish babies. Instead of helping them in their work, encouraging them and coming to their aid, everyone everywhere hinders them or shows them the door. The Associated (Jewish Charities) lent them a deaf ear. The rabbis are silent, as if it were no concern of theirs when they should be the first to lend succor. Other social workers, as Mr. Rosenblott, pretend to know nothing of it. The result being that this dire need cannot be met.</p>
   <p>The Courier, as the organ of the Jewish community, cannot remain indifferent to such a tragic and scandalous situation. We have all the Jewish Charities; it is our policy that whatever is done in Chicago under the name of charity, should be accomplished not without the leaders and social workers, but must <span class="page-break">\6</span>go through the proper organized and systematized channels.</p>
   <p>We stand in principle against rending these forces and against private groups.</p>
   <p>But should our social workers in Chicago further continue to ignore this urgent problem of providing for the Jewish infants who must receive our first consideration, then the Courier will be compelled to deviate from its present policy, and together with this group of women who desire to establish this necessary institution for unfortunate babies, appeal directly to the public without consulting the leaders, because our Jewish conscience is not broad enough to look on when Jewish children are lost to the Jewish race.</p>
   <p>We can only remind the Associated Charities to do their duty, but should they fail to do so, others will. We must provide for the unfortunate babies.</p>
