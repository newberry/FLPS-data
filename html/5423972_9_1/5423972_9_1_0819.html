   <p>We announce that we will conduct our worship this Rosh Hashonnah and Yom Kippur in the well lit hall of the Jewish Educational Alliance, 1243 N. Wood St., where our beloved countrymen, Shlomo Wexler and Hershel Rosenzweig, will conduct the prayers accompanied by a choir of 15. The proceeds of all sales of tickets for these days will go to the war victims of our old home.</p>
