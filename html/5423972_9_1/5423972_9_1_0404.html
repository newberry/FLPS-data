   <p>The annual dinner and meeting of Sinai Congregation was held on April 10. The board of trustees presented the results of investigations made for the acquirement of a new temple and center site. A definite decision was reached to build the new temple at 56th St. and the Outer Drive.</p>
   <p>Sinai will carry on its work in its old quarters for another year. It is hoped that the congregation will be at its new location for the high holidays in the Fall of 1928.</p>
