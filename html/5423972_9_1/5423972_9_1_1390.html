   <p>Jewish youth in the West Side of Chicago has no center. That it needs one goes without saying. There are innumerable Jewish clubs, societies, organizations, the objects of which are educational, intellectual, literary or social, which have no adequate meeting places and no guide for their activities.</p>
   <p>Not only is there a need for a center for our youth, but for our adults as well. There is no Jewish intellectual center on the West Side, no Jewish literary center, no Jewish social center, and no Jewish library either. The only way to meet all these actual requirements is to establish one center to accommodate the young and the old, the literate and those in need of an education, the poor and [the] rich. The center, it should be understood, must serve Jewish purposes and must be permeated with a Jewish spirit. It must foster noble Jewish aims and aspirations. It must be the cementing power in the community, a source of Jewish idealism and the central point for all the Jewish activities in the Lawndale District. The Jews in the Lawndale District are no longer immigrants. They are all thoroughly Americanized. The number of newcomers from across the seas is insignificant, and therefore the center to be established can concentrate all its activities on the cultivation of the Jewish spirit and Jewish ideals. The American school will take care and does take care of all Americanization work. If the center to be established in the Lawndale District will bring up a good generation of Jews in Chicago, it will ipso facto also serve the purposes of a better citizenship, for a good Jew, true to the traditions of his people and to everything that is noble in Judaism, is of necessity a good man and a good citizen. He is ethically minded, a lover of justice and a seeker of truth, and hence the center to be established can best serve the purposes of Americanization and the purposes of creating a better citizenship by being thoroughly Jewish in spirit. Such a center is a real need and is worthwhile having.</p>
   <p>If the leaders of the community, who are interested in the establishment of such a center, will approach the solution of the problem from the point of view we have here presented, their appeal for a center will meet with a generous response on the part of the Jews in the Lawndale District. If the leaders of the community indicate their willingness to establish a Jewish center to meet the educational, intellectual, religious, artistic, literary and recreational needs of the Jewish community on the West Side, there will be not a single West Side Jew who will not contribute his share toward the building fund.</p>
   <p>In our humble judgment, the center to be established at the cost of a million dollars should have a modern Hebrew school to accommodate at least five hundred pupils of both sexes, a Jewish library to be the Jewish library of the Jewish community of Chicago, a synagogue and educational facilities for old and young, and courses in Jewish history and literature as well as in Hebrew, besides playgrounds, meeting halls, etc. The educational and intellectual policies of the center should be left in control of a Joint Board consisting of prominent West and South Side Jews who know something about matters Jewish and who are familiar with the intellectual and educational needs of the West Side. The other activities, can be left to the Board of the present Jewish People's Institute. This seems to us to be a sufficient basis for co-operation between the West Side Jews and the present Board of the Institute. Such co-operation will result in much good for the community and will greatly contribute to the creation of a united Jewish community in Chicago. The West Side Jews must not feel for one single moment that they are being imposed upon philanthropically but they must feel that they are on equal footing with the rest of the community and that their co-operation is accepted and welcome.</p>
