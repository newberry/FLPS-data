   <p>In Rock Island the Zionists have ousted their Reform rabbi from the organization because the rabbi said to them, "Either you help me with my temple work, or we won't have a Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] committee." The rabbi began to abuse the Zionists because they refused to help him with his "temple work," which would mean dragging the Orthodox Jews into the quagmire of Reform. Since the Zionists of that city ignored the Reform temple, the rabbi launched a campaign against the Zionists and the Keren Hayesod, and the result was that the Zionist leaders ousted the rabbi from the organization. Now they carry on the Keren Hayesod work without interference.</p>
   <p>I cannot understand, to this very day, how a Reform rabbi can be a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Zionist.</p>
   <p>The words Zion and Jerusalem must not be mentioned in the Reform temple. The words Zion and Jerusalem cannot be found in the Reform prayer book, and the temple represents the meager Judaism that they [the Reform Jews] stand for. How can one place a taboo upon Zion and Jerusalem in the temple, and afterwards go out and preach Zionism? I have, therefore, arrived at the following conclusion: If a Reform rabbi is an honest Zionist, he is a fake as a Reform rabbi; if he believes in Reform, and is, at the same time, a Zionist, he is a humbug as a Zionist. That is why I am not particularly impressed with the great Reform rabbis who are Zionists. I know that my friend [S.B.] Komaiko will immediately protest. Let him. Logic is logic and protests will be of no avail.</p>
   <p>The United Rabbinate has already had a number of meetings. At these meetings certain matters have been taken up, which are of general interest.</p>

   <p>I believe, therefore, that the United Rabbinate ought to give the public an account of its activities. What are the obstacles involved, and why doesn't the organization move a little faster? Statements would be of great benefit to the United Rabbinate itself.....What do you intend to do, gentlemen?</p>
