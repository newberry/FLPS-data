   <p>A few synagogues in Chicago are now conducting a very successful membership drive. The Kehilath Jacob Synagogue alone enrolled last week not less than fifty new members. Every synagogue in Chicago should and could double its membership if it would only make an effort. The synagogues in the Lawndale district should have at least fifteen thousand members, but they have no more than three thousand because they make no effort to obtain new members. As the Orthodox congregations in the city are today all, or nearly all, centers of general Jewish work, it follows that the congregations should have, not only from a religious point of view but from a general Jewish point of view, three times as many members as they have now. The Jew who belongs to a synagogue can be approached for all Jewish public purposes, which means that the more members a synagogue has, the easier it is for it to bear the burden, and the less worries has the individual about his synagogue. So let us have more synagogue members!</p>
