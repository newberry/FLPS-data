   <p>A considerable number of years have elapsed since we were involved in a controversy over the various systems of education. We are constantly proving that this or that system is better for instruction in Judaism, and makes it easier to teach Hebrew. We are forever seeking methods as well as sound advice.</p>
   <p>The public is divided into three factions: (1) those who cling to the system of having Hebrew translated into Jewish; (2) those who insist on having Hebrew translated into English; (3) those who contend that Hebrew should be studied in Hebrew [direct method]. The fourth, and largest, faction is composed of those who care nothing about any system of education and hence, don't want anything taught. The system doesn't make any difference to the children who study. Under any system, one will acquire more knowledge, another, less; and the children who do not study anything <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will remain boors regardless of any system.</p>
   <p>Too much time has been wasted on this controversy. The truth of the matter is that, first of all, we should have answered a question of greater significance, viz., What methods of instruction shall we use in order to win the confidence of our children so that they will remain with us?</p>
   <p>This question is very difficult, because it cannot be answered merely by applying a system of education, whether it be Hebrew into Jewish, Hebrew into English or even Hebrew into Hebrew. Our children may use Hebrew as their mother tongue and still be strange to our nation.</p>
   <p>It is an established fact that not all who speak Hebrew are Jews, just as all who write letters in Hebrew are not necessarily nationalists.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that the reason for this is quite simple. Our modern teachers have neglected an important phase in Jewish education, viz., religious <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>instruction. Our modern teachers maintain that it is unimportant to teach the child "grace", and also that it is a waste of time to teach him how to read the daily prayers because he will not, in any case, observe them.</p>
   <p>This reminds us of the story of the young housewife who put a pot of meat and mixed spices on the stove, and forgot to light the fire underneath the pot. At noon when her husband came to eat lunch, the young housewife complained that "the stove is no good, the meat is raw and the soup tasteless; everything must be thrown out!" "No", said the wise husband. "It is not that bad. The stove is not to blame. Light the fire underneath the pot and everything will be all right."</p>
   <p>Our children look for inspiration; their young souls thirst for something sacred, something religious. It is true that in the Jewish home in America there is nothing to inspire the child in a religious way. In several homes jokes and mockery at the expense of religion are often heard. For <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>this reason, the Jewish teacher must perform the mission of kindling the sacred flame of religion in children's hearts. If the teacher neglects this, then we need not wonder why children remain ignorant of Judaism and why they draw apart from us.</p>
   <p>Furthermore we dare say that whatever religion the Jewish child fails to receive at home from his father, and in Hebrew school from his teacher, he [the child] will get in the mission homes from the missionaries. In the mission home the child listens to services in which religious legends are told and hymns are sung.</p>
   <p>It is certain that among the hundreds of children who frequent the mission homes, which have now become so widespread in the heart of the Jewish district, not one can be found who attends a city Talmud Torah (Hebrew school).</p>
   <p>It is a great mistake to think that a Jewish child becomes a Jew because <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>he is accidentally born one. One becomes a Jew through a Jewish upbringing.</p>
   <p>In America this sacred task of rearing the child as a Jew falls entirely upon the city Talmud Torah. We cannot change the father; we cannot alter the conduct of his home. Nevertheless, we have some authority and a great deal of influence over the child. It is our moral obligation to teach him Judaism because, if the Jewish teacher doesn't, no one will.</p>
   <p>It is also erroneous to think that a Jewish child who is not brought up in the Jewish religion will later on be a person without a religion. He will seek another religion. Those who rear their children without faith create candidates for a different faith.</p>
   <p>Not the System, but Jewish education itself is the principal thing! The principal thing is how to raise the child as a Jew so that he will remain with us and not wander off into strange pastures. The most formidable <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>weapons are our old weapons. We must teach the children the Pentateuch so that they won't attend the mission's "Bible hours": we must relate to them the legend of Elijah the Prophet so that they won't be so enthusiastic about Santa Claus; if we take them to the synagogue, they won't go to the church; if we tell them of the Anointed King they won't believe in any pseudo Messiah; if we teach them the laws of the Sabbath they won't observe Sunday; if we lead them to the God of Israel, they won't look for an idol among other faiths; impurity will have no power over them if we fill their hearts with sanctity.</p>
