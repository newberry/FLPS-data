   <p>A number of attempts have been made to unite the Jewish forces in Chicago and to create a central organization of the orthodox forces of Chicago. Every attempt has failed because either the Chicago orthodoxy was not ready for such a unity of forces, or because certain elements could not see the necessity for it, or because certain leading persons were not brave enough to make the necessary sacrifices which a union of orthodox forces demands.</p>
   <p>But now a moment has arrived when the orthodox Jews in Chicago must act if they wish to save the Judaism, which we have inherited from our fathers, from being totally wiped out. It is absolutely impossible to permit the conditions in which the Chicago orthodoxy finds itself now to continue. Many important, and sometimes delicate, problems have arisen. These problems must be solved or a catastrophe will arrive.</p>
   <p>On the order of the day stands the problem of the proposed merger between the Federated and the Associated Charities--and that problem is not easy to solve.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Of course, the unification of the Jewish charities in Chicago is very much to be desired, but such a consolidation should not occur at the expense of Judaism. Jewish life in Chicago must become stronger, not weaker. If, as a result of unification, Judaism becomes weaker--then this unification must not take place. But who shall have the deciding word? Who shall say yes when yes must be said, and no when no must be said? It is true that the Federated has a board of directors and an excellent management, but the representative of Chicago orthodox Jewry is the congregation, not the Federated. When it comes to the problem of amalgamation, then the orthodox synagogues must have their say through their representative. This they can do only when they are united.</p>
   <p>Several very unpleasant incidents have recently occurred in Chicago. These incidents throw a remarkable light upon the conditions of the community, and upon the organizational weakness of the Chicago orthodoxy. It very nearly came to pass that the representatives of Chicago orthodoxy, rabbis, synagogue presidents, slaughterers, would have <span class="page-break">3</span>had to appear in court and explain [the regulations] concerning slaughtering: who controls them, who has a right to be a slaughterer according to Jewish law and whether a slaughterer may be slugged if he is not a member of the union. This would have been a terrible disgrace to the Holy Name which would not have made Chicago orthodoxy stronger in any way--neither morally, socially nor spiritually. A few weeks ago there was a dispute between the slaughterers and the butchers, and had it not been for the levelheadedness displayed by certain leaders of both sides, a scandal would have arisen.</p>
   <p>The most unpleasant problem of all, the problem of burial on Sunday, has again come to the forefront. This problem has not been solved as yet, but it must be solved immediately in a way which will satisfy the demands and customs of the Jewish religion as well as the law of the land, and it must be regulated in an honest and decent way. The representatives of the synagogues have at last realized that this problem must be solved in the very near future.</p>
   <p>The present relief drive in Chicago has opened the eyes of responsible orthodox leaders and they see the necessity of a union of their forces. Materially the relief drive has been a great success. Chicago Jews may well say with justifiable <span class="page-break">4</span>pride that they have not only done their duty this time, but that they have set a beautiful example for others to follow. Spiritually and morally [however], Chicago orthodoxy has not only not won anything in this drive, it has lost a great deal. It is high time that we openly admitted this.</p>
   <p>The Reformed Jews have put their stamp upon this drive. The most important meeting during the drive took place at the Sinai Temple, where hyperconscious orthodox Jews and orthodox rabbis could not go. The leaders of the drive did not find it necessary to hold even one meeting on the West Side or on the Northwest Side, though the orthodox Jews did their share and contributed many hundreds of thousands of dollars to the relief fund. During the present drive the Chicago orthodoxy has been almost non-existent, if we look at it from the point of view of social status and social recognition. The leaders of the drive did not deem it necessary to consider the orthodox Jews at all.</p>
   <p>Whenever a religious group loses its social influence, it also loses its religious influence. However, we believe that such a great undertaking as a two million dollar drive in Chicago should strengthen Judaism and not weaken it, <span class="page-break">5</span>If the orthodox forces were united, then Chicago orthodoxy would have won a great deal in this drive, morally, spiritually and socially. But Chicago orthodoxy has lost everything in this drive because its forces were not united.</p>
   <p>Can this go on? Not only do we say no, but so do the leaders of the Chicago orthodoxy, the thinking and active rabbis and synagogue members. And because they say no, they have now made a last and final attempt to unite.</p>
   <p>The union of the synagogue presidents and of the synagogues, which has assumed the name of Union Of Orthodox Congregations Of Chicago, can accomplish a great deal toward strengthening Judaism in Chicago. The men who stand at the head of this organization and those who are connected with this organization, which represents the entire Chicago orthodoxy, bear a tremendous responsibility. It is the hope of every Chicago Jew that they may be successful in their work.</p>
