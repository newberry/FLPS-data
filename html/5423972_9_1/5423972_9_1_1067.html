   <p>The corner stone of Congregation B'nai Abraham's new temple was laid last Sunday afternoon with Masonic ceremonies. The new building is located on Marshfield Avenue, between 12th and Taylor Streets, and will be 55x110 feet. The front is of Portage stone, and when completed, the temple, with the organ and pews, will cost about $45,000.</p>
   <p>The congregation intends to establish a free kindergarten in the basement of the new temple, which will be fitted up according to the best methods of such institutions. Two young ladies, whose parents are members of the congregation, are already preparing as teachers for the kindergarten.</p>
   <p>Dr. Levy is very confident of success in this undertaking, and believes that with the aid of Prof. Bamberger, he will be able to secure teachers who will give their services gratuitously. All other expenses <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the kindergarten will be willingly defrayed by the congregation. The congregation should number 150 members by the time they move into their new quarters.</p>
