   <p>"The first American Congress of Liberal Religious Societies was convened at Sinai Temple on the evening of May 22.</p>
   <p>This gathering is the outcome of the Parliament of Religions, held at the time of the Fair, at which representatives of the Universalist, Unitarian, Independent, Reformed Hebrew, Ethical Culture and other organizations united in the appointment of a committee of ten to devise ways and means of securing closer cooperation between the denominations of religious societies.</p>
   <p>All the speakers at the Congress expressed the opinion that the time was ripe for the unification of liberal religious thought. We are heartily in sympathy with the aims of the congress and consider its work of supreme importance to the religious world.</p>
   <p>In our minds the greatest result of the Fair is shown in the union of liberal religions and we feel that the fruits of its labors will be a long step toward the day of the millenium."</p>
