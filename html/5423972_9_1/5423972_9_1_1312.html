   <p>TELLS OF B'NAI B'RITH WORK.</p>
   <p>Fred Bernstein, representative of District No. 6 on B'nai B'rith Hillel Commission, presided. In his opening remarks he called attention to the fact that B'nai B'rith was celebrating its 90th anniversary; that the dedication exercises were part of the 10th anniversary celebration of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations. Mr. Bernstein stressed the fact that B'nai B'rith represented no particular group of Jews and no particular phase of Jewish life; that after ninety years of active life it still held to its original program of "uniting Israel." "B'nai B'rith," said the chairman, "has no fixed policy and never had unless its program of uniting Israel could be considered a fixed policy. Its activities change with the needs of the times. It sought to defend <span class="page-break">\5</span>and protect the fair name of Israel whenever that was necessary. Today, B'nai B'rith has come to the conclusion that the Jew was suffering mostly from ignorance of the Jew. Therefore, the main activities of the order today are through its anti-Defamation League which seeks to keep the non-Jew informed and to make him understand and appreciate the contribution which the Jew has made and still is making to civilization, and through its B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations it seeks to inform the Jewish students who will be the Jewish leaders of tomorrow, thus preparing them to carry on the traditions which have come down from our ancestors and to better equip them to meet the challenges that come from without."</p>

   <p>STUDENT COUNCIL HEAD SPEAKS.</p>
   <p>The first president of the Student Council, Marvin Finder, spoke eloquently on the subject assigned to him, "What the Students Hope For," and Rabbi Jacob Singer, the first director of the Foundation, who is giving his services without compensation, delivered the address of the evening. Rabbi Singer said that the exercises were really a rededication and that through the foundations B'nai B'rith was attempting a recreation of the age-old Jewish traditions. He prayed that the child would grow into maturity, bringing joy and satisfaction to the great order which has made possible the splendid work being done among Jewish university students.</p>

   <p>Rabbi Charles Shulman of Glencoe Temple, delivered the invocation and Rabbi A. L. Lassen, president Chicago Rabbinical Association, brought greetings from the Chicago Rabbinical Association pledging their hearty support and cooperation to the new Foundation.</p>
   <p>Both Rabbi Singer and the chairman conveyed to President Scott and Rev. Tittle the appreciation of B'nai B'rith Hillel Commission of the fine spirit of cooperation and the splendid courtesy exhibited in their sincere cooperation.</p>
