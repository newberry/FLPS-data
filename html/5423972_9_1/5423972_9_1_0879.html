   <p>An important meeting was held yesterday by the Chicago Rabbinate in the Waller Street Talmed Torah, where the position of the dietary food laws to the present meat strike, and its effect upon the city, was discussed.</p>
   <p>As is well known, the Schohtim Union (Slaughters Union) announced that its members would not slaughter any fowls for private individuals, but only in the butcher shops where they are engaged. This, naturally, makes it difficult for the women who do not want to go to the butcher shops. Therefore, many will demand carcass and unkosher meat. The rabbis, who are indebted to observe the dietary food laws, have given this matter serious consideration, and after long deliberation they determined to beseech the Shochtim to slaughter fowls, without retardation, for private individuals.</p>
   <p>Whoever will not carry out this order, will violate the words of our sages and be punished accordingly.</p>
   <p>All the Shochtim who were present at this meeting unanimously agreed with the <span class="page-break">2</span>rabbis and ruled as void the declaration to decline from slaughtering fowls for private individuals.</p>
