   <p>More than 130 delegates came yesterday to the labor conference for Palestine at the West Side Auditorium. The conference lasted all day and came to a close in the evening with a banquet.</p>
   <p>Mr. D. Ben Gurion, the well-known Poale Zion leader came especially from New York to the conference and in several addresses clearly outlined before the assembled delegates, who represented about eighteen thousand organized workers and members of aid societies, the present situation regarding Palestine and what the workers must do to help; firstly, to rebuild a new life for the Jews in Palestine, and secondly to be represented everywhere in such a manner as to prevent the wealthier class from exclusive domination.</p>
   <p>Mr. William Nathanson, in a powerful address called upon the Jewish workers not to abstain from this sacred work, but to help in building the Jewish <span class="page-break">\2</span>homeland on the basis of equality, justice and brotherly love.</p>
   <p>Several resolutions with recommendations to the delegates to the Labor Congress, which will be held next month in New York, were adopted after lively discussion. Similar conferences were held yesterday in almost every part of America.</p>
