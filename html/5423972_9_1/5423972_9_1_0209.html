   <p>We rejoiced as all Jews rejoiced, over the fact that out of the discord between the American Jewish Committee and the Congress Organization "peace unto Isfael" finally was achieved. We have expressed our satisfaction with the fact that these committees, which had both determined to seek an agreement, had finally effected a reconciliation. Consequently, American Jewry is united. All classes of Jews will participate in the Congress.</p>
   <p>But after the first excitement caused by the good tidings had subsided and the public had settled back to its normal mood, it began to consider what sort of a Congress it was given, and began to ask whether this was what it wanted and whether the whole fuss was worth-while. It [the public] discovered that the Congress, upon which both parties had agreed through a reconciliation, was a handicapped Congress, a crippled Congress. The ardent supporters of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Congress felt almost like a childless woman who had been praying for children for many years, and finally, when the happy moment arrived, gave birth to a freak.</p>
   <p>The only point that the supporters of a Congress virtually gained through a conciliation was the establishment of a Congress. When we remind ourselves of the bitterness with which the American Jewish Committee fought the idea of a Congress, we must admit that this is a great victory. Besides this point they have gained absolutely nothing because the "boundaries and limitations" which surround the Congress reduce it to a shadow of a Congress. They [the Congress supporters] discovered that it would be a crippled Congress, "crippled and lame and disabled", and with other deformities which will prevent its becoming significant. The delegates who will attend such a Congress will immediately learn that many questions concerning Jews cannot be brought before the Congress, and consequently, cannot be discussed.</p>
   <p>For example, one of the clauses of the conciliation [agreement] forbids the <span class="page-break">\3</span>proposal of a resolution in the Congress, having any connection with the theoretical base of Jewish life. This clause was urged by the American Jewish Committee in order to prevent the Zionists from entering with Zionist resolutions. The Zionist members of the committee, as Zionists, found no fault with this clause because, in the first place, they are not out to impose Zionism on the Congress. What sort of Jewish Congress can it be if it takes precautions against a reversion to Jewish principles?</p>
   <p>Now, a second limitation which is still more naive. The committee of the American Jewish Congress argued that the Congress should neither last indefinitely nor be established as a permanent institution, but should convene only once. At first no one would think of speaking about this, i. e. whether the Congress should be a permanent institution or should convene once and then adjourn sine die. But who can predict what tasks this Congress will encounter in the course of its activities? No one is stupid enough to believe that all that the [Jewish] Congress has to do is to convene, demand equality <span class="page-break">\4</span>for Jews in all countries and the nations will immediately yield, and then the Congress will have to dissolve because it has nothing else to do. Whoever possesses a particle of common sense knows that the liberties which the Jews must win, must be gained step by step, over a long period of time. And if the Congress wishes to aid them in this struggle, then it is self-evident that the Congress will have to remain in existence.</p>
   <p>And the "thou shalt nots" which were fastened to the Congress drag along with them a whole pack of other limitations which were not specifically mentioned.</p>
   <p>Let us assume, for example, that a delegate proposes a resolution that whereas shortly after the war wholesale emigration of Jews from Russia will begin, therefore, the Congress shall organize a committee to take care of them; shall create relief and shall do other things necessary for the support of the immigrants. Then another delegate will get up and say that this resolution is not in order and should not be brought before the Congress, because <span class="page-break">\5</span>the Congress will soon dissolve and therefore cannot create committees that will outlive it and will remain permanent. And the second delegate would be right.</p>
   <p>For this reason, Congress organizations and other organizations which participated in the Philadelphia conference, claim that it would be better to have no Congress at all, rather than to have such a Congress, because such a Congress will be contrary to the spriit of a democratic, people's organization. As soon as limitations are imposed upon certain questions, the representatives of the people no longer have the opportunity to speak the will of the people!</p>
   <p>The delegates who took part in the Philadelphia conference will now have to vote, by referendum, whether or not they are satisfied with the reconciliation. We greatly fear that the majority will not be satisfied, and the dance will begin anew.</p>
