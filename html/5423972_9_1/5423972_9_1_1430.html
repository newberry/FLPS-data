   <p>Yesterday evening the Young Judea of the Middle Western States opened their conference at the Jewish Educational Center, Fifty-Ninth Street and Michigan Avenue.</p>
   <p>Delegates came from Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Ohio, and Indiana. Including the Illinois delegation there were close to a hundred young men and women in attendance.</p>
   <p>From the New York Central office came Mr. H. Newman who showed highly educational slides depicting the activities of the Young Judea. The audience received them with great enthusiasm. Today the meetings will be held in the Congress Hotel. A very important program has been arranged.</p>
   <p>For the successful preparation of this conference we owe a vote of thanks to Rabbi A. Cohen of the Rudfie Tzadic Shule (synagogue) who worked untiringly toward this end.</p>
   <p>It is expected that as a result of this conference, the Chicago Young Judea will become a solid and stable organization which will organize activities for the benefit of Chicago's Jewry.</p>
