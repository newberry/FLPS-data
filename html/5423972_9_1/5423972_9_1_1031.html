   <p>Einhorn's prayer book has been translated into English during the last year, by Dr. E. G. Hirsch, and a few weeks ago this new translation left the press. It was forthwith adopted by several Chicago congregations, among them being Zion. In Chicago, the book is well known in its original form. Sinai Congregation has used it since 1861. In 1864 Zion Congregation adopted the book, and later the North Side Hebrew Congregation and Isaiah Temple followed.</p>
