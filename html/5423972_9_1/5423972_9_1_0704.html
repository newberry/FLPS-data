   <p>On Friday, the Chicago Tribune scored a "sensation" at the expense of the B'nai Israel Congregation of the North Side, announcing that girls had been engaged there to sing in the choir during the holidays, and further stating that "the girls were supposed to wear men's clothing, so that the orthodox Jews would not have to look". The Tribune maintained that the orthodox Jews of the congregation had learned about this situation in time, had fired the girls, and that the girls were now demanding to be paid, in accordance with the contract made with them to sing on Rosh Hashonoh and Yom Kippur.</p>
   <p>The truth of the matter is that one of the choir singers, who considers himself an "expert" in Judaism, brought the girls to the choir director to be considered but the director refused. The girls then begged for an audition, and now they want to be paid because they were brought over and permitted to sing.</p>
   
   <p>The representatives of the B'nai Israel Congregation learned about the whole affair from The Tribune, Friday morning, and now they ask The Courier to let the Jewish people know about it.</p>
