   <p>At the outbreak of the Civil War, under the auspices of Ramah Lodge, a mass meeting of Chicago Jews was called for the purpose of raising money to recruit a company of Jewish volunteers to form a part of the Eighty-second Regiment of Illinois Volunteers, commanded by Col. Frederick Hecker and Lieutenant-Colonel Edw. Solomon.</p>
   <p>The meeting was a great success and the sum of $11,000 was scoured, from which fund a bonus of a $100 each was given to one hundred and four men enlisting in the company. With one exception, all the officers of the company were Jews, and they achieved a splendid record in the war.</p>
   <p>Shortly after the enlistment, Henry Greenbaum, Abraham Hart,and Joseph Frank went to Camp Butler to deliver the regimental flag which had been procured by the Jewish women of Chicago. The flag was entrusted to the Jewish Company, Company C., the Color Guard, and that same flag was was carried throughout the war by a Jewish soldier, Levi by name.</p>
   
   <p>On June 17, 1865, the Eighty-second Regiment returned to Chicago. The flag was riddled with bullets, and out of more than 1,000 members of the Regiment, only 250 returned.</p>
