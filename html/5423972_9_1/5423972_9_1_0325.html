   <p>It may not be out of place here to explain in detail the work which has fallen to the Jewish section of the Religious Parliament.</p>
   <p>Like every other denomination the Jews are expected to hold, in conjunction with the general sessions, a denominational congress of their own. This congress has been called by the joint committees of the Union of American Hebrew Cong. and the Central Rabbinical Conference to convene the last week of August.</p>
   <p>The sessions will be held in one of the synagogues and papers on subjects of interest will be read by men appointed. This congress is entirely under the <span class="page-break">2</span>control of the participants.</p>
   <p>But at the general Parliament, one day and two evenings, during the week intervening between Rosh- Hashonah and Yom-Kippur, have been reserved for what is known as the presentation of Judaism. Nine or ten speakers have been selected to present Judaism's contribution to religion and ethics. These presentations are intended to be the media of conveying information to the world at large on the peculiar tenets of the respective religions. A hall in the new Art Building has been designated as the place for such presentations.</p>
