   <p>The Jewish Congressman from Chicago, Adolph J. Sabath, can now admit two students into the [United States] Military Academy. Young Jewish men who desire to become officers in Uncle Sam's army may send him their applications. Congressman Sabath sent us the following statement, explaining the procedure to be followed by applicants:</p>
   <p>"Thanks to the bill of May 4, 1916, I will have the authority this year to propose two candidates for admission to the Military Academy. An applicant must be between seventeen and twenty-two years of age. He must also possess a high school education or its equivalent.</p>
   <p>"Applications should be addressed and forwarded to my office in Washington not later than September 15, because I intend to hold a formal examination in order to give the successful students a chance to prepare themselves for the final examinations given by the military officers.</p>
   
   <p>"Applications should be forwarded to the following address:</p>
   <p>"A. J. Sabath,</p>
   <p>"Member House of Representatives,</p>
   <p>"Washington, D. C."</p>
