  <p>An event of communal importance was the celebration held last Saturday afternoon at the Kehilath Jacob Hebrew School. Representatives of eight of the largest Hebrew schools in the city came together to observe "Chamishoh Osor Bishevat." But the significant feature of the evening was the celebrants themselves: They are "Tzofim," members of the organization comprised of pupils of the local Hebrew schools.</p>
  <p>"Hatzofim," as the organization is known, had two-hundred and fifty of its members at the celebration. The most impressive part of the occassion came, when after the address by Dr. Alexander M. Dushkin, wherewith he initiated the new "Tzofim," the youngsters recited their pledge - a pledge of loyalty to the Jewish people and its ideals, ending with the words the Jews uttered when they received the Ten Commandments: "Na-Aseh-V'Nishma," - "we will do and we will obey." "Hatzofim" has a splendid idea back of it, that should attract every Jewish lad who is intelligent and devoted to his people. The task of the "Tzofim" is two-fold - wor for their Hewbrew school and for their race. The code of the "Tzofim" includes the doing of a "Mitzvah" - a good deed, each
