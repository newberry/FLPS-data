   <p>Worthy Editor: At a meeting of the Adas B'nai Israel which was held last night, the importance of organizing young girl's clubs, under the name of "Tzieroth B'noth Israel", was discussed. A committee was appointed which immediately swung into action. And through the initiative of the writer of these lines, we succeeded in organizing twenty-five girls, from ten to fifteen years of age, who will hold their first meeting on Sunday in the club rooms of the Adas B'nai Israel, 1133 West Twelfth Street, at 2:00 P. M.</p>
   <p>These clubs aim to draw our Jewish daughters closer to the Jewish religion, to arouse in them a love for everything sacred in Jewish life, to study Jewish history and particularly to create a Jewish environment for young girls who should revere everything which has a truly Jewish character.</p>
   <p>Parents who want their children to benefit from Judaism and to acquire a knowledge of Jewish history are requested to support this undertaking by sending <span class="page-break">\2</span>their children to 1133 West Twelfth Street.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Miss Robinson, organizer.</p>
