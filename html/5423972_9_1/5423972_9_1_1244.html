   <p>Last Thursday (a week ago Thursday), in the Congregation Beth E1 the ceremony of the unfurling of a service flag with thirty stars was held. Rabbi Elijahu Dov Daskal delivered an impassioned patriotic speech on the theme, "The Jew as Patriot".</p>
   <p>The stars on the flag were crocheted in the shape of a Moggen David (the six-pointed Jewish star called the "Shield of David"). The synagogue was packed, and Gary will long remember this day. Appropriate prayers were also read.</p>
