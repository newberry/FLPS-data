   <p>An attraction of the Women's Religious Congress will be a book containing a collection of all the attainable Synagogue music of the Jews from the earliest times to the present. Most of the melodies will be harmonized in hymn form. The work of compilation is entrusted to the most noted cantors in the country. Its intrinsic value will be enhanced by the limitation of the edition published, to 1,000 copies.</p>
