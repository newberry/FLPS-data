   <p>The Chicago delegation to the Poale Zion 6th Convention held in Detroit,Michigan, participated in a great mass meeting for the purpose of selecting a place for the next convention meeting. The Chicago delegation put up a hard fight to bring the convention here but met with failure.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee decided in favor of New York. Our Chicago delegate, Mr. Applebaum, delivered a very able speech, but had no success in bringing the convention here.</p>
