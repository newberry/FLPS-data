   <p>"Another congregation, the fourth one in chronological order, was established by Israelites residing in the west division of the city in 1864. It was chartered under the name Zion Congregation. Its first divine service was held on the eve of Rosh Hashanah 5625, September 30, 1864, and the first temple which the congregation occupied was located on Desplaines street between Madison and Washington streets. In 1869 the congregation disposed of its temple, and erected a new structure on the southeast corner of Jackson and Sangamon streets. In a few years this temple also proved to be too small, and in 1885, the Zion Congregation built a new temple, on the corner of Washington boulevard and Ogden avenue, facing Union Park. Here, they still assemble for divine worship.</p>
   <p>In 1867, The North Side Hebrew Congregation was established. Previous <span class="page-break">\2</span>to the great fire, this congregation had a temple on Ohio st. near Wells st., but the fire destroyed it. In 1882, the congregation undertook to build a new temple on the corner of Rush st. and Walton Place, but they did not finish the building. They sold the property afterwards, and they have recently purchased a lot on the corner of La Salle ave. and Goethe st., on which they will soon erect a new and spacious temple."</p>
   <p>In closing, Dr. Felsenthal said, "The Jews of Chicago have formed societies and have gone into many philanthropic ventures. For example, the Michael Reese Hospital, the Jewish Manual Training School, and the Old People's Home."</p>
