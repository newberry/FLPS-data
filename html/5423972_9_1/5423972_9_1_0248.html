   <p>At the opening of the annual convention of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods at the Congress Hotel, Dr. K. Kohler, president of the Hebrew Union College, said:</p>
   <p>"When the war ends in Europe, a vast current of Jewish immigrants will enter America, which will not only be a blessing for Judaism, but also a boon to humanity.</p>
   <p>"We deeply sympathize with our brothers on the other side. We find them in all the warring countries. For them, war is a horrible misfortune, because the Jews are the greatest pacificts and liberals. America will gain considerable advantage from their coming here, because the Jew always seeks peace."</p>
