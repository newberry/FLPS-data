   <p>Henry Morgenthau, the new American Ambassador to Turkey, was today the guest of the Eastern Council of Reformed Rabbis, who, in his honor, gave a banquet at the Majestic Hotel. The Jewish Envoy expressed satisfaction over the fact that England has elevated a Jew to the high office of Chief Justice. He stated that in these troubled times, Jews can look forward and gain comfort from the fact of the high position accorded Rufus Isaacs. He himself is happy to have accepted the position of Ambassador to Turkey from the largest republic in the world and he believes, many Jews will rejoice in having a Jew represent America in Turkey.</p>

   <p>"In Turkey I shall live as a Jew; I believe the Christian institutions will come under my supervision, but I shall not forget my duty to all Jewish institutions that are worthy of their name."</p>
