   <p>The conference of the Jewish Socialists of the middle western states, which opened last Saturday at 1144 South Halsted Street, closed its session last night after passing important resolutions concerning the future activity of the Jewish Socialist branches in the Middle West. Among the most important resolutions are the following:</p>
   <p>1. Colleges offering courses in socialism are to be founded in all states;</p>
   <p>2. Schools for children and adults are to be opened;</p>
   <p>3. A vigorous campaign is to be waged in behalf of Socialist candidates.</p>
   <p>At the conference, a district committee, composed of one delegate from each state, was elected. This committee, whose first meeting will be held no later than January 1, will complete the arrangements for Socialist [party] activity <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the Middle West.</p>
   <p>It was also resolved to recommend to the Federation a special organizer for the Middle West. The local Workers Institute was endorsed and it was recommended that all the states should follow the example set by Chicago and establish similar institutes.</p>
