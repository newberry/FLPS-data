   <p>The Congregation Ohave Sholom, with its new synagogue on Ashland Blvd. and Polk St., has secured the services of Rabbi Silber as their rabbi for their new synagogue.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Silber comes from Columbus, Ohio, highly recommended and he is to officiate at the coming high holidays. In the few days that he has spent here among his flock, he has already made many good true friends who have learned to love and respect him. This is due to his great personality. The congregation contracted him for a term of three years as their rabbi for their synagogue. Rabbi Silber is not only noted for his great knowledge of the Talmud but he is also a man of great personality, he is an excellent mixer, etc.</p>
   <p>The congregation is establishing a new Sabbath School, where the Hebrew language, Jewish religion, Jewish history, and everything else in Jewish learning will be taught.</p>
