   <p>The "Kehilath Anshe Maariv," a Jewish congregation in Chicago is celebrating its 60th jubilee at its beautiful temple, 33rd street and Indiana avenue. The temple was originally founded as a purely orthodox synagogue, but as the members prospered and took on a new view of things, they gradually accepted the Reform doctrines, until now after 60 years of its existence it is a Reform temple having completely assimilated the Reform interpretations of Judaism.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the Kehilath Anshe Maariv on its 60th anniversary. Knowing the natural development of Judaism, we are certain that when the congregation will celebrate its 100th anniversary, it will again have accepted our established doctrines.</p>
