   <p>Somewhere in France, at this moment, a Jewish young man lies deep in the mud of the trenches [with other American soldiers]. His eyes are focused directly in front of him, at the camp where great numbers of the enemy lie ready to pounce--as a band of barbarians pounce upon those standing in their way--because the Allied soldiers bar the way and prevent the enemy from attacking, and destroying with murderous savagery, the city of the highest development of human civilization--Paris.</p>
   <p>Yes, his eyes look only at the foe, but his thoughts return to his home, to the peaceful environment where his Jewish education had influence over him, where his Jewish soul found its spiritual and material contentment.</p>
   <p>He doesn't want this Jewish spirit to desert him even on the parapets of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Picardy. The supreme sacrifice which he sees being made by the young men who are inspired by just one thing--their fatherland's call--only intensifies his Jewish feelings. He wants you to help bring Judaism to him, by sending over to France Jewish books and journals. For he feels that under the circumstances the written Jewish word is practically the only Jewish spiritual sustenance with which he can provide him.</p>
   <p>Here we relay to you some of his own words:</p>
   <p>"Somewhere in France.</p>
   <p>"Dear editor of the Courier:</p>
   <p>"A year ago, while I was still in the United States, I read in various Jewish periodicals that a committee had been organized to provide Jewish soldiers with books and newspapers in the Jewish language. Regretfully, however, I must write that, although I have been here in France for six months, and in various <span class="page-break">\3</span>parts of the country, I have seen nothing of the sort. I very much regret this situation because the Jewish soldier who has no Jewish books must go to the Young Men's Christian Association. Do you know what you get there? You get books which do not bring the warm glow of your nation and religion to you. The words of Isaiah, 'The righteous man is lost and no one takes it to heart,' come to my mind. Not one of our Jews seems to remember the Jewish soldier 'lost' at the front.</p>
   <p>"Who can feel the words, 'Each person should suffer penitence one day before his death,' better than the Jewish soldier? His heart yearns for his people and he looks to them for help, and yet, deplorable though it is, he cannot get it, and must seek in alien fields. Therefore I appeal to you Jews, to try to do your duty to your brethren. For they are looking to you to supply them with spiritual comfort. You are the only ones who can do anything for them, and I can tell you that when they hear that you have not forgotten them, their joy will be very great.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"I shall end my letter here, worthy editor, and hope that you will print it. I shall try to write you of the results it will bring.</p>
   <p>"I remain your friend forever,</p>
   <p>"Bennie Margolis"</p>
   <p>Jews! When you read this letter, doesn't your heart warm for the "typical Jew" who is personified by this young Jewish soldier? Can this young man ask any less of his brethren--and with such simplicity--than that they should send Jewish books?</p>
   <p>The Midroh (commentaries on the Bible) says that the Jews were redeemed from Egypt because of the merit of the Jewish women. The hard labor and misery suffered by the Hebrews in Egypt were insufficient reason for the Lord to have compassion upon them and liberate them from slavery. However, the kindheartedness and sympathy shown by the Jewish women made the whole cause of Jewish <span class="page-break">\5</span>redemption a worthy one.</p>
   <p>Jewish women and Jewish daughters! Will you remain aloof when it becomes necessary to make the fate of the Jewish soldiers, who lie so completely in the "hands of fate," a little pleasanter and happier?</p>
   <p>You cannot even casually read this simple letter of an unknown Jewish young man without taking upon yourself the obligation of collecting Jewish books and sending them to the American Expeditionary Army in France.</p>
   <p>The government supplies all the physical needs of the soldier. And yet there are people who devote themselves only to supplying the soldier with another shirt or another sweater, when he wants to have as little as possible of that stuff to lug around. But the soul of a Jewish soldier like Bennie Margolis cannot be satisfied with material things. And now there are hundreds of such Jewish soldiers in Pershing's army, and their number in increasing daily.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>For the soldiers in general, philanthropists maintain the Young Men's Christian Association quarters. And many Jews find a way of spending their leisure time there. But you can see for yourself that there is something lacking. And this "something" only the Jew himself can realize.</p>
   <p>Mothers and sisters of the American soldiers, as well as their sweethearts, must answer the call of the Jewish boys. Nothing is as comforting or as encouraging to them as the feeling that their brothers in the United States always hear their call and are always ready to give them immediate aid. The Jewish soldier who comes from the orthodox and nationalistically inclined home, is in a strange land, three thousand miles from home. He certainly feels even more lonely and dejected than do the other Jewish soldiers. Still it is quite natural that Jewish books should bring some atmosphere of the home into the lives of the Jewish boys.</p>
   <p>Jewish books, Jewish magazines and newspapers will afford them long hours of enjoyment, and at the same time they will bring back thoughts of their homes; <span class="page-break">\7</span>they will be regards and greetings from all their friends and loved ones back home.</p>
