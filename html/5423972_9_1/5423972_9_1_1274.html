   <p>As revealed in a report coming from the Mexican border, the number of Jewish soldiers in the army and militia of the United States would surprise even Jews. As far as the Gentiles are concerned, they, who nurture the fancy that Jews are afraid of a gun, will rub their eyes in amazement.</p>
   <p>According to this report, there are as many as 6,000 Jews in the army and navy. Assuming that the regular army consists of 100,000 men and the navy of 30,000, then the Jews constitute about five per cent [of the armed forces]. If in America there are three million Jews, they constitute only three per cent of the total population. This means that Jews furnish a larger number of soldiers than any other nationality.</p>
   <p>Even more surprising is the numerical roll call of Jews in the militia. According <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the report there are eighteen thousand Jews in the National Guard! This sounds exaggerated. But even this exaggeration shows that there must be a great number of Jews in the militia. Now, let anyone come forth and say that the Jews in Russia or elsewhere seek to evade military service because they are afraid of a gun!</p>
