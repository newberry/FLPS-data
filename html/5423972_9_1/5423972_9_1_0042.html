   <p>A month from today, September 14, the twenty-first annual convention of the American Zionist Organization will open here in Chicago. We need make no special mention [of the fact] that this convention will be the most important one ever held by American Zionists. It is the first "peace convention," the first great Zionist meeting since the Paris Peace Conference decided to make Palestine a homeland for the Jews. It is the first convention that must devote all of its energies and intelligence to constructive work in Palestine; it is the first Zionist Convention in America that does not need to apply itself to the problem of organization, because this problem, which takes up so much time, was settled very satisfactorily at the last convention in Pittsburgh, called the "redemption convention". It accepted certain resolutions pertaining to the future problems of the Jewish people in Palestine. Now that all preparations, diplomatic, political, and organizational, have been completed, the present convention can devote itself entirely to [the <span class="page-break">2</span>question of] constructive work in Palestine. These are the expectations of the Zionists of America and the Zionists of the world.</p>
   <p>The Zionist Organization in America has never ceased to assert its policy of democracy. We question whether it is democratic to keep the Zionist public in the dark about the working program of the next convention. There are, without question, many problems, economic, administrative, political, and religious, upon which not all Zionists agree, and which should be discussed. There are problems to consider which must first be studied and understood. Because they know nothing of them, the Zionists may be "railroaded" at the convention, and nothing would remain of Zionist democracy.</p>
   <p>If the optimism of the Zionist leaders and diplomats is justified, then we now approach the greatest moment in the history of the Jews since the destruction of the Jewish homeland in Palestine. We shall soon rebuild our land. Is it not absolutely necessary that the Jewish people, especially the Jews of America, should know the plans for rebuilding the country and the methods to be employed in the reconstruction work? There are many Zionists who are <span class="page-break">3</span>opposed to the Mizrachi and the Poale Zionists: they are neither religiously nor socialistically inclined. In facing concrete problems of reconstruction in Palestine, the Zionists will not depend on the justice of Mr. De Haas, nor on the philanthropy of Mr. Lipsky, nor even on the Judaism of Mr. Brandeis; but they will, themselves, determine all the important problems of national reconstruction.</p>
   <p>In order to reach any decisions, they must first be acquainted with the problems. But if the leaders of the Zionist Organization remain silent now, and do not give the public an opportunity to become acquainted with the principal problems which must be discussed at the convention, then it appears as though these leaders of the Zionist Organization intend to gather twelve hundred delegates, set certain plans before them, and ask them to raise their hands to indicate "yes" or "no". If the Zionist leaders intend to play politics that way, then we must say that, during the course of the last great world catastrophe, they have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.</p>
   <p>Today we can no longer direct the actions of individuals by using dictatorial <span class="page-break">4</span>methods. Today the people themselves mold their own fate, and the leaders only instruct and inform the people and point out the way, if the people fail to see it themselves. The modern leader of the people can no longer be an emperor or a dictator, as in former periods, but is rather a director, a pathfinder. We demand of our leaders that they understand the trend of the times, and take the people into their confidence by informing them of what they plan to do regarding constructive work in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Leaders of the Zionist movement will certainly demand huge sums of money. The people will have to raise this money. But if the great reconstruction problem is "railroaded" at the convention, then the masses cannot be expected to contribute as large a sum of money as may be asked of them. They give money only when they are enthusiastic, when they know that they control these sums and that they are important political factors in the movement. We do not wish to make any predictions, but we are convinced that if the Zionist leaders want to succeed at the convention without giving previous information and instructions, then the convention will be doomed to failure. The people will not respond as generously, and will not fulfill their quota.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Therefore, we ask our leaders: "Why are you silent?"</p>
