   <p>The National Workers Conference of the Western States opens today in Netherwoods Hall, Taylor Street and Marshfield Avenue. The date for the calling of the American-Jewish Congress will be discussed. About three hundred delegates are expected to attend, and it is very possible that unity may be achieved.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pinchas Ruttenberg, author of the proposal for a Jewish Congress, and Mr. H. Ehrenreich, general secretary of the Poale Zion, have come here especially to secure unity. Mr. Ruttenberg stated the position of the nationalist wing in the present conference to a reporter from the Courier.</p>
   <p>"We hope to effect an alliance with the organized Jews of Philadelphia.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>No fundamental difference exists between us, not even on the question of Palestine.</p>
   <p>"The working class must fulfill its mission without further delay. All Jewish workers should support the Congress movement, which is the greatest revolutionary movement in the history of mankind.</p>
   <p>"I believe that the American people feel a responsibility for all the Jews, but American Jews can take the initiative in the movement toward Jewish emancipation. I believe a split is impossible; should it take place the fault will lie with individuals."</p>
