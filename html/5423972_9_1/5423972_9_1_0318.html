   <p>The mass meeting held at Sinai Temple on Monday afternoon for the purpose of organizing the Chicago section of the National Council of Jewish Women, was a success. The purpose of this organization is to awaken our men and women to the need of a better knowledge of our religion. Therefore, the Council will throw its force into an endeavor to remove the dense ignorance in which Judaism has been shrouded. It will perfect a plan of study which will be followed by all its sections. It hopes, too, to make its influence felt in the Sabbath Schools. Another main object of the association is to further, so far as it lies in its power, preventive philanthropy, not by starting new or unnecessary organizations, but by bringing scientific methods and system into the old. The association will also do all in its power to break down existing barriers which tend to keep apart women whose interests are common.</p>
