   <p>Yesterday the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Daily News published editorials on Hughes's demand to the House Committee on immigration that no hatred be aroused in Japan against America by making unlawful the admission of the Japanese into the country, since there exists a gentlemen's agreement between the two nations.</p>
   <p>Senator Johnson wants to abrogate this gentlemen's agreement and, through reforms to present immigration laws, prohibit the Japanese from entering the United States.</p>
   <p>Yesterday the Tribune and, the News discussed this question editorially. The Tribune claims that Johnson is right and America should not regard Japan's sentiment nor fear for Japan's fists. The News on the other hand, <span class="page-break">2</span>says that America should regard Japan's sentiment and, abstain from doing anything that may arouse her anger.</p>
   <p>The Tribune speaks the language of fresh American junkerism; The News that of peaceful American capitalism.</p>
