   <p>In response to a striving call, nearly every member of the Congregation B'nai Sholom attended a special meeting last Sunday afternoon. It was unanimously decided to appoint a committee of ten members, five from the executive board, and five from the general body, whose duty will be to arrange for the selling of the present temple building, situated on the corner of Indiana Ave. and Twenty-sixth St., and to purchase another site for building purposes, located somewhere between Fortieth and Forty-fifth streets, between Wabash Ave. and Cottage Grove Ave.</p>
