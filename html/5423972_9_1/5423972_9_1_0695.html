   <p>Many Jews of Chicago who yesterday, or the day before yesterday, had the honor of being elected presidents of their congregations are happy today, and many others are sad because they were not elected. Those who were not elected are again private individuals and do not bear any more responsibility than do any other groups of individuals. But those persons who yesterday, or the day before yesterday, were elected to be the leaders and representatives of their synagogues, bear not only the responsibility for the their congregations, but also the responsibility for the content and form of Jewish life in Chicago, because the synagogue presidents are the elected representatives of the Orthodox Jews of Chicago. They are the leaders of the community and upon them rests the responsibility for everything that happens in the Jewish life of Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>If the slaughtering is not in order, the leaders of the community are responsible; if various charities in Chicago are not in order, the leaders are responsible. If certain institutions are needed in Chicago, or if certain institutions do not occupy the high place they should occupy, if education is not what it should be, if the Keren Hayisod does not make the progress it should, it is not the fault of individuals but of the leaders of the community, of the elected synagogue presidents, because being presidents of synagogues they are the representatives of Chicago Jewry, and as such they should take care not only of their synagogues, but also of all Jewish interests that have public significance.</p>
   <p>There was a time in Chicago when an orthodox congregation was only a gathering place for those who came to pray, and the synagogue president had only one responsibility--to see that the number of people who came to pray should keep growing. That period in the history of the congregation has been gone for a long time. Today the orthodox congregation is a small community in itself. Every large congregation has its own social institutions, a Talmud Torah, a couple of charity organizations, and quite often has also an organization for <span class="page-break">3</span>the young people, etc. Because in Chicago there is no organized community to manage all Jewish interests, each congregation must, therefore, of necessity, be a small community in itself, as well as an organic part of the community that should be created.</p>
   <p>This puts upon the president a certain responsibility for things that have no direct relationship with the synagogue, within the narrow meaning of that word. Upon the presidents rests a big responsibility and we hope that they will realize their great responsibility and will act in all Jewish affairs not as representatives of individual, separate congregations but as leaders and representatives of all the Orthodox Jews of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Since there is no organized community in Chicago to conduct all the business of Jewish public life, it is necessary that the congregation presidents, who bear the responsibility for all public Jewish affairs anyway, should come in contact with each other. It would be no more than right if our synagogue presidents came together periodically, once in two weeks, to consider and discuss <span class="page-break">4</span>local Jewish and public problems in order to see what they could do to solve those problems.</p>
   <p>It is not proper that synagogue presidents should be called to meetings on every occasion: to relief meetings, Keren Hayisod meetings, meetings to discuss local affairs. The synagogue presidents ought to have their own permanent organization with permanent committees--a committee for relief, a committee for the Keren Hayisod, a committee or committees for local affairs, such as education, dietary laws, etc. Instead of taking orders they should give orders, instead of attending an important meeting and being as useful as a fifth wheel on a carriage, they should be the driving force in every movement, they should set the pace. This would strengthen Orthodox Jewry in every way; it would give a greater moral force to the synagogues and the Jewish affairs in Chicago would be managed better.</p>
   <p>Can anybody tell us why Chicago has nothing like a Community Council, made up of all the synagogues presidents of Chicago? Whenever the talk arises about <span class="page-break">5</span>organizing the community in Chicago, "wise" men at once appear with the argument that it would cost a great deal of money and that there is no source from which to draw this money. But a Union or an Association of synagogue presidents who would meet once a week or once in two weeks to discuss local Jewish or public affairs would not cost anything. They can meet in a relief office, in a Zionist office, or in the vestry of a synagogue and do their work.</p>
   <p>From such an association of synagogue presidents, holding regular meetings, great results can be expected: more order in local public affairs, more co-operation on the part of the synagogues in all Jewish affairs, more order in charity and educational work, more work for the relief and the Keren Hayisod, more moral strength for the Orthodox Jews of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The few social workers in Chicago, who now do all the work voluntarily, cannot forever bear the entire burden alone. They must have the co-operation of the synagogue representatives and this co-operation they can have only when the synagogue presidents are united into a sort of a union or an <span class="page-break">6</span>association and work systematically. When this takes place, then the foundation for a solid Jewish public organization in Chicago will be laid, and the responsibility for all Jewish affairs will be gradually transferred from the few individuals who are now bending beneath the heavy yoke to the public that can bear the burden.</p>
   <p>Now, after the elections, all the synagogue presidents should come together and organize a permanent Community Council. This will be a blessing to Chicago Jewry.</p>
