   <p>On the Northwest Side two Zionist Junior Gates have been organized, Tziere Zion and Young Judea. Children from thirteen to fifteen years of age are admitted into the former and children from eleven to thirteen are admitted into the latter. They will hold meetings every other week in the Ezrath Israel Congregation, Artesian and Potomac Avenues. They will hold their first meeting today at 2 P. M.</p>
   <p>Those parents living on the Northwest Side who want their children to become acquainted with Jewish affairs should send them to the meeting of these clubs, where they will be taught how to become good Jews.</p>
   <p>The Zuraboval Junior Gate has also been active on the Northwest Side for the past three years. Children from fifteen to seventeen years of age belonging to this club are familiar with all Jewish interests and are so active in the Zionist movement that the grown-ups envy them.</p>
