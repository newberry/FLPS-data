   <p>As we are in the "free Diaspora" of America, remote from a European Sabbath atmosphere, your "From the Eve of Sabbath to the Eve of Sabbath" is certainly a delicacy that satiates one for the entire week....</p>
   <p>Your last Sabbath's delicacy was as ever well cooked, but instead of sweet aromas you poured in large drops of poison....</p>
   <p>You write that if you were President Harding you would correct many of his mistakes, and you would expel all undesirable elements from this country, especially all the Reform Rabbis.</p>
   <p>I wish, my dear friend, that you will understand that the Reform Rabbis did not ask me to defend them.</p>
   <p>The sense of justice and my desire that you be tolerant induces me to express my regret and surprise over your acrimonius and ruthless criticism....</p>
   <p>Do all Reform Rabbis deserve to be expelled? Who knows as well as you how many devoted and loyal Zionists there are among the Reform Rabbis? Many of them approached me to ask you to provide their Hebrew schools with Hebrew teachers, where they wish to give the young generation a national Jewish education. You will certainly admit that their influence has kept a large number of our people together, who, otherwise, would have been entirely lost to us, and that for the last few years the Jewish spark has been aglow in the ranks of Reform Judaism.</p>
   <p>We are now undergoing the most horrible and most tragic moment in our history.</p>
   
   <p>It is, therefore, necessary that in all the ranks and strata among our brethern there should prevail a friendly spirit. Such remarks from your pen, which should have the greatest recognition and value, do more harm than good, and your great influence is being weakened there, where it would bring beneficial results to our suffering people.</p>
   <p>Hoping that my few words will be accepted by you, with the same sincerity as they are sent,</p>
   <p>I remain yours,</p>
   <p>S. B. Komaiko.</p>
   <p>(We hereby wish to remark, that if among the four hundred Reform Rabbis in America there are ten who are opposed to vulgar assimilation and are nationalistically inclined, then they are not consistent Reform Rabbis. The exception always proves that the rule is sound. Reform Judaism adheres to the standpoint of apostacy, and is responsible for the moral and religious ruin of a certain portion of American Jewry. American Reform Judaism is the greatest falsification of Jewish history, and of the Jewish view of life.--Editor [of Courier]).</p>
