   <p>A Jewish youth succeeded in getting an appointment to West Point. His name was Michael Lurie. The future officers of the American Army, however, did not relish the idea of having a Jew among them. They gave young Lurie no rest. Finally, at the end of a year, he left West Point, but he had blazed the trail for other Jews to follow him into the academy, and with more success.</p>
   <p>As soon as war was declared against Spain, Lurie enlisted as a non-commissioned officer, and was sent to the Phillipine Islands. He distinguished himself in service and was promoted to the rank of Captain. At the conclusion of the war, he remained in the Islands, and helped to organize a school system there. Several years later, he settled in Chicago, his native city. When the United States entered the World War, Lurie reenlisted; and returned to Chicago this time, with the rank of Major.</p>
