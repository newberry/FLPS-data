   <p>The Russian [Jewish] Synagogue in Chicago has set an example for other synagogues in Chicago, with regard to their duty to the [Hebrew] Theological College. If all the other synagogues would follow the example of the Russian Synagogue, the directors of this new institution [Theological College] would have no financial worries and would be able to concentrate all their attention upon the spiritual development of the institution.</p>
   <p>I imagine that the Jewish lodges would also do something for the Theological College by way of annual contributions, if we approached them and spoke to them about this matter.</p>

   <p>Poland has forty thousand subscribers to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. America could have one hundred thousand. It is much harder for a Jew in Poland to give a portion of his earnings to Palestine than it is for an American Jew, because it's easier to make a living in America than in Poland.</p>
   <p>If the American Jews had the Polish Jews' feeling for Zionism, or if the Polish Jews had the money of the American Jews, then Zionism would not need to beg and everything would be all right. The American Jews have small hearts and the Polish Jews small pockets. That is why we have difficulties.</p>
