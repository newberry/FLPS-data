   <p>The decision of Rabbi Judah Leb Gordon regarding the Talmud Torahs and the United Jewish Charities has caused great excitement among all the community workers in the city. The possible consequences of this decision are so great that many community workers are now asking themselves: What will happen now? The rabbis of the city also find themselves in a great quandary. On the one hand, they participated in the agreement with the United Jewish Charities. On the other hand, they cannot oppose the authority of Rabbi Gordon.</p>
   <p>We learn that Mr. Leizerowich, the president of the Moses Montefiore Talmud Torah is thinking of resigning because he cannot ignore the decision, and if he accepts it, he sees no possible way of keeping up the Talmud Torah because the budget of the Talmud Torah is about two thousand dollars a month, to which the Charities contribute thirteen hundred dollars a month. The members of the committee of five, who were elected last Tuesday, have not yet decided <span class="page-break">2</span>what to do. We know of one member of the committee who is resolved to go on with the work as if nothing had happened. We have good reason to believe that three members of the committee of five will go on with the work.</p>
   <p>While these lines are being written, the educational council is holding a meeting at the Hebrew Theological College, trying to find an answer to the difficult question: now what? We expect that by Monday, the situation created by Rabbi Gordon's decision will be somewhat clarified.</p>
