   <p>Chicago is recognized throughout the world as a religious Jewish city. In proportion [to its population], Chicago has more synagogues than any other Jewish city in America; Chicago has more rabbis than any other Jewish city in America; Chicago gives more charity than any other Jewish city in America; Chicago gives more for Zionism than any other Jewish city in America. Chicago Jews are more devout than those in any other Jewish city in America; Chicago Jews are more studious than those in any other Jewish city in America. Chicago has more religious organizations than any other Jewish city in America--in short, Chicago is the Jerusalem of America. But in this Jerusalem of America, there is more trefa food eaten than in any other Jewish city in America. The Shechitah (slaughtering of animals in accordance with dietary laws) in this city does not lie in the hands of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the rabbis where it should lie, but in the hands of a "walking delegate" of a union, and the sale of kosher meat is controlled by the union, instead of by the Chicago rabbis.</p>
   <p>In no other city in America does the trade with hechscherim (religious sanctions) blossom as in Chicago; in no other city does the hespeidim (funeral orations) industry blossom as it does in Chicago, and in no other city does such chaos prevail in every phase of Jewish life as exists in Chicago. In thousands of religious Jewish homes in Chicago, trefa meat and trefa bread are eaten--bread baked with lard or some other trefa ingredient--and Chicago is a pious city, a city of God-fearing Jews. It is the Jerusalem of America!</p>
   <p>This is no secret. Everybody knows it; no one speaks of it because no one feels strongly enough to oppose the element which is responsible for this <span class="page-break">\3</span>
<span class="gap">[gap]</span>
<span class="page-break">\4</span>spend about one hundred thousand dollars a year for the maintenance of the rabbis and the rabbinate, can compel them to perform their duties. After all, the rabbinical politicians are not the heads of Jewish affairs in Chicago; the community leaders are laymen. The highest authority in the city is the will of the community--not the will of Ephraim Epstein.</p>
   <p>We have proposed constructive work, and an end to quarrels. When we noticed the chaos that prevailed here in the city, we proposed three things: a kehilah, a beth din [Jewish court of law], and a board of education. We always knew who was responsible for the chaos. The main culprit is one individual who does not want order in the community under any circumstances because if there were order and discipline, he would not be able to [continue to] fish in muddy waters. That person is Rabbi Epstein of Congregation Anshe Kneseth Israel. We, however, were of the opinion that when the constructive work began, the reactionary forces would disappear. We admit that we were wrong. These reactionary forces will reign in Chicago as long <span class="page-break">\5</span>as the laymen are either too good-natured or else continue to have a false--entirely false--conception of the respect due the Torah. "Where there is blasphemy, no honor is conferred upon the rabbi." A nonkosher Chicago is certainly a blasphemy; nothing can be constructed, nothing can be achieved.</p>
   <p>The reactionary forces who are the cause of all our community troubles and who are responsible for the chaos in Chicago--who are alone responsible for it--for the fact that Chicago is a trefa city, can be removed without a blasphemy of the Torah and without a humiliation of the rabbinate. They can be removed only through the moral courage and the Jewish courage of the laymen.</p>
   <p>The Orthodox Jews of Chicago, who give one hundred thousand dollars a year to the rabbis and the rabbinate, have a right to call them in and say to them: "Gentlemen, your salaries are paid not so that you can meddle in <span class="page-break">\6</span>politics, or misuse your pulpit for political speeches, for profanities, for calumny, and lies in general; not so that you can run to meetings, or hold daily conferences concerning your rabbinical politics; not so that you can sell funeral orations for a five-dollar bill; your salaries are paid so that you can perform your rabbinical duties, which are: one, study; two, interpret the Talmud; three, supervise kashruth and the Jewish board of education; four, direct Jewish affairs of a religious nature. We do not give you a hundred thousand dollars a year so that you can control the city and meddle in all its affairs; we want you to be genuine rabbis. You must either give up your politics, your plots to control and rule the city for your personal gain, or you must give up the rabbinate. A rabbi must be a rabbi; whenever a rabbi is not a rabbi, but is instead a politician, he alone is responsible for the blasphemy of the Torah and the desecration of God's name. Rabbis have always been humble and righteous men, with clean tongues and pure hearts. Rabbis have never been politicians, and that is why Judaism has continued to exist. Chicago--the pious and typically Jewish <span class="page-break">\7</span>city--has become a trefa city because the Chicago rabbinate is poisoned with politics. Judiasm in Chicago is on the verge of bankruptcy."</p>
   <p>When the Chicago Jewish laymen speak clearly and sharply to those rabbis who have changed rabbinism into politics, then we shall have clarity. Either the politican-rabbis will remember their rabbinical dignity and become real rabbis--and then everything will be all right--or else politics is dearer to them than their rabbinism, and then they should discard rabbinism entirely and become professional politicians--and that will be all right too. But at any rate we shall know where we are--and then we will be able to begin constructive work.</p>
