   <p>Delegates of all the workers in the American meat-packing industry, will meet on August 19, in Kansas City, at the conference called by their International, to consider the problem of a wage increase.</p>
   <p>Eighty thousand Chicago workers, through their Stock Yards Labor Council, recently asked for a wage increase of from twenty-five to fifty per cent. Federal Judge Samuel Alschuler, the official arbitrator in the meat-packing industry, and the employers themselves are now considering the problem. Whatever the result may be, the Kansas City Conference is certainly a significant event in the lives of the four hundred thousand meat workers of the country.</p>
   <p>The delegates must bring with them the information and material which will be needed for the proceedings of the conference, and, naturally, the workers will <span class="page-break">2</span>have the responsibility of seeing that they are provided with this information. The Jewish Stock-Yards workers, who have already chosen their delegates to the conference, must take an active interest in this conference, and must help their delegates to get the necessary information concerning present conditions in the industry, particularly, concerning wages.</p>
