   <p>effect has been created throughout the building by the adoption of the Moorish style of architecture. From the main doors to the arched ceiling, in the form of decoration stained glass-work, and in every department, this oriental and attractive style has been introduced. The facade contains, besides the main entrance, and several small windows, one large circular window of stained glass in star-shaped design. The graceful arched ceiling is finely finished, and decorated in pale-blue tints, with small gold figures. The fronts of the gallery, which extend around three sides of the auditorium, have been finished with the latest style of the raised-figure composition decorations, touched up with harmonizing shades of blue, red and bronze. This is very rich. The large windows on each side are filled with stained glass. The pews are fine, the ark superbly finished, and so is the place for the choir. The pulpit of cherry is one of the most elaborate pieces of work of its kind in the city, and was presented to the congregation by the principal contractor of the new building.</p>
