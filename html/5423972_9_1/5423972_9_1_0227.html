   <p>A conference was called by the district organization committee of the Workmen's Circle, Sunday, January 30th, to give a report of its activities and to hear a report from the National Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>Friend Witt, chairman of the district organization committee, opened the meeting.</p>
   <p>Friend Mazur of Branch 515 was elected chairman, and friend I.S. Diamond of Branch 376 was elected Secretary.</p>
   <p>After reading the credentials it was revealed that 32 branches were represented by 64 delegates and the district organization committee was represented by 3 delegates.</p>
   <p>The following report of 3 months' activities of this district organization committee, was given by friend L. Benenson, the Secretary:</p>
   <p>Our activities to organize new branches were not successful, due to the tailor strike, hard times in general, and the question of fraternal rates, as we did not know what the exact dues would be.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We put in a good deal of time in strengthening the existing branches.</p>
   <p>The financial report of the finance committee was read and approved.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades demanded of the City Central not to interfere with arguments among Unions, on the ground that the City Central Committee has appointed a committee to investigate the grievances of the independent musicians union against the United Hebrew Trades and the A. F. of L. After a lengthy debate their demand was granted and the investigating committee was released.</p>
   <p>The City Central Committee approved the recommendation of the educational committee, to hire Dr. Jitlowski to deliver 9 lectures. The first 5 lectures will be arranged, together with the I. L. Peretz branch. Members of the W.C., by presenting their membership book will be admitted for 10 cents. It is hoped that the W.C. members will take advantage of this opportunity and come to hear the best lecturer in the ranks of the radical movement. The meeting was then adjourned, the members filled with inspiration. It was a pleasure to see that all the misunderstandings and ill-feelings have disappeared and harmony once more exists among the members of the City Central Committee.</p>
   <p>The branches were urged to demand reports from their delegates.</p>
