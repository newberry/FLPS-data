   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Class A membership has been abolished and all present Class A members must become seat owners to retain their membership. Class A membership consisted of those who have been paying $40.00 a year without owning a pew; but did not include special members, meaning thereby the sons and sons-in-law of regular members.</p>
