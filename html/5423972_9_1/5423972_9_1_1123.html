   <p>The Emanuel Congregation on the North Side is yet wavering between two minhagim (rituals). During the year they have Minhag America, and for the holidays they use the old Minhag Ashkenas. This causes a great deal of dissatisfaction among the members. One Minhag is enough for any congregation.</p>
