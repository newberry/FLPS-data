   <p>The Chicago Sinai Congregation of which Dr. Emil G. Hirsch is the Dalai Lama, has a good publicity service. It never fails to inform the press of the subject of the rabbi's forthcoming Sunday sermon. I have observed carefully the subjects of his sermons, and I have begun to realize that they are lectures of a well-known type--book reviews--which have nothing to do with Judaism.</p>
   <p>Sometimes the themes of the rabbi's sermons are purely Christian, sometimes they have a general character and could be delivered in lecture halls, vaudeville houses, free churches. To deliver sermons like these, no congregations are needed and no religious services are necessary.</p>
   <p>Very rarely does the rabbi speak on Jewish subjects, and he is quite <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>right from his point of view. Judaism to him is a prosaic thing; it is everything except that which is actually Jewish. When he has such an all-embracing Jewish program, he can speak on anything. When a bold individual calls attention to this all-embracing program of radical Reform Judaism, which turns Judaism into a cheap vaudeville show, he is told: "The Reform Jews are also Jews, and we have no right to interfere in their internal affairs"--as if there could be two kinds of Judaism in this world.</p>
