   <p>Two congregations will rejoice this Sunday--the First Hungarian Congregation and the North Shore Congregation, that have united into one congregation under the spiritual leadership of Dr. Sonderling. At one o'clock on Sunday, the ceremony of departure from the Marshfield Avenue synagogue of the First Hungarian Congregation will take place, and at four o'clock, the entrance ceremony of the North Shore synagogue on Kenmore Avenue will take place.</p>
   <p>Both congregations will rejoice because the "match" won favor in the eyes of both. The tendency of merging small synagogues into one large synagogue is a healthy tendency. One large synagogue can accomplish much more in the field of Jewish life than three little ones. The merger of the two above-mentioned synagogues is a welcome event in the life of the Jewish community of Chicago. The Jewish <span class="page-break">2</span>community leaders of Chicago will how watch very closely the further development of this new congregation and the activity of its rabbi, Dr. Sonderling. We will know in a few months whether a new type of a Conservative synagogue has come into being as a result of the merger of the two congregations and of the activity of Dr. Sonderling.</p>
