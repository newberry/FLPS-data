   <p>The Jewish Courier learned from federal authorities that first citizenship papers are now available to Jews who came from Austria-Hungary, but each applicant for the first papers must bring with him two witnesses who are American citizens.</p>
   <p>The first papers may be applied for at the following places: Naturalization Department, Post Office Building, Superior Court Clerk, Circuit Court Clerk.</p>
   <p>The last two places are located in the County Building, Clark and Washington Streets.</p>
   <p>Thus, right now, the Austrian Jews, who are in business, or are engaged in peddling and who are in danger of losing their licenses or permits on the first of May, may apply for their first papers at the three places mentioned above.</p>

   <p>As quickly as he obtains his first papers, he can immediately go to the City Collector, room 107, City Hall and get a license. But in order to obtain a license, each applicant must fill out an affidavit. A copy of the affidavit blank can be obtained from the City Collector, and then after all questions are answered, it is necessary to take an oath before a notary public.</p>
   <p>In the affidavit the following questions are asked to which concrete answers must be given:</p>
   <p>Where were you born? Are you a citizen, if not, have you your first papers? If you have your first or second papers, give the day, month and year when you obtained them.</p>
