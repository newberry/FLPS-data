   <p>The problem of immigration looms as a nightmare before the eyes of tens of thousands of Jews in America. The fear that Congress may halt it, worries many of us.</p>
   <p>As long as the war lasted, there was no time to think of it. The human mind recognizes an impossibility, adjusts itself readily, and stops questioning. During the War there came to us the heart-rending cries of our starving, desperate brothers. But more than charity we could not give them. To bring them here, and make a home for them in America was entirely impossible at the time.</p>
   <p>But now Peace has been signed among the Nations of the world. The seas once more are open. It is to be expected that great masses of our weary brothers who during the years of terror looked to America as their refuge, will now exert every effort to flee from a destroyed Europe. At a distance America appears to them as the land of security and bread. Therefore, they will emigrate naturally to America.</p>
   <p>The United States Congress desires to pass, after twenty years of formulation, a law which limits immigration. It was on the verge of being passed many times, but in every instance, as though by a miracle, it failed. This last time it certainly would have become a law, if war had not been declared.</p>
   <p>War, at any rate, decreased immigration and made such a limiting measure unnecessary.</p>
   <p>Congress, or rather those members of Congress who desire to lock the doors of America against immigration, have directed their attention to the desperate, weary, restless masses of Europe, and warn America against the influx of immigrants. It is said that if Congress does not do something immediately to keep this stream out of America, it will continue to come and demoralize our national life, jeopardize our wage standard, bring unemployment, unrest, and Bolshevism.</p>
   <p>Bolshevism, when mentioned to members of Congress, produces a cessation of reason, justice, or pity--the perils of Bolshevism demand extreme caution.</p>
   <p>Already we hear rumors that existing immigration laws are not sufficient safeguard. Newer and stricter laws are necessary. This [policy] comes from the National Committee established for the purpose of "constructive immigration," which means naturally, limited immigration.</p>
   <p>It has been proposed that labor immigration be halted, at least for two years, after which time only a certain percentage may enter, measured according to the population of that national group already in America.</p>
   <p>It is also proposed to tighten American citizenship requirements. New applicants must be more literate, more intelligent than previously.</p>
   
   <p>In short, we may say this of the tendencies of American [policy in regard to] immigration: America is resolved to admit only immigrants who are the best, [that is] the cream of every land, and not the humble and the poor.</p>
   <p>Judging from present American opinion regarding foreigners, especially those of Eastern Europe, it is not unrealistic to expect that such limitations as are here presented may perhaps be adopted.</p>
   <p>If during the War we realized the desolation of our millions of brothers across the sea, and could, at most, aid them only with charity, then that desolation which must now ensue, will certainly be laden with even greater bitterness and heartache than heretofore. During the War we salved our conscience with, "this is War, the whole world suffers, all nations bleed." But the time has come for rebuilding all that was ruined. The debris will be cleared away. Nations will heal their wounds and begin anew. War steeled man's soul through suffering. Since Jews are everywhere the weakest link in the political chain, the enemy breaks through them first. They have no home, in the true sense, and have no place to settle. The stand of America against immigration hits them, therefore, more than other nations. All others desiring to immigrate have a homeland; the Jew alone has none.</p>
   <p>At this moment Palestine, the Jewish Homeland in the making, comes to the fore as a bright star of hope. Unfortunately we cannot say, at this moment, that Palestine can serve the great Jewish masses as America could. Unfortunately, it will take many years before Palestine will be in a position to accept the great masses, to give them work and sustenance. Yet it was necessary to begin somehow to provide a home for our wandering nation, and that beginning has already been made.</p>
   <p>We can already see, with the eyes of the spirit, the time when Palestine will be settled by at least a Million Jews, who as a nucleus will serve many great Jewish communities in Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>The center of Judaism will then be closer to its birthplace, and the Jew will no longer be homeless.</p>
   <p>In the moment of our greatest desolation, let this be our greatest consolation.</p>
