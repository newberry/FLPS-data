   <p>A new, lively, energetic project has been started in one of the Workers Circle's largest schools on the Northwest side. This school is conducted by the Socialist Institute, Le Moyne Street. This new project consists of the establishment of children clubs and the introduction of a series of contests.</p>
   <p>On the program of the Workers Circle's schools, from their inception, much pressure was applied to the children clubs.</p>
   <p>First, the children clubs are the best and perhaps the only means with which to develop within the child a sense for social and common work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Second, the club is the best place for the child to show his natural inclinations and abilities, and develop his mental character, his independence, and all that he is to do, and does do.</p>
   <p>The management of the clubs, however, encounters many technical difficulties, especially when the time is short, for the schools are open every day in the week, with classes until 8 P. M.</p>
   <p>To take an evening off from school is something they do not wish to do. But where there is a will, there is a way. The management and the teachers have gotten together, and so far have founded two important clubs: one, the Young Builders Club, which consists of <span class="page-break">3</span>children of higher education, who for certain reasons had to leave public school. This club has drawn a number of high school students, who enrolled in the Workers Circle's school. The second, the Children Circle club, consists of only small children from 7 to 9 years of age.</p>
   <p>The love and inspiration of the children for their clubs is so great that the slightest sign of misbehavior, which means expulsion, is immediately rectified.</p>
   <p>The training value of the club cannot be overestimated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>An example of such a characteristic fact: A seven year old boy of the Children's Circle, who had spent his two cents for candies instead of paying his dues, made the entire membership of forty-five children demand the child's expulsion, and had it not been for the intercession of the supervisor, the child would have been expelled. He was compelled to make all sorts of promises, promising to pay four cents at the next meeting, and never again commit such a crime.</p>
   <p>Now another fact: Some time ago the Daily Forward came out in large red letters, on the occasion of the pardon and freeing of Debs. The executive happened to bring a Forward to the school, and the children, after reading the news of Debs' pardon, had some secret arguments <span class="page-break">5</span>in reference to this news, which finally resulted into a secret meeting. The result of the meeting was that they hung large photographs of Mr. Debs, decorated with red ribbons and flowers, on the wall of the main hall. At the regular meeting held two days later at their own initiative, they presented a play the features of which were Debs'arrest, conviction, and freedom.</p>
   <p>At every meeting, the children carry out their own plans and programs of plays, songs, recitations, and debates. Every child is eager to bring out his best.</p>
   <p>To what extent the sentiment of solidarity is being developed among the children through the clubs, is adequately illustrated by the <span class="page-break">6</span>following examples:</p>
   <p>Last Friday the children of the Circle's school elected their officers for the coming three months. Two of them were candidates. The one who was elected came running to the director, begging and pleading that his friend, his opponent, should serve as his substitute every other week, that is, that the time for which he was elected be divided between the two.</p>
   <p>Not long ago, the club of the older children, the Young Builders, on their own initiative and with hardly any outside assistance, carried through a beautiful literary and musical program which was <span class="page-break">7</span>witnessed by more than four hundred children and many adults. Now they plan to enlarge the school library with the most modern literature for children.</p>
   <p>At their next meeting, a general debate is to take place, the subject of which will be the Constitution: whether or not it is constitutional to take away the constitutionally guaranteed citizen rights of a person who declares himself for free speech and against war, as in the case of Mr. Debs. Aside from that, the clubs have special committees to look after the hygiene of the children, seeing to it that they wash their faces and hands. There are also other committees whose duty is to look after the members in case of sickness and to investigate why some of them stay away from school for any length of time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Two contests have been going on in the school for some time. One on writing compositions and the other on Jewish riddles. These contests are being carried on with unheard of success. The children are writing compositions on various subjects. They especially take a great deal of interest in writing about worker's children. A part of their compositions consists of letters and greetings to Mr. Debs, on his freedom.</p>
   <p>All the compositions are submitted to a committee of judges, and the best compositions carry off prizes.</p>
   <p>According to the answers of the children to the Jewish folks-riddles, you can readily see what this school can and will accomplish. For <span class="page-break">9</span>example, some one asked one of the boys a riddle; viz., Who is poor himself but makes others rich? "A worker," nearly all answered. Another riddle was asked: Whose death was mourned by all nations of the world? "Karl Marks," was the immediate answer.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we can frankly state that the Northwest Side school of the Workers Circle for children clubs will be a great success in the near future.</p>
