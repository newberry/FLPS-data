   <p>The Inter-High Jewish Educational League came into being about a year ago upon the initiative of Dr. A. M. Dushkin, the executive director of the Jewish Education Committee.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the league is to rekindle in the hearts of the large number of Jewish high school boys and girls the flame of Judaism and to make them aware of their duty as Jews.</p>
   <p>The league has at present three branches, at Marshall, Medill, and Tuley High Schools. It is the aims of the leaders of this movement to extend its work to other high schools where Jewish pupils are to be found in large numbers.</p>
   <p>The Inter-High Jewish Educational League is a branch of the Jewish Education Committee of the Chicago Charities.</p>
