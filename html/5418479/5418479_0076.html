   <p>A small town American lawyer named Edwin Hawes, Jr., called our Chicago vice-consul by long distance telephone, eighty miles from here, pledging a contribution of $50.00, which he explained definitely was for our government.</p>
   <p>Consul Wang received the check and the next day it was forwarded to the New York branch of the Bank of China.</p>
   <p>Such a deed is certainly worthy of respect.</p>
