   <p>The power of a nation depends upon the qualification of its citizens; the qualification of a citizen depends upon the education of the individual; and education is indeed, the most influential factor in the existence of a nation.</p>
   <p>Education may well be divided into two distinctive classes, they are school education and home education. The latter is generally termed "home-training" and is fundamentally most important as it deals with the most plastic years of a human being. In fact, home-training is so important that it guides and sometimes determines our future. Upon the shoulders of our parents, then, rests the vital responsibility of home-training.</p>
   <p>Parents, who are ready to undertake the difficult task of raising children, should first of all, realize that their children are born innocent, and they must see to it that their innocence is not jeopardized by ignorance.</p>

   <p>The innocent children are born with the instinct of imitation and learn through their senses of hearing and seeing. They know not right from wrong, nor wrong from right. Whatever they see, they do; whatever they hear, they say. It is, therefore, important that good parents watch their own conversation and actions. If the parents, unfortunately, should possess some undesirable habits, they should refrain from indulging in them in the presence of their alert children, because rarely do the children have habits which they have not acquired from their parents. Fortunate indeed are parents, to have the privilege to play such an important role in the life of the next generation! But how delicate, how important, and how difficult, is their task! Unfortunately because parents are unable to Perform such a task, we have our wide national illiteracy.</p>
   <p>Besides home-training then, is the equally important school education, We, undoubtedly, know that the responsibility rests with the teachers and instructors <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>The teachers' responsibility should not be a mere scholastic achievenemt but should rather be the character formation of the students. We regret to admit again that the lack of a nation-wide educational system and the ignorance on the part of our teachers as to their real duty is the second of the two predominant factors in our national illiteracy.</p>
   <p>Our corruptive educational system of the Chin Dynasty need no further expression of opinions as we all are more or less acquainted with it. But the so-called modern educational system of today is what we are concerned with. It is a pity that a good percentage of our modern teachers have neglected their fundamental duty of character building. In fact, teachers who live the lives of play-boys have become numerous. And there are teachers who are so involved in politics that they can practically call their schools political centers. No doubt, these vices and hobbies are but personal characteristics, but they are of such an import to the future of the students that we who are interested in our children's welfare must take immediate action.</p>

   <p>The responsibility of the parents in the homes and of the teachers in the schools is clear to us. No doubt, we are away from our homeland but if we perform our duties here in our Chicago Chinese community efficiently we shall soon find our children playing an important part in the development of our national life.</p>
   <p>Parents who are interested in our national welfare should pay immediate attention to the home-training of their children. And to the teachers may we suggest that they should refrain from political activities and be molders of character as well as teachers of learning. With the fullest cooperation of all concerned, we are sure, our country will soon be one of the strongest in the world.</p>
