   <p>We recall about a year ago when the Chinese Student Association began soliciting for funds in promoting the publication of the Student Association Monthly.</p>
   <p>As a result of our fellow countrymen's (merchants) interest in the student organization they have contributed generously and thus materializing the dream of the student body - a Student Monthly.</p>
   <p>The Student Association in expressing their gratitudes for the generosity of the contributors, has published a complete list of the contributors in the first issue.</p>
   <p>Our fellow merchants have made it possible in materializing the only means of uniting the spirit and ideals of our students scattered throughout North America. But we must remember too, that the existence of the publication depends also upon your continual support by subscribing to it which we believe is $2:00 per year.</p>

   <p>Financially it is too meager to be termed as a business proposition and it is assured that your cooperation will be fully rewarded in the form of literary contributions by the students.</p>
