   <p>The Chicago Chinamen are making great preparations for the Chinese New Year, which comes next Monday. All of them are laying in supplies of good things, and paper signs hang in the windows to notify passing Chinamen of the delicacies for sale within. "We call our New Year's day the Sun Down", said cigarmaker San Moy, 319 Clark Street, who is one of the boss Chinamen of Chicago. "It is the sixteenth of the present dynasty-that's the way we count it, you know. We will celebrate it in the usual way, with feasts and religious exercises. We don't have so much fun here as they do in other towns where they are allowed to shoot off firecrackers in the streets. The authorities won't let us go that far. If we had a license we would go ahead and spend every cent we have made in a year".</p>
