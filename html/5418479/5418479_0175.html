   <p>The Chinese delegate at the League of Nations Conference, Dr. Woo Shih, was in Chicago yesterday on his way back to China. He came directly from the Harvard University, where he was conferred the honorary degree of Ph. D.</p>
   <p>While in Chicago, Dr. Woo gave a public address in an American auditorium on "The Chinese of Today."</p>
   <p>Dr. Woo stated that "the present unsettled condition in the world may be traced back to the Japanese invasion of China in 1931. The surprising progress made by China during the past five years is also due to the Japanese barbarism. Chinese are becoming to realize if we ever want to get ahead, we must help ourselves, and if we wish to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>maintain the China Republic, we must fight for its existence ourselves."</p>
   <p>"Dr. Woo emphasized that the Chinese people as a whole are people-like and they are noted for their patience, but if we were compelled to fight, then fight will we to the hitter end. We will fight, however, only when there is no alternative."</p>
   <p>"Japan's invasion of our land may be called as the beginning of another world war. Eventually America, Britain and Russia will fall into the war pool. No doubt, citizens of all these countries will oppose such a participation, but because of the world-wide economic and other relationships of one country and another, the world will be forced to fight. Each will fight for self-defence and self-preservation.</p>

   <p>"In spite of our hatred of the Japanese invasion, we must admit that their invasion was a most welcome one, because it brought us unity, a feat which heretofore failed by all Chinese leaders."</p>
   <p>"Since the Japanese invasion our country is not only united, but it has progressed miraculously in transportation, communication, compulsory education, and the reducing of taxes on more than 5200 items to lighten the people's burden. Indeed, China is building a country upon the invasion of Japan.	</p>
