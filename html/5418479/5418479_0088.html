   <p>November 3rd, is the American presidential election day, a day in which all American citizens will enjoy and exercise their individual rights as citizens. Such privileges and rights are, however, not valid unless voters are registered.</p>
   <p>In behalf of all members of this Association and fellow countrymen who are citizens of this country, this Association is pleading for participation of all eligible voters.</p>
   <p>Do not forfeit your rights and privileges of a citizen, but show to the Westerners that we are just as good and as active if not more so than they.</p>
   <p>The dead line for registration is October 6th. You should register at the nearest office to your residence. All information will be available at this Association to all those who are not familiar with the registration and voting procedures.</p>
