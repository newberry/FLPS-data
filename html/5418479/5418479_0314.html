   <p>The unity of our country is obivous since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. Chinese abroad have organized societies such as this one to maintain unity amongst ourselves. And to put forth an united effort in supporting the National Government. Our responsibility as a citizen of the Republic of China is, then, to stop immediately all our economic relationships with our enemy. Boycott Japanese goods is, of course, our main weapon. But in addition to that, we have decided, beginning today all Chinese salesmen and stores must not sell any merchandise to the Japanese.</p>
   <p>There is only one exception in this case. That is our restaurants are obliged to accommodate the Japanese because of the American law. And finally, no Chinese should seek employment from a Japanese restaurant or store. All these will signify our desire for a united effort in our fight against our enemy - Japan.</p>
   
   <p>If anyone should violate the designated rules in trading with, or working for, our enemy, he is, of course, a traitor who cuts himself off of the national government intentionally. And, no doubt, we all know how a traitor should be dealt with.</p>
   <p>We hope, therefore, all of you will maintain self-respect.</p>
