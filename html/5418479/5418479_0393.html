   <p>It was during an informal tea reception in the garden of the Hwang-Poo Military Academy campus when General Chiang commenced to express his deep concern in education. He spoke of hope and future in education. He emphasized that a revolutionized political future and society depends solely upon systemized education. Education makes a citizen and educated citizens are ever qualified for important duties in society and its national government.</p>
   <p>During his recent tour of China, General Chiang has spoken to all the leading educators in every province (state) in China pleading for an improved educational system whereby more youths may obtain training which is absolutely essential to a good citizen. Indeed, it takes a good citizen to serve society and humanity. If our citizens are more concerned with their responsibilities, a bright future and satisfactory consequences will be apparent.</p>

   <p>General Chiang then spoke of Canton. Whether it is political, economic or educational revolution he hopes that Canton or the State of Kwantung will be a model State in China. He pleaded earnestly, therefore, that all Cantonese educators will endeavor to promote a wholesome educational system, so that the youths may grow with a wholesome education as their foundation.</p>
   <p>"A wholesome education" emphasized General Chiang, "consists of moral, intellectual, physical and social trainings. Every educator and teacher must feel responsible for the growth of this four-fold training in their students."</p>
   <p>"In the process of such a four-fold training, discipline is very essential." By this, General Chiang stressed "that all students must be taught the disciplinary life - they must be taught to realize that there is a limit, beyond which there is ill - consequence thus gradually building in them the habit of lawfulness and the ever - increasing spirit of patriotism.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>If a teacher is successful in bringing his student up to this stage then the way is paved for the building of a new generation with proper individual qualification and integrity - a foundation which is necessary to a ranking nation."</p>
   <p>"But before an educator is able to bring up his students systematically and successfully he must first discipline himself - his thoughts, words, actions and habits. He must visualize the indispensible quality that makes a good citizen. He must be a model to his students." To prove how extremely importantoa teacher is to a nation, Ceneral Chiang stated, "good educators produce good citizens; good citizens produce good society and government - eventually a modern strong nation."</p>

   <p>So then, the future of our country is really in the hands of our teachers and students. All of us - fellow countrymen - who are abroad have no doubt contributed financially to some or all of our national activities - mostly political in nature, because we feel that this is the only means with which to express the spirit of patriotism and duty. But little do we realize that the far more effective way to serve our country is to center our attention upon our children's educational trainings - in bringing up the future pillars of our national government. Let us all bear in mind our great leader General Chiang's speech and shall we not be more concerned with all our educational activities here in the Chicago community?</p>
