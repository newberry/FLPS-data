   <p>We know that the Chinese Y. M. C. A. has really been the only relief station in Chinatown for the past four years. Records show that more than one thousand persons (both Americans and Chinese) are receiving weekly aid from this station.</p>
   <p>It has come to our attention that the Y. M. C. A. is in need of clothing for the poor. We hope that all you generous fellow countrymen realize that your surplus of old clothes can be used by the needy. We are hoping, therefore, that as many as possible will respond to this call.</p>
   <p>The givers may bring their clothing to the Y. M. C. A. personally or notify the same to call for them.</p>
   <p>Let us remember that givers always receive abundantly.</p>
