   <p>Date - October 11, 1937 (Monday) 1 P. M.</p>
   <p>Place - Chicago Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association.</p>
   <p>The Chinese restaurateurs are facing bankruptcy due to the increasing cost of merchandise, rent and other incidentals.</p>
   <p>The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association has taken the initiative in organizing a Chinese restaurateurs' union which is absolutely necessary for the protection of the interest of the restaurateurs' enterprises.</p>
   <p>The first restaurateurs' meeting was called September 19th, at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association Auditorium.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Few were present, in fact there were not enough present to represent all the Chicago Chinese restaurateurs. No action was taken at that meeting, except that a temporary committee of eleven was elected, which was to be responsible for the arrangment of the second mass meeting of the restaurateurs.</p>
   <p>The objectives of this meeting are the organization of a Chinese restaurateurs' union, to raise the prices, and to redecorate the interiors of the Chinese restaurants.</p>
   <p>Due to organization and united action we can readily see how the restaurants operated by the Westerners are enjoying increasing prosperity inspite of the so-called depression, whereas our Chinese restaurateurs are struggling for a bare existence. Indeed, it is such an organization that we need. Because of their organization, the Western restaurateurs have succeeded in raising their prices so as to meet the increased costs.</p>

   <p>The Chinese restaurateurs, lacking an organized union, have maintained the original "depression" prices, while their purchasing expenses were increasing. Such a thing is suicide. If this condition should continue it will be dreadful to even think of the consequence or the future.</p>
   <p>We hope, therefore, that all Chinese restaurateurs will realize the importance of such a union which has such a close relationship with our business future. And if you are interested, at all, in your own future, you will certainly try to attend the coming meeting which will take place, October 11th, 1. P.M. at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. (May we suggest that one person will be enough to represent each restaurant.)</p>
