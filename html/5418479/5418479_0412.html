   <p>Mr. T. T. Tsung, president of the Kwangtung Radio Institute and Mr. C. C. Li, chairman of the radio and electrical division of the Nanking Communication Department, have come to this country from China to visit the principal industrial and electrical cities.</p>
   <p>They have been in Chicago over a week, and during this time Mr. Y. F. Moy has escorted our guests to the various electrical plants and factories. They feel that their stay in Chicago has not only been very entertaining but also helpful to them.</p>
   <p>They left Chicago yesterday for Detroit where they will visit Henry Ford's automobile plant. From there they will go the Eastern States and will return to China by the way of Europe.</p>
