   <p>This is the twenty-sixth commemoration of Independence, and it comes at a critical moment of our national existence. It seems that this commemoration is going to be a meeting of joy and sorrow. We are happy, because this commemoration reminds us of our martyrs who gave their lives so that we may enjoy the existing republic, freedom and equality. But we are sad and sorrowful, because our republican freedom and equality are being challenged and attacked through the Japanese invasion of our land.</p>
   <p>We want joy and joy alone, and it is up to us to get it and to keep it, because freedom and equality are not gifts freely given by others, but are only obtained through our personal efforts. We must realize that we must maintain our prestige through self-preservation, and strengthen ourselves through self-protection. Opportunity knocks at our door and we must not let it slip by.</p>

   <p>To depend upon others for help in time of trouble is to invite failure.</p>
   <p>Germany was defeated and its freedom and equality taken away. But look at it now. Indeed, it is the fighting spirit for self-preservation that we need. We have to, and we must, fight for ourselves for freedom and equality. The old saying; "Those who have aims will eventually succeed".</p>
   <p>Our country is fortunately blessed with vast and rich territories and a numerous population. If we could only unite and fight all together, we would not have to worry about any foreign invasion and aggression.</p>
   <p>Our present plan and hope is to have the whole country united in its support of the central government and to fight for the ultimate republican victory. Otherwise, we will not only lose our freedom and equality, but there shall not be a place left for us in this wide world.</p>

   <p>The policy of our country, now, is to save ourselves. I hope that all fellow countrymen in China and abroad will do their individual best to maintain the existence of our republican China.</p>
