   <p>Yesterday the editorial office received a letter from a Westerner who praised Mr. Lin-Eng's food market on East 43rd Street. The name of the establishment is Wang-Pao-Yven Grocery and Meat Market, 108 East 43rd. Street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>He emphasized that the foods in that store are of high quality and fresh; the stores interior is decorative and clean; prices are reasonable; service splendid. Such a unique store is what that particular district has never had.</p>
   <p>The Westerner also stated that his present address is quite a ways from the store which requires a long walk daily for him. He wanders, why some Chinese food mart doesn't establish a similiar store in his residential district. This Westerner's residence in on the southside of Chicago.</p>
