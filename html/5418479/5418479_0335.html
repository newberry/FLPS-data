   <p>In order to resist our enemy's invasion successfully, we need united efforts of the whole country, and our main weapon is to discontinue our economic relationship with them. If we could accomplish this measure fully, it will mean the end of our enemy's life.</p>
   <p>Many people of other nations, angered at the aggressiveness and invasion of Japan, have started boycotting Japanese goods. Inflicting an economic punishment on our enemy.</p>
   <p>England, America and others have expressed such a desire and, our countrymen in San Francisco and other cities have followed the steps very strictly</p>
   <p>We, fellow countrymen in Chicago, have long been noted for our patriotic movements, since this incident we are doubly affected and enthusiastic.</p>

   <p>As to the conduct of buying and selling Japanese goods, we all realize it is most hateful. This society, ( or organization) then, must reform its duty in resisting Japan by issuing the following rule:</p>
   <p>Any countrymen if caught and proved buying or selling Japanese goods secretly, whether in Chinatown or Western stores, will be dealt with very severely. They are looked upon as traitors and should be discarded entirely from the public.</p>
   <p>For the purpose of stringent organization, we are sending out investagators from time to time, hoping all of you will remember your duty to our country, thus maintaining self respect.</p>
