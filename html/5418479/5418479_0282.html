   <p>The Local Friends Church's Sunday School was established in 1908. With its 30 years record of excellent teaching methods, The Friends Church's Sunday School is considered one of the best English teaching schools in the city for the Chinese. Approximately one hundred Chinese have been baptized in this Church through the Sunday School.</p>
   <p>Last December the entire student body of the Sunday School decided upon celebrating its 30th anniversary on February 27th at 3:30 P. M. The program will be held in the Church Auditorium. We believe this program will interest many American and Chinese Christians, especially Chinese members of various Sunday Schools.</p>
