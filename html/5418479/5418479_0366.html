   <p>Miss S. L. Tsuo was the first speaker who stressed the fact that the only possible means to defeat Japan is to fight until the end.

The audience responded with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. T. V. Tung, president of the Chinese Student Association at Harvard University, followed with a report on Chinese students' patriotic work in Boston and Southern States of America.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Miss C. T. Chen, a Chinese student delegate from the South, who related the war of 1832 in Shanghai.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. Y. Yee, executive officer of the North American Chinese Student Association, then spoke of his future service to our country. He related that he has devoted all his time to chemical research work and that he is returning to China to render his services to the munitions factories and fulfill his duty towards the government.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. J. Chin presented his belief of ultimate Chinese victory by stating <span class="page-break">\3</span>five important reasons. He also emphasized the fact that the only factor that will stop the present war is the return of our Northern Chinese lost territories.</p>
   <p>The speeches lasted about three hours and the audience was not in the least bored, which proves the enthusiasm and patriotic spirit of all fellow Chinese.</p>
   <p>The presiding chairman, Mr. Moy, concluded the program by stating that our brothers and fellow countrymen are sacrificing their lives and all for our country, and should we, as oversea Chinese, keep on loving and worshipping money? The entire audience was stimulated by his timely and precious words. Then they all arose and cheered - "Fight Japan with united effort till the end; down with Japanese imperialism, and long live the Chinese Republic!"</p>
