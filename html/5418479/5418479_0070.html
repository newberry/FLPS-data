   <p>Fourteen carriages containing four Chinamen each rolled into the entrance of Rosehill Cemetery at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, and a little later three street car loads of former residents of the Celestial Empire arrived and joined their countrymen. At first the cemetery officials wondered what their visit meant but later on were informed that the Chinamen had come to feed their dead.</p>
   <p>Little time was lost getting to the plot of ground belonging to the Chinese and almost instantly Hip Lung, their wealthy leader, was surrounded by his friends and after a few words in his native tongue the entire party was engaged in placing all kind of edibles upon the grave. Meats, breads, vegetables, and queer dishes, familiar only to these strange people, were scattered in profusion. While it was all going on a large caldron containing consecrated paper made of an imported punk that had been prepared by the chief religion officer of China, produced a dense smoke, as it was arranged to burn slowly.</p>

   <p>The strange gesticulations and seemingly funny antics cut by the officiating people were extremely interesting to the few white people present. Many thought the pigtails were dedicating their new monument and in order to learn whether of not this had been done Hip Lung was questioned. "It is not a dedication of the monument", said he. It is our custom of feeding the dead. We will not dedicate the monument until next Sunday. We feed our dead today, tonight we feed some of our living - the laundry men".</p>
   <p>In the evening there was a feast at Hip Lung's store 323 South Clark Street. The sidewalk was crowded with Chinese from every part of Chicago, all awaiting the sound of the gong - the tocsin of feast. At 7:30 P. M. the large dining hall on the second floor of Lung's building was ablaze, and the Laundrymen of Chicago enjoyed a banquet such as was never seen or tasted here before. It was given because a nephew had been born to Hip Lung.</p>
