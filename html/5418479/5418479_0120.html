   <p>I have suffered pain in vain. I couldn't sleep nor sit. I have visited both Chinese and American Doctors and found no cure.</p>
   <p>Through the recommendation of a friend, I bought "Teh-Dah" pills made by Dr. Liang-San.</p>
   <p>I found immediate relief and practically cured after using the pills.</p>
   <p>I am publishing these few words to express my gratitude for his wonderful achievement.</p>
