   <p>A disastrous flood is taking place at Hai-Yien, Canton. Lives lost and properties damaged. The pitiful condition is beyond description of words. And our compassion and sympathy is aroused. We feel that an immediate step must be taken. A meeting was called to solicit for the flood relief, but due to the shortage of association reserve fund we had to make a loan of a hundred odd dollars (Amounting to $1000 - Hong-Kong money) from the Lo-Yit Company to be sent to the flood relief headquarters immediately. In the meantime we have elected eight solicitors to visit you all on Thursday, Friday and Saturday for contributions toward the flood relief.</p>
   <p>We hope all of you, fellow countrymen, will open your pocket-books and contribute generously.</p>
