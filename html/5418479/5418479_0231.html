   <p>The commemoration of our Independence (Octobet 10th), celebrates the birth of Republican China. On this day we must also remember the Mukden incident (September 18th) which was really a national humiliation. In order to gain a clear concept of the Independence commemoration we must compare October 10th with September 18th.</p>
   <p>The reason for the commemoration of October 10th, is the overthrow of the imperial government by the revolutionary movement which movement was initiated by Dr. Sun Yat San. Thus Republican China was born. We are now commemorating the 26th birthday of our Independence.</p>
   <p>Now let us go back to the Mukden incident of September 18th. This incident marked the invasion of Manchuria by Japan. Our enemy has since indulged in his devastating desire for continual aggression. Exercising her three - fold (air, land and water) military power. Japan is destroying our cities and mercilessly murdering the civilians.</p>
