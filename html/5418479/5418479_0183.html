   <p>Because of the Japanese invasion of our country, a fellow-sojourner named Liang San, is extremely zealous to exhibit his duty as a Chinese. He has selected Sunday (26th) at 4 P.M. as the date to put on an acrobatic show on the vacant lot, in front of Kwang-Hak-Lung &amp; Co., on Wentworth Avenue.</p>
   <p>All contributions received on that occasion will be turned over to the civilian relief fund.</p>
