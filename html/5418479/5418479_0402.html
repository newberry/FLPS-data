   <p>The National Government will call for a Nationalist Convention in November 1936 to restrain constitutional law and to give us Nationalist rights and privileges. According to the Nationalist Convention election law No. 35 Chinese in the United States of America should be represented by three delegates. And the Chinese Ambassador at Washington, D.C. was appointed manager of the Chinese election campaign in the United States by the general election headquarters.</p>
   <p>We realize The United States is a big country and there are a large number of Chinese and will require time to get satisfactory results. We, therefore, suggest early preparations for registration, such as registration books for voters and an outline of their eligibilities, etc.</p>
