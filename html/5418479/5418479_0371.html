   <p>We are concerned about the growing Sino-Japanese warfare because it means the future of our national government is at stake. But we are, indeed, glad to mention that our oversea fellow Chinese are putting forth all their efforts in backing the national government financially.</p>
   <p>Time and again we have received letters regarding the proper place where the contributions should be sent. Now, in order to solve this problem, the Ambassador is making this public announcement to all fellow countrymen, that the New York Branch of the Bank of China has been decided upon as the contribution receiving center. He also mentioned the two divisions in contributions. That is, all contributions solicited for emergency relief for the dead and the dying will come under the Chinese Red Cross Association, and those of war fund will come under the Chinese Embassy.</p>
   <p>This unique arrangement of the Embassy has been presented to the national government, and we are positive that this will avoid all possible confusion.</p>
