   <p>The entire world has realized that the Japanese military movements in China are not only menacing the peace in Asia, but are also affecting the whole world. The world, therefore, is ready to stand by its principle, to sympathize with the Chinese defenders. The American people, especially, have expressed their sympathy with us. We feel, as Chinese, that we should put forth additional efforts in propaganda.</p>
   <p>The American Anti-War and Anti-Fascism Associations together with the Friendly American-Chinese Society, have decided to have an anti-Japanese mass meeting on October 19th (Tuesday) at 8 P.M. The location will be at the Stuben Club, 188 West Randolph Street.</p>
   <p>The speaker will include the Chinese acting consul, Mr. Wong, Mr. J. Chin of the University of Chicago, and the president of the local steel workers union.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The objectives of the meeting will be to uphold the President's speech on October 5th, during which the President accused the aggressors and violators of world peace. Then a discussion will take place concerning the possible means of boycotting Japanese goods. Other anti-Japanese movements will also be considered.</p>
   <p>We hope as many Chinese as possible will attend the meeting.</p>
   <p>The admission is twenty-five cents.</p>
