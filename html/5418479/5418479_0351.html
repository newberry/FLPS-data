   <p>During the last month the Bank of China in New York has received over $200,000, for defense fund, and over $20,000, for relief fund. The Bank of Canton in San Francisco has received over $800,000. All the banks in Chicago have received over $300,000. Contributions for defense fund have been sent to our national government and the relief fund to the Chinese Red Cross Association.</p>
   <p>It is apparent that the overseas Chinese are making an admirable sacrifice while the soldiers are giving their lives to defend our country. We realize that a prolonged war is the only means to an ultimate victory, but war is expensive. We must have the continuous financial support from the overseas Chinese.</p>
   <p>To distinguish the relief fund from the defense fund may we explain that the defense fund is for the governmental expenses during the present war, and the relief fund is for the victims from the war.</p>
   <p>Originally, the relief fund has been controlled and distributed by the Chinese Red Cross Association only, but in order to avoid possible misrepresentation in the future, the relief fund will not be turned over to the Red Cross Association only, <span class="page-break">\2</span>but to all other benevolent organizations where help is needed.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, hope that contributors will realize that their general contributions are war implements for the soldiers and fresh flowers of inspiration for the victims.</p>
