   <p>Our ever-increasing associations with the foreign world are beginning to penetrate the foundation of our 6,000-year-old civilization, foreshadowing changes in the social and economic fabric, and in the traditional philosophy and ethical outlook of our people, of greater significance than the more dramatic changes in the political sphere.</p>
   <p>Our virtually unchangeable independent ideals have, at long last, come to submit and to react to extraneous influences. We are beginning to realize that the stability of our age-old civilization has left us trailing behind the comparatively new nations. We are convinced that a momentous transformation must take its course. But little are we aware of the fact that there are no other influences that have done and will do more to unify the people, reconcile diverse points of view, eliminate provincial or state jealousies, set ideals for the people, and train leaders for the service of the state and the nation, than nationalized education.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Indeed, modern industry and forms of government demand in the average citizen a higher standard of knowledge and training than formerly sufficed. Education aims at conserving and perfecting the life of the community, but that life is nothing other than the life of the individual. Education, then, is the determiner of a person's future.</p>
   <p>A school, the generally recognized center of education, when its functions are properly performed, is a genuine society inspired by the best ideals of national character and therefore able to transmit to and confirm in its pupils the traits which enter into those ideals ideals of the new and not of the old.</p>
   <p>Whether or not a school is capable of performing its functions properly depends entirely upon the structure and organization of a nationalized educational system, a system which provides for all citizens the acquisition of individual development through the so called "public school education," an organization which possesses its distinctive feature in the replacement of <span class="page-break">\3</span>the old conception, - in which schools corresponded mainly to social stratification, - by the idea that children of all classes should have an equal opportunity at a primary education designed to meet the needs of childhood, followed by a post-primary or secondary education adjusted to the needs of adolescence. Thus a young man is at last equipped with the common knowledge of his social and economic responsibilities and activities in his immediate community.</p>
   <p>The so-called "public school education" has enabled the young man to weigh the difference between the primitive tendency of a community towards the complete subordination of an individual and the modern tendency towards the increasing valuation of individual life. Education, therefore, is indeed the stimulating factor in a child's - a youth's - a young man's ever-increasing realization of his individual valuation to his community, state and national government.</p>
   <p>It is obvious, then, that the individuals or citizens make a country; education <span class="page-break">\4</span>makes an individual; and, therefore, education makes a country.</p>
   <p>It is no doubt easy to visualize and to realize the importance of education, primary, elementary, and public-to-a nation, but to establish and to perform a nationalized educational system is another question - it is difficult. I say it is difficult, especially in our country, because of its tremendously vast area, unstable political situation, inefficient transportation and communication, and lastly, lack of economic nationalism. But in view of these unquestionable obstacles our duty is to rouse the spirit of the people of the republic to perform the seemingly impossible in order to accomplish the indispensable.</p>
   <p>Surely, we can recall what Dr. Sun Yat-Sen did for our country. Yes, he performed what the people of prior to 1911 thought was impossible. But in October, 1911, the nation witnessed the miraculous change - from an Imperialistic government of four millenium to the present day Republican government. I say, therefore, if there is will there is power.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Knowing what is indispensable to our nation, let us all put forth the individual efforts in performing the impossible and the acquiring of the indispensable - the nationalization of educational system.</p>
   <p>My personal opinion is that an efficient nationalized educational system must embody the following factors:</p>
   <p>1. The organization of a board of education in town, city, county, state, and headed by the executive committee of the education department in the central government. Like a national government, the educational system must be efficiently organized and maintaining an absolute relationship between the sub-department and the central office.</p>
   <p>2. Any educational fundamentals, reports, changes and functions must be opinioned by the national experts and then sanctioned by the national executive committee of the central education department before they are to be nationalized.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>3. Executive orders of the central office of the department of education must be strictly observed by the state, county, city and township boards. Any plans or schemes of specific changes and improvements of certain localities should be presented by the township board to its immediate superior who in turn will do likewise, which means, eventually, that the national executive committee of the educational department will directly supervise all changes and improvements in all localities - a system of efficient nationalization.</p>
   <p>4. The state should be responsible in developing the middle class talent, and the national central office should be responsible in the making of all talented research workers and specialists.</p>
   <p>5. All educational commissioners and staff members should be supported by the locality with the sanction of the national central office. In case of financial insufficiency or over-appropriation for such a program, the central office should see to the balance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>6. Elementary and middle school operations should be financed by the city and state, and the national central office should finance educational institutions beyond the middle school - such as colleges and technical institutions, etc.</p>
   <p>In case a city or a state is unable to raise sufficient funds for its own elementary and middle school expenditures, the central office will, naturally, supplement the balance.</p>
   <p>7. Experimentation in the field of educational functions is very essential. Each locality or township should be allowed the opportunity, without national interference, for educational experimentations which, of course, must not go beyond the central office educational fundamentals. This opportunity will naturally encourage unlimited progress and expansion in all localities.</p>
   <p>8. If a town or a city is unable to establish its elementary and middle school, or such operation may involve more than one town or city, then the <span class="page-break">\8</span>state should take the full responsibility.</p>
   <p>If educational functions should involve more than one state, the operation automatically becomes a national central office problem.</p>
   <p>In other words, the national executive council of the educational central office should always be the basic foundation in all educational enterprises - giving, however, all chances possible to staff members of each locality through out the nation for a maximum exercise of initiative in supplying the exact need of their own locality.</p>
   <p>If we can consider thoroughly the above factors in the nationalization of our educational system, I am sure the result will not be far from what has been accomplished by this country.</p>
   <p>In promoting such a program may I say that we who are abroad, especially in this country, should assume the leadership. The reason is because we are <span class="page-break">\9</span>living in a country with a perfect educational system, a country which has achieved more during the past century than any other nation in the world, due largely if not totally, to its efficient educational system. We who realize the important part education is playing in national standing, should, therefore, do our utmost in promoting and advancing the efficient nationalization of our educational system.</p>
