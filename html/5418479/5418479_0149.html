   <p>Dr. Gee Wo Chien of this city heads a stock company of wealthy Chinamen who are determined that the customs and institutions of their native land shall not be entirely excluded from the Great Columbian Exposition.</p>
   <p>On Midway Plaisance they secured a desirable concession, and are erecting there a Chinese theatre, joss house, restaurant, and bazaar. Dr. Chien says he thinks the restaurant will excite greater curiosity than any other eating establishment on the grounds. Everything about it will be strictly Chinese except some of the table ware. The restaurant will be furnished with ebony tables and stools all artistically inlaid with pearl.</p>
