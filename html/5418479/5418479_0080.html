   <p>A certain local Japanese restaurant owner applied for an ad in our paper yesterday. The ad was to notify any Chinese who might be interested in buying his restaurant, as he is returning to Japan. He emphasized the fact that the deal should not be known to other Japanese, etc. Now, if he is a Japanese, then he is certainly a traitor.</p>
   <p>But this paper has always upheld the policy of boycotting Japanese goods and executing no economic relationships with them. And because of this policy, we refused to accept the applicant's ad.</p>
