   <p>In order to console the eminent, patriotic and heroic spirit of the deceased, we ask all Chinese organizations and fellow- so journers who intend to send funeral scrolls, flowers, odes and elegies, to send them as early as possible to our office of funeral ceremonies, because we want plenty of time to make the proper arrangements before the services. It will take place on Sept. 30th, 1937 at 8:30 P. M. at the Chinese Presbyterian church.</p>
