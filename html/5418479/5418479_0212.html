   <p>We understand that your committee is occupied discussing the problems of China and Japan. The objective of which is for the benefit of your country. Your comtemplated neutrality act is, obviously, to avoid the United States from being drawn into the Far-Eastern war. If so, then the self-defending, territory protecting China is hindered immeasurably in her effort to resist aggression. Indeed, your neutrality stand will only help and encourage the aggressor and not the peacelike and helpless defender.</p>
   <p>If your committee will think of others, as you do yourself, and the principle of investigating the present, in order to meet the future, then the foundation of world peace will be firmly established.</p>
   <p>This association is pleading earnestly that your committee will refrain from the proposed neutrality act in order to enable the now defending China to perform the human duty of defeating the peace treaty violator and aggressor - Japan. When we accomplish this task then we have surely done our duty in maintaining the World Peace.</p>
