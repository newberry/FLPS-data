   <p>October 10th, is Independence Day. This is the day when our minds are centered upon the martyrs who fought and died during the revolution. It was their patriotic spirit and their activities that created the Chinese Republic. Today, we are in the midst of national crisis. The contest is not merely between Imperialistic China and Republic China, but between China and Japan. Indeed, we are facing a much worse crisis than our martyrs ever did.</p>
   <p>With this objective well in mind the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association is planning a patriotic parade on October 10th, at 3 p.m. Every Chinese who is interested in his country is expected to participate.</p>
   <p>A propaganda mass meeting will be held at the Shia-Tien Garden directly after the parade.</p>
   
   <p>It is expected that this announcement will provide the opportunity for all the Chinese to inform and ask their foreign (American) friends to attend the meeting. This will not only be a grand Commemoration of Independence, but also a golden opportunity to do some propaganda work.</p>
