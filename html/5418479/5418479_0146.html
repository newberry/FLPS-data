   <p>Passengers standing around the Polk Street depot yesterday morning looked with amazement at 200 Chinese actors as they tumbled from the Santa Fe' Express, which arrived at 10:30 o'clock. They were brought from China in charge of Chin Pork Onay, secretary of the Chinese Columbian Exhibition Company and are billed to play at the Chinese Columbian Bazaar.</p>
   <p>We were taken to the headquarters of the Chinese Exhibition Company, at No. 322 South Clark Street. The headquarters consist of combination hotel, restaurant, mercantile office, opium berth and general jobbing buisness of which Wah-Hoe is proprietor. The weary travelers so long deprived of their peculiar and favorite dishes were soon seated at twenty tables and proceeded to devour steam rice, bamboo shoots, and birds nest soup. After a hearty breakfast the Orientals smoked opium, drank tea at intervals and occasionally gazed up and down Clark Street wonderingly.</p>

   <p>As China is opposite in all things the star actors instead of being objects of high esteem and admiration are looked upon by their fellow men as being low in the social scale. The stars are as follows: Mou Sung Tang, first tragedian; Sho Sung Ning, first villian; Shov Mon Wing, first comedian; Ton Don, leading lady impersonator; Mov Sung Jung, a giant in nature was the life and soul of the party. A number of wealthy Chinese merchants were with the party and seemed to know better what to do with themselves than did the actors. One of them purchased a lot of blue felt hats for the party as a precaution against Chicago weather. Groups of from six to twelve of the newcomers were being instructed in the value of American coins and currency by some of their brethren who have been in this country for years. As fast as the value of one piece of coin or currency was learned it was placed safely in a long stringed purse and the merits of another discussed.</p>
   <p>The headquarters had been temporarily transformed into a baggage room for the company.</p>

   <p>Chinese baskets and curiously shaped trunks containing the theatrical costumes and curios to be exhibited at the Fair are piled up ceiling high. A group of merchants were discussing plans yesterday afternoon for removing their goods to the bazear which will be in readiness for the them in a few days.</p>
