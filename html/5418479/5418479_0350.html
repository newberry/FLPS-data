   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>The Chicago Consulate has reported to me the sad news of the death of Mr. Frank Moy. It certainly was a great shock to me. I am extremely sorry. Mr. Moy has always devoted himself to his country welfare and lately laboring day and night in the course of saving his country through soliciting contributions. It was certainly a great and honorable deed.</p>
   <p>Will you kindly convey my deepest sympathy to the members of his family?</p>
