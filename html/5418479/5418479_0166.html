   <p>A New York Chinese merchant, Mr. H. T. Chen, has come to Chicago with movies produced in China. They will be shown here Friday, Saturday and Sunday. This will, certainly, give our Chinese movie goers a new treat.</p>
   <p>The production entitled "Ne-Se-Chu," (Second Generation Ancestor) stars the famous Chinese actor, Mr. Ma-Se-Tsung and Miss Tan-Lang-Chin.</p>
   <p>The story is very dramatic and entertaining.</p>
   <p>As to the time and address for the showing, please read the advertisement.</p>
