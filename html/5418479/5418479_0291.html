   <p>Beginning this Saturday at 2 p. m. and every Saturday thereafter a Boy-Scout class will be held at the Chinese Christian Church on Wentworth Avenue. The class is being formed for the benefit of our Chinese boys who are in need of scientific and creative encouragement.</p>
   <p>The curriculum consists of moral teachings, instructions in practical handicrafts and educational moving pictures. All of which will be extremely helpful to the plastic youths.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stephen, a graduate of the Chicago University will be the instructor. We understand that Mr. Stephen, himself, is an ardent enthusiast of Boy-Scout movements and has done extensive research work in this particular field. He is a man of character and education, and we are certain that the class will be a success under his leadership.</p>
   <p>All the boys between the ages of nine and fourteen are welcome to join the class as soon as possible.</p>

   <p>The class will hold its first meeting on this coming Saturday night at 7:30 o'clock. It will be considered a commencement meeting, and Mr. Howe will be the guest speaker. He will also display some electrical appliances which will be of interest to the class as well as to the adults.</p>
   <p>For this reason an invitation is extended to all those who are interested.</p>
