   <p>Our general director of the Middle-Western Chinese Civilian Relief Association of Chicago, was taken by death on Sept. 17th, at 6 A.M.</p>
   <p>The On-Liong Association has been in charge of his funeral and the service was held at 2 P.M. yesterday at the Chinese Presbyterian Church on 23rd and Wentworth Avenue.</p>
   <p>The church was filled with funeral flowers. Every space was taken by the hundreds of relatives and friends, that was available, ( including his American friends.)</p>
   <p>The services opened with a prayer by Rev. T. Y. Li, followed by a three minute meditation. Then a song was sung by the chorus and the reading of a brief biography of Mr. Frank Moy by the president of the On-Liong Association, Mr. Moy U-Cho, followed. Again a song of grievance.</p>

   <p>The service concluded with Rev. T. Y. Li leading the congregation past the coffin to pay their last respects to the deceased, Mr. Frank Moy.</p>

   <p>After reaching the Chinese cemetery, Rev. Li offered prayer and again relatives and friends paid their final respect by saluting the deceased, before burial.</p>
   <p>The funeral procession numbered thousands and certainly the greatest ever seen.</p>
   <p>We conclude, therefore, that the patriotism of the deceased and services rendered to his fellow-men have obviously commanded the respectful devotion of us all.</p>
