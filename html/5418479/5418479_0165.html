   <p>Due to the uncertainty of the weather, the fifth of the regular Sunday open-air mass meetings will be held at 216 Twenty-Second Street.</p>
   <p>Miss L. S. Tsuo, a student of the University of Chicago, and Mr. K. L. Hwang of Wisconsin University will be the guest speakers.</p>
   <p>After the speeches, films, which extol our art and civilization in general, will be shown to remind us of our native home - the land of our birth. Above all, there will be films showing us how our enemy, the Japanese, are mercilessly killing our fellow countrymen in Peiping and Shanghai.</p>
   <p>These films are, by far, different from the regular movies, and we are certain that all those who are interested in our national affairs should not miss this important meeting.</p>
