   <p>Mr. Frank Moy, general director of the Chicago Chinese Emergency Relief Society, died from over-exertion in patriotic activities. What touched our hearts was the fact that Mr. Moy was one person who actually gave his life for his country. He breathed his last while persuading his fellow countrymen to contribute towards the defense and relief funds.</p>
   <p>These are the reporter's impressions of yesterday's memorable funeral of Mr. Frank Moy:</p>
   <p>1. The patriotic spirit of the Chinese public was apparent in their expression of deep sorrow and sympathy.</p>
   <p>2. The spirit of organizational and individual unity has never been greater in the history of the Chicago Chinese community.</p>
   <p>3. The combination of love for fellow countrymen and of patriotism gives the reporter a greater assurance of our ultimate victory in war against Japan.</p>

   <p>There were more than three hundred automobiles and more than a thousand mourners participated in the funeral procession. Then, of course, there were thousands of on-lookers and by-standers.</p>
   <p>Traffic in Chinatown was tied up for hours. The normal order was not restored until the procession reached the cemetery where thousands more had gathered to witness one of the most spectacular funerals in the history of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Due to the limited available space, your reporter has given you just a brief outline of the great funeral procession. As a matter of fact, there are no available words to express such solemnity, lavishness, and patriotic spirit.</p>
