   <p>The achievements of the Chinese students in this country are well known to us all. During the last 30 years. Chinese student movements have met with appropriate success and development. In spite of changing circumstances and conditions the student movement nevertheless, must continue to progress, because the general principles and aims of the student organizations remain the same. One must, however, remember to adopt proper methods and procedures in organizing and take into consideration the present environment and circumstances.</p>
   <p>I realize that all you student delegates are here to discuss the exact duties and proper activities of students under the conditions concerning national welfare. And I will now present my version of the present conditions.</p>
   <p>1. You undoubtedly realize that we are living in the most precarious and critical stage of our national history. All of us must share in the responsibility of averting the calamities of the national crisis. You, students, are the intellectual nucleus of whatever movements we might undertake.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>You are fortunately blessed with wisdom and the ability to understand the republican principles of China. Therefore, students who respect and honor the past achievements of our student movements will surely follow their example in rendering their service to our country.</p>
   <p>2. We are fighting, in the present war, for freedom and independence. We must win the war at any cost. If, however, we who are citizens of one of the world's largest and most resourceful countries having the oldest historical background and civilization, should be unfortunate enough to lose in the end, not only we would suffer the consequence but it would also be a loss to the world. I therefore, repeat that we must secure the ultimate victory. And in order to reach such a goal we need an unparalleled determination in working whole-heartedly for such an accomplishment.</p>
   <p>3. We all realize that the present war is going to be a protracted one and we must plan and prepare accordingly. The following are important factors in the extended war against our invader.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>(a) Military organization - Our military forces have gradually discarded old fashioned equipment and are using modern machinery and equipment. If we should plan to prolong the war over a five year period, we must consider the replacement and manufacturing of arms despite our ever available man-power.</p>
   <p>(b) Aerial Combat - We realize that aerial combat is most predominant in modern warfare. Our enemies are using bombers to endanger our defenses, and it is up to us to defend ourselves aerially. We are, therefore, facing the vital problem of purchasing planes and training pilots. We, citizens of China, not only should be generous in contributing towards the up-building of aerial defense but we must also have more intelligent young men to take up aviation courses. We must prepare ourselves to become useful and available to our national government.</p>
   <p>(c) The need of talented and trained scientists- Because of lack of trained scientists, we have depended somewhat upon foreign specialists I am sorry to say. We realize that in times of war we need more scientifically trained men and women. I hope that those who have specialized in science will soon go back to serve our country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>(d) The need of spirit in war- The outcome of a war, whether it be victory or defeat, depends also upon the morale and the spirit of the participants. While our country is resisting our enemy with united effort, you students should likewise unite in spirit in your patriotic activities.</p>
   <p>(e) Exhortation and publicity work- In this Sino-Japanese War, we are trying to resist our invaders; we are fighting for freedom and independence; we are fighting for our national principles; and lastly, we are fighting for world peace. Our principles and actions are right and, therefore, it's not difficult to gain sympathy from the rest of the world. You students should utilize every available opportunity to elucidate our purposes in the war, and to explain how both the United States and Europe will, eventually, be involved in the present war.</p>
   <p>Personally, I am proud of our national heroes and their achievements, I am very optimistic regarding our ultimate victory. Above all, during these critical times of our national crisis you students should not neglect your duty as citizens. Everyone should take an active part in patriotic endeavors.</p>
