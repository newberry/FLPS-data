   <p>Mr. Moy U-Liao, who is in the local luandry business, isaquiet and poor man who minds his own business. But whenever anybody happens to discuss the lawless invasion of our enemy- Japan, he gets excited and exceedingly exasperated.</p>
   <p>Since the existence of the Mid-western Chinese Emergency Relief Society, Mr. Moy realizing the opportunity to recompense his country was at hand, began economizing in food and clothing, contributing towards the war fund again and again. His contribution totalled $550.00, and stated clearly that he would not accept a receipt of public debt or a national bond for same.</p>
   <p>On the basis of the individual laundryman's contribution, Mr. Moy rates the highest. Besides his contributions towards the war-fund he also solicits from the Westerners, for the emergency relief to help unfortunate civilians in the war zone.</p>
   <p>Such is Mr. Moy's patriotism. He is indeed a first class citizen.</p>
