   <p>The owner of a Chinese laundry at 38th street left the store last Saturday night. When he returned at 10 P. M. he discovered the rear door had been opened. The thief unlocked the door by breaking the glass above the lock, and went away with over ten dollars in cash. It was fortunate that he did not touch any of the clothing and laundry.</p>
