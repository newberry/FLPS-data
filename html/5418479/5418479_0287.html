   <p>The Chinese Sunday School Conference will have its annual Spring meeting next Sunday at 7:30 p.m. The meeting will be held at the Chinese Christian Church on Wentworth Avenue.</p>
   <p>All the Chinese Sunday School members who number over three hundred will participate at the conference meeting.</p>
   <p>Nine English churches in Chicago support Chinese Sunday Schools. One Sunday School is also attached to the Chinese Christian Church. These Sunday School classes are established to accomadate our Chinese people who are interested in Christianity. The enthusiastic American teachers have even devoted their time every Sunday afternoon to teach English to the Chinese members who do not know this language. Thus, they remove the only obstacle which prevents some Chinese from acquiring a thorough knowledge of the Christian religion. We may say that the present records of some of the 350 Chinese members of the Sunday School classes prove that the American teachers' efforts have not been in vain.</p>

   <p>The program of the meeting will consist of musical selections and speeches. Reverend T. Y. Lee, of the Chinese Christian Church will be the presiding chairman and Mr. S. L. Lin will be the principal speaker.</p>
   <p>We do believe that the gathering will be a gay and entertaining one.</p>
