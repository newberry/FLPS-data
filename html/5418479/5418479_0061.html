   <p>Mr. S. T. Wu, son of Mr. S. C. Wu a leading Chinese merchant and proprietor of the Sing Sing and Company, was married to Miss C. S. Li yesterday morning. Instead of a traditional Chinese wedding the couple went through a simple Americanized ceremony.</p>
   <p>Following the ceremony, however was the traditional Chinese custom of lavish entertainment in the form of banquets. All Chicago leading Chinese merchants and relatives numbering at around 300 were entertained at the Hwa-Ying-Low. We understand that there will be another banquet to-morrow (Sunday) entertaining Mr. Wu's Chinese friends who are in the laundry business.</p>
