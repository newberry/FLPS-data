   <p>Nationalized elections have been in effect for the past fourteen to fifteen years. What elections were prior to 1921 is something no one can recall.</p>
   <p>Today, there is the difference between the verbal opinion of the people and the opinion of the press in regards to elections. Generally the peoples verbal opinions are more authentic. Therefore, to obtain the exact effect of the psychology of elections we uphold the verbal opinion of the people - yes, the majority. But the majority of the people hate elections  they hate election disturbances and they hate the various consequences resulting from elections. So, this is the opinion of the voice of the people! They are indifferent toward elections. A mere indifferent attitude of the public toward their national activities is always a hindrance to the progressive government of any nation.</p>
   <p>The object of election is to secure the opinion of the majority of the people -better elections always result from the participation of more voters. Where there are more voters, competition is inevitable, and the keener the competition the better the election will be.</p>

   <p>So then, in elections there must be competition. Where there is competition there is organization.</p>
   <p>A systematic organization is the most essential factor in an election. We regret to admit that organization is just what our country lacks. With our 6000 years of civilization we are still incapable of organization. The reason is probably due to the fact that education was only obtained by a selected and perhaps a wealthier group and the educated ones with a superiority complex dislike to organize or to cooperate. Therefore what little organization there was, was done by people outside of the intellectual and educated class. With the intellectual and educated group having nothing to do with organization we can just imagine how far such an organization will go. Yes, such is the condition and it is indeed a pity.</p>
   <p>The great democratic countries of Europe and America have political parties and political parties call for organization. Their purpose is to utilize every intellectual ideal available to organize for an election.</p>

   <p>Yes, every single capable person in the country is noticed and considered. All, therefore, participate and all compete in elections in order to obtain the wholesome result of a proper election.</p>
   <p>So then, the individual element is essential in proper elections. The election of individuals to represent our country should not be based on their wealth, etc., but rather on their character, qualifications and ideals. Yes, a person who thinks fairly of the people and his government.</p>
   <p>If our national campaigns can be based on the above factors then we shall have attained success.</p>
   <p>May we remind our fellow countrymen of Chicago that all elegibles in any election should adopt the same principle in electing our delegates to the national election campaign.</p>
