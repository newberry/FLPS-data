   <p>Because of present disastrous conditions in Shanghai the former Chinese Red Cross Headquarters at Shanghai was actually disabled making it difficult to perform its duties. But in order to continue its helpful service to the unfortunates Mr. C. T. Pang, the general secretary was sent from Shanghai to Hangkow to establish a temporary general office. And at the same time Dr. C. S. Wu was appointed special agent at Hongkong to manage the incoming contributions from the overseas countrymen.</p>
   <p>We realize that all fellow country-men abroad have supported this organization heartily and generously by means of cash contributions, medical and other supplies which we do appreciate very much. Your love for our country and fellow-men thus shown certainly deserves respect and honor.</p>
   <p>In closing may we request that you notify the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association and other benevolent organizations, to forward all contributions for the Chinese Red Cross to Dr. C. S. Wu of Hongkong, China for proper distribution.</p>
