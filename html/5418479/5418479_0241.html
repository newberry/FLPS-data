   <p>My beloved fellow-countrymen and fellow-students, while we are in the midst of a National crisis we must remember to commemorate the unforgettable May thirtieth, and May thirty-first - day of National misfortune.</p>
   <p>We commemorate May thirtieth because of sacrifices made by our fellow citizens, students and workers due to British and Japanese imperialism.</p>
   <p>We commemorate May thirty-first because of the Tong-Koo treaty - the loss of our Northern China to Japan.</p>
   <p>We have decided to commemorate on May thirtieth, Saturday, 8 P.M. at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association Auditorium. We hope all patriotic fellow-countrymen will attend as scheduled.</p>
   <p>By participating in this patriotic program we will display the undying spirit of the Chinese Republic, and to express our desire for a united effort in war against Japan.</p>

   <p>We hope all readers will notice the next issue for a detailed program of the meeting.</p>
