   <p>After several years of most inhuman and wholesale murdering of innocent countrymen, women and children which started from Manchuria in 1931 and it will undoubtedly extend to almost every part of China by Japanese military despots. China is as united as she was on the very first day of hostilities. The crime committed by Japanese military despots brought about this miracle. Every Chinese today has but the same thought, the same ardent desire, and that is to drive out the invaders, and to be able to live in peace.</p>
   <p>Although our American friends have always displayed their respect for justice, their search for progress and an instinctive attachment to the laws of humanity, for several years, Chinese in America have not yet appealed directly to our American friends for assistance of any kind in regard to the blind barbarian passion of the Japanese.</p>

   <p>As the American people would say, "We mind our own business." Rationally speaking, there is a limit to everything a limit to mind one's patience; a limit to one's suffering; and especially, a limit to mind one's own business is also the business of others.</p>
   <p>To understand the Sino-Japanese crisis more clearly, there are some questions people of the world would like to know. Do the Japanese people support their militarist despotic government with sympathy and united effort? Do the Japanese people know what is going on between China and Japan, in China? What have they been told and what do the militarists expect of them?</p>
   <p>Ever since the Japanese invasion of the three Eastern Chinese provinces, commonly known as Manchuria, the Japanese militarist group has declined in prestige as well as in political power. The invasion of China yielded no profit to the Japanese people but a steady increase in taxation and continuous loss of lives of Japanese soldiers due to the resistance of the Chinese volunteers in Manchuria. During the parliamentary elections of the past few years, the Japanese militarists have been defeated again and again by the Japanese people.</p>

   <p>There is a definite hatred and distrust of the Japanese people toward their militarist despots. To get control, to oppress the General Will by popular election has failed to be accomplished. The Japanese militarist despots resort to war against China, attempting to rule the people by iron hands and at the same time to shift the hatred to the innocent Chinese.</p>
   <p>The invasion of China, and the distruction of Chinese lives and property by Japanese militarists aroused not only condemnation by foreign countries but also from their own people. According to eye-witnesses, authentic reports and first hand information Japanese people had been misled, corrupted, and systematically poisoned by their militarists. It is practically well known that Japanese frequently refused to serve in the army and the Premier had to tempt the tax-burdened people to serve by exempting them from taxation. Young Japanese officers were shot in the railroad station in Tokio because they demonstrated against the invasion of a friendly neighbor who has done them no harm. Japanese abroad also show the same resentment against their government.</p>

   <p>We still believe and the majority of the people of the world still believe in the sanctity of treaties, the principle of humanity, that the weak have rights and that the strong have duties, that each nation has every right to life and independence, and that freedom for its own sake is as well worth fighting for today as it was in the past. Indeed, we shall fight for the land where we were born; for the restoration of our lost provinces; and for our children so that they may have the right to think, speak and feel in China.</p>
   <p>Japan has before God, before man and before the ages to come, stained himself forever with the blood of innocent Chinese. If such crime should again triumph (first in Manchuria and second in Spain), the human race would be definitely degraded. Treaties and obligations would no longer have any value, nations no security. All moral effort since the human race has existed would be annihilated, a and there would be no distinction between men and beasts. Cruelty and brutality would rule the world. The very thought of such a terrible state of existence is maddening. Any one who has a heart would brave the worst evils rather than sink to such degradation.</p>

   <p>Ninety percent of the population of the world hopes fervently for peace. But there can be no peace answering to the true meaning of the word, no peace permitting the nations of the earth, great and small, to walk unarmed and unafraid until the respect for laws of humanity and of world opinion shall have supplanted the sway of reign of terror and international lawlessness.</p>
