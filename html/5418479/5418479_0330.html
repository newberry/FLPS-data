   <p>(The following is a letter from Mr. N. L. Sheh of Shanghai to his brother Mr. N. Y. Sheh of Chicago.)</p>
   <p>Opportunities to witness aerial combats are numerous.</p>
   <p>On the day when our aerial force attempted to bombard the Japanese gunboat "Tsuyuen", I (Mr. N. L. Sheh ) was on the roof of the Bank of Shanghai which was only half a mile from the gun-boat. Three bombs were dropped by our bombers. Unfortunately the closest was about 100 feet from the gun-boat. Our bombers again failed to accomplish their purpose, a second time. The gun-boat, however, moved away soon afterward.</p>
   <p>The Japanese invasion of Shanghai this time has met not only strong resistance but the Japanese were forced back from time to time. They had to ask for reinforcements repeatedly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Japanese army that reached Shanghai, included at least sixty thousand soldiers, fifty gunboats and battleships, and over one hundred planes.</p>
   <p>In spite of their apparent power, our forces resisted their attacks rather successfully. It was estimated that at least 10,000 Japs have been killed, since the beginning of their attack on Shanghai, up until September 5th.</p>
   <p>Although our enemy had a large number of planes, due to lack of efficiency on the part of the pilots, their aerial force suffered great losses. With-in a period of three weeks since August 13th, more than 40 of our enemy's planes have been shot down, while we lost only 10.</p>
   <p>Our enemy, however, claims to have destroyed several of our air fields including some 76 planes. This claim is of course unfounded. In the first place, for the sake of safety, our planes and bombers were never assembled in great numbers, and secondly, our air forces were always aware of impeding attacks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Our fighters always meet the attackers before they ever reach their destination. They thus make it impossible for them to accomplish their purpose.</p>
   <p>This false rumor, however, might have been based upon the following incident.</p>
   <p>In Hangchow, we have two air fields, one for the aeronautic school and the other purely for military purposes. The aeronautic school air field has always been inspected by visitors, but the military air field is kept closed to the public. As a matter of fact, the public does not even know that there is such a field for military activities. In times of war, the well known aeronautic school moves into the interior, and leaves behind the hangars and some 50 wooden decoy planes. It was not long before our enemy's planes flew above the field and destroyed the planes which they thought were real ones. While they were fully enjoying themselves in destroying the wooden planes, our aerial fighters surrounded them with machine guns. As a result of this combat our enemy fled minus 5 planes. We lost only one plane which was indeed a victory.</p>
