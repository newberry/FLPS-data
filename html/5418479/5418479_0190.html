   <p>The local Chinese Y.M.C.A., has been distributing bread to the poor three times a week since 1933. During the period of five years many have been helped by it, and as a matter of fact, the Chinese Y.M.C.A., might be called the only relief agency in Chinatown.</p>
   <p>The fund is realized through voluntary contributions. For the benefit of those who should be in need of some material aid, may we add that an unusual amount of food will be distributed on the coming Easter Sunday.</p>
