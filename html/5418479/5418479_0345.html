   <p>Since the Sino-Japanese war, the American people have been very sympathetic with us. During the past few months, numerous American people have contributed to our war fund.</p>
   <p>There is one particular case of a certain American gentlemen who contributed $10.00 last month and $10.00 this month. He has promised to continue contributing $10.00 per month until the end of the Sino-Japanese war.</p>
   <p>Such noble enthusiasm certainly deserves our respect and gratitude. Now that the American people have done such noble deeds, how about, ourselves, fellow country-men, shouldn't it be of great encouragement to us.</p>
