   <p>The Chinese community is extremely fortunate and happy, indeed, to be the host of our distinguished guests from China.</p>
   <p>Miss W. H. Chen, the principal of the Tai-San Girls Normal College in Canton, is here to solicit funds for the construction of additional buildings and dormitories for her Normal College. Her personal visit to this country is, without doubt, her unselfish efforts in the up-building of our national educational program. The expansion plan of the institution in which she has devoted all her life since her graduation from the Lin-Nang University is, obvious indeed, that education is becoming more popular amongst our girls everyday. Yes, the future-paving education, an opportunity which heretofore has been <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>denied to the girls of our country. The achieving of educational progress amongst our girls is a primary step and an important foundation to the independence of our women and participation by them in keeping up with the pace-setting modern civilization. We can readily see what an important and vital responsibility is resting upon the shoulders of Miss Chen.</p>
   <p>The realization of our guests' accomplishments and her present needs, we feel it's the duty of all fellow countrymen here in Chicago to assist Miss Chen with her plans financially.</p>
   <p>The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, On-Leong, Chinese Merchants Association, and Ning-Yang Benevolent Association are holding a joint conference in behalf of Miss Chen's solicitation plan in Chicago.</p>

   <p>During the reception banquet at the Hwa-Ying Restaurant, Miss Chen spoke enthusiastically on education and its relation to society and government in China.</p>
   <p>Our second guest of honor was Mr. Y. C. May who has come to this country as a personal representative of General Tsai Ting-Kai.</p>
