   <p>The eighteenth annual Association convention has brought about a definite plan in checking up on its membership standings. This Association is allowing three months (October 1st to December 31st) to all members who are in arrears in their membership dues and pledges.</p>
   <p>All those concerned must come in personally within the indicated period either to clear up their obligations or make some definite arrangements with the secretary in charge at the office. Members living outside of Chicago are permitted to arrange through mail if it is preferred. We repeat, however that the dead line is December 31, 1936.</p>
   <p>We do hope that all members will realize their duty and assume their obligations in order to avoid any necessary steps the Association is reluctant but obliged to take in dealing with violators of the rules of this Association.</p>
