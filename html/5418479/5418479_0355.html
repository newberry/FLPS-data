   <p>Since the beginning of this organization, we are happy to announce, we have achieved successful results.</p>
   <p>All credits must be given to the various associations and clubs, and to our local countrymen who have afforded us their whole-hearted co-operation and support.</p>
   <p>A meeting of officials of this association was held yesterday. The association has set the date of September 15th, as the dead line for the first payment of contributions toward the war-fund.</p>
   <p>Will all pledgers who have made partial payments as well as those who have none, come in and pay in full, on or before September 15th?</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>As to those who have not yet pledged because of the following reasons-</p>
   <p>1. Addresses lost by contribution collectors;</p>
   <p>2. Contributors out, when the collectors call;</p>
   <p>3. Intentional violators of contributing rules of this association.</p>
   <p>The officials have decided upon the following orders which must be strictly executed, in order to meet the present demand.</p>
   <p>1. Beginning today and until the 15th of September, all members who have not yet pledged, are requested to come to the office of the Chinese Association and contribute according to the rules set by the Association</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>2. Those who have been accepted and verified by the squad of inspectors of this association before September 15th and have not contributed nor pledged toward the war fund according to rule, will be dealt with severely.</p>
   <p>3. Elderly country-men who are not able to contribute, because of a loss in business, must come to the office to relate their problems before the 15th day of September. And if problems prove to be absolutely correct, with two or more official signatures as witnesses will be allowed a reduction of the required contribution or perhaps a release from all obligations.	</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>4. All those who have detected any one of our countrymen who have not pledged, may feel at liberty to report to us by mail. This will naturally assist the squad of inspectors a great deal in their line of duty. The sender of such letter or report need not sign his own name, but must write plainly, the violator's name, address and circunstances.</p>
   <p>5. All contributors must wear the badge which was given by the association, to all pledgers, on their overcoat whenever they visit Chinatown. This will eliminate unnecessary questions and waste of time when meeting with the inspectors.</p>
   <p>The above orders and methods of solicitation have been voted and decided upon by all officials of this organization and approved by the leaders of all Chinese Associations and clubs with whole-hearted co-operation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Thus we must adhere strictly to these orders, and we hope that all those who have not as yet contributed, will think of the perilous conditions of our country and realize the fact that to save our country is to save ourselves. So then, make up your mind now, and without hesitation, to live up to what is expected of you- to share the obligation and responsibility as a citizen. The future of our country depends on you.</p>
