   <p>The Chicago Chinese Emergency Relief Society, has recently organized the Foreign Publicity Department for the purpose of advertising our patriotic spirit and its activities. The department will also be responsible for the correction of any propaganda work which might be disadvantageous to us.</p>
   <p>The Publicity Department will adopt three different methods. Speeches, literature and art. Each department will be headed by an expert.</p>
   <p>These plans are definitely in process of completion. In the meantime, how-ever, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association feels that the impending Independence Commemoration on October 10th, will offer the Publicity Department a wonderful opportunity, as it is quite obvious that many foreigners (Americans) will be visiting Chinatown to witness the Commemoration and the parade.</p>
   
   <p>The Publicity Department, has consequently decided to print some English pamphlets giving true facts of the Sino-Japanese war and of our economic relationships with the world powers. The pamphlets will be given to as many foreigners as possible.</p>
   <p>Propaganda work of this type, we are sure will not merely entertain the sympathetic neutrals, but also give them a vivid picture of the Sino-Japanese war and its repercussion on the rest of the world.</p>
