   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In the letter it stated that: We, a Chinese student body in the United States as a whole, are taking this opportunity to offer our respects to all fellow Chinese countrymen in the United States who have sacrificed so whole-heartedly and contributed so generously toward the war fund since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
   <p>We are also taking this opportunity to encourage all of you to continue the excellent and unforgettable patriotic activities. At the same time, we are reminding you that to save China we must exterminate the Japanese, and to exterminate the Japanese, we must prolong the war. In this case, then, tremendous war expenses are unavoidable - as a matter of fact - indispensable. We hope, therefore, that your organization and members and all other fellow Chinese will continueyour untiring efforts in striving to maintain our national integrity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>When the ultimate victory is gained by our country, we are sure that, all oversea Chinese will be credited immeasurably.</p>
   <p>As students in this country we are offering all our cooperation and preparing ourselves to render our services to our country in the near future.</p>
