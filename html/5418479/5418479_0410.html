   <p>In behalf of all fellow Chinese who are anxious to return to China but who have insufficient funds, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association has, with the co-operation of our Consulate, made arrangements with shipping and railway companies so as to obtain a special reduced fare from Chicago to Hongkong, China. This special rate, however, is limited only to the people who prove themselves to be in need of assistance due to old age, illness, and unemployment, etc. We hope that all those who are planning on returning to China will come personally to make the proper arrangements.</p>
   <p>The Association, as a matter of fact, will even endeavor to help those financially destitute.</p>
