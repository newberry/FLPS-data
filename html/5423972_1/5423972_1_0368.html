   <p>We are pleased to note that the striking Hebrew teachers of the Moses Montefiore Talmud Torah are back on the job. While we realize the hardships the Klhillah has undergone to be able to finance these institutions of learning, it did not augur well for them to permit the oldest Talmud Torah in Chicago to be forced to close its doors, because of inability to pay its teachers, who have gone for months without receiving their salaries.</p>

   <p>The time has come when something definite must be done in connection with the struggling Talmud Torahs, and the matter should be presented in a forcible manner to the Jewish Board of Education. Talmud Torahs are just as important as Sunday schools and they should be supported.</p>
