   <p>On the 10th of August, it will be a year since the comrades of the Douglas Park Socialist Party branch opened their school for children. On the first anniversary we should stop and take inventory to see what we have gained in the past year and prepare the work for the following year.</p>
   <p>It is easy to praise the sponsors of the school, because they have made wonderful progress. Over one hundred children visited the Douglas Park S. S. S. almost every day for a year. The children's choir participated in all the important Socialist affairs.</p>
   <p>Those that are close to our school in the Douglas Park, and the Workers Institute, know the great impression our work has made upon the children. Our readings and talks have awakened a thought of freedom, developed powers of the observation, and tied their young souls with the interests of their parents and brothers.</p>
   
   <p>We must consider the problems of our children's schools in a deeper sense. Four elements constitute a successful school: Children, comrade co-workers, teachers, and a system. In the English-American districts, the first element presents a very important problem. The children go to the Christian Sunday schools, which are well organized and equipped in the material and psychological sense.</p>
   <p>I personally believe we can win children everywhere. Our children have no religious school; our schools are too primitive and too backward; hundreds of children of Jewish workers could be attracted to our schools in every city in any community. The question is how do they stand in education?</p>
   <p>One of the most striking features in the life and struggle of our schools was the deep sympathy and gratitude from the parents of the children, especially the mothers. During the Winter, in the severve cold and snowy weather, the children were present in school.</p>
   
   <p>When any entertainment would take place, the mothers would listen to the old and new melodies coming from the mouths of their youngsters. The parents of these children are with us, but they have not the time and the experience to organize, to collect money, and to take an active part in the work.</p>
   <p>The real and important problems are teachers and a system. Here we must admit that our movement has no system, no plans, and no teachers. Within the last year, I corresponded with almost every school in the country, and personally spoke to many comrades, on this subject, comrades who have spent many years in this work, Sheder, Ameringer, Brown Lesur, Chvartan and others.</p>
   <p>I received cards from Rochester and Baltimore, Kenosha and Rockford, all voicing the same complaint of no system, and much striving without plan or purpose.</p>
   <p>We, here in Chicago, have done a great deal and we believe that we are nearing the completion of a system, which will lay the foundation of a strong organized movement. We must admit, however, that if the children and parents have filled our hearts with hopes and inspiration, the actions of our more intelligent comrades, lecturers and authors awoke a feeling of hatred in all the workers who were active in the schools.</p>
   
   <p>What do you teach in your schools? We comrades throughout the United States ask, What books, what system do you use?"</p>
   <p>And most important, how do you teach in your school? It is not the lessons alone, it is the art of teaching. The children are stuffed six days a week with education in the regular schools. They are being taught and drilled, but they are not learning to be self-thinking, and independent.</p>
   <p>They are subjected to the authority of the teacher and the principal. In the higher classes, the children lose themselves. (They are being transformed into a big machine, and with the children starts the development of the machine.) Automatic psychology blocks the deliberation of the worker more than all the capitalist laws put together.</p>
   <p>It was this machine psychology which has driven myriads of Socialists into the European Armies. If the Socialist schools would like to accomplish anything, they must annihilate this horrible system, and must elaborate one organization in their classes, which shall not be constructed on obedience and authority, but on love and comradeship.</p>
   <p>Upon considering our schools from this standpoint, we readily understand why it is so difficult to support them. We have no teachers and the more teachers we get, the worse it becomes. Our adult comrades are children of the old tyrannical military world. They enter the classroom with a viewpoint of egoism, and the children segregate themselves and lose interest naturally remaining the weaker. This situation between teacher and pupil is a matter which is now being vigorously debated upon in all educational circles, and must be adopted in our literature, and discussed in order to train teachers for our children.</p>
   <p>If this point shall become clear, the problem of a system will be solved very easily. The purpose of our schools is:</p>
   <p>1. To develop the sentiment of sympathy within the children.</p>
   <p>2. Elementary Evolutionary Science.</p>
   <p>3. Music and play.</p>
   
   <p>You cannot publicly fight religion, you cannot fight the old system of teaching when you deal with a child. In general, to lecture, to instruct has no influence. When we have interviewed our elder children concerning culture, history and the primitive life, we have seen that, at each interview, they were alert and were beginning to compare the realities of their life with the realities which we endowed upon them. They commenced to analyze, asking why and how, and that is the birth of free thought.</p>
   <p>It is just the beginning. Children learn general science in public schools, but their minds do not develop because they are being misled. We must contrive a series of inquiries and interviews concerning the ground principles of nature and the social sciences. Our system attracts the attention of the children to the important phenomenons and discoveries in human history, to our heroes, and martyrs, and plants in them the new spirit, and sentiment of historical struggle for a better and safer world.</p>
   <p>As you see, we can develop our children into Socialists without preaching direct theories to them, without blocking their minds with economic systems and dialectics. However, the best way to reach the soul of a child is by appealing to their sentiment and from this angle, very little was done.</p>
