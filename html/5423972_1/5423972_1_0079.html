   <p>To the list of Jewish holidays should be added another important holiday, Graduation Day.</p>
   <p>Of course, Graduation Day is not essentially a Jewish holiday, but it is certainly a great holiday for the Jews. On that day the glory of Jewish children and the pride of their parents transcend everything else. In fact, to the proud Jew, reflecting somewhat partially on the splendid representation of Jewish children in the commencement rituals, it seems as if Commencement Day is an institution for the exhibition of Jewish love for knowledge.</p>
   <p>For indeed, Commencement Day, wherever it may be celebrated, is a great day for the Jews, who participate in it to get degrees and awards for meritorious intellectual distinction.</p>
   
   <p>Whether it be in old-time tzarist Russia, where Jewish students were discouraged by inhuman restrictions and exacting quotas, or in the halls of the celebrated Harvard University, in the "Land of the Free," where restrictions against Jews are now under discussion, the names of Jewish children occupy prominent places on the honor roll. In proportion to school population, Jewish children obtain more honors of distinction and awards than any others.</p>
   <p>It has been thus for ages.</p>
   <p>Where knowledge is garnered, where the written or spoken words of intellect is propounded, where the principles of science are expounded, Jewish children have been always in the rank of the distinguished; a virile, inspired, proportional majority in the minority that distinguishes itself in the halls of intellectual training.</p>
   <p>Probably this is why some of the orthodox Jews repeat in their prayers, in the midst of persecution and strife, that the Jews are "God's chosen people," and probably this is why the Jewish race cannot be extinguished. The hunger for knowledge and the struggle therefore are nature's greatest gifts to the human race. The Russian tzars and other tyrannical rulers of history, surrounded by mighty armies and powers of destruction, were overthrown by weak, poverty-stricken individuals, martyrs pining away in dungeons but wise with knowledge, - knowledge ready for action. The man who haunts the halls of a public library, though his clothes be shoddy and his diet meager, will have a greater share in the destiny of the human race than the one who sits in the throne of the mighty and reigns in the halls of the powerful. The people who have knowledge own the world, runs an oft-repeated saying which deserves repetition.</p>
   <p>No, the Jewish people do not own the world; they do not aim to, nor do they stand in line for a lease on the strife-ridden orb through their intellectual distinction. But their gift of intellect does stand them in good service in their struggle for self-preservation.</p>
   
   <p>Arthur Brisbane, the famous editorial writer and editor, has reprinted in a number of papers one of his excellent editorials on the Jews, originally published in the Hearst newspapers. As a keynote to this splendid editorial the following paragraph follows:</p>
   <p>"Jews, like others, search for fame, money, honor. But before all, they put education. That is why they succeed.</p>
   <p>"The Jews will live and work for thousands of years to come, because they value knowledge, get knowledge, and use knowledge."</p>
   <p>There Mr. Brisbane puts his finger on the finest point of the Jewish race. "No other people in the world put as high a rating on education, struggle for it so, is forced to overcome so many bars and obstacles, as the Jews, no matter in what land under this glorious sun."</p>
   <p>Virtually, our fight for education is our fight for preservation. And this blessed trait, this hunger for education, for knowledge, is inherent in us. We have been raised with it for generations. And the many of us who have gone further and see a light that is greater than nationalism, who struggle in the ranks of fighters for the emancipation of the working class and against suppression in general; those of us must also acknowledge our idealistic tendency as born of the racial trait: the Jewish hunger for education and knowledge.</p>
   <p>No parents are prouder of their children's education than the Jew; no parents in the world struggle more or are more willing to endure heavier sacrifices for their children's education than they. To our knowledge it has been thus in Europe, and it is so in America, where the immigrant parents slave in the shop so that their children may get their education.</p>
   <p>Indeed, this is not intended as a hymn to the Jewish race. We are as good and as bad as any race. It is, however, a hymn, and a sincere tribute to Jewish parents and Jewish educational spirit, which has no equal among any race and for which everyone should be glad, radical, orthodox assimilator, as well as nationalist.</p>
   
   <p>At this month's commencement exercises, you will notice meek, unpretentious Jewish mothers and fathers lost in the turmoil; perhaps neglected even by their children, but with tears of joy in their glowing eyes, more jubilant than the noisiest in the merry crowd. They participate in the celebration quietly, heartily; too filled with pride and joy, at their children's ascendance in the world of education, to speak or shout their feelings, except through a bashful tear, which seems to be the eternal Jewish emblem in sorrow and in joy.</p>
   <p>Jewish parents, how wonderful and devoted you are! How much the cause of education owes you for your devotion to your children's education!</p>
   <p>Who but Jewish children are in the majority in the handful of plucky youngsters who work their way through college doing all kinds of labor during recess hours to attain an education?</p>
   <p>In Jewish families, more often than in others, you will find sisters working in shops and factories to help a brother go to school; brothers toiling long hours and deferring marriage and careers to see a younger brother through college. Education is our watchword.</p>
   <p>Get any Jewish parent in conversation about his children and you will find that his heartiest boasts are: "I have a son, - long life to him, - who is in his last year of college," or "My little grandson, you know, my son's, the lawyer's child, - what do you think of him? He has already skipped two classes in school...Eh, isn't he good?"</p>
   <p>And the same reverence for education is held by the Jews all over the world, under all conditions...</p>
   <p>In his editorial on Jews, Arthur Brisbane writes the following:</p>
   <p>"Stupid prejudice, some of it in pretentious little private schools, some in pretentious, big Harvard College, would discriminate against the Jews and cheat them of education.</p>
   
   <p>"Too late for that. The Jews know education's value and will have it."</p>
   <p>He then goes to the length of quoting a Talmudic maxim to the effect that, "Jerusalem was destroyed because the instruction of the young was neglected." He also quotes a number of other Hebrew sayings, which deserve to be repeated here.</p>
   <p>"If thou hast acquired knowledge, what canst thou lack?" "If thou lack-est knowledge, what canst thou acquire?" "Do not confine your children to your own learning, for they were born at another time."</p>
   <p>"Teach the children of the poor without compensation and do not favor the children of the rich."</p>
   <p>"One who teaches a child is one who writes on clean paper."</p>
   <p>"Honor the sons of the poor; it is they who bring science into splendor."</p>
   
   <p>"Ignorance and conceit go hand in hand."</p>
   <p>"He who instructs a child is as if he had created it."</p>
   <p>"Without knowledge there can be neither true morality nor piety."</p>
   <p>"Who are you whose prayers alone have approval?"</p>
   <p>"I am a teacher of little children."</p>
   <p>In the discussion of restriction against Jews at Harvard, recently, the venerable dean of the university expressed the opinion that such a step may be beneficial, because the success of the Jews in the schools provokes Anti-Semitism and creates Jingoes who fear intellectual Jewish domination. Even if such is the case, and although the threatened restrictions may be instituted to one degree or another, Jewish children will go on obtaining an education, keep on going to school one way or another, be selected on merit, and in spite of prejudices, for the delivery of valedictorian orations, be selected to the Phi-Beta-Kappa, be the foremost among those who are awarded prizes for distinction, have the pride and zest for education which is characteristic of them and which cannot be extinguished.</p>
   <p>In a great measure, in fact, these bars and restrictions of the past and the present make Graduation Day a great holiday for Jewish parents the world over; a holiday shared by the orthodox and the free-minded alike,- a true Jewish holiday in tradition and spirit.</p>
