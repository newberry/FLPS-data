   <p>The readers of Forward are already acquainted with the fact that the Chicago Board of Education have decided to establish new junior high schools.</p>
   <p>The junior high schools create a new epoch in the system of education. They will divide the children into two categories: children who will receive a common, ordinary education and children who will be trained as skilled workers.</p>
   <p>The Board of Education decided on this system arbitrarily, without debating this question with the teachers who oppose. This system and the organized workers, all of whom were ignored.</p>
   <p>The organized workers resented this action and protested so loudly that the Board of Education had to listen to them by agreeing to hear their protest. The Board will also give a hearing to the teachers.</p>

   <p>What is the objection of the workers against the new system of education in the public schools?</p>
   <p>Victor Olander, secretary of the Illinois State Federation of Labor, submitted an answer to this question.</p>
   <p>Olander appeared before the Administration Committee of the Board of Education, making such an impression that the latter decided to grant the workers a hearing in spite of the fact that the Board of Education have voted for the new system already. "When such a change is to be made in the school system," said Olander, "You must first hear the sentiment of the citizens. I do not want to say that the new system is bad any more than I am prepared to say that it is good. All I want to say is that this situation must be thoroughly studied, taking into consideration the opinion of all concerned.</p>
   <p>"All we know is that the new system, as it is now worked out, divides the children into two classes: a privileged class and an oppressed class.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We are protesting against dividing the children and against discrimination. To separate children in school in that manner is tyranny.</p>
   <p>"The new system reminds me somewhat of the old fashioned school system in Germany, in the time of Kaiserism.</p>
   <p>"In those days they took twelve-year-old school children and made them workers, trained to benefit capitalism. The capitalist must have both skilled and unskilled workers, and for the former he looks forward to the public schools. The latter, which is no more than a tool in his hands, does just what he demands of them.</p>
   <p>This is the chief but not the only complaint of the workers against the new junior high schools. Another complaint is that according to the old system, the children graduated at the age of sixteen; whereas, in the new one the children will graduate at the age of fifteen, thus losing a year of school. The law prohibits that children go to work before sixteen. What will the children already graduated at fifteen do until they reach <span class="page-break">4</span>sixteen? Formerly it was different, the children attended school until they were fourteen and by the time they reached sixteen, they had already had two years' training in high school.</p>
   <p>Now Capital wishes to change the system for its own benefit.</p>
   <p>The workers must combat this new system. They should protest energetically against this new system at the hearing set for June 3.</p>
