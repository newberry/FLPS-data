   <p>Mr. Herman Hirsch of Chicago is the designer of aseries of triangular blocks which, when placed in position make up a "Mogen David" (Jewish Star). There are thirteen blocks in three layers. The author presents, in beautiful and accurate drawings, the objects used in Jewish ceremonials on one side of the block, and the explanation in English on the reverse surface. The name of the object is also inscribed in Hebrew.</p>
   <p>The author is contemplating the addition of the Jewish Calendar for a prolonged period, which will indicate the dates on which the Jewish holdings fall.</p>
   <p>Rabbis who have seen the "Mogen David" speak highly of its usefullness. It is now being considered for adoption by the Synagogue Extension Department of the Union of American Hebrew Congregation.</p>
