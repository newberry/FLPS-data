   <p>The well-known philanthropists, the brothers Samuel M. and Dave Travis, have announced that they have promised to contribute exactly as much as the campaign for ten thousand members for the Yeshivah Rabbi Isaac Elchanan will bring in, to be used as a fund for the erection of a new building for the Yeshivah. It is expected that the campaign will bring in between fifty and one hundred thousand dollars and the Travis Brothers will also add a like sum. The Yeshivah Rabbi Isaac Elchanan is in need of a new building because the number of its pupils and teachers increases with each season, and the present quarters are inadequate to house all those who want to be and must be accommodated.</p>
   <p>The magnificent contribution of the Travis Brothers will also help to solve the housing problem for the Yeshivah. It also has already given a strong impetus to all the captains of the campaign to work with more diligence and energy to make the campaign a real success, for everyone now realizes that for each dollar collected for the Yeshivah, another one will be added by the Travis Brothers.</p>
