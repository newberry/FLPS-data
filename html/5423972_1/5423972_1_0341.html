   <p>Among the gifts announced by Dr. Harper is one made by Mr. Julius Rosenwald who purchased for the University of Chicago a splendid collection of rare books, comprising almost 10,000 volumes, forming the library of Prof. Bernays of Munich.</p>
   <p>At the wish of the donor, this collection will be known as the Bernays-Hirsch Library in recognition of the fact that Dr. Hirsch was instrumental in securing the volumes for the University.</p>
