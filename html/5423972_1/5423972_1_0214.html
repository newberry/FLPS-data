   <p>The Hebraic Organization Ohel Shem of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Ohel Shem was organized about two months ago through the efforts of the well known Hebrew writer Mr. S. B. Maximon, the new principal of the Chicago Hebrew Institute Hebrew Department. A preliminary meeting took place in the rooms of the Hebrew Literary Society, where a few of the best known Hebrew scholars assembled at the invitation of Mr. Maximon, to devise ways and means for the development and revival of the Hebrew language and its literature in Chicago. That the standard of Hebrew education is below the lines of criticism was apparent to everyone present at that meeting. Some of the smaller Jewish communities have much more modern Hebrew educational institutions than our great city of Chicago with its hundreds of thousands of Jews, with all their community and social workers.</p>
   <p>In order to remedy this evil, to open up the mind of our people, to interest our great communal workers and systematize the education of our youth, this society was organized with Mr. Maximon as its president.</p>

   <p>Dr. A. Levinson, vice-president, J. Gold, treasurer, G. Prochovnick, secretary and the writer as corresponding secretary. The first public meeting was held at the Chicago Hebrew Institute, Sunday July 30, on the occasion of the celebration of the Bialik 25th anniversary. The meeting was opened by the writer with a short address about the aim and object of the organization and Mr. Maximon delivered a very interesting address about Bialik, in which he brought out the fact that the poetry of Bialik distinguishes itself, in that while man varying in degree of intellect seeks various avenues for the expression of prayer, and that while to some that power of expression is entirely lost to those of our people who are still imbued with the divine faculty of imagination and whom the ancient formal version or the fixed prayer does not satisfy Bialik appears as a scribe and prophet who in the charming voice of poetry gives vent to the innate desires of the human heart for prayer and communion.</p>
   <p>The meeting was conducted entirely in Hebrew, and was very well attended. Two children rendered declamations in Hebrew, reciting the poems of Bialik <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with feeling and expression.</p>
   <p>Lovers of Hebrew will long remember the well spent evening. The Ohel Shem is planning a series of lectures in Hebrew for the next season, and working out plans for great Hebrew activity during winter months.</p>
