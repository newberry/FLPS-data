   <p>"Chicago, June 17, 1878: Editor, Jewish Advance: Dear Sir! I beg leave to report to you the proceedings of the meeting held on Sunday, June 16, at Milwaukee Ave., as announced in your able paper.</p>
   <p>This meeting was called for the purpose of organizing the School Association, and a fair representative of the subscribers responded.</p>
   <p>Reverends: Adler, Gerson and Ottendorf were also present, by special invitation.</p>
   <p>The following were elected officers, pro tem: Isidor Brother, President, A. Pike, Secretary; Joseph Leske, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>Rev. Adler was called upon to address the Assembly, to which he heartily responded.</p>
   
   <p>Rev. Ollendorf also followed with a few able remarks; both of these gentlemen spoke in the German language, and Rev. Gerson, who followed next, delivered a very able address in the English language.</p>
   <p>On motion, a Committee of Five was appointed to draft Resolutions and By-Laws, and lay the same before the Association at its next meeting for adoption, and to issue a special call on all subscribers for a general meeting, when we intend to organize and elect officers permanently.</p>
   <p>Yours,</p>
   <p>A. Pike"</p>
