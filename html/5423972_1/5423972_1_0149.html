   <p>The founders of this country created the school system to indicate their will and desire to give to all children, without exception, the opportunity to acquire all the knowledge which the elementary and higher schools can give. Immigrants from various foreign countries arrived in this country to settle. Each group brought over its own ideology, each wanted to force its own teachings upon the other groups, to set up its own teachings as a standard. The American public school system cancelled all those plans. It firmly adhered to a democratic foundation in its educational program. It has taken the children of the various groups, and has shown them those truths upon which they can all unite. There is no room in the American school system for dissenting and conflicting ideas.</p>
   <p>We Jews have to thank the American public school for a great deal. We who have suffered from restrictions and persecutions, cannot even imagine what kind of an America this would have been, had it not been for the democratic public school. The same dark forces that now operate in the schools of the old country, would have had a free hand in this country.</p>
   <p>The schools here are not opposed to the religious and national beliefs of the various groups that are to be found in our great, many-sided city. They admit that those sentiments are very desirable from a general civic point of view.</p>
   <p>The Jewish boy in the old country was always afraid to walk through the streets inhabited by gentile children. The American-Jewish boy is not afraid of the gentile boy, because the American school has put them side by side and has taught them to tolerate each other.</p>
   <p>The American school teacher does not wear a uniform or a cap with a visor. He holds no whip in his hands and does not frighten the child. The American school teacher, usually a woman, is democratic and kind in her attitude towards children. She tries to inspire them with courage and bravery, for their own good and for the good of the country.</p>
   
   <p>Let us begin with the kindergarten. Most of the two hundred and five elementary schools in Chicago have kindergarten classes where children, from four to six years of age, are gladly accepted. Ordinarily, in the very heavily populated districts, such as our own Lawndale district, there is not sufficient place for the children in the kindergartens, and many children are not admitted until they are five years old. Almost all of the young women school teachers who teach in the kindergartens, do this kind of work because they love to work with this pure, innocent, pliable human material. They open before [the eyes of] those little children a world full of goodness, a little world of joy and childish happiness, and the pure, gentle childish soul basks in that happiness and gains strength from it. The significance of those classes lies not in the fairy tales or songs that the child learns there, but in the effect that those stories and songs have on his personality. Let the child find happiness in the world of phantasy; let him feel warm and comfortable. Let not the chill of reality touch him at this stage.</p>
   <p>Those young women teachers understand the child's world. They are in complete sympathy with the purposes of those classes, and they are doing great work for our very little children. Let every Jewish mother who has little children, go to school with them, and visit the kindergarten class. Every principal will be glad to permit a visit, any morning or afternoon. It is a real pleasure to see how the woman teacher identifies herself with the children's world, and amuses the children, with the sole purpose of making them happy, thereby recapturing experiences from the world of pure imagination.</p>
   <p>Most of the Jewish mothers have neither the time, the energy, nor the necessary qualifications to teach their little children through amusement and play. Many thank God that the child has begun to attend school. This is particularly true of mothers who are forced by circumstances to remain at home, and whose hands are always busy with housework. The children of those hard-working mothers are welcomed joyfully at school, and they return home happy and satisfied.</p>
   <p>The kindergarten classes are doing great work for the child himself, for his parents and for the welfare of the country. Gloomy and sad children with embittered souls could exist only in Russian or European ghettos. In free America, a child must grow up happy and lively so that he can enjoy life. The childhood years are the impressionable years. Those impressions remain vividly stamped on the child's mind. In his adult years, he is influenced by them. A person whose childhood was pleasant, grows up to be a pleasant person with a good word for everybody.</p>
   <p>All this is accomplished by the kindergarten classes, which are found in almost every school. Every Jewish child should and must attend one of those classes for at least one year. Those mothers who lie about the child's right age, who say that he is older than he actually is, in order to get him into the grade school, are not fair to their child. One should not jeopardize a child's happiness. Such parents rob the child of a happy and joyful period of life, and they do not gain anything from it, because the child who has been forced ahead in his studies too rapidly, will become a backward child.</p>
   <p>Let the child experience the pleasure of play, song, and story as it is given to him in the kindergarten classes.</p>
