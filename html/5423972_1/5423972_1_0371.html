   <p>Twenty-three Talmud Torahs of our city find themselves now in dire financial distress and are on the verge of closing. Yet we have in Chicago a so-called "Board of Jewish Education", which spends annually tens of thousands of dollars on frills and "fancy work" and completely ignores these struggling Talmud Torahs. It is unfair to the teachers who haven't been paid in months and unfair to the Talmud Torahs, yet no one seems to be interested enough to see that fair play prevails.</p>
