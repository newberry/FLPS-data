   <p>I have the honor of submitting to you the annual report of the West Side Religious School.</p>
   <p>It should be noted, however, that the neighborhood of the school is rapidly changing. The Jewish population is moving further west and every week children's absences are explained by the fact that the family has moved too far for the younger children to come to school. The older children come on the street car or are able to walk the long distance.</p>
