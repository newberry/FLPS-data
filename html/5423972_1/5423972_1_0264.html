   <p>There are thirty-four church songs in the school books which the Chicago children are studying. The majority of these songs are religious church songs including material which is against many Jewish principles. These songs are also strictly foreign to the American tradition of excluding any type of religious teachings from the public schools.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Julius Rappaport and other Jewish leaders have expressed their views on this subject, stating that Christian songs should not be included in the books of the Chicago public schools. There are also a number of congregations and synagogue organizations which have decided to present similar protests to the Board of Education. Rabbi Rappaport called upon all Jewish leaders of synagogues, lodges and societies to cooperate with him in this struggle. After all, the Chicago schools are supported by the taxpayers of the city, among whom there are many Jews and others who do not believe in Christianity. Why mix religion with education in our public schools?</p>
   <p>It is the desire of all concerned that when parents wish their children to be <span class="page-break">2</span>religious, they should send them to a church school and not attempt to secure religious training for them in a public school.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Rappaport informs the public that there are schools in the city in which Jewish children form ninety percent of the population. It is a crime to teach them religious matters which are strictly against their faith.</p>
