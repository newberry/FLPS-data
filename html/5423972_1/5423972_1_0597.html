   <p>There is nothing modern about intermarriage. Moses, the great Hebrew leader and legislator, twice married Gentile women; so did Elijah, the great Hebrew prophet. History is merely repeating itself. One thing, however, is most essential for persons of different beliefs to ascertain before they decide to become companions in life's journey, and that is their intellect and intelligence on racial and religious understanding and knowledge. Of course, if one wants to follow the edict of Joseph Bernstein, of Bridgeport, that "a Jew is a Jew and a Christian a believer in Christ," with the thought of "Oh! shut up, you Sheeney," vibrating in one's mind, then intermarriage is a calamity and an everlasting catastrophe.</p>

   <p>But when we mate as human beings as children of God, children of nature, children of the Infinite Intelligence, we need not fear of such "wow's and zowies," or other verbal explosives that the Mr. Bernstein suggests so fearfully.</p>
   <p>There is no social ostracism in being a Jew; nor is there anything wrong in being a believer in Christ, or a believer in anything or anybody as long as the belief is pure and conscientious.</p>
   <p>Some of the Nazarene's teachings are wonderful and inspiring. If one of his phrases, now called the Golden Rule, "do unto others as ye wish them to do unto you," were followed and observed faithfully by every living person, this world would be a paradise. Bernstein and all, including myself, <span class="page-break">3</span>love ourselves, and if the same love that we have for ourselves were to be shown and bestowed upon our fellow humans with equal reciprocity, won't this earth be a Heaven?</p>
   <p>The trouble with the Jew, the same applies to the Gentiles and other faiths, - is that our thoughts from childhood on have been trained to regard the other's faith and belief with awe. A Jew, the Orthodox sort, will not eat pork, not that it isn't tasty, but because from infancy on he had been told time and again that "Chazzir" was pooh, and pooh it remains until he tastes it - and then lo! behold! you can't give him enough of it, and his daily menu becomes a ham sandwich. In referring to pork, I am not making fun, I merely do so as an illustration of how one's mind can be trained to hate and <span class="page-break">4</span>to love.</p>
   <p>Intermarriage, if we are not bigoted, is not a failure; it's an evolutionary process, gradually working its way to get the Jew and Gentile together and make us all one big family of the Great Universe.</p>
