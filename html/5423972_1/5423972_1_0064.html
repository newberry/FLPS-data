   <p>Chicago, singularly rich in educational facilities, is yet backward in one important branch. While the University of Chicago maintains a college downtown, and Northwestern University has its professional schools on the McKinlock campus and on Lake Shore Drive, neither serve adequately the thousands of people who would like to continue their education, but find it impossible to matriculate in the day classes of the universities.</p>
   <p>The professional schools of Northwestern University are chiefly for graduate students. The would-be student who has had only a high school education, or one or two years of college is thus automatically barred. The University of Chicago, on the other hand, through its University College in the Lake View building, gives a fairly complete undergraduate course, with the cream of the university professors as instructors. Meritorious as this work is, however, it is sadly hampered by material conditions. Courses requiring laboratories must be held on the South Side, thus debarring many students.</p>
   <p>We Jews are, happily, much interested in higher learning. Many of us have emigrated to this country in order to escape the baneful, numerous clauses so prevalent in Europe. But another clause operates in this country. It is an economic condition. Many must work for their livelihood during the day, their only time for study being at night.</p>
   <p>Every encouragement, should be extended to the University of Chicago in its, as yet, tentative plan for a building downtown. It seems to us that the logical place for such a structure would be in Grant Park, possibly in connection with the Art Institute-Goodman Theater group. An endowment and building fund will probably be necessary, but we are sure that this fund will be quickly subscribed for, if not over-subscribed.</p>
