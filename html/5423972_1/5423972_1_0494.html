   <p>There should be a higher duty to possess our Rabbis.....In New York City, we find now that the reform ministers make it a point to go among the lowly and poor to give them instruction. Why cannot Drs. Felsenthal, Grossman, Hirsch, Sale, Heller, Norden, and others of Chicago go among the South Clark Street, Pacific Avenue, Canal and Milwaukee Avenue Jewish Communities and organize Sabbath School instruction?</p>
