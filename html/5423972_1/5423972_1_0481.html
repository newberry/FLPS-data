   <p>In September 1876, a number of high-minded Jews of Chicago established the Jewish Educational Society for the purpose of fostering Hebraic knowledge in the community.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kohler, Dr. B. Felsenthal, Rev. Liebman Adler, Rev. A. Norden and other prominent Jews issued an appeal to the Israelites of Chicago in which they urged the necessity of such a society. The purpose of the Jewish Educational Society was clearly set forth in the articles of organization, which were adopted at a meeting held in August 1876. "The object shall be three-fold (1) to establish a school at Chicago, where instruction shall be given in Hebrew language and literature and in Jewish religion and history (2) to encourage the establishment of Sabbath schools in those parts of the city where, heretofore, religious instruction had been utterly neglected. The Society shall stand ready to assist and maintain these schools if necessary (3) to create a system of instruction, by means of lectures and lessons, and to devise methods by which our youth can be interested in Judaism.</p>
