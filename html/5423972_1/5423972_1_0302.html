   <p>The board of education is planning to hold examinations in the Hebrew language for the purpose of selecting young Jewish men who wish to become Hebrew teachers in the Chicago high schools.</p>
   <p>Hebrew classes are being established in the Chicago high schools so that Jewish pupils will be able to study the Hebrew language.</p>
   <p>At present, the board of education is preparing special examinations in order to select individuals qualified to teach Hebrew.</p>
   <p>Those who will qualify, will begin to teach the Hebrew classes immediately at a salary of $110 a month. According to a ruling of the board of education the teacher will also receive a bonus of $100. The person who passes the Hebrew language examination must also possess a certified high school teacher's diploma [before he will be allowed to teach in the schools]. He will have to teach Hebrew full time, and will not have any time to teach anything else since there is a great need for Hebrew instruction in many Chicago high schools.</p>
   <p>This is the latest news we have received from that prominent Jewish gentleman, Harry A. Lipsky.</p>
