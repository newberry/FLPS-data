   <p>At last the Chicago College for Rabbis, which had its temporary quarters at the Anshe Kneseth Israel Synagogue has moved to its permanent abode, recently established at the new Talmud Torah on Grenshaw Avenue.</p>
   <p>This school of higher learning, founded by Chicago Rabbis upon the initiative of Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, began its activity on a very small scale and without much ado, without tooting horns and big advertisements, as is usually done by other groups. They placed themselves first on a solid footing, before starting to build the future structure of Chicago's Jewry. For this modesty, the directors of the institution deserve hearty thanks.</p>
   <p>There are many who prefer to outline a program before starting a movement--before testing their plans to see whether they are practical and can be carried out in a general way. But this was not the case with the founders <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the College for Rabbis. First they founded the institution, enrolled suitable and worthy pupils, appointed a principal, and then, when convinced of the ultimate success of their undertaking, only then did they begin to think about the publication of a program.</p>
   <p>We are happy, therefore, to outline the full program, recently completed, in the columns of this newspaper, which has pointed out at every opportunity the need for such an institution for Chicago's Orthodox Jewry.</p>
   <p>The program consists of the four parts upon which the institution was founded.</p>
   <p>The first deals with the period of time in which pupils should complete their studies and be prepared to wear the mantle of Rabbi.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The second deals with the details of the lessons which the pupil is to prepare.</p>
   <p>The third determines the majors and the credits.</p>
   <p>The fourth definitely establishes the duration of the semesters.</p>
   <p>(A). Each pupil enrolling in the College, desiring to receive the title of Rabbi, must devote at least eight years of daily and earnest study to the Torah and the teachings of Israel.</p>
   <p>Further, he must also gain during this time a thorough knowledge of general subjects in different fields in order to receive the title Bachelor or Master of Divinity, in one of our city's universities.</p>
   <p>(B). In this institution the year is divided into two semesters, a Winter and a Summer Semester.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The Winter Semester begins with the first day of the month of Heshvon and ends on the seventh day of the month of Nissan.</p>
   <p>The Summer Semester begins on the first day of the month of Jyar lasting till the end of the month of Blal.</p>
   <p>The three remaining weeks of the months Nissan and Tishri are a vacation period for the pupils.</p>
   <p>(C). The study hours will be as follows:</p>
   <p>Sunday--eight hours; Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday--six hours each day; Friday--two hours, and Saturday--four hours.</p>
   <p>(D). In the weeks in which the pupils are free from public schools, the period of study will be eight hours daily until Friday; six hours on <span class="page-break">\5</span>Friday and four hours on Saturday.</p>
   <p>There are five major subjects: Torah, Jewish Knowledge, Languages, and Administration; also the study of the art of jurisprudence.....</p>
   <p>The principal of the school is Rabbi Rubinstein, a highly-learned man with a personality well suited to the position.</p>
   <p>The only thing that remains for the Chicago Jewish Community to do, is to assist this institution morally and financially on the road to fame.</p>
   <p>It must be admitted that Chicago is still very backward, when the question of assistance to its institutions is raised. It still thinks it is a vassal state, a taxpaying branch of Greater New York. But we must divorce ourselves from this thought. We now have grown to the point of providing for the needs of public administration. We have a manifold science for governing <span class="page-break">\6</span>a community and exercising influence upon it. We are now able to establish lodges and various organizations for religious and public welfare purposes.</p>
   <p>The program was worked out very skilfully by the noted pedagogue, the principal of the Moses Montefiore Talmud Torah, Rabbi Greenberg.</p>
   <p>The Rabbis, who are devoting their time and energy that this institution may become a moral success are: Rabbi Ezriel Epstein, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, Rabbi Kardon, Rabbi Goldenson, Rabbi Rabinstein, Rabbi Schach, Rabbi Silver, Rabbi Vinograd, Rabbi Greenberg and others.</p>
