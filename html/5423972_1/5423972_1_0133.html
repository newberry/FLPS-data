   <p>The Menorah Bulletin, published by the Intercollegiate Menorah Association of America, prints a partial bibliography on the agitation in the American colleges for student limitations at these higher schools of learning. The bibliography covers a wide range of publications and reveals the interest in the question. In most instances, the articles deal frankly with the Jewish subject as the writers are fully aware of the fact that the discrimination is anti-Semitic in character rather than anything else. The general non-Jewish publications especially discuss the question in this manner, making it evident that they too know or believe that the agitation is anti-Jewish. Despite this bibliography and its illumination of the existence of certain anti-Jewish manias in this country, we venture the belief that anti-Semitism has no future in America, that public opinion condemns the action of such institutions as Harvard and that the lagging interest in the Harvard affair proves that while <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the school may be the loser of some of its best students and large endowments as a result of its policy, that no such discrimination exists elsewhere among the colleges of this country, despite agitated views to the contrary. Above all, we believe we have no right to become panicky, else we lose the rationalism which is an essential part of our safety in this country even more than in others.</p>
