   <p>We are notifying our sister members that we will have an important meeting Sunday evening, April 3, at the Beth Ha-Medrash Ha-Godol (Theological Seminary) and Bnai Yaakov, 836 Maxwell Street. We beg all sisters, who are members or who wish to become members of such a worth-while organization, to attend this meeting and become enrolled. Dear Sisters, do not think that because the organization was neglected that it is dead. The flame of the Holy Dorah must not flicker. Help, us, Sisters, to achieve this holy goal and your heavenly reward will be great.</p>
   <p>At the same time we would like to inform you that Simchah Charlotte, 1521 West 12th Street has the authority to collect dues and other monies for the Society. We ask that Sisters treat him accordingly.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Malchab Miller, President.</p>
