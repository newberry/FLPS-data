   <p>The Workmen's Circle is first and foremost a workers organization founded on the basis of class struggle.</p>
   <p>Everything that the Workmen's Circle does for its members in the way of benefit, is just like the cement keeping the bricks together of a brick wall.</p>
   <p>As a workers organization, the material benefits are as important as it is for a union to better the conditions of the work shop.</p>
   <p>A union that cannot do something for its members must sooner or later perish--and the history of the labor movement is full of such facts.</p>
   <p>It is therefore very important to discuss the question of education, from a worker's organization standpoint, recognizing the fact, that the good, which they get from the Workmen's Circle is as important for the workmen's circle as air for a human being.</p>

   <p>The question of an independent workers education is more important for the Workmen's Circle, for in the branches there are quite a number of members who are not workers and their interests in the Workmen's Circle are materialistic and not idealistic or spiritual.</p>
   <p>It is therefore doubly necessary, if we are to understand the meaning of workers education, that we undertake, in Chicago, a systematic, steady dissemination of workers propaganda among the members of the branches and those who do not come to the meetings, but just send in their dues by mail or check. The latter constitute approximately about 8 percent of our organization.</p>
   <p>What is meant by a workers education? What do we mean by a worker's press? All workers know the answer. A worker's paper dedicated to the class struggles is as different from a capitalistic paper as night is from day. The same is true of workers education. When the workers leave their education to their class enemies, they will be controlled by their class enemies.</p>

   <p>Worker's education means the inculcation in the mind of the workers, of the workers philosophy.</p>
   <p>When an industrial conflict arises, we do not go to the capitalist press, asking what stand the workers should take.</p>
   <p>A worker, in order better to understand his interest, must understand the capitalist system of today and the economic laws which guide it and must realize the difference between the efforts, and aims of the capitalist and those of the workers who received a workers education, and have a workers viewpoint. The workers philosophy is contrary to that of the capitalist. The capitalists are concerned with the preservation of the existing system. Their entire philosophy stems from this viewpoint. Their educational system is founded upon it and they spread that education among the workers through the medium of the schools, churches, newspapers, moving pictures and colleges. The atmosphere is filled with capitalistic education which is based on the preservation of the system of today.</p>
   <p>Properly speaking, the workers viewpoint on education must necessarily <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>contrary to that of the capitalist. The workers' education must have for its main aim the discontinuance of the present system. The workers must strive toward a fundamental change in the existing social system.</p>
   <p>An organization like the Workmen's Circle must spread this concept among the members of all its branches. The Workmen's Circle should educate and develop all their members, and should have an apparatus to carry on the workers education, and to supply the means to reach the membership of the Workmen's Circle.</p>
   <p>Once we realize what the foundation of a workers education is, it is very important that we make clear to those who think that we have in mind only bread and butter when we speak of a workers viewpoint, that such is not the case.</p>
   <p>It is true that the foundation of the workers education is the fundamental concept of the class struggle, which gives the worker the class viewpoint, and which serves as a compass to lead the workers in a straight line of thought. But is also true that learning other social sciences is not ruled <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>out of the program of workers education, but when workers have adopted the workers approach to all economic and social problems, they will, in learning the other phases of human life, have the workers viewpoint as a guide.</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle, as a workers organization is now the only body, in the Jewish community, which is capable of carrying on this educational work. An apparatus must be created to educate our members to be not only members seeking benefits, but also class concious individuals in the army of workers, who have the workers point of view toward everything that occurs in life.</p>
