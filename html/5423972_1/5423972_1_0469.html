   <p>You have all, no doubt, read last summer's report of the Hebrew Theological College which appeared in the Courier. You have also probably noticed that the College made loans in various places, raffled a watch, sold tickets for the High Holidays, etc. In spite of all these activities it still owes one of its teachers his salary. This situation existed in the summer when no gas bills had to be paid, no coal was needed, no clothes had to be purchased for the students, and no other similar expenditures had to be incurred.</p>
   <p>Now with winter upon us, with the number of students increasing, with the bills for coal, gas, clothes, and other items mounting and the income steadily decreasing, the problem is becoming very serious. It should not be neglected. Methods should be found to perpetuate this important Jewish institution.</p>
   <p>We appeal to all Chicago Jews to aid this sacred institution where over one hundred poor students are taught to be good Jews. We are sending committees <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to all our synagogues and asking them to allot one Sabbath for an appeal for funds for the College. We ask the presidents, officers, and members of all the synagogues to co-operate with these committees and to do everything they can for the good and welfare of Judaism.</p>
