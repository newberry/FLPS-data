   <p>The splendid gift of Mr. and Mrs. Albert D. Lasker to the University of Chicago of $1,000,000 is much in print. This sum will found the "Lasker Foundation for Medical Research," the chief aim of which will be to inquire into the diseases of the middle-aged. Mr. Lasker has not loaded his gift with definite conditions, which discoveries in the future may obviate, but has given the medical authorities of the university medical schools carte blanche, with the understanding that the first work of the fund will be along the lines he has indicated.</p>
   <p>Physicians point out that while the average life span has been considerably lengthened during the past years, this has come about chiefly through the reduction of infant mortality, and the proper handling of epidemics. The diseases of the middle-aged are as virulent and as unchecked as ever, and some are even on the increase, due to the complexities of modern life. If the Lasker Foundation for Medical Research gives the world only a beginning into the science of certain diseases, it will more than serve its function.</p>
