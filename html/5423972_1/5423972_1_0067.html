   <p>As to the Jewishness of our institution and the extent to which we shall direct our program I have already spoken earlier in this report. I want here merely to give certain specific Jewish activities conducted during the past year. We have cooperated with the Jewish Education Committee in promoting the Circle of Jewish Children, which has participated in many club activities and holiday celebrations; assisted in registration of the Kodimah Hebrew School, which meets two days a week at the Institute. The Observer gave publicity to all Jewish education projects, such as the Hebrew School, the College of Jewish Studies, etc. Meetings of the Jewish Educational Committee were held at the Institute, also the High School Educational Society's meetings were held at the Institute, where the foundation for the organization of the High School Jewish Youth Movement was laid. The Jewish Youth, organ of the League, is sold at the Institute to students at reduced rates.</p>
   <p>I have already referred to the exhibitions of works of Jewish artists; <span class="page-break">2</span>also to the biblical backgrounds and Jewish themes woven into the program of the Institute's Jewish Art Workshop. We cooperate with young Judea in the development of a club program. Chicago young Judea held two large affairs at the Institute, one celebrating the opening of the university in Jerusalem, the other a holiday get together.
