   <p>The New York State Senate has rejected by an overwhelming majority a censorship bill, which would have made it a felony to have on one's book shelves any book containing as much as a single sentence, which the Puritan proponents might have thought obscene in any way. Thus a very serious attempt to legislate against freedom of expression in what may genuinely be considered as literature has been rejected. The remarkable fact about all attempts of censorship has been that the pornographic books that reached the millions of unsophisticated and mentally inferior people have never been censored, while the books of genuine literary merit, such as do not appeal to any but intellectually well-equipped and mature persons, have been the butt of all such criticism. Perhaps an ideal censor could be an asset to a community and a civilization, but until such a one is invented, for he cannot be found, the evils of censorship far outweigh the possible benefits that are claimed for <span class="page-break">\2</span>it by its advocates, men whose lives are always more drab than those of the authors who write the books that are objectionable to them.</p>
