   <p>A constructive step toward meeting educational needs in Chicago has been taken by the Jewish charities in engaging Dr. Alexander M. Dushkin, of New York City, for the coming year. Dr. Dushkin, acting together with a committee to be named for that purpose, will study the local situation with regard to Hebrew schools and other facilities for Jewish training, and endeavor to effect an adequate coordinated educational system.</p>
   <p>Dr. Dushkin and his associates, therefore, will, after a fashion, comprise our Board of Jewish Education. All interested in the proper training of our youth will hail this step with satisfaction.</p>
