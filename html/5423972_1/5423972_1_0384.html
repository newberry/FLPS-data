   <p>The Herzliah Hebrew School, one of the most prominent Hebrew school's of the city, has for three months now been lodged at the Institute. The school was first founded some ten years ago under the present name. It was adopted by another congregation and had its name changed for a time. It was returned to its present name again in 1927. When it became a distinct institution and was separated from its congregation, for a time it met at one of the schools in the neighborhood. There it had various difficulties of a space consideration.</p>
   <p>In October, it came to occupy its present quarters at our building and was united with the smaller Hebrew school which had existed at the Institute for some time. The purpose of the Herzliah Hebrew School has been to develop a fine type of an American Jew, well grounded in his peoples culture, sympathetic to its ideals, and with a sense of responsibility toward the cultural and social welfare of the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>At present, the school has an enrollment of about three hundred and fifty children, who get daily instruction except Friday and Saturday.</p>

   <p>The pupils are divided into fourteen classes. The instruction is given in Hebrew, (reading, writing and speaking;) the Pentatuch, Rashi, the Prophets, Jewish History, Jewish customs and ceremonies, Jewish current events and Jewish music.</p>
   <p>Besides the curricular work, the school includes also a number of extra curricular activities, which have the purpose of enriching the people's experience with respect to their impressions and knowledge of Jewish life and Jewish thought. One of these activities is singing. The children are being taught to sing Jewish songs in Hebrew, Jewish and English. The repertoire includes mainly, chants and folk songs of an educational value. Apart from that, there is the school chorus consisting of about sixty children with very good voices.</p>
   <p>Another activity is that of the Dramatic Club, embracing a Hebrew and English section. A third activity is that of the Kerenami. The children are urged to contribute weekly of their own money to a common fund, called Kerenami.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Three or four times a year delegates from all sections come together for a conference, where they decide on the apportionments to be given to the various institutions the world over.</p>
   <p>The fourth activity is that of arts and crafts. This is an attempt to approach Jewish life from an esthetic point of view. A closer connection and a more sympathetic attitude towards Jewish things is believed to be the result of this Jewish work. There are other groups, such as the Library Club, Geography Club, and so forth; Also doing very good work.</p>
