   <p>The Students Aid Society of the Hebrew Theological College, which consists of a group of women whose aim it is to help students of the Torah, gave a dinner recently which was "different" than the usual run of the mine. The speakers were few, brief and timely. Mrs. Jacob Shapiro, acting president, gave a very interesting talk on the activities of the society as well as a brief resume of the future plans.</p>
   <p>Though the proceedings were arranged and conducted by women, who are blessed with the proverbial nine measures of speech," the dinner, the speeches and the fine musical program all were completed at half-past ten o'clock. An unusual event, indeed.</p>
