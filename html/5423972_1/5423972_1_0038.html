   <p>The Jewish People's Institute has undertaken a tremendous piece of work which should receive the whole-hearted cooperation and support of all who are interested in the future of the Jewish youth of our great city. With the closing of Crane Junior College, a large number of Jewish boys and girls who have started out on a professional career are unable to continue their studies. Dr. Philip L. Seman, Executive Director of the Jewish People's Institute, realizes the necessity of helping these ambitious Jewish students of small means, and is organizing a first class Junior College where the curriculum will be of such high standing that credits will be given to graduates by acknowledged universities. For those residing in the immediate vicinity of the Jewish People's Institute, which is located at Douglas Boulevard and St. Louis Avenue, in the heart of the Lawndale district, this Junior College will be a God-send, as it will not only save them time and carfare, but also a considerable amount in fees which, to poor students, is an item of consequence. The fees at the Jewish People's Institute, for Junior College students, will be less than other similar institutions charge, while the curriculum will equal that of any of the accredited colleges.</p>
   <p>It is a move in the right direction and should be encouraged in every possible way.</p>
