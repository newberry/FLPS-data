   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>As a constant reader of the Jewish Courier, permit me to say a few words through your newspaper to the directors of the Talmud Torah (school of religious lore) of the West Side.</p>
   <p>I do not mean to criticize the Talmud Torah. On the contrary, my opinion is that it is conducted in the highest and best manner, with a fine principal and competent teachers. Everything is run in such an orthodox fashion that we can hardly expect anything better. But the one thing I do want to say is that we are lacking one Talmud Torah in which to educate children who, due to lack of space, are out on the streets, deprived of a Jewish education. I cannot describe how joyfully the people of our neighborhood welcomed the news when they heard that the Talmud Torah had purchased the lots on Winchester and Twelfth Street. This is the only place suitable for such <span class="page-break">\2</span>an institution because from Waller Street to Douglas Park, a district densely populated by Jews, there is no Talmud Torah except the one on Taylor and Lincoln Streets.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, however, a few years have already elapsed, and in the lots where these sacred buildings should have been erected, our children can be found playing ball and other such games on the Sabbath. A few weeks ago we had occasion to rejoice again upon reading an advertisement to the effect that the directors want contractors to build the Talmud Torah at the same place. Unfortunately, however, they still have not begun to build anything. I do not wish to criticize the directors of the Talmud Torah, but merely to ask them, "Why do you remain silent? Why aren't you doing anything? Perhaps you are afraid that twenty years hence this neighborhood will not be so densely populated with Jews. If this is the case, then why build synagogues or houses at all, because the Messiah may arrive soon and we will have to leave all our belongings behind. This neighborhood is most suitable for a Talmud Torah and is, at present, <span class="page-break">\3</span>populated by Jews. Therefore, we would like to see some fruits of your work soon. Leave an everlasting name for yourselves! Let our children also have something to remember you by! You will see that when you lay the foundation, the Jews of that district will co-operate fully. It would be better if you would begin immediately, because with the approach of the High Holidays, a vast sum of money could be raised."</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>S. Z.</p>
