   <p>The Board of Education of Chicago last March made an appropriation for the salaries of the school teachers of Chicago, which included an increase of some $82,000. This increase in teachers' salaries was never paid because as the superintendent of schools said, the funds were used also for other school purposes and were not sufficient to pay the increase at the same time. Now the Board has cancelled the increase altogether. They could have borrowed that money and have kept their promise to the teachers of Chicago, but they chose to go back on their promise. We think this is a sad comment on the Board's state of mind. The teachers of the public schools are perhaps the most efficient, the most hard-working body of men and women engaged by the municipality, and the repudiation of the promise held forth to them is bound to be discouraging to an underpaid profession, and is bound to hurt the school children of the city.</p>

   <p>We feel the Board should have acted otherwise, but perhaps the Board knows better than we, and think it more sensible to appropriate the money for legal experts than for the teachers of Chicago.</p>
