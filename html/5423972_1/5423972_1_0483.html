   <p>There are institutions still needed in our city. We have not reached the goal as yet; much is to be done to perfect our existing organizations, but new ones are needed. The common interest of Jews and Judaism is involved. We need a Hebrew Free School.</p>
   <p>The Cheder system is worse inthis city than in New York. The children degenerate through it and become indolent. There has been several months ago in connection with the Jewish Training School a movement made to organize an auxiliary society, which we believe was permanently organized. The members mostly consisted of Russian Jews, who were willing to contribute as much as it was in their power, but they wanted a Hebrew Free School. Several meetings were held, but it seems the last meeting everything went into oblivion. Is there no possibility of reviving it again?</p>
