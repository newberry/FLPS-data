   <p>On August 29, 1927, the second graduation exercises of the Rabbinical Department of the Hebrew Theological College will take place. The occasion is auspicious for the entire middle west as it indicates that the H. T. C. is rapidly becoming a vital source of traditional Judaism. Already it is firmly established as the Torah center of the West and is supplying the communities of the central and western parts of the U. S. with capable spiritual leaders.</p>
   <p>The graduation will be held at the Anshe Sholom Congregation, Independence Blvd. and Polk St. There are nine candidates for the Rabbinical Degree. All of them are American young men who have attended American colleges.</p>
