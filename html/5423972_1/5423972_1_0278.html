   <p>Motto: "He who watereth shall be watered again." Analytical Third Reader, p. 135.</p>
   <p>The above wise and highly suggestive passage came to our attention as we leaved through the book from which we quote above. This book contains the mental food which is offered our youngsters in the public schools. It contains something better than mental food: spiritual sweetmeats, for instance. Thus a little story of a boy who was so disconsolate because he had refused to indulge in the whim of his dying little sister, closes with this pious wish: "May the blessed Jesus so keep you, that you may never have to mourn" (p. 27). In verses on a wonderful little boy who had two hands, two feet, etc., that prodigy is praised because</p>
   <p>"The Lord's little servant</p>
   <p>He's trying to be." (p. 66)</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>And in a morning hymn sung to the peculiar One-Three Divinity of Christianity, the children are made to pray:</p>
   <p>"My sins forgiven,</p>
   <p>And let me live,</p>
   <p>Blest Saviour, near Thy side." (p. 82)</p>
   <p>The following piece from the Second Reader of the same analytical series is disgustingly repulsive to non-Christians:</p>
   <p>"Would my little reader be beautiful in heaven? Go to the same fountain, drink of the same spirit, love the same Jesus, and you shall go to that beautiful land and be an angel there. There, all tears shall be wiped away; and there will be no more sorrows and crying; neither shall anything enter that causeth fear.</p>
   <p>O, who would not love Jesus</p>
   <p>And dwell with Him above,</p>
   <p>Where sorrow never enters</p>
   <p>Where all is peace and love?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We do not believe that this manner of spreading belief in Jesus is quite in harmony with the spirit of a strictly non-sectarian education for which alone our public schools may claim the support of the people at large.</p>
