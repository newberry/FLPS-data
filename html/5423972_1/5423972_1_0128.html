   <p>The outbreak of an anti-Semitic movement among the students of the University of Syracuse furnished the Jewish press with considerable material for a discussion of the cause of the sudden Judaphobia within the American colleges. None of the newspapers explained the cause of anti-Semitism in the universities of this country. the leaders of the Syracuse movement gave a local reason for their attack on the Jewish students and for their demand that the University establish a quota restricting the number of Jews to be admitted. They claim that Jews haven't the slightest interest in sports, and are, therefore, not desirable students for American universities.</p>
   <p>True, the question can be raised as to whether universities have been created for the advancement of gymnasts, pugilists, and wrestlers, or for scientific <span class="page-break">2</span>research. If we accept the arguments of the academic anti-Semites, i.e., that Jews neglect sports, our critics will have to admit that in the realm of learning, the Jewish students are among the most competent and diligent. The Jewish students, however, defend themselves by attempting to prove to their Syracuse foes that the accusations are false; that they are real athletes, just like their Christian colleagues. Our press ridicules such apologies and attacks the arguments of the Jewish students. It [Jewish press] believes that the arguments that have been made about sports are merely empty pretexts, and that if Jewish students were superior athletes, they would be persecuted for other reasons.</p>
   <p>We cannot wholly agree with the point of view taken by the New York Jewish press. Sports on the campus of the University of Syracuse may be a side attraction, but the [average] intelligent youth of America considers sports an organic part of academic life, an everyday necessity for his physical and mental development. He feels sports to be part of the culture of the <span class="page-break">3</span>people. That is why the American athlete has as much respect for well-known Jewish athletes as for Irish or Negro athletes because he [the American athlete] considers them national heroes; he feels that they represent American physical culture--that they are ornaments of American society. He has more respect for athletes than for American scientists because science is international, and the majority of scientists are not Americans. In America, athletics are more highly developed than they are elsewhere and are thought of as the national pride and wealth of the country.</p>
   <p>The "Benny Leonards" will never arouse any hatred or envy among their non-Jewish professional colleagues; they will receive honor and respect from their American admirers. American youth always respects the brave sons of their homeland; they will even respect Jews who are of foreign birth because their physical prowess is in conformity with one aspect of American culture, and increases the prestige [of the nation].</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>On the other hand, American youth is less interested in great scientists. It [the American youth] will sometimes pay homage to practical inventors or explorers, to the Edisons and Steinmetzs, but it does not respect theoreticians or philosophers because, in a certain sense, inventions and discoveries are technically developed forms of sport....</p>
   <p>Therefore, the arguments of the anti-Semites of the University of Syracuse can be disputed, but they cannot be entirely ignored. We also believe that Jewish students are active in sports, even though they are not as active as Gentile students. It may be true that the pretext given by the Syracuse anti-Semites is no more than an excuse to attack the Jews. Viewed objectively, however, these arguments, if they are based on fact, are not as unimportant as the New York Jewish press seems to think.</p>
   <p>The athlete occupies a unique position in the social life of America. A citizen who is not interested in sports, is not considered a full-fledged <span class="page-break">5</span>citizen. Perhaps this is intolerance, but human nature is stronger than ethical concepts. The heterogeneous character of a people brushes aside many accepted social principles and creates new ones which are more acceptable.</p>
   <p>Anti-Semitism in the University of Syracuse is, of course, a result of the general outbreak of Judaphobia in certain intellectual circles of American society. But the pretext given about the lack of interest in sports on the part of Jewish students cannot be ignored until we can refute the charge. Americans have a great respect for sports in general. If the Jewish students at the University of Syracuse were known to be good athletes, no one would dare to hound them and to demand restrictions upon their educational opportunities.</p>
   <p>Jewish "strength" would command more respect than Jewish "intellect". "Academic Benny Leonards" would not be threatened by anti-Semitism.</p>
