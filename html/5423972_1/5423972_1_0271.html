   <p>The first day of October marks an eposch in the history of the intellectual forces of our city. On that day, the new University of Chicago will begin its work.</p>
   <p>The Jews of this city have reason to be proud of this Institution. At a time when the whole plan seemed destined to miscarry, it was a social organization, whose membership exclusively consists of Jews, that came to the rescue. We have no doubt that, among the students, there will be many of our faith. Among the departments, we find courses in Semitic Literature and Philology.</p>
