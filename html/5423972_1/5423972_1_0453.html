   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>I hope you will grant me some space in your newspaper. Since many children are unable to come to our old club because it is too far from their homes, we have organized a branch called the Tzirie Adas Bnai Israel, Branch B" in the Congregation Yauneh, at the corner of Winchester and Roosevelt Streets where the meetings will be held every Sunday at 2 P.M. All children who are interested in belonging to our club, where the language, religion and history of the Jewish people are taught, are requested to come to our meeting, Sunday at 2 P.M.</p>
   <p>Those who wish to open a branch in their respective synagogues should apply to the Tzirie Adas Bnai Israel, 1133 W. 12th Street.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that our Jewish children will respond enthusiastically to such meetings where they will learn a great deal about the religion, language and history of their own people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>With fraternal regards to all children,</p>
   <p>Nathan Cohen,</p>
   <p>President, Tzirie Adas Bnai Israel.</p>
