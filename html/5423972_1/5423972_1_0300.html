   <p>Mr. E. Zeligman, 2789 Augusta Street, is the first Jew in Chicago to pass the examination given by the Board of Education as high school teacher of Hebrew.</p>
   <p>This step was the result of the work of Mr. H. Lipsky, who four years ago started a campaign for Hebrew as one of the subjects in the examination of high school teachers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zeligman is a Ph. B. of the University of Chicago and a teacher in the Hebrew school at the Home for the Aged.</p>
   <p>It is expected that for the next semester he will be selected as Hebrew teacher for one of the Chicago high schools.</p>
