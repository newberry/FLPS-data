   <p>Hannukah coming while the drive for Jewish War Relief was on, the pupils by vote, decided to do without their usual gift of a box of candy and instead donated that money to the War Relief Fund. In addition they gave and collected about $700.00</p>
   <p>The contributions of the pupils on the first Sunday of each month to the "Help a Child League" amounted to $70.00 for the year.</p>
   <p>The money is used by this league to pay for the services of a nurse for children at the summer camp for crippled children at Brown's Lake.</p>
