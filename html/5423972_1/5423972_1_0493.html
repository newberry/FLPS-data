   <p>Our Russian and Polish Jews are gradually moving forward in the matter of educating their children and furnishing to the poor and indigent means to send their offspring to religious schools. A piece of ground ( and a two story building thereon), of 25x110 feet, valued at $5,400 has been secured and is located at 71 Judd Street.....The children sent there, will be taught by capable teachers in the elementary branches of English and Hebrew and also in religious instruction.</p>
   <p>It is understood that this school is to be known as the Moses Montefiore Free Hebrew School, and will be supported by all the Russo-Polish citizens and members of congregations and societies.</p>
