   <p>Mrs. Young, superintendent of schools in Chicago, devised a new course for the public schools of the Chicago Board of Education. Like every new project, this course received strong opposition from some members of the Board who are very little posted on this new program on education for children, a program which is being considered not only in Chicago and throughout the rest of this country, but also in all civilized parts of the world. New ways and better means are now being sought everywhere to instruct children with such greater efficiency as will yield better results.</p>
   <p>Pointing to the historical development of the public school in her discourse on March 6, Mrs. Young proved that at its very inception the public schools embraced a broad program of study. In time new subjects such as music, art, and construction work, were also introduced. These new cultural subjects, however, did not bring unity into the curriculum of the schools, at least not to the extent where they could effect the cultural development of the children.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>They have, however, satisfied to a certain extent the children's impulse for art, which can be seen from the fact that ever since these subjects were introduced, the children have stopped writing on the walls and carving the desks and chairs. Nevertheless, the public realizes that the schools are far from perfection, and a proof of it is that there are more than one hundred thousand people who send their children to parochial schools. Parochial schools, according to Mrs. Young's personal investigation, constitute, thanks to their religious aims, a great element of culture. They develop the soul and the fantasy of children, the very thing which wealthier citizens demand.</p>
   <p>When art and handicraft were first brought into the public schools, they were viciously denounced on the assumption that public schools need teach only such subjects as will be utilizable to the child later in life.</p>
   <p>The first school for the poor, founded in New England, instituted sewing as one of its subjects. However, no sooner had this school been transformed into a public shcool that sewing was ostracized.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Truthfully, public opinion at the time already favored unlimited subjects for immediate use as the best means of instruction. They contended that if children were only taught the most necessary subjects, they would only have to view schools as preparatory places for the factory. The school's mission is to develop the child's soul and glorify his sentiments.</p>
   <p>This is especially more important in large cities than in small towns and rural communities where the environment is less exacting. In small communities the children are actually bound to nature, whereas in a large city the only place where children can learn anything about nature, before stepping into practical life, is the school.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Young also points to a historical phenomenon in the public schools, a phenomenon which throws light on her deep observations as superintendent of public schools in a large city. She shows that the antiquated methods of teaching tend to degrade the character of the teachers and corrupt their abilities. As long as the courses are wide in range and confined to one teacher, she or he simply becomes an automat. Should the teacher possess a <span class="page-break">\4</span>certain inclination or talent for a particular subject, it goes to waste because she is not given the opportunity to practice it.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Young maintains that the only way to improve this condition is to employ the least number of subjects in public schools at a time. Five subjects would lead to unify theory and practice, which would rise children to greater heights in education. The five subjects should be divided into three fundamental and two cultural. Physical culture should be an additional subject.</p>
   <p>Such a course will improve the condition of public schools a great deal. It will also enable the teachers to do more efficient work, because they shall have the opportunity to teach the subjects for which they are best qualified. Although it is believed that Chicago has one of the finest teaching staffs in the country, it will still improve by this system. The children will not become tired of their school work. They will no longer consider their studies a burden.</p>
   <p>The new program of the public school courses is based throughout on the <span class="page-break">\5</span>foundation to change courses now prevailing in schools, so that the children may develop in every sense; that there should no longer exist any subnormal classes. If the child is poor in arithmetic, he may however be very good in another subject. If pupils are segregated into lower classes, they then assume an inferior attitude, which has a bad effect on their mental condition.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Young desires to introduce the most modern and improved methods on education for children. She is, however, encountering many obstacles because in no other thing is society so backward as in matters concerning children's education. This should not stop her from fighting until her plans are adopted in the public schools.</p>
