   <p>In eighty-two synagogues throughout the city appeals for the Vaad Ha' Yeshivoth, to aid in the support of the Yeshivoth of Europe and Palestine were made on the High Holidays. Rabbis and congregation officials stressed the work of the Yeshivoth in the preservation of Judaism and a substantial sum was pledged by Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>The noted "Chofetz Chaim," immediately prior to his death wrote a letter to the Vaad Ya' Yeshivoth, emphasizing the need for the successful continuation of its work. It was among the last requests of the "Zadik" that the Jews of Chicago aid in the preservation of the Torah. To do this it is requested that the pledges be fulfilled as soon as possible either at the respective synagogues or at the office of the Vaad Ha' Yeshivoth, 3244 Grenshaw Street.</p>

   <p>Rabbi Ezriel Epstein, chairman of the Vaad, announced that several synagogues, owing to circumstances, have delayed making their customary appeal until Shmini Atzereth. He urged these synagogues to do their utmost on that occasion to ensure the success of the appeal to discharge their obligation to the thirty great centers of Jewish learning in Europe and Palestine.</p>
