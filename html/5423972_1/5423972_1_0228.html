   <p>It is a well-known fact that the Reform rabbis of the "old school," especially those who have neither learned nor forgotten anything since they were ordained as rabbis, are extreme anti-Zionists. The accusation made by these "representatives of the people," that the Zionists are disloyal to their adopted country, is also well known. Reform rabbis frequently pour out their wrath upon the Zionists for retarding the process of assimilation advocated by the Reform congregations who believe in the "melting pot" theory. The Zionists and the general Jewish public are so accustomed to hearing these charges made, that they merely laugh at them. In fact, the remarks made by these bourbons [i. e., by the anti-Zionist Reform rabbis] affect the Jewish public as much as the sullenness of an old, decrepit man affects the views of a youth who refuses to allow the world to remain unchanged and advocates changes in it.</p>
   <p>The latest complaint, or better still, accusation, comes from one of the great bourbons--Rabbi T. Schanfarber. He accuses the Chicago Zionists of seeking <span class="page-break">\2</span>to abolish the public schools and of desiring to establish parochial schools in their place. We do not know where [the rabbi] secured this information, but we do know that this idea is contradictory [to the essentials] of Zionism. Only the ultra-Orthodox group is in favor of establishing parochial schools. They, like the patriotic reformers who are at the other extremity as far as religious doctrines are concerned, are anti-Zionists.</p>
   <p>The Zionists are, however, opposed to parochial schools or to any type of religious school. They believe that religion and nationalism are two separate matters that the further apart they are, the better it is. The Zionists are satisfied with the theory put into practice by Mrs. Ella Flagg Young [the superintendent of schools in Chicago] of developing and encouraging the national spirit [of the children] of the various nationalities that attend the Chicago [public schools]. Classes have been organized in the schools in which the language, history, ethics, and legends of the various nationalities are taught. The Zionists are assisting Mrs. Young in organizing the Jewish classes. If Rabbi Schanfarber has any complaint to make about this matter, he should direct <span class="page-break">\3</span>it to Mrs. Young. He certainly should not feel slighted if the Zionists recognize Mrs. Young as a greater authority on the subject of children's education than even he, the honored rabbi of Kehilath Anshe Mayriv.</p>
   <p>We think that it is not correct to say that the demands of the ultra-Orthodox groups, who wish to establish Jewish parochial schools, are entirely wrong. When people are willing to dedicate their lives to religion, they will surely not hesitate to sacrifice their patriotism. If the ultra-Orthodox groups became estranged from their faith, they would not continue to exist in America--in fact, the whole issue would disappear.</p>
