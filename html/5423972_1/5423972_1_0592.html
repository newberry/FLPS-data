   <p>The annual report of the American-Jewish Committee ends in an optimistic atmosphere, stating that anti-Semitic propaganda in America is becoming weaker. Perhaps they have facts to prove it. I imagine that this committee keep a record of all anti-Semitic literature published in America and compare the amount of books, articles, and other literature of last year with the amount of the year previous thus ascertaining the trend. It must be that way, because I fail to see any other system whereby this fact could be determined.</p>
   <p>But I doubt that the increase or decrease in anti-Semitic propaganda can be measured by the amount of books and other literature published in a given period. Sometimes a small anti-Semitic book can spread more anti-Semitism than a hundred large ones.</p>
   <p>Anti-Semitism in America is exceptionally hard to measure. American anti-Semitism has a mixture of foreign hatred, and it is hard to tell where the foreign hatred ends and anti-Semitism begins.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>In relation to the Ku Klux Klan, it is not clear to this day whether their hatred toward Catholics is stronger than toward Jews. Nevertheless, the question whether anti-Semitic propaganda in America is becoming more or less powerful, or is gaining or losing strength, is not so important.</p>
   <p>The amount of propaganda is an unreliable factor, one year it is smaller or larger than the next, depending on conditions. Anti-Semitism may grow an become powerful even if propaganda is weak. It is even possible that anti-Semitic propaganda is only relaxing, especially at a time when anti-Semitism has expanded and become strong.</p>
   <p>But how can the strength or weakness of anti-Semitism be measured? Not two individuals can feel the effects of anti-Semitism in the same degree or in the same manner. Dr. Stephen Wise and Rabbi Shulman can see in the book Hunch, Punch and Joel an example of pure anti-Semitism, while others would not even find a trace of it in it.</p>
   <p>Anti-Semitism in America is manifested socially, that is, there are many who do not care to associate with Jews in social life, but who will consider <span class="page-break">3</span>it improper to utter insulting remarks against them. On the contrary, they will treat the Jews with the utmost courtesy, will transact business, and be connected in political relations, but when it comes to social life, they draw a line. Socially they do not like the Jews.</p>
   <p>Social anti-Semitism does not bother us in the least, (when I say 'us' I mean the Jewish intellectual) because the Jewish merchants and peddlers have in general no conception of social anti-Semitism. . . . . The Gentiles whom our Jewish intellectual comes in contact with, are just the sort who appreciate the company of their Jewish acquaintances.</p>
   <p>With the Jews of the American-Jewish committee it is entirely different; they suffer particularly from social anti-Semitism. The Gentiles whom these Jews come in contact with in business or politically, are just that class who do not like the Jew socially.</p>
   <p>To me, for instance, it is of little concern whether or not a yacht club admits Jews as members. I do not suffer from that sort of anti-Semitism because I have no yacht or even dream of ever having one.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>But there are Jews who have yachts. To them, the yacht club's anti-Semitism hurts very much. On the other hand, they don't suffer from the anti-Semitism that refuses to rent them an apartment in some buildings, because they themselves would not rent any apartments in their own buildings to Jews.</p>
   <p>In general, America possesses a portion of anti-Semitism. I believe also that anti-Semitism is spreading and gaining strength, because the role that the Jews play in America becomes more significant. However, I also believe that very often we picture anti-Semitism in America much darker than it really is.</p>
   <p>When we speak of anti-Semitism, it is not how much this or the other Gentile dislikes Jews, but to what extent that hatred can harm Jews.</p>
   <p>There are also Jews who dislike Gentiles, but the Gentiles are not bothered about that; they are not worried about this or the other Jew disliking them.</p>
   <p>We, here in Chicago, for instance, are very little interested in the Poles, who dislike Jews. We know that the hatred of the Poles cannot harm us, but we are very much alarmed when Americans dislike us because their hatred may <span class="page-break">5</span>result in much suffering for us.</p>
   <p>As to what extent do the Jews in America suffer through anti-Semitism, I believe that we are exaggerating conditions and seeing things darker than what they are in reality.</p>
