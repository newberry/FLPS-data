   <p>Chicago is blessed with a number of excellent institutions devoted to Jewish culture. Foremost among these is the Modern Hebrew School of the Caligraph A. Rubenstein, located at 1261 N. Lincoln street. Mr. Rubenstein has distinguished himself as an admirable instructor in the teachings of Israel.</p>
   <p>Sabbath is observed with great solemnity at the school. Every pupil is required to attend the morning prayer meeting. In the afternoon, the children again congregate and Mr. Rubenstein relates to them Biblical stories and myths. After the pupil has finished the course prescribed, he receives a diploma written and signed by the caligraph and a noted rabbi.</p>
