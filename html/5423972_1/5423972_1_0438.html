   <p>If a nation wishes to become great and powerful, it must not only strengthen its army and navy which would be inadequate in itself, but it must also build schools, develop its language, illumine its history and implant its ideologies and traditions into the hearts of its people.</p>
   <p>History tells us that the Romans built schools in every country that they conquered. In these schools the vanquished were taught the Roman (Latin) language and Roman customs in order that friendship toward the Roman people might be imbued in them, and also that they might consider themselves citizens of the Roman Empire.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We need not go so far back into history to find examples of this nature. The same thing can be witnessed at the present time right here in the United States where we live. In this country vast sums of money are allocated to the various institutions of learning, especially public schools. We Americans are always trying to develop the educational system to a higher and higher degree. Fedagogues are constantly devising methods to simplify and make education accessible for children.</p>
   <p>If the American people who are politically powerful put so much weight on the dissemination of their language, history, and literature, then how much weight should be put on the same by a people who have lost their political power, having as their only bulwark in life their language, history, and literature?</p>
   <p>It is therefore very painful to see how our national language, Hebrew, is being steadily forgotten among us Jews. Our history and literature are like a closed <span class="page-break">3</span>book, and our traditions and characteristics are being engulfed into the stream of life in general. The question of education is of prime importance to those who cherish the existence of our people.</p>
   <p>The stronghold of a people is their schools and should we desire to ascertain a nation's strength and durability, we must examine its educational system. When we consider the system and order of Jewish education here in America, we acknowledge the fact, that the stronghold of our people is very weak. If we do not strengthen it in due time, then we will be confronted by a grave, national danger.</p>
   <p>Jewish parents allow their children to go through an unsystematic course of study which deadens the latter's interests in Jewish studies. Among no other people is the system of children's education so careless and negligent as it is among us. Every boor and ignoramus among Jews undertake to become a teacher.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The children who receive discipline in public schools quickly withdraw their affections from the ineffectual Jewish studies as they not exist. The teachers do not know what they teach the children, nor do the children know what they learn from the teacher. It is painful to see how parents rejoice when their Barmitzvah son chants the confirmation exercises and repeats a memorized speech. This is no more than throwing sand in our own eyes. Not love, but rather abhorrence to Judaism is instilled in the heart of a child through such a system. The chaos within the Jewish educational system is due to many reasons. One reason is that we lack a definite program of education. Co-ordination in both the old-fashioned school and modern school is non-existent. If a child is transferred from one school to another, he encounters a different course of study, because every teacher has a different system of teaching. The result of this is tragic, because the child becomes confused and can never derive any benefit from this studies.</p>
   <p>There is no relationship whatever between the Jewish home and the Jewish School.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The parents do not know what their duties are toward their people and children.</p>
   <p>Such evil, such anarchy exists everywhere. It exists also among us in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In order to introduce order and a definite program into the Jewish educational system here in Chicago, Mr. S. B. Maximan, who is now principal of the Hebrew School at the Hebrew Institute, has worked out a sound program for Jewish education in our city, and he hopes that our welfare workers will co-operate with him in his work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Maximan's program consists of the following points: "Unity must prevail in the various Jewish institutions of learning. A clearly outlined program should be drawn up for the curriculum. A number of schools worthy of the name must be established.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"For this purpose a committee of examiners should be organized to give out diplomas to students who pass the examinations.</p>
   <p>"A teacher's training school should be founded with two objectives: one, to train teachers for American-born children of Jewish parentage; two, to provide continuation courses for teachers coming from eastern Europe.</p>
   <p>"Parent organizations should also be organized with a view toward explaining to parents the present condition of Jewish schools and to enlighten them on the problems of education.</p>
   <p>"A kindergarten should also be founded. And in every possible way the school should become the focal point of the student's life.</p>
   <p>"A library containing Hebrew and Yiddish books, as well as a club for boys and girls of thirteen years and over, should be established.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>"Art should be introduced into the Jewish school."</p>
   <p>Mr. Maximan believes that the Hebrew Institute is the only place in Chicago that could serve as a model school for the entire country, because it has all the necessary conveniences, such as large, airy rooms, a playground, and particularly, the good will of the management to assist in this undertaking.</p>
   <p>Now it is up to our welfare workers to become interested in this plan. If they do, we cannot see why it should not materialize.</p>
   <p>No one will dare to defend the course of study as it is now, because all facts speak against it. The facts are that the Jewish children of our city grow up without any knowledge of the Hebrew language, Jewish history, or literature.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>It is our great national obligation to do something about Jewish education which we have so grossly neglected.</p>
   <p>It is said that Moses received the Torah on Mt. Sinai and handed it down to Joshua and Joshua to the Elders and the Elders to the members of the Great Assembly. The Jewish erudition was passed from one generation to the other. Therefore, at all times a person should feel as though the Torah were given personally to him at Mt. Sinai. But do we now, in this generation, pass the Torah on to our children? None will dare say yes.</p>
   <p>Only by upholding Jewish education can we continue our existence as a people. This is the elixir which has been imbued within our souls and which has strengthened and fortified us forever. Because it is the basis of our existence, the question is not a simple one. If Jewish education in Chicago improved through the efforts of our welfare workers, they will be compensated with honor and recognition.</p>
