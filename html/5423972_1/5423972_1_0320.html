   <p>Max Epstein of Chicago donated $1,000,000 to the University of Chicago for the erection of an art building, it was announced Saturday by Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the university.</p>
   <p>The entire $1,000,000 is to be spent on a building, which will be near the new chapel of the university. Mr. Epstein suggests that the institute shall have a board of trustees apart from that controlling the university, but shall include in an interlocking directorate interested member of the university board, and shall not be a department of the university.</p>
   <p>The reason is that a fund to assure operation of the institute, as a teaching and research school, must be obtained independently of the construction foundation. Such a board of trustees is now being formed by Mr. Epstein and Dr. Hutchins. One of the duties of that board will be to obtain money.</p>
