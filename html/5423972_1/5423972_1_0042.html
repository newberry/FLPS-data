   <p>The University of Chicago has prepared a new plan for its students and faculty and in a year will put the plan into operation. The essential elements in the plan seem to be the encouragement of the students, each according to his capacity, shortening or lengthening (and we imagine the latter only within reason) the term of residence at the university, and the cultivation in each student of the special aptitudes that he may have. Both of these details are necessary in our present social system, and for both of them there will have to be necessary checks.</p>
   <p>It has been clear for a long time that our whole educational process is wasteful in two directions at least. In the first, it has become increasingly evident that students enter the university for whom a college education will prove a very expensive luxury. Family pride, based on a very worthy family, dictates that the children shall have a college education. Some benefit very greatly. They grasp the sense of world culture and find for themselves the tools, and gain the ability to use them, tools that will be theirs for the rest of their lives. The possession of these tools will make understanding men and women, <span class="page-break">2</span>capable of keeping abreast with the developments in human thinking and achievement. They may make their livelihood out of the use of these tools and may be inspiring teachers. Or they may enter industry, but they will always have the safety valve for their lives, a hobby if it has to be, of general culture. If they are not in the teaching profession, they help build up the general culture of a community. Their college education will prove to be a good investment, not only to themselves, in the enrichment of their lives, but also to the community at large.</p>
   <p>But there will always be those in our present system, who will just enter by the skin of their teeth (by the way, a good Biblical quotation) and who at their shrewdest will select what students call "cinch" courses and will somehow or other come out of the university with a degree. The elective system, introduced by the late Charles Eliot and overdone by most universities, until the extent of the evil was seen, made the paths of these "cinch" students easy. There were lecture courses on subjects in which students could bluff it through, subjects that just gave long names to phenomena that people learn about in ordinary conversation. In the meantime, for the very important four years of their lives, when habits were being formed, not for childhood but for manhood, <span class="page-break">3</span>such students were learning how to be wasteful of time and how to fill up a precious day with next to nothing. The training for them is disastrous and all the harshness of the present up-building of the university is due to the fact that these students must and should, sooner or later, better sooner, be eliminated from the records of the university. It would have been far better for these students never to have entered the university, not because they did not learn something, they did - but they would have done very much better for themselves if they had gone immediately into industry and subjected themselves to the exacting time clock.</p>
   <p>Some of us have come to the conclusion that the universities were becoming entirely too popular and that a better way of lifting the educational system and increasing the educational possessions of the younger generations would be to make the university accept the most promising and the most capable, but to lengthen the high school course for all children by a year or two. In other words, the work of the high schools should be crowded and with the addition of a year, the equivalent in text-book knowledge of two years at the university, might be given all children. After that they can go to work, or if they are gifted, go to the university.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>And most of us have come to the conclusion that the whole course of education, certainly for professional life, was too long. The years represented a tremendous drain upon the energy of the students and parents. And if this system allows students to work as they can work, there will be a possibility (of course within reason) for students to finish their preparatory work a little sooner. But there ought to be a warning. At worst the stay of four years at a university is not a total loss. There is some such thing as being subjected to the companionship of those who have culture. There is a spiritual and educational sunning which a generation ought to have to make it appreciate the whole course of the human line. One cannot just substitute sun-lamp for sunlight. One can not just drill through a university. There is an advantage in letting the culture sink in, at least in letting the various subjects get a coordination. Students ought to live with their culture so as to absorb and give it the proper place in their lives. In such a case, hurrying a student through the university will give him outward possession and not inner mastery of the subjects.</p>
   <p>Of course the new method will put a strain on the students. It will put them on their own, so to speak, and the testing of the comprehensive examination at the end will tell, and only then, if, while they were on their own, they have <span class="page-break">5</span>really grasped the things they were supposed to have. But the teachers in such a system will have to be alert at every turn, and will have to be more than examiners on text books. Students can be selected that will fit into the system, out of the hosts of applicants for admission, but teachers of the sort required will have to be slowly developed. It may even be that the weakness of the system will be developed, not because of the failure of the students, but through the failure of the faculty. Students will take their comprehensive examinations but it is really the faculty that will be examined.</p>
   <p>And just one more paragraph. The University of Chicago thinks it has something new in the elastic time schedule of the residence of students of the university. It is old. The old Yeshivah, as it was known in the Jewish communities, had the system hundreds of years ago. Students were admitted to the Rabbinical School and they began their studies and their work. When they were ready for examination they presented themselves to the examiners. Some students made the examination in two years, some in ten. It would be interesting to know why, in American Jewish life, we dropped the old method and accepted the American method, only to find that the advanced educational planning of America goes back to the method of the Yeshivah.</p>
