   <p>A short time ago, the Federation of Chicago School Teachers published in the Chicago press, a declaration, in the form of a paid advertisement, showing with many strong and logical arguments why the parents sending children to school should be explicitly against the proposed "Platoon System" which the new Superintendent is trying to put into operation in the public schools of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The members of the Chicago School Board, who are part of the powerful political machine of the present city government, uphold the Superintendent <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and support him in his plan to establish the "Platoon System." Thousands of Chicago school teachers are openly against this "platoon" plan, and in their fight against it, they are being supported by all organized workers of Chicago, through their representatives in the Chicago Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>Again, on the other hand, we see certain capitalistic newspapers strongly supporting the Superintendent's new plan. The one fact alone, that those supporting the plan receive free space in the newspapers and those opposing it have to publish their explanations in paid advertisements, is in itself sufficient proof of the partiality of the reactionary press even if it is not mentioned editorially.</p>

   <p>First of all, let us explain as briefly as possible, in the limit space of a light article, what is the Platoon System. They want to establish in the Chicago schools; then we will see why the teachers are so strongly opposed to it.</p>
   <p>Chicago has long been suffering a shortage of school buildings. The schools existing now are overcrowded, and tens of thousands of school children are as a result, forced to stay away from school half days, just because there is not sufficient room for them.</p>
   <p>This great problem exists not only in Chicago, but in many other large cities, particularly in the Middle West, where the population, for the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>last twenty years has been steadily increasing. Along with the increase in population, the city itself naturally expanded to a great extent. Tens of thousands of houses were built, whole tracts of land that until not long ago had ever been trespassed human beings were built up. All those who built the new houses, and even those who did not build but who bought a few lots in one of these vicinities where new streets have been laid, must have paid large sums in taxes for the improvement made by the city, as for instance, sidewalks, sewers, and paved streets. The vast growth of of the population required the erection of new schools. This is as necessary an improvement as sidewalks and street pavements. But for this improvement, they run short of funds. The owners of houses the values of which increased to hundreds of millions, and those who have gained wealth as a result of the vast growth of the population, never were taxed even <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>one per cent of the real value of their wealth. Besides, you should not forget the fact that every city administration, squandered millions for graft, so that when the question of building schools was brought up there just simply was no money.</p>
   <p>Then, what is to be done about it? How can this problem be solved? There are two answers. One is to fill the classrooms with twice as many children as they can seat, with one teacher in charge of four or five classes, instead of one, in the same room; the remainder of the children waiting for a few hours outside the classrooms and in the school auditorium, like a flock of sheep, until the classroom is vacated. This will work like one mass-meeting after another. According to this system, one teacher will have to teach from five to six hundred children instead of seventy-five. The result will be that the teachers will not be able to teach their own classes properly.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>This, in short, explains the "Platoon System" the Superintendent is trying to introduce, and which is being supported by the members of the School Board.</p>
   <p>The second answer to this serious problem is, given by the teachers, who are supported by every right-thinking citizen in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The teachers claim there is only one way to solve this problem, and that is to build more schools. They emphasize the fact that this "Platoon System" will positively have an injurious influence, both spiritual and physical, upon the school children. The teachers still have in mind the total failure of the experiment that was made in the cities of the Middle West.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Let the owners of houses, whose value amount to hundreds of millions of dollars not try to wiggle out of paying taxes, say the teachers. The city will then have more than enough money to build more schools instead of having to introduce a system that will bring more harm than good to the children.</p>
   <p>It is hard to say which of the two sides will triumph but of one thing we are positive, that if this question be left to the citizens of Chicago, so that they may have the last word in it and through a vote decide whether they want a "platoon system" or not, they will surely support the teachers and decide in their favor and against the Superintendent and the politicians who support him.</p>
