   <p>The Hebrew School is open daily except Friday and Saturday, from 4.00 to 6.00 PM, and Sunday from 10.00 to 12.00 AM. A fee of $2.00 per month is charged for each child. Rabbi Morris Levine is principal of the school. He may be seen at his office in Room 25 on the second floor any day when the school is open, between 3:45 and 4:30 PM, and on Sunday from 9:30 to 10:15 AM.</p>
   <p>Religious instruction in a casual manner does not satisfy the conservative element of our people, especially so when the Hebrew education of the boy is concerned. For this reason, the Sabbath school with one or two short sessions per week, is merely tolerated on the West Side. Poor people, laborers, who can hardly support their families, make the greatest sacrifice for the Hebrew education of their children.</p>
   <p>It is not a rare thing for a poor man to pay from $4.00 to $6.00 per month for the tuition of his child, in what is called a Cheder (Religious School). Jewish families will deny themselves the necessities of life but will not forget the religious education of their child. It is a well-known fact that informer times <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Chedar was the greatest factor in the moral training of the Jewish youth; in fact, in the Old-World today, in countries where the Jewish children are excluded from the public schools, the Chedar is still the moral safeguard of the Jewish boy and young man. It is different however, in this country. Thanks to the school-system the Cheder in America, if it is not to repel the child, must be conducted on methods improved upon those in Europe; it must be more in accordance with the system of education in secular schools. The vernacular should be the vehicle for conveying to the child the meaning of the Hebrew Language, the Jewish History, etc.</p>
   <p>The teacher must have a knowledge of pedagogies and the laws of hygiene and sanitation must be strictly observed in the rooms of the Chedar. Unfortunately, the average Chedar throughout the country has not been adjusted to the conditions under which the Jewish child lives in America. The teacher, while a Hebres scholar and versed in Jewish lore, is, as a rule, not able to speak the language of the country, and has no knowledge of modern methods of education. The child does not, for this reason, derive the full religious and moral benefit of the instructions from the Chedar.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>To reconcile the old with the new, to inspire the child with Jewish ideals, the Hebrew Institute has opened a Hebrew School, where the child will be given a thorough training in the Hebrew language, besides a complete course in Jewish History and literature. The school will be conducted in accordance with modern methods.</p>
   <p>The studies are arranged in a six-years course, to meet the needs of children from 8-years to 14-years of age.</p>
   <p>The children of the Hebrew School will also be expected to attend the Sabbath Mincha Services (Evening Prayers) for Children, Saturday afternoons at 3 o'clock. As far as possible, the Hebrew School is to be made self-supporting. For this reason a fee of $2.00 per month is charged for each child.</p>
   <p>The school opened on Sunday, October 17th, and on the day of the writing of this (October 29) the attendance has already reached the number of 100.</p>
   <p>As soon as the Hebrew School is put on a firm basis, the Sabbath School conducted at the Institute during the past year, will be reopened for children whose parents do not insist upon a thorough training in Hebrew, and do not want to have their children attend religious school more than once, or at the most, twice a week.</p>
