   <p>We have visited some of our Sabbath schools and in nearly all of them we noticed the lack of good and capable teachers. Even the richest and most prominent of our congregations engage one or two efficient instructors for the higher classes, the rest of the work being entrusted to young girls who know hardly enough of Judaism and Jewish history to satisfy their own doubts in matters of religion and ethical questions. But we cannot deny the fact that the results of their labors are far from being satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Most of these lady teachers read the lessons to the children from useless books which are either written in too wretched or too high language. Reading a history lesson from a book, and a badly written one at that, is a very poor method, especially in the lower classes. Many of our congregations are too indifferent in regard to religious instruction. Many of our parents don't send their children at all to the Sabbath school, finding a ready excuse in the fact that very little is accomplished in these schools anyway.</p>
