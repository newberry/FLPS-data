   <p>One of the most important problems confronting us in America is that of people's education which embraces the conception of the history of this country, the character of various laws, and the development of national institutions. This problem assumes greater importance when speaking of our new Americans--those immigrants who have come recently to our shores.</p>
   <p>Most immigrants who come to our shores have no intention of returning, but rather intend to become a part of our large American nation and place themselves under the protection of our red, white, and blue flag which flutters over the multitude of families who have united themselves to our soil. Every single state of our country is, therefore, morally obligated to those of foreign birth who have come here as grown-ups not having had the opportunity to benefit from our public schools.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The obligation of each state consists in providing such people with an education, and acquainting them with those opportunities open to them in this country--especially with our history and Constitution, which has made our nation a model among nations.</p>
   <p>How, then, should this service be rendered to the future citizens of America? What should our big, wealthy city of Chicago do about this matter concerning the people? Chicago can furnish the entire country with an example in the problem of how to Americanize the foreign adult population if our Board of Education devised plans for increasing adult interest in becoming students of our schools where they can learn the English language, and particularly the history of this country. We must do this for our immigrants because we must exhibit friendship to them; we must guide them and "show them the country." just as we would show a good friend visiting us from New York our city institutions. The immigrants are also our guests and we must acquaint them with our land by means of our schools. What methods of education <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>should be applied in the case of our adults? It is a known fact--and whoever has attended the evening classes has undoubtedly noticed it--that adults are not satisfied with the courses of study. This is due to the fact that the teachers convey knowledge to them as they would to small children, and many are so discouraged that they drop their attendance at school entirely. If, however, the normal school would train special teachers for adults, the adults would show more interest in their studies.</p>
   <p>We must also manifest a personal interest in the education of our adults. Thus, it would be of great importance if our clubs and other organizations were to form visiting committees in the various neighborhoods to call upon adult students who have discontinued their schooling. In this manner, encouragement to continue their studies might be given them. It is axiomatic that when a person feels that someone else is interested in his progress, he will devote himself more zealously and ardently to the things that lead to his progress.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>May it also be known that Americanism and the English language are not one and the same thing, but rather two different things--two distinct spiritual guides, having nothing in common with each other. One may be a good American citizen, loyal to the Constitution of the country, loyal to its flag, and yet have a poor mastery of the English language. On the other hand, one might be well-versed in English and still be an undesirable citizen of "Uncle Sam's" country.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is not absolutely imperative that the courses in citizenship need be conducted especially in English for those who are unable to grasp the language properly. When a future citizen studies the Constitution in a language that he does not properly understand, he cannot have much interest in it. Therefore, it is far more important for our American citizens to study matters that concern them with heart and soul rather than to memorize words whose meaning remain incomprehensible. Also, it would be of merit if our Board of Education were to adopt entirely new methods of adult education for foreigners. As one of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>our new methods, motion pictures could be of service for that purpose.</p>
   <p>There are many foreigners who will never during their lifetime learn the English language well. The adult students would therefore attain immediate proficiency if their study of American history and American institutions were illustrated for them. Many films of an educational character, in which the masses display a keen interest, have already been produced. The [foreign] adult students will gain two things from this:</p>
   <p>1. After a hard day's toil the will be able to go to a school--which is a show--and simultaneously amuse themselves.</p>
   <p>2. Facts of various historical periods will be indelibly impressed on their minds.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>It is also highly important that the classes continue throughout the entire year, because when the study is disrupted the adult student loses his interest, neglecting it entirely the following year. It would be commendable for the Board of Education to encourage employers to form such classes for their workers.</p>
   <p>Have you ever heard the legend about the "philosopher's stone"? It concerns some sort of amulet which turns iron into gold. Nature does not recognize the validity of this, and we would consider a person who would set out to discover this stone a fool. But an amulet to develop the minds of people and to broaden their ideas is allowed by nature. And this is what we call the "philosopher's stone," which we should utilize for our great national educational structure.</p>
