   <p>The first Jewish day-school was established by the congregation K.A.M. of Chicago in 1853. It was the first school of its kind in the state of Illinois, and was located at Adams and Wells Streets. This day-school was in existance for twenty years, from 1853 to 1873. A number of non-Jewish teachers were engaged to instruct in the common English school branches, and Hebrew and German were taught by the reader and teacher of the congregation. In 1873 this day-school was discontinued, and a Sabbath school for religious instruction exclusively was established.</p>
