   <p>While it is a deplorable fact that only 12,000 out of 55,000 Jewish children of school age are receiving systematic instruction in Judaism in Chicago, it is a matter of pride on the part of the School Committee of Sinai, that almost 1200 or 10% are being educated by the three Religious Schools of Sinai. Our Religious School became so popular that it was necessary to open another on Saturday morning in addition to the one on Sunday morning and Saturday afternoon.</p>
   <p>Following Confirmation, we now have a full high school department and this year have added the first year of a teacher's training class which meets on Saturday morning at 11 o'clock. We now have children and young people connected with our school, from the age of six and twenty.</p>
