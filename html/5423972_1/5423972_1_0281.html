   <p>The board of the Jewish Educational Society held a meeting yesterday at the Sinai Synagogue, Indiana Avenue and 31st Street. Hermann Felsenthal acted as chairman, and explained that the purpose of the conference was to elect new officers and to consider building a new school. The following gentlemen were elected: Hermann Felsenthal, president; Lazarus Silvermann, vice-president; Michael Greenebaum, treasurer; J. W. Rubel, secretary. The problem involving the building of a new school was discussed at length, and the educational aspect was considered in particular. The question arose whether only Hebrew should be taught or other subjects included--sewing for girls, for instance. It was finally decided to refer the matter to a committee of four--Messrs. Felsenthal, Gersoni, Witkowski, and Greenebaum--and to give them authority to make the necessary arrangements.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Eleasoff, Silvermann, and Hexter were named members of the committee on lectures.</p>
   
   <p>The assembly then adjourned until December 21.</p>
