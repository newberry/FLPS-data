   <p>At the time of our last report the arrangement of the grounds for use of activities was still in process. Although already partially in use, it however, was fully ready and equipped for our 1911-12 activities.</p>
   <p>In accordance with our plans, indoor activities ceased with the annual meeting and the Summer curriculum began. While the sum expended on the grounds, $7,913.35, may sound rather large, yet, if one realizes the amount of labor involved in clearing of the grounds and much of the debris of the burnt building, and transforming a veritable desert into one of the most beautiful playgrounds in the county, with all equipments, the money seems well spent indeed, and much thanks is due to Mr. Jas. Davis, Chairman of the Committee on Grounds, and Mr. Jenkensen, Landscape Architect, under whose supervision this delightful transformation took place.</p>
   <p>The Summer curriculum embraced Morning Kindergarten, Domestic Art, Gardening, Story-Telling, Afternoon Games, Athletic Exercises, Sabbath Entertainments, Social Hour and familiar talks on Hygiene. Each division of the work is assigned to a competent leader, assisted by volunteers.</p>
   <p>The grounds were also used for outdoor concerts, childrens' picnics and outings. The tennis courts and baseball grounds were at all times occupied to full capacities by both children and adults. In addition to our own ground amusements, the children were taken to the Buffalo Bill Show, Soldiers Tournament, Aviation Meet, and to Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>On Labor Day, the Summer term ended only too soon, and all work was returned to the building, and with the return I am sure each mind rose to loftier heights and each heart beat more tenderly even for so short a contact with nature's realm. "Mighty things from small beginnings grow." How true may this prove, of the influence spread, even within our small domain: The Fall term opened with an overflowing registration taxing our physical capacity beyond the limit.</p>
   
   <p>The Education Committee, through the Chairman, Mr. Israel Cowen, reports that the English Department was opened in September with five classes, which were gradually increased to seven, but even that number was insufficient to meet the demands and registration had to be closed, and has remained so part of the Winter: Of the 747 pupils accommodated about 300 have organized themselves into an Educational League, whose purpose is educational and social.</p>
   <p>In the Kindergarten, two classes were formed instead of one, as we had last year. The attendance during the milder weather often running up to seventy. Many of these children are now in the first grade of the public school. In our Trade Schools we have had during the year, ninety-five different pupils, and the school is in a better condition than it was last year, in spite of the fact that the expenses of instruction have been reduced from $90.00 to $80.00 per month. Five pupils of the Plumbing Department are now preparing themselves for examination, which is a larger number that the school had before. In the Sewing School, two classes were formed, beginners and advanced, with an average monthly attendance of 306 and 342.</p>
   
   <p>In our Dancing School we had 220 different individuals, 110 of whom hold season tickets; the others bought single admission tickets. Average attendance on a Saturday evening, 60, maximum attendance, 120. In our Piano School we had 37 different children this year and there is a long waiting list. The circulation and attendance in our Library varied between 17,000 to 18,000 per month. About two-thirds of that number are being turned away because of lack of accommodation.</p>
   <p>In the Game Room this year were handled about 2,500 children per month. Owing to lack of accomodation no Game Room could be opened in the evening. The room now given to the activity is entirely too small. In the Story-Telling class were handled about 300 children per month. New activities, also under the auspices of the Educational Committee, opened this year are: First - A Civics Bureau for the purpose of assisting people in becoming American citizens as soon as they are ready for this privilege. The school is composed of of two divisions, one regular class work, for which a charge of $1.00 for four months is made, and the other free information. Apropos of this new department I wish to mention that Judge Hugo Pam has for the past two years been giving a course of lectures before the Educational Club, composed of pupils of the English classes, on civics and American government.</p>
   <p>Second - The room in possession of the Men's Club, which was not sufficiently used, was turned into a public Pool Room with a charge of twenty-five cents per hour, per table. The Pool Room since then has not been large enough to meet the demand. In the month of February it was used by no less than 987 people. In addition to billiards and pool there is also chess and checkers played, for which no charge is made. Average attendance of this room, 766 and 984.</p>
   <p>Third - At the beginning of the season, public dances on Saturday evenings were introduced. These dances have met with such success that the large Assembly Hall is no longer large enough to accommodate the people, many men and women are turned away. The dances more than pay for themselves and are attended by young people from every walk in life and every part of the city.</p>
   <p>Not less zest and interest was displayed in the Hebrew School, under the Religious Committee of which B. Horwich is chairman and Max Shulman, secretary. In this department, instruction was furnished to about 186 children, in Hebrew reading and writing. It employs the services of twelve trained teachers, five of whom teach in Hebrew Day School and seven in Sabbath School. The Sabbath School has an attendance of about 285 pupils weekly and holds two sessions weekly. On Saturday, from 3 to 4 P. M., a special service for children is held. The success of this department is due to the infusion of love and enthusiasm that Rabbi Levine brought to it.</p>
   <p>That the great hunger for knowledge, in the heart and soul of the Jewish children, particularly those of foreign birth and parentage, is hard to appease is a well known fact and our statistics in proof thereof reveal nothing new, only affirm the old, that new acquisitions only increase the thirst for more and more light. But that Jewish boys and girls should win acknowledgment of superiority in the athletic world is new, indeed, as well as a highly gratifying diversion. And such is the record of our Athletic Department. The registration in this department for the year was 400, with a regular attendance of over 250. Our teams have been among the constant winners. The Basket and Indoor Baseball Teams have lost only two games during the entire year. The Wrestling Team tied for first place in the Amateur Athletic Federation contest, recently held in Chicago, and in which contest over 200 Churches, Y. M. C. A.'s Parks and Gymnasiums took part.</p>
   <p>Equally as creditable has been the Gymnastic Department. In the three-cornered contest recently held between West Park No. 2, Hull House and Chicago Hebrew Institute, our teams captured more points than the other two teams combined, and during the past year we have won several silver trophies. Mr. Jacob Loeb is chairman of this department and Mr. Harry Berkman, instructor.</p>
   
   <p>No share of this success attributed to Mr. Berkman is too great. He is a teacher and performer of recognized ability.</p>
   <p>The officers and directors beg to acknowledge his services with deep appreciation, nor may it prove amiss at this time to urge upon our members present, and others the great need for a modern, well equipped gymnasium. Give to our people the proper means wherewith to build healthy homes for their healthy souls. Just a single denial of some personal pleasure will cover the dues of membership. These small mites from each individual would make a splendid nucleus for such a fund. And perhaps the good faith of so many, may bring forth a material appreciation from some blessed source of Samaritan.</p>
   <p>Who knows, it is well worth trying, and I trust each one present tonight, not already a member, will join, and persuade their friends to follow.</p>
   
   <p>The South Side Womens Auxiliary of which Mrs. Jos. Fish is president, true to its pledge of last year, defrayed the expenses of the girls' and women's departments, which curriculum is practically a continuance of the Summer work indoors. $2,400.00 was the expense of conducting this department and the full sum paid into the Institute. They hope, before closing their season, to add about $500.00 more to their contribution, This auxiliary has a membership of 403 women, 37 of whom are $3.00 members, 217 are $5.00 members and 149 are $10.00 members.</p>
   <p>Several months ago, Mrs. Fish organized a junior section and with her usual success, 100 members were secured. The juniors will cooperate with the seniors and a percentage of their funds will be paid into the treasury of the seniors. It is worthy of record that the funds turned in by this auxiliary are gross, all expenses and entertainments are defrayed by several members. Needless to say, the largest shares of which is contributed by Mrs. Fish.</p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Benjamin Davis is chairman of the Educational Committee of the S. S. Auxiliary, and Miss Bertha Jerusalumsky is in charge of the women's and girls' work. No material returns could adequately recompense Miss Jerusalumsky for her deep devotion to the work. Early morning and late at night, she can always be found graciously and ably executing her duties.</p>
   <p>The Social Committee also maintained its record of pleasure giving and under its auspices, many pleasant afternoons and evenings have been spent by the members and the neighborhood. To this committee largely contributed the Institute Players Club, of which Judge Hugo Pam is president. Under the able leadership of Mr. Alden, the talented members upon all social occasions presented playlets and musical comedies of interest. Not less, the Institute Women's Club demonstrated the usefulness and strength of these organizations. This auxiliary, organized a year ago, under the leadership of its efficient president, Mrs. J. Ginsberg, have now a membership of 150, dues ranging from $3.00 to $5.00. They have turned into the treasury of the Institute $500.00, which sum they expect to increase before the end of their fiscal year. During the year they held a number of social functions for members and guests, at the Institute Building, thus propagating the Institute and its work at large on the West and North-West Side. Their chief educational interest is the Piano School, purposing to afford a musical education to all worthy applicants at a nominal sum. They donated a piano to the Institute studio for such pupils as have not the means to practice at home.</p>
   <p>Another organization which has proved of much value to the Institute is the Young Woman's Club, headed by Miss Ida Roscoe, president. They organized about a year ago and have since turned in $100.00 to the general fund and have rendered individual and collective service on all social and general occasions. They have a membership of 85 and we trust that soon their splendid use will attract many more to their midst.</p>
   
   <p>The Young Men's Club has been a social club, but indirectly, giving publicity to the Institute. After listening to such records of mental prosperity, would that it would be my lot to speak equally as glowingly of our worldly goods, but alas, it is not given to mankind of this century to live in Utopia, therefore, I must, before closing, engage your attention to the more prosaic side of our life, financial.</p>
   <p>Revenues and Expenses. Period from May 1, 1911, to April 1, 1912. Revenues - Income - Dues - Regulars, $8.059.50 - Associate, $84.00 - S. S. Women's Auxiliary, $2,400.00 - Institute Women's Club, $500.00 - Young Woman's Club, $100.00-Total Dues, $11,143.50 - Miscellaneous - Baron De Hirsch fund for trade - Schools, $1,500.00 Legacies, $400.00 - Donations, $217.00 - Rentals, including Club, $775.90 - Internal Revenues, $6,957.27 - Total Miscellaneous, $9,850.17 - Total Revenues, $20,993.67.</p>
   <p>Expenses. General Administrative, $7,777.39 - Maintenance, $6,052.23 - Education, $15,767.29 - Total General, $29,597.21. Permanent improvements. Building, $267.25 - Furniture and Fixtures, $2,090.20 - Grounds, $6.674.14 -Total improvements, $9,031.39 - Total expenses, $38,628.60 - Thus leaving a deficit of $17,635.07, for which we used the balance of the insurance fund, $20,000.00.</p>
   <p>While as compared to last year our activities have doubled and trebled, the expenses proportionately were much less, and in this connection no little credit is due to Mr. Max Klee, acting president. Mr. Klee, throughout the year devoted hours of each week in personal supervision and advice on all details, big or small. Thus the Institute was the beneficiary of service that could not be purchased at any cost. When Mr. Klee went abroad a few months ago, Jacob M. Loeb took charge with equal results.</p>
   <p>While this summary contained a list of names that have been so helpful in bringing the affairs of the Institute to the present point of progress, needless to say that the man behind the gun was our superintendent, Dr. Jos.</p>
   
   <p>Pedott. His love for the work swept all obstacles away. He brought to the Institute a fresh, unmarred enthusiasm that put a new spark of life to the old, and founded well the new.</p>
   <p>The kindest mention is also due to all our volunteer workers, boys and girls, particularly those who constitute themselves as official ushers and are so helpful in handling the large crowds. We also wish to acknowledge our appreciation to the Chicago Israelite, Reform Advocate, The Sentinel and Yiddish Press for their services and courtesies. Last, but not least, our thanks and remembrance to our chief, President Julius Rosenwald, to whose munificence our existence is due. The directors whose successors you will elect today, are - Messrs. Israel Cowen, Abel Davis, Gustav Freund, I. B. Lipson, Abe Margolis, Samuel Phillipson, M. R. Hart, Jacob M. Loeb, Leon Zolotkof, Drs. E. A. Fishkin, Albert B. Yudeson, Emil G. Hirsch, Mrs. Julius Stone, and to fill vacancy for one year, caused by the resignation of Mr. Van Gelder.</p>
   <p>And now, before concluding, I cannot refrain from emphasizing the fact that according to the financial report, one-fourth of the general expenses was defrayed by internal revenues, which largely means the Educational Department. What more eloquent words need be employed to plead for the continuance of this Institution than this proof of the worthiness of the people who are partaking of its opportunities? They are making every effort within their means to prove the right to this being called a people's Institute, by paying, however small, a sum for all that they receive. The Institute, as far as its physical properties are concerned, has gone to the limit of possibilities. We must have more space. If the oft-made charge that a supply was created before the demand was ever true, it is no longer true. It has become an essential in the life of the Jewish community. This is our home, mine, yours, as well as the immigrants. Those of us who have watched and worked closely, cannot and will not deny that in return they have received a new and greater meaning of life and sense of duty to their fellowmen, something more than mere thanks of officers and directors; therefore, from the inmost depths of my heart pray I, that it may be my lot to tell you next year that our Home is the resort of love, of joy and plenty, supporting and supported. I thank you,</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>Goldie (Mrs. Julius) Stone, Secretary.</p>
