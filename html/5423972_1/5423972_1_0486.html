   <p>Members of the Sinai Congregation, Indiana Avenue and Twenty-first Street, were given a surprise at yesterday morning's service by Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch. As is customary with him Dr. Hirsch wore a dress suit during the service. The text of his address was "The Bigotry of Liberalism," and the surprise for the congregation was caused by some strongly-worded remarks made by the Rabbi regarding the aversion of even some of the Jewish people to having their children educated in the Jewish schools, Rabbi Hirsch said:</p>
   <p>"It is a curious fact attested by history that the victims of persecution are apt pupils of their persecutors. Scarcely has the lash been lifted from their backs then they are ready to seize the whip and apply it to others.</p>
   <p>"Thus scarcely had the Puritans fled from England on account of intolerance when they themselves set about inquiring into the faith of their neighbors, and it was they that had come from Spain who excommunicated Spinoza. Liberalism is that attitude of the mind which results from the knowledge that absolute truth is not within the possession of man. Often have I come across men who would shudder at the mention of the name of God and go into convulsions at the thought of the immortality of the soul, but who would with as great intolerance as was ever displayed by priest of Pope insist that their views were the ultimate truth.</p>
   <p>"Much bigotry is found even among the liberal Jewish congregations and many a man would as little dream of having his children taught in our religious schools as sending them to learn how to walk on the tight rope. If the Jewish religious schools were to-day what they were fifty years ago, mere places of instruction in Hebrew, this prejudice might be understood, but, as to-day instruction is imparted by confident and liberal men, the attitude of so many of our friends smacks of bigotry."</p>
