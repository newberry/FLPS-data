   <p>Advertisements, in a newspaper, are reflections on its readers.</p>
   <p>A business man having merchandise to sell usually seeks a district where the demand is large for that particular commodity, and he advertises his article through the newspaper. The business man who pays hard earned money for advertisements does not do it merely for the sake of seeing his name in print. Advertisement is an investment to him from which he seeks to make a profit. Should he see that the newspaper in which he advertises does not yield any results, he stops wasting his money.</p>
   
   <p>A butcher will not think of advertising ham, bacon, or other non-Kosher products in a Jewish newspaper, regardless of how large the circulation might be. Even in the Jewish-English newspapers, which are edited by our Jewish rabbis, who have declared Kosher all sorts of food, and whose readers are lovers of oysters and pigs-feet, we have not, as yet, seen such advertising by fish and meat markets.</p>
   <p>A manufacturer of sacred, Catholic pictures or statues will not consider advertising his merchandise in a Jewish newspaper, even in the so-called Jewish newspaper whose editor, a Rabbi, removed the scroll from his temple and turned Sabbath into Sunday. And for the very same reason, we do not find in Jewish newspapers - daily, weekly or monthly - the following advertisements found so plentifully in the English newspapers: remedies for drunkenness, sanitariums for drunkards, and formulas to sober one up.</p>
   
   <p>These advertisers know that the Jews are not drunkards, and, therefore, they are not in need of such remedies. To advertise their products is merely a waste of money. They would rather spend their money in places where they can attract customers - in newspapers whose readers occasionally take an overdose of whiskey.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, a very poor sign, when such advertisers of remedies for drunkenness and drunkards have commenced using Jewish newspapers to advertise their products. This indicates that the drinking epidemic is also spreading among Jews.</p>
   <p>This sort of advertisement is, as yet, not popular in the Jewish press. It can not be seen in the general, daily Jewish newspapers. This shows that the "common" Jewish public does not suffer from the drinking plague.</p>
   
   <p>However, an advertisement like this was found in the Reform Advocate, edited by the most liberal and progressive editors, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, and his son-in -law, Dr. Gershin Levy - and it is understood that it is read by our Jewish aristocrats. Being a genuine Jewish church paper, it is perhaps circulated among our reformed and progressive rabbis, and if the merchants advertise in that paper continuously it is a good sign that they profit by it. It is, however, a poor sign to us. It shows that progressive Judaism has made strides on the road of reaction.</p>
   <p>It is a very poor and sad sign.</p>
