   <p>In order to remedy the overcrowding in this Department, which existed last year, and also in accordance with our aim to make our activities as nearly self-supporting as possible, the tuition fee was raised at the beginning of the fiscal year, from $1.00 for four months to $1.00 for two months, or 100%. Despite this increase in the fee, however, our classes continued to be overcrowded and a waiting-list had to be maintained all during the year.</p>
   <p>This occurred in spite of the fact that there were several public evening schools in the neighborhood where no charge for instruction was made. Our total attendance in this department was 39,942, representing 963 individuals, 682 male and 281 female, against 37,248, representing 827 individuals during the previous year, or an increase of 136 individuals. There were seven classes, meeting four times a week, with an average attendance per night, of 207. Nine pupils who could not afford to pay for instruction were admitted free.</p>
