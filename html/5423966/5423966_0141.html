   <p>The Eucharistic Congress of the Serbian Orthodox Church in America, which convened in the Serbian Monastery at Libertyville on July 4, attracted thousands of people of Serbian extraction from all parts of America--Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>Serbia, and others saw in it a miniature of Yugo-Slavia.</p>
   <p>I say that it was at least something that we could call ours.</p>
   <p>Several prominent speakers delivered addresses on our national unity and on church activity. Among them were General Counsellor Kolombatovich and Mr. Pekich, secretary of Srbobzan.</p>
   <p>We have been informed that a very generous sum of money was collected for the needs of the monastery.</p>
