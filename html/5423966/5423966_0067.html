   <p>Serbia's songs are full of the sharp ecstacy, gloom of life and Serbian mountains and valleys. Their motifs are the cries of a spirit that has had truth suddenly revealed to it - a truth so all-significant that it can be felt only passionately and unrestrainedly.</p>
   <p>Serbian laughter and Serbian sorrow, as revealed in the songs, is never superficial. It is always so madly profound and representatively Serbian that even the American Serb who has never seen Jugoslavia must experience a sort of nostalgia.</p>
   <p>The Serbian Singing Society, Sloboda, of South Chicago, is made up almost entirely of Serbians of the second and third generation, who have never been to Jugoslavia, and these powerful songs affect them so deeply that seventy of them attend weekly society meetings, to catch, in a phrase here and there, a glimpse of the passionate land from which their parents came.</p>
   <p>Organized in 1927 under the leadership of George Lalich, and with a membership of rather elderly men, Sloboda has since then attracted the youth of South <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Chicago to such extent that it became necessary in 1932 to organize a junior choir of youngsters between the ages of 10 and 16.</p>
   <p>The junior choir is made up of some fifty members, promising material for the future of Sloboda.</p>
   <p>During its seven years of existence, Sloboda has appeared in its own concerts on the average of twice a year, and it has, in addition, participated in the programs of other Jugoslav societies. On the more important holidays, Sloboda sings the holy liturgy in St. Michael Serbian Orthodox Church. In 1929 Sloboda won second prize in a choral contest of all Jugoslav societies sponsored by the Preradovich Society of Gary, Indiana.</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1934 Sloboda gave a concert in Detroit, Michigan, and it has been invited to sing in Akron, Ohio, in the spring of 1935. Under the able leadership of Adam Popovich, its president, the society has kept clear of a deficit during the entire depression. Mr. Popovich's aides this year are <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Joseph Grba, vice-president; Christine Cuculjevich, secretary; Samuel Pejovich, treasurer; Mildred Dragash, financial secretary. Ever since its founding Sloboda has been under the direction of Dr. Joseph Kindl, well-known pianist and graduate of the Praha Conservatory of Music.</p>
