   <p>Every year, for generations, we Serbs and Montenegrins celebrate our national holiday Vidov-Dan. This year, as usually, the celebration was held on June 29. All proceeds will be turned to the treasury of our church for a new church building. Vidov-Dan has a sad memory in our hearts. On this date in 1389 we lost our kingdom and on the same date, a few centuries after, we established our free country, when two of our enemies, Turks and Hungarians, lost their kingdom.</p>
   <p>After the church rites, all people present formed a long procession, with a band playing and a choir singing national tunes. Thousands of people joined this procession on its way to Viker Park Hall, where the official celebration was progressing with a dinner and special entertainment. Plenty of money has been collected for the church fund. Our singing society 'Branko Radichevich' sang many songs to everybody's delight.</p>
