   <p>The Serbian singing society, Sloboda, of South Chicago, was organized in the year 1927. At the beginning it had only 32 members, male and female singers.</p>
   <p>For the past ten years the choir of Sloboda has made its own name and reputation among Serbians in America.</p>
   <p>Sloboda's concerts in Chicago, Detroit, Akron, and other places, were a bright part in colonial life and brought joy and happiness to their people.</p>
   <p>These concerts also brought excellent understanding and admiration among people of other nationalities in America for Serbian motives and songs.</p>
   <p>Today Sloboda celebrates the tenth anniversary of its noble work of <span class="page-break">\2</span>propaganda for Serbian music with a grand concert to be given under the direction of their organizer, director, teacher and composer, Mr. Adam Popovich.</p>
   <p>From 1927 to 1936 its director was Professor Joseph Kindl.</p>
