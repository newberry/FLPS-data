   <p>More than half a century has passed since our struggling forefathers emigrated from the sunny Adriatic shores of our brave Fatherland to the great bountiful land of freedom, these United States.</p>
   <p>Little did those pioneers know at the time that the outcome of their original Obilich Pleasure Club, consisting of just a few men, was to be the present-day United Serbian Society, a strong and independent benevolent society, with a foundation as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar.</p>
   <p>The founders of the United Serbian Society and those who came later endured many hardships to keep up such a society of their mother tongue in a new country and a strange environment. But pride, courage and perseverance guided them to the high ideals on which they founded the United Serbian Society, and on which the building of society and its <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>youth is being carried on.</p>
   <p>In the first years men were the only ones admitted to membership. Later on, in 1917, women were invited to join, but not until 1921 was there the thought of having any child enter the society.</p>
   <p>Between the years 1921 and 1930 little was done to interest the children in joining the Junior Order, but in 1930, when the first elder, Mr. Rade Govedarica, was elected, the Junior Order began having its own meetings, officers and social functions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jovo Simich followed Mr. Govdarica as elder and both did all they could to enroll more members and to inspire and acquaint them with our beautiful Serbian language. For the few short years of its activity, our Junior Order has to its credit an enrollment of 106 fine, healthy <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>boys and girls ranging in age from two to twenty-one years.</p>
   <p>The activities of the group are many and varied. Regular monthly meetings are held. Everything is done in the Serbian language. At the head of the Junior Order we have a fine, intelligent girl, Desanka I. Tarailo, as president.</p>
   <p>She has held this position for a number of years and has filled it extremely well. She is competent in the Serbian language and is an active and willing worker in any undertaking. She is, indeed, a credit to the Junior Order.</p>
   <p>Bozo R. Nogulich stands out among the boys as the most active and acts as vice-president. A short time ago he was awarded a gold pin for having <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>enrolled the largest number of new members in the order.</p>
   <p>One of the most interesting activities created in our Junior Order is the Tamburica Orchestra known as "The Happy Mountaineers," (or) Vesels Brdjani. They happily sing and play their cares away.</p>
   <p>The Junior Order maintains Serbian classes every Saturday, so that its boys and girls may avail themselves of the opportunity to learn how to read and write their beautiful language. There are three groups which meet at different hours, and they are classed as to their ability. About 65 attend every week. Besides reading, writing and history, they learn national songs, games and kolos (national dance).</p>
   <p>They are always willing and ready with recitations and plays whenever a program for some society is needed. All of these things help them to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>understand and know about their ancestral home better than they would know otherwise.</p>
   <p>Sports have not been neglected either. For the past three years a baseball and basketball team have been sponsored by the Junior Order. It has been supplied with Jerseys, caps, ball and other necessary equipment besides moral support. The team has played quite regularly and has been victorious over most of the teams played. The younger boys have organized a team also and play very well for their ages.</p>
   <p>One of the most outstanding events in the history of the Junior Order of the United Serbian Society occurred on June 9, 1935, when the Junior Order gave a modest gift to our church in Chicago, the Holy Resurrection, at 1905 Fowler St.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The gift was the icon of St. Sava, a beautiful masterpiece which will long remain in our church as a remembrance of its children who love the church and the memory of Saint Sava. The year 1935 was celebrated as St. Sava's year, for it was the 700th anniversary of the death of this famous monk, who first instilled religion and education into the hearts of our people.</p>
   <p>The Junior Order rightly celebrated St. Sava's year by studying all about him at meetings and classes throughout the entire year. The climax was the dedication of the icon in the church, on June 9th.</p>
   <p>All the children worked hard to earn the funds to purchase this icon by means of selling tickets in a popularity contest sponsored by the Junior Order.</p>
   <p>And so on, the Junior Order of the United Serbian Society keeps on its <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>various activities. This is all due to the efforts of the children themselves, who take interest to do these things through the cooperation and fine support given them by the present officers and other interested members of the United Serbian Society; and through the parents who allow and urge their children to such activity.</p>
   <p>The generosity and kindness of the Serbian National Federation and its worthy secretary, Mr. Branko Perich, cannot be surpassed. The Serbian books which they provided for the Serbian children in the Chicago community proved a great help to us also. Their method of spreading Serbian culture is indeed praiseworthy. Many thanks to all of the above mentioned.</p>
   <p>The goal of the Junior Order is to outnumber the membership of the United Serbian Society itself, to work loyally and conscientiously on behalf of the society and the juniors, to preserve the ideals forwarded to them by the elders; to know the beautiful traditions and <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>history of Jugoslavia, never to forget the mother tongue, to be good orthodox Christians living up to the standards of Pravoslaveye as taught by the immortal Sveti Sava; to be loyal sons of Jugoslavia; to understand and respect the ideals for which its heroic men fell, as did the never-to-be-forgotten King Alexander I, and finally, as young American citizens to respect and love their adopted country, the United States, and its great President, Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
