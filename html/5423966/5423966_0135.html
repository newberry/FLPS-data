   <p>Last Sunday, February 7th, the great idea of a United Slavic Front became a reality on a small scale. For years and years this idea was propagated among the people of Slavic extraction with no visible success. This time a cornerstone was laid by a few energetic people in Chicago.</p>
   <p>As we said, last Sunday a meeting was held with representatives of all Slavic colonies present. After a long and heated discussion, it was decided to appeal to all our newspapers in America. A campaign was started to organize small units in every Slavic concentration. We sincerely believe that this campaign united all our people in a powerful central organization.</p>
   <p>This idea has such wide fields for expansion and such importance for <span class="page-break">2</span>the welfare of our people here and abroad that with all our hearts we strongly recommend future work on its realization.</p>
