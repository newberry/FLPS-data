   <p>In 1878 the Chicago Serbian colony formed their first entertainment club, Obilich. In 1881 the first benevolent society, named Serbian and Montenegro Benevolent Society, was organized.</p>
   <p>Due to the prevailing idea that the Serbians, Herzegovinian and Montenegrin provinces must be united into one kingdom, it was found necessary to change separatistic names of existing societies to some name which would be acceptable by all Slav (Balkan) nationalities, and (which) would not suffer from future changes. So, on Oct. 17, 1894, delegates from the society Obilich and the Srpsko Montenegro Benevolent Society unanimously decided, during a meeting, to accept the new name of "United Serbian Society Jedinstvo," under which title the Illinois charter was drawn.</p>
