   <p>The time has come when also the Serbian workers in the United States will step forward in the fighting circle of the American workers. They must march openly under their own flag, armed with victory and enlightenment.</p>
   <p>There was talk about a new Serbian Socialist paper. This paper printed in the cyrilic alphabet will be issued about New Year, under the name of Narodni Glas (People's Voice). The edition of the paper is in charge of the central committee of the Serbian department of the Jugoslav Workingmen's Educational and Political Federation.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that this news will gladden Serbian workers all over America, and that they will concentrate all their powers on having it edited. Your support in money should be sent to the Serbian Socialist Committee, 2350 Clybourne Avenue, Chicago.</p>
