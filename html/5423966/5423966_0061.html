   <p>In the early days of Serbian migration to this country we find in every city, whether large or small, the formation of different colonies. In a similar way a Serbian colony was established on the North Side of Chicago in the first decade of the 20th century. In the autumn of 1906, a group of Serbians on the North Side of Chicago organized the first Serbian Singing Society in the United States of America, with the name of a great and immortal Serbian poet, Branko Radichevich.</p>
   <p>The society was organized on November 14, 1906. The following were the ones who brought about this organization: Simo Providzalo, Manoylo Yovanovich, George Miloyevich and Petar O. Stiyacich (present Serbian priest of Chicago). The aim of this society was to promote Serbian songs, produce theatrical acts from Serbian life, and do other cultural work among the Serbs here.</p>
   <p>The first instructor of the Singing Society Branko Radichevich was Risto Baltich; also, the first song mentioned on the records was "Sharp Swords";</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>the first theatrical performance was "The Peasant Scamp," which was given in the year 1908. In the same year the society affiliated with the first Serbian string (tamburitza) orchestra.</p>
   <p>During the 30 years of the society's existence, hundreds of different songs were sung and over forty theatrical acts were played, some of them numerous times at the request of the Serbian people, not only in Chicago but in adjoining cities as far as Milwaukee, Wis., or Detroit, Mich., and always were successful morally and materially. By competing in contests, the society received three trophies: from the Slovenian Singing Society 'Lira,' 'Nitranska Slovak's Sokol,' and the Croatian Singing Society 'Preradovich' of Gary, Ind.</p>
   <p>On September 4, 1916, the society celebrated its 10th anniversary, and also blessed its flag. In the year 1924 the society celebrated the 100th birthday of their patron, Branko Radichevich, with the participation of many other Slavic singing societies, and the net proceeds were sent abroad for the erection of a monument to Branko Radichevich. The society worked in harmony <span class="page-break">\3</span>with the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Church, Holy Resurrection of Chicago. Since its beginning it was very active in the erection of the new church and hall. It also participated in many national and religious movements. It gave donations to the Red Cross here and abroad during the Balkan and World wars, and sent volunteers from the society.</p>
   <p>On March 29, 1931, the Serbian Singing Federation of America was organized in which many of our members had taken active part in the work. The Serbian Singing Society 'Branko Radichevich' is classed in the Federation as No. 1.</p>
   <p>The 4th of October, 1931, the society celebrated its 25th anniversary, in which many other singing societies participated.</p>
   <p>For the particular celebration a memorial book was published with a brief history, and on that occasion they honored many of our prominent men as honorary members of the Singing Society 'Branko Radichevich'.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Before that time the society had honored Prof. M. I. Papin, Dr. Anton Bjankini, Ivan Vuchetich, John R. Palandech, etc.</p>
   <p>In 1933 the society was reorganized and now the Serbian youth, boys and girls, take an active part as regular members. The society has ninety active members and many sponsoring members. Their headquarters are at the new Serbian church hall, 1905 Fowler Street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>On February 17, 1935, the Serbian Singing Society 'Obilich' affiliated with the Serbian Singing Society 'Branko Radichevich' under the name of Serbian Singing Society 'Branko Radichevich.' Now they have no competition, as it is the only Serbian singing society in the Chicago Serbian Orthodox parish. As their new instructor they have elected Prof. Alexander Savine, a prominent and well known vocal and musical instructor, who takes a very active interest in the society. Their first success came to them in the summer of 1935 during a convention of the Serbian National Federation in Milwaukee, Wis. The entire society took an active part in the church services and later attended the banquet.</p>

   <p>The second great event came in the spring of this year when the Middle West Serbian singing societies entered in a contest given at Gary, Ind. They were awarded first prize, free transportation for all members to Akron, Ohio, and participation in the Serbian singers' contest on May 29, 30 and 31, 1936. They were selected as one of the best and awarded first prize, a silver cup, donated by Mrs. Varvara (Smith) Papin, daughter of the late Prof. Michael Papin, honorary member of the Serbian Singing Society "Branko Radichevich.'</p>
   <p>Our society is proud to be the first possessor of the trophy.</p>
   <p>The following are benefactor members: Serbian Orphan Society, S. B. Society "Obilich," United Serbian Society "Jedinstvo," and "Kolo Srpskih Sestara."</p>
