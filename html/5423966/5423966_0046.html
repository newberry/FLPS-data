   <p>Why do you not learn? Why do you not open your mouth and your eyes? Why do you stay all alone, like a stranger along the sea, where anybody knowns how to swim except you?</p>
   <p>You suffer, despair, because the road is hard, so you progress very slowly.</p>
   <p>Look around. Open your eyes, thousands of opportunities are here, why do you not seize one? Read newspapers and advertisements, listen to what is said around you, go in society, where our word is not spoken. It does not matter even if they laugh at you, you will never make the same mistake again.</p>
   <p>You will have difficulties, you will get exhausted in the struggle of thoughts and words, but every day you will get nearer to your goal. It makes no difference if you are not understood at first. You are not to blame. Many others do not know the English language. Many have only rudimentary knowledge of it, and they have to learn it too.</p>
   <p>Do you want to earn money and to get a good position? There are no prospects</p>
   
   <p>for you until you learn the English language. That is your admission ticket. Every one has to pay the same price. For a career free tickets are not given.</p>
   <p>There is so much talk about success. But what is success? Success is the ability to do better than the average man.</p>
   <p>Don't do things just well. Perform things better, but to do that you must learn - English</p>
