   <p>On the initiative of John R. Palandech, leaders of the foreign language press, a "dinner-meeting" was held at the Hamilton Club for the representatives of the foreign language press to devise the right means to avoid the danger of closing the schools.</p>
   <p>Introduced by Mr. Polandech, various speakers addressed the audience and Mr. Bogan, Superintendent of Schools, exposed in detail the reasons why the schools must not be closed. It would be a shame for a cosmopolitan city like Chicago.</p>
   <p>A moving picture demonstrated that Chicago spends less than any other city for public education.</p>
   <p>The expense for education in Chicago amounts to 2.40 per cent and that for the criminal element to 8 per cent of the taxes.</p>
   <p>The assembly resolved to try every means to reach a solution of the problem of not neglecting the most important branch of social life, the education of the children who represent the future generation.</p>
