   <p>Immediately after the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria, the real Serbian patriots all over the world got into lively action to help their people in the above mentioned provinces to free themselves from the enemy's rule.</p>
   <p>Among the most active organizations working on this worthy cause was Srpsko Jedinstvo. During the time of the Balkan war this society sent twenty volunteers to the front, plus a sizable sum of money to support the movement.</p>
   <p>As soon as the World War was begun the society Srpsko Jedinstvo formed a group of 45 members (young and middle-aged), fully equipped and sent them to the front. All expense for equipment and transportation was paid by the society. The society Srpsko Jedinstvo has been known for its patriotic inclination, and there was no worthy cause registered which did not draw its hearty support, financially and morally, from the society.</p>
