   <p>Our countryman, J. Walter, has passed on to us for publication an interesting letter from an ardent Bohemian national worker, Stepan Horsky, who is better known in Russia by the name of Gorski. Horsky used to be a very good friend of Stolypin, and has an important standing among our countrymen in Russia. Horsky writes from Nizza, December 30:</p>
   <p>"Among us in Russia there is the general and unanimous belief that, after all, we shall win out in the end. Bohemian Moscow started by organizing the Husitska Druzina (Hussite Group [of Comrades]). The Druzina, which, in fact, is a Bohemian legion, is headed by the Russian colonel, Sozentovic; Brother Tucek, president of the Bohemian Committee of Moscow, is its political leader. Let us hope he will develop into a Bohemian Garibaldi. He is a man of great <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>ability, and is a most honest worker. Before the war, he was the manager of the Moscow branch of the firm of Laurin A. Klement [Bohemian firm manufacturing motorcycles and automobiles]. My friend Hrabe is vice-president of the Bohemian Committee, and so am I. Our leaders have arranged things so that Tucek has joined the Druzina. I am working outside of Russia, and Hrabe is taking care of Bohemian matters in Moscow.</p>
   <p>"As the delegate of the Bohemian Committee of Moscow, I have traveled through Italy, France, and England. Now I am returning to Italy on my way back to Paris, where our convention will be held January 28, and not, as originally announced, on January 14. Bohemians and Slovaks will meet in this convention. An all-Slav convention or meeting is scheduled to be held in Paris on February 4. In Paris we have established, as a preliminary organization, the Narodni Rada Cesko-Slovanskych Kolonii (National Council of Bohemian-Slavonic Colonies), and we shall be publishing a periodical in the French and English language under the title of L' Independence Tcheque. To provide information on the all-Slavic <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>cause, we expect to publish Les Nouvelles Slaves. Moscow, Paris, and London have each donated two hundred francs for the expenses of the Narodni Rada Cesko-Slovanskych Kolonii. Of course, this is very little; but we hope that other cities will support our movement. I am approaching you, my worthy young friend, with the following appeal:</p>
   <p>"Please work among the Bohemians and Slovaks in America, make them acquainted with our activity, and have them join us. We do not need financial support as much as we need moral encouragement. For conferences on important matters, we are in need of men with political experiences. We would like to give the leadership to prominent Bohemians and Slovaks in the United States. Let them know this, talk about it in your meeting, and do something about it. I know you as a good Bohemian and a true Slav. Therefore, I hope that my voice will not be 'a voice crying in the wilderness'. Let them send us articles for L' Independence Tcheque. You yourself should write something for us. Everyone must do his bit. Remain in good health, and co-operate with us with cheerful hearts! Na Zdar! (To Success!)</p>
   <p>"Yours,</p>
   <p>"Stepan Horsky."</p>
