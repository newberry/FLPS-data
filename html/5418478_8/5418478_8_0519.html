   <p>One eighth or one tenth of the members of the Bohemian nation living outside the borders of Austria-Hungary and Germany have a most difficult and responsible task to perform in this war: to direct the Bohemian politics, that is, the so-called "high" politics. The Bohemian nation in its own country must remain politically inactive. It must not even as much as express its opinion, or publicly manifest its wishes and desires, much less take active part in dealing with political matters. It sounds like a paradox, but we who live in "enemy countries" have much more freedom and liberty than our countrymen in their own land.</p>
   <p>Consequently, overseas Bohemians have taken the political reins of the nation in their own hands. Since the people at home are not free to express their views, it becomes our right and duty to speak and act for them. Thus, we also carry a great deal of responsibility for the future development of the Bohemian nation. How shall we acquit ourselves of the obligation? Only history will give the correct answer.</p>
   <p>Immediately after war was declared, we took sides unanimously and unequivocally, with the Triple Entente, and have tried, as far as conditions have permitted, to help it to victory. This automatically made for the anti-Austrian and anti-German trend of our politics. As a consequence of the first step we have been obliged to adopt a definite political program. This program is simple and clear: the independence of the Bohemian nation.</p>
   <p>Having adopted this program it became our natural duty to find out whether or not we have the agreement of the whole Bohemian nation. We are firmly convinced that we have. Who would not desire the independence of the Bohemian nation? All Bohemian political parties had the so-called "Statni Pravo" (State right, or "home rule," a movement in every respect similar to that of the Irish prior to the establishment of Eire) in their programs. Only the Socialist-Democratic party did not agree with the idea of the Statni Pravo, but what was its reason? Certainly not that it would not desire the independence of the Bohemian nation, but because the Statni Pravo was impossible of realization under normal conditions. This is very clearly apparent now: Bohemian independence cannot be achieved except with the help of other countries and as a result of great international conflicts.</p>
   <p>In working, then, for Bohemian independence we may be sure of the full agreement of the whole Bohemian people. All that now remains to be answered is the question whether or not Bohemian independence can be realized, can be achieved. The realization of Bohemian independence obviously depends on the victory of the Allies over Germany. Without that victory there can be no independence--that, I believe, is a known fact. Of course, we all firmly believe that the Allies will win and that, therefore, Bohemian independence will become a reality, but let us try to answer the question of what would happen if the Allies did not win, or if their victory were not to be such as to enable them to exact the requirement of Bohemian independence as one of the conditions of peace. Would that be the end of us? Certainly not. There is no need to fear. Our independence would be, of course, gone, but not the existence of the nation. We should be facing Germany's ire and violence, but we should succeed in defending ourselves. We are not alone in the world. We have the sympathy of all the democracies of the world, and the support of all Slavs. The awareness of our allegiance to the great Slavic group of nations engenders in us new strength, new vital energy, and daring hopes for the future. It has succeeded in leading us out of the deepest national deterrioration to the present flourishing state of our economic and cultural life, and it will lead us further--to full political freedom and economic independence.</p>
   
   <p>All this, of course, would apply only in case the war were to take a bad turn. Many of our countrymen ask what would happen to us in case the war does take a bad end. I should like to reply that it would not be as sad as one might thing, and that, therefore, nobody should be afraid of the consequences of our anti-Austrian politics, our anti-Austrian propaganda. No nation has ever received its rights by spinelessness and submission, but many of them have exacted respect and admiration even of their foes by energetic and daring words and deeds.</p>
   <p>However, the Allies' victory is certain. Hence our duty is to get ready for it and to know what we want, to be clear and definite in our demands. When the time comes to deal with the Bohemian question, when we shall be asked what we want, it will be necessary to give a definite, concrete, and unanimous reply. In giving it or not giving it we shall show our political maturity or our political childhood. And that is what will decide our future.</p>
   
   <p>At the present time it is necessary to moblize all our men and all our resources. It is necessary to enlist every Bohemian, every Bohemian must become an active part of our movement for independence of the Bohemian nation. Furthermore it is necessary that absolute unity prevail in our camp. These historic times do not permit us to indulge in the pleasures of partisanship, in the delight of political competition. A small nation must act as one whole, one being, when it wants to achieve its rights.</p>
   <p>Finally it is necessary to awake our Slavic consciousness, our Slavic feeling. It is in the Slavic people that our strength, our future lies. The stronger and the more firmly entrenched the idea of unity and brotherhood is in Slavonic nations, the better chances we shall have, the more calmly, more securely shall we be able to look forward into the future.</p>
   <p>It has been said that Bohemian independence depends on the Allies' victory.</p>
   
   <p>That fact itself gives us the obligation to do all we can to help them to achieve that victory. There are many ways in which this can be done. But the best way is to work for and promote the smooth, rapid, and uninterrupted supply of munitions to the Allied armies. That will hasten their, and our, victory.</p>
