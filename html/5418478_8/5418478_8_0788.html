   <p>Yesterday afternoon we were visited by Mr. Karel Malik, the jeweler. Mr. Malik has issued at his own expense beautiful medallions bearing in relief the Havlicek monument in Douglas Park. The medallions are in the shape of a watch fob charm for men, and a medallion with red and white ribbons for the ladies. Mr. Malik had several of these medallions made of genuine fourteen karat gold. Two of these he wanted to give to speakers of other nationalities during our festivities; namely, Mayor Harrison and Governor Deneen, three he wanted to send to Bohemians, one to the National Museum, one to the Naprstek Museum, and one to sculptor Strachovsky, the creator of the Havlicek statue. Because Mr. Malik's intention was misunderstood on the part of the Arrangements Committee, or rather some of its members, he decided to sell the two medallions which had been intended for the speakers and donate the profits which <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will be about thirty dollars to some good cause, to the Bohemian Liberal [Freethought] Schools. There is no doubt that this change of intention will meet with the approval of every sincere Bohemian because it is not known whether or not this beautiful and significant gift would really be appreciated by people of other nationalities, but that the sum of several ten dollar bills will be welcomed by the management of our often forgotten schools. Of that, there need not be a moment's doubt. The other three medallions which are intended for the museums and the sculptor, Strachovsky, will be turned over to the president of the Bohemian-American National Council so that he may forward them to their destination.</p>
