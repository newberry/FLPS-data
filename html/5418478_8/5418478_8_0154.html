   <p>The second large Czech expedition to Czechoslovakia will leave today. This time it will be a Catholic organization under the leadership of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America). Last Thursday the first expedition....left Chicago. It was the Czeckoslovenska-Americka Obchodni Vyprava (Czechoslovak-American Commercial Expedition). This second expedition, organized by the Svaz....is in charge of Mr. Jan Straka, president of the Svaz; Reverend Frantisek Bozenek, secretary of the Svaz and chaplain of the Parish of Svati Cyrill A Metodej (Saints Cyrill and Methodius), Town of Lake, Chicago.....The number of members in this second Czech expedition is imposing. The expedition will surely accomplish its aim in Czechoslovakia and attract considerable attention.....Some of its members will return to Chicago while others will settle in Czechoslovakia....We wish good luck and a pleasant sojourn to all, hoping that the returning members will come back to America in good humor and happy....</p>
