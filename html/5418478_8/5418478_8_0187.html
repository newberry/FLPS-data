   <p>Everyone who wishes to take part in the expedition of the Narodni Svaz Czeskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) and the Katolicky Sokol (Catholic Sokol) to Czechoslovakia must make his application and accompany it with a deposit of $30 in order that his cabin may be reserved for him. After the month of February, we may not be able to make any more reservations. Time flies, so do not procrastinate. Ask for detailed information about the expedition; in it you will learn about the whole trip from America to Prague.</p>
   <p>Many people have the habit of deferring the payment of a deposit and waiting until the last week before the expedition is to start; such people run the risk[of not being able to secure cabin reservations].....therefore, let no one give up this visit to his old homeland to see it again after many years; to see the places where he spent his best years.....we shall visit the homeland during its best season, on about May 25, and anybody may return at any time according to his means.....Those people who have their first citizenship papers need not be afraid that they will have difficulties upon their return. Those who have none ought to take them out if they intend to return.</p>
   <p>It is most important now that all countrymen who have a desire to go make their wishes known to us at once so that we may enter their names on the roll of members [of the expedition].....The program will be a surprise for everybody.....Make your applications now! Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku, 3207 West 22nd Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
