   <p>Chicago, Illinois, March 28</p>
   <p>The Bohemian State, the longing for it, is not a product of Bohemian-America. This, no doubt, we all know, but it is less generally known that the number of friends and enthusiastic defenders of this yet unborn State is much smaller in America than we might have expected. Just in these last few days a brief but rather inconsiderate note concerning the behavior of Bohemian soldiers and political leaders in this war appeared in the newspapers. Its writer remembered--with an audacity worthy of a better purpose--those Bohemian men who threw themselves body and soul into the fight against the Russians and Serbs. Bohemian-America immediately was ready to pass its ruthless judgment <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>on these soldiers, and many found a new pretext for buttoning up their pocket more tightly, if possible, than before, and without a feeling of shame.</p>
   <p>But the question so far has not been how our people in the old country behaved in the face of the present developments in Europe, but rather how we, here in Bohemian-America, have behaved toward our old country in these present critical times. This question should and can be answered today with a certain reservation. It seems to me that it is not the purpose of Bohemian-America to pass judgement on things during the course of their development and criticize the manner of that development. If such things should be condemned, I believe there is plenty of time for such condemnation in the future.</p>
   <p>Even here in Bohemian-America, where we have the possibility of considering the conditions in the old country from a distant and independent point of view, where we have learned to know and appreciate new conditions and new public institutions and therefore should be able to determine how far Austria-Hungary is a suitable or unsuitable frame for our old country, we find opinions which <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>are not a bit better than those (opinions) which we condemn but which we often are unable to rid ourselves of. Current events have shown that we in Bohemian-America have learned very little about true political thinking and still less about political acting. It is not that this country is an unfit place for serious political thinking and working; it is not that it could not give such thinking and working the proper appreciation and insure for it an altogether different place from that which it now occupies. The failure to recognize this fact leads, according to my personal opinion, many of our countrymen to a false interpretation of conditions in the old country; it causes them to disregard all the maltreatment and abuse that the Hapsburgs have been meting out to our nation since 1620; it makes them believe even today that we have reasons for sympathetic treatment of Austria, and that what has been black and ugly for four hundred years will now become white and beautiful and shine like the silver of new-fallen snow.</p>
   <p>If we consider just a few instances of the last century, we find many reasons to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>be extremely dissatisfied. Let us take, for instance, the so-called language question which to many here in America seems to be a matter of most trifling consequence, a worthless whim. If such an extremely polyglot country as America can be without a language and a nationality question, why, they say, "can it not also be fixed somehow in Bohemia." Well, it is just that "why" where the rub comes in. Why can the law be enforced everywhere else but in Austria which, let the truth be said, has more liberal laws perhaps than any other country in Europe? Conditions in Austria have been developing in an entirely different direction and the results are also entirely different. For one thing, the German language was not introduced in Austria as a language necessary for uniform intercommunication in matters of state administration, but merely because it was the mother language of the ruler and therefore more important than the language of the people. The anti-democratic feeling of the Hapsburgs cannot be better characterized than by their directly instinctive aversion toward the language of a nation they have ruled and which has sacrificed for them the lives of its best men and most precious possessions times without number.</p>
   <p>But there is some good in every evil: The national oppression substantially <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>helped our national awakening, an assertion which took hold of all strata of the people in 1848. At that time even the Germans felt the strength of this nationalistic movement, it was just at that time that the stubborn opposition of the government and the Germans to everything Bohemian really began, as Palacky [first modern Bohemian historiographer] so aptly points out. It has never been the purpose of this struggle for our nation to dominate the Germans, just as now it is not its purpose to dominate the Slovaks. All we have wanted is equal rights with the German people, although we have a three-fourths majority in our country and could claim much more than mere equality of rights.</p>
   <p>Some of the successive governments of Austria proclaimed in the more recent times that they were trying to introduce equal rights for all of Austria's nations, but mere proclaiming is not enough to enforce a principle, and this principle still awaits enforcement. There are still heated arguments about the interpretation of the conception of equality of rights, and this argumentation will be taken up by the Germans again after the war, particularly if they should succeed in bringing it to a somewhat honorable peace, and the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>interpretation will be still more detrimental to the Bohemians. In fact, these governments have never tried to eradicate these unbearable conditions in Bohemia and, behind the scene, have been doing all they could to suppress the whole Slavic element in general, and the Bohemians and Slovaks in particular.</p>
   <p>To demonstrate more clearly the great seriousness of this burning question, let us recall that the [Austrian] census showed 357 persons out of every 1,000 as "using the German language in their daily contacts". When, however, a census of persons in civil (public) service was taken, it showed 479 persons out of every 1,000 were "using the German language in their daily contacts," that is, 122 more than to what they were entitled. In the military service there were 429 [out of every thousand], and in government and [imperial] court service, 460 instead of 357, that is, 103 more than the correct quota, to say nothing about the definitely scandalous conditions prevailing in the courts where a Bohemian could not seek justice in the Bohemian language when the court was in the so-called "Uzavrene Uzemi (literally," closed territory,"--territory, city, town, or village with <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>actual or assumed German majority, the Sudeten of unhappy Munich memory). In the same courts a German could fight his legal battles in German, freely--and all over the country! Now, these same Germans who brag every day about their culture and therefore claim exceptional privileges, have shown in the official census that the percentage of literacy among the Germans is 91.84 while the corresponding percentage among Bohemians is 93.88. Among the Germans in Bohemia, there are 6.83 per cent who do not know how to either read or write; among the Bohemians, only 4.26 per cent. It is difficult to guess where the superiority of German "culture" in "barbarous" Slavdom really comes in.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to explain that the Slovaks are still worse off than all that. In reply to my question as to the standpoint of the Party of Independence toward nationalities other than Magyar in Hungary, put to him on the occasion of his visit here last year shortly before the outbreak of the war, Count Karolyi made the following statement: "The Party of Independence does not know any <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>other nation in Hungary other than the Magyars, and will permit nothing that could make possible the development of other nations in that country." This statement alone should be sufficient for both the Slovaks and us to decide which way to turn our sympathies.</p>
   <p>But we, here in America, also have reasons to complain about Austrian institutions. For instance, it would be most difficult to prove that the Austrian consulates have always been as kind and thoughtful toward the Bohemians and the Slavs in general as they are now that they again need the hated Slavs for the salvation of their vanishing existence. Bohemian politics of the last seventy-nine years offers a definite proof that it was the Bohemians and Slavs who put forth efforts to build Austria up, and were defending it with blood and property in the hope that it would find itself. And while accepting from its subjects for its Emperor "what is the Emperor's" and frequently much more, it will, after some bitter experiences, give to its people what is the "people's". When these bitter experiences were over, and Austria began to recover somewhat from the wounds it had suffered, it has <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>again become an anachronism and has taken up the role of the reactionary, undemocratic and unconstitutional country it had been playing before.</p>
   <p>If the Austrian Ambassador in Washington now complains that there is a Pan-Slav movement in Austria and seeks its causes in Prague, he is not worth the money paid to him from the taxes of the twenty-seven million people in the Monarchy, because, in the first place, he is here to protect the interests of the subjects of the Austrian Government, not to accuse them of disloyalty; in the second place he repeats the fatal historic mistake for which Austria has started paying already and which, in the end, will seal the fate of that monarchy, the monarchy that has never understood its own mission and will have to leave the world arena before its bigwigs grasp what it is all about.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian political leaders, on the other hand, had a clearer insight, and all of them, without distinction of political parties, have been expressing themselves in favor of Austria; and thus, alas, generations have grown up <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>which could not imagine any other place for the Bohemians than Austria. But these political leaders were in favor of an Austria that would finally abandon its mistakes and become a healthy place where those who live within its boundaries would find justice. In that, of course, Austria was a disappointment and has remained blind to the day when victerions Russian armies have crossed her border.</p>
   <p>When Bohemian-America takes all this into consideration, there will not be a single nationally awakened Bohemian who could be serious in his defense of that country of injustice and anachronistic notions. To this opinion we are led neither by hatred, nor by Pan-Slavism, nor by any feverish, nebulous imaginations. We are led to it by the only possible interpretation of the unavoidable trend of historical developments and the stupid stubborness of Austrian policies and its government.</p>
   <p>"The way you make your bed is the way you will rest," says an old Bohemian proverb. It may not always apply in this country of unbelievable possibilities <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>where there are always kind people who gladly make beds for others, but it certainly has been proving its applicability in the land of the double-headed eagle, and therefore it is not necessary to doubt its truthfulness.</p>
