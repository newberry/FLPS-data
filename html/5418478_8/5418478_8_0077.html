   <p>p. 4.. Our Czech Congressman Sabath could render valuable service to the Czechs and other Slavonic people if he would call the attention of Congress to the barbarism which is being perpetrated on the immigrants in the Southern States. An issue like this should be taken up by congress, for no state is sovereign enough that it could keep aloof of a reprimand for injustice done.</p>
   <p>There is a conspicuous percentage of Czechs among those immigrants who are groaning under the yoke of slavery imposed upon them in the South and about whose pitiable situation the newspapers print sporadic items. We hope Congressman Sabath will take action, regardless of the fact that the states concerned are Democrat states and the very home of Chief John S. Williams.</p>
   <p>He who makes himself guilty of, or an accessory to a crime deserves to be condemned - Democrat and Republican alike. Our only Bohemian congressman would serve the Czech cause much better in the way suggested than by submitting to Congress some other propositions which, being launched by a Democrat, will not be allowed by the Republicans to advance even to a second reading.</p>
