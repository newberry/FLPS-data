   <p>Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, our leader, will be welcomed by representative officials of the State of Illinois next Tuesday, October 8, as the head of the Czechoslovak Government. This will take place on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of the induction of Illinois as a state. Tuesday has been especially reserved for us Czechoslovaks.</p>
   <p>Czechoslovaks are the only nation thus privileged to be able to make an impressive appearance before the highest state officials and in influential American circles.</p>
   <p>The demonstration in the Auditorium should be a gigantic one. It is incumbent upon us Czechs and Slovaks to give evidence of esteem for our leader, who will on that day address our people in the Czech language.</p>
   <p>Admission to this festive meeting is free; no tickets will be issued. First come, first served. Doors will open at 7:30 P.M. Festivities will begin at 8 P.M. sharp.</p>
   <p>For the arrangements committee:</p>
   <p>J. F. Stepina, F. G. Hajicek, J. J. Zmrhal,</p>
   <p>Vaclav (Wenceslas) Vanek.</p>
