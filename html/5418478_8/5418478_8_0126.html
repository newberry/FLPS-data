   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (Czechoslovak National Council in America) has issued a call to all the Czechoslovaks of Chicago and vicinity, regardless of their political or religious affiliations, to attend a festival in which an urn, containing the sacred soil of places very dear to all of us, will be received.....The urn was sent as a present to the Czechoslovak people of America by the Masarykova Akademie Prace (Masaryk's Academy of Labor) as an expression of gratitude for the work of liberation of our old homeland by the Czechoslovaks of this country. The shipment of the urn was accompanied by the following letter:</p>
   <p>"May you, our brothers, as well as your children who were born on the soil of your new homeland, be inspired whenever you look upon this urn. May the secret whispers of the symbolism of these three clods of native earth become audible to you. They are a gift of love. Help us to defend that liberty which you have built for us, and now cultivate the seeds of your common labors together with us here who live beyond the seas."</p>
   <p>In view of the importance of this festive occasion, the National Council invited some outstanding nationalist workers to be the speakers at the ceremony. The full program is given below: (1) Music; (2) Opening of ceremonies by the president of the Narodni Rada, Mr. John A. Cervenka; (3) A festival speech by Mr. Karel Pergler, the first official representative of the Czechoslovak government to the United States; (4) A speech by the Reverend Oldrich Zlamal, of Cleveland, Ohio; (5) A speech by Mr. Albert Mamatey, Czechoslovak consul from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; (6) The viewing of the urn by the public.</p>
   <p>After the speeches, the urn will be on display in a special room so that everyone might have the opportunity to see the sacred soil of his native land. The Narodni Rada, hoping that it would meet with the desires of our countrymen, ordered some pictures to be made of the urn, and anyone desiring such a picture may obtain it as a souvenir.</p>
   
   <p>The patriotic Czechoslovak public of Chicago should set aside tomorrow as a national holiday, and attend the festival and the ceremony in large numbers. The ceremonies will start at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>The Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) has likewise issued a proclamation to its members as follows:</p>
   <p>"Friends--On Friday evening, according to the proclamation of the Narodni Rada, there will be presented to the Czechoslovak people of America an urn containing the sacred soil of Rip, Velehrad, and Devin. The urn was recently brought to the United States by Mr. Jan Straka, president of the Narodni Svaz. The urn was entrusted to him during his visit in Czechoslovakia, when he was asked to take it to his countrymen in America and have it deposited in some fitting place that it might forever serve as a reminder of things Czechoslovak. The act of receiving that urn will be an exalted one. By viewing the urn with its sacred contents--the soil from places infinitely dear to us--we are to remember the land of our birth and bear in mind that we are a transatlantic branch of the brave and now liberated Czechoslovak nation. We Bohemian Catholics have ever been cognizant of our duty as Czechoslovaks and have always done our duty honorably and loyally. We have proved as Catholics and as Czechs that we could always be depended upon to come to the aid of our nation; we have kept our escutcheon unsullied by doing our sacred duties well, by working indefatigably for the great future of the Czechoslovak nation for which we still work.</p>
   <p>"Our memories will be refreshed at the Friday festival which is to be held in Pilsen Park at West 26th Street and Albany Avenue at 8 P. M. Our folk should be well represented at this festival which is one of the most significant ones for the Czechoslovaks of America; by attending, we shall prove that we have remained loyal to our ideals. And all should be there to manifest our pure love to that land which served as a cradle to a great many of our ancestors. We kiss thee oh soil, hallowed by the blood and love of our ancestors, oh soil from places so sacred to us and so dear; our eyes are moist with tears of gratitude, the gratitude of a distant American branch to its own nation for having sent thee to us here, so that you might live with us and among us and be a symbol of concord and perseverance. By touching thee, our lagging strength shall increase and efforts expand; thou shalt constitute a firm bond between us and the Czechoslovak nation."</p>
