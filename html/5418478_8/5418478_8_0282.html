   <p>The late Mr. Joseph Triner, founder of the reputed firm Joseph Triner And Company, Chicago, was treasurer of the Czech-American branch of the Czech National Council in Prague. In his last will, he left $1,000 to the Czech National Council in Prague, for the explicit purpose of aiding Czech independence.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Catharina Triner and Mr. Joseph Triner, present head of the mercantile concern, are executors. They decided that the moment the Czechoslovak National Council, which represents the Czech National Council in Prague in the pursuit of Czech independence, is recognized by the Government of the United States, the amount becomes due for payment to Professor Masaryk, head of the provisional government of the future Czechoslovak independent state.</p>
   <p>Mr. Triner, accompanied by Dr. Jaroslav Salaba Vojan, called on Professor Masaryk in the Blackstone Hotel yesterday and delivered the money. He expressed deep appreciation for the opportunity to fulfill the last wish of his father, to aid <span class="page-break">2</span>the cause which is dear to all American Czechs--and to do it through the venerable hands of Professor Masaryk.</p>
