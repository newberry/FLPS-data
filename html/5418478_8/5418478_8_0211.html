   <p>Mr. Josef Kasal, a native of Krucemburk, Czechoslovakia, living at 2422 South Hamlin Avenue, recently received a communication from his birthplace asking that support be given to a collection for the purpose of buying new church bells to replace those stolen by Austrians during the World War. As a consequence, the town is without church bells. Members of the committee in charge of the collection, Reverend Rohlik, Mr. Al. Zrzavy, and Mr. Karel Pokorny, state that the town has been without church bells for several years; this fact is a constant reminder of the horrors of war. Hope is expressed by the committee that American countrymen from Krucemburk and vicinity will give assistance to make possible the purchase of new bells. Our countrymen from Krucemburk and surrounding towns who wish to contribute are requested to send their donations to the above-mentioned address.</p>
