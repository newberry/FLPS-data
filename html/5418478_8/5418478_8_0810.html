   <p>P.4--Erroneous opinions have been circulating in Bohemian circles about the patriotic sentiments of our musician artist, Jan Kubelik, in regard to us Bohemian-Americans. In many respects this supposition was based upon truth and the cause for this opinion was, that Kubelik during his time, was not the kind of man our countrymen would have liked him to be. Kubelik, on his entrance into the society of aristocratic friends, began to cool in his patriotic enthusiasm and our people could not bear that, for their motto was: Kubelik is a Bohemian; Kubelik must be saved for the Bohemians. It was not altogether the fault of the artist alone that he began to forget his countrymen, it happened simply because of the activities of certain people, who are chiefly enemies of everything Bohemian, who making use of their influence upon our Bohemian artist wished to deprive us of Kubelik's friendship. That Mr. Kubelik did not act in the manner expected by our countrymen during his first visit cannot be held against him; at that time, he did not have as much experience with local conditions as he has today; he had been driven into an unfamiliar world by fate, and Dame Fortune lavishly smiling, showered him with fame and great success. For a young man this was almost too sudden and he was obliged to neglect some of his duties. Our famous artist <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>returns to us, after three years, entirely changed. His patriotic sentiment has flared, in his youthful spirit, with great enthusiasm and to our joy we can say, that only now is kubelik becoming a real Bohemian. Perhaps it will be held against us wrongly, because we bring such an impartial opinion about our artist, however, the purgose of this paragraph is to show Kubelik, to our people, in his true light. Every nation honors its great. The people of other nations would feel the loss of eminent men, of equal fame, as deeply as we do. Our people are in many respects, almost inconsiderate, in their desires. However, they esteem our artist too his hly, to suffer his alienation in silence. To be sure, kubelik is not a hereditary property to which we are ontitled, however, he is our countryman. He is a Bohemian and for that reason, we take such great interest in him.</p>
   <p>The concert being given in the interests of our benevolent undertakings in Chicago, by Jan Kubelik and Milada Cerny, at the Auditorium, on the 18th of this month, is for us the best proof, that Jubelik acknowledges the Bohemians and values the friendship of our countrymen. Our many patriotic giants know fully well the sad conditions existing among American-Bohemians. They think, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>however, that simple phrases will suffice to hide our nakedness before the world, whereas Kubelik realized, that it is better not to talk so much and to really aid morally and financially; such patriotism helps, much more than mere words. Our master decided to arrange a concert for the benefit of our welfare activities, for which he deserves the warmest recognition. Kubelik proved by this action, that he is a sincere and genuine Bohemian. Now, it is up to our people, to be conscious of their duty and one and all, according to their ability, to strive to make the affair as great a success as possible.</p>
   <p>We can now show, that we are nationalists, in short, that we are deserving of the honors which our young artists are bringing to us. Kubelik has done his duty as a Bohemian, now we must do our part.</p>
