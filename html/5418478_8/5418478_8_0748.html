   <p>Everywhere in Bohemian and Noravia, in all sizeable cities, the Den Kvetu (Flower Festival) is developing into a day consecrated to spirited activities, in districts where we are in the minority, for the benefit of our hard-pressed national organizations: the Narodni Jednota Pesuravska, Narodni Jedneta Severoceska (two committees in Bohemia for organizing and supporting Bohemian schools) and the Spolek Komensky (Komensky Society) for Bohemian school in Vienna. The idea of the Den Kvetu has been enthusiastically received is the old country, and the wide-spread preparations for the day give definite indication that its success, both moral and financial, is assured. Bohemian cities will be decked in a resplendent, magic garb of blossoms overflowing from windows and balconies. Crowds in festive finery, with nosegays, corsages, and flowers in men's buttonholes will be milling through the streets; and each flower, each bud and stem gathered from the awakening bosom of Mother Nature will proclaim the sprouting of the nation's newly awakened zeal for the preservation of its budding youth, whose tender stems are threatened by the unsparing attacks of a merciless foe.....</p>

   <p>Thus in the old country they combine the beautiful with the useful; the posy of spring-time with the practical efforts for national self-defense and protection of those who are being oppressed. And, May 18 is being recognized as a national holiday of no mean importance.</p>
   <p>With this in mind, our committee on beautification has decided to initiate a movement for a flower festival in all Bohemian communities in America. It will be held on the same day as the one in the old country, and the net profits will be equally divided among the three above-mentioned organizations and the Bohemian-American Hospital in Chicago. The committee on beautification is appealing to all our national organizations, particularly to our Sokol units, to exert their influence and give us active support in launching this national and charitable innovation properly. We are addressing an appeal to all Bohemian newspapers for help in creating an interest in the flower festival in Chicago as well as our communities in New York, Cleveland, Cedar Rapids, Omaha, etc. Their co-operation is urgently needed. If every one of us makes just a <span class="page-break">3</span>small contribution, the flower festival will become an important national holiday in our American communities, and its financial success will be more than amply assured.</p>
   <p>Again we repeat: let none of us refuse; let us all contribute, each according to our means; let us each do our national and humane duty and demonstrate to our non-Bohemian neighbors in this new home of ours that we are a wide-awake nation, that we sympathize with our suffering brothers and sisters!</p>
   <p>Chicago, May 10, 1913.....</p>
