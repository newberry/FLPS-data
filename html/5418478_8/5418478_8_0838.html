   <p>On October 29th, 1923, in the city of Chicago, Ill., James F. Stepina passed away. He was a comparatively young man as far as vigorous men go. He was only a babe in arms when he arrived in New York with his parents in 1864 from his birthplace in Bohemian--Kutna Hora.</p>
   <p>"Don't expect me to accept the presidency of this meeting unless that (Austrian) shield is removed from this hall," thundred "Jim" Stepina on July 28, 1914, in a meeting called to protest against the Austrian course toward Serbia. </p>
   <p>That, probably, was the turning point in the attitude of Americans of Czechoslovak origin, for, with the tearing down and trampling upon that shield amidst the howling and jeering bedlam, their purpose was firmly fixed and from it there was no deviation. </p>
   <p>In all probability "Jim" Stepina was the cause of arousing his countrymen to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a high pitch of enthusiasm which led to the freeing of Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>In 1870 the family moved from New York to Chicago and there young "Jim" Stepina, no one ever referred to him otherwise, was destined to work out one of the most creditable careers in the United States.</p>
   <p>Educated in the city's schools he entered the office of a notary public and about the year 1880 opened his own notarial office. Then he entered actively into politics.</p>
   <p>In turn he was district commissioner, collector of West Town and park commissioner of western parks.</p>
   <p>In the late nineties he opened a real estate office. In this he continued until 1911, when he organized the "American State Bank," one of the most successful financial institutions of Chicago. He was its first cashier and soon became president in which office he continued until his death.</p>

   <p>However, just a short time ago he arranged for the amalgamation of the "American State Bank" with "Kaspar's Bank", thus materializing the largest financial institution in the world controlled by Americans of Czechoslovak strain. Unfortunately he did not live to see it actually put through.</p>
   <p>Personally "Jim" Stepina was a very likable individual. To those who came to know him he was a man of firm convictions, stern principles, and sterling qualities. He loved America as no man of foreign birth loved it. Yet, withal, he loved his birthplace in Bohemia, with fervor seldom equalled, although he never saw it until in 1922 when he paid his first visit to free Czechoslovakia in whose cause he sacrificed so much.</p>
   <p>Possessed of a charitable disposition, he was free in helping worthy causes. His pride and--he made no secret of it--was his work in behalf of Czechoslovak freedom. And for this he is entitled to all the credit that this world can bestow upon him. Yet, there were some who tried to deny him the credit which was honorably his.</p>

   <p>When Count Lictzow visited this country many years ago to lecture on Bohemia, it was "Jim" Stepina who, with the Emanuel Beranek, saw to it that the American public was made familiar with Bohemia.</p>
   <p>Friendship meant more to "Jim" Stepina than mere acquaintance. He valued it above all else. Unfortunately a family tragedy--in fact, several--placed the cup of bitterness to his lips and he was forced to take many deep draughts from it.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, this hastened his end.</p>
   <p>Stepina was one of the leaders and largest supporters of the cult called "Svobodo-myseny" (Liberal thinkers). He was a Mason and held membership in many other organizations. He was popular and a friend of Jews and Gentiles, Liberals and Catholics.</p>

   <p>America has lost a loyal son. Czechoslovakia has lost a staunch friend. Americans of Czechoslovak strain have lost a leader who was at once courageous, firm, honorable and determined.</p>
   <p>"Of Stepina it may be properly said that there was no worthy undertaking which did not receive his support," writes Svet (Cleveland, Ohio). "Not only was his heart open to every good, noble endeavor, But also his purse. The first large amount contributed for the freedom of Czechoslovakia came from him."</p>
   <p>"The whole Czech America, and every worthy undertaking and effort, has sustained a loss through the death of J. F. Stepina."</p>
   <p>"Stepina was an exemplary American, proud of his new homeland, but his heart was also loyal to the nation from which he sprang", writes Svornost (Chicago, Ill.) "He was a generous supporter of national and Czechoslovak movements and he had many friends among the Jugoslavs whose endeavors he willingly supported."</p>
