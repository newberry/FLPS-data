   <p>P.4--The recent order for the deportation of a Bohemian immigrant girl shows to what petty punctiliousness our immigration authorities allow themselves to descend. The girl, Marjanka (May), was detained in the harbor of New York on the ground that she, according to her own admission, had a job waiting for her upon her arrival in Chicago. She was therefore detained as a violator of the law against importation of workers under contract. This seems to us utterly preposterous. Or did the immigration authorities really believe that a simple peasant girl had made the trip to America under contract? Had they given the case more careful consideration and investigated it more thoroughly, they would surely have discovered that some relative had written to her about as follows:</p>
   <p>"Just come, dear May! Plenty of work will be found for you, for there is a great lack of good servant girls."</p>
   <p>On the strength of some such superficial assurance, probably, the inexperienced girl confided to the immigration officers that a job was waiting for her in Chicago! And this was sufficient reason for them to detain her. Are they really of the opinion that a message of invitation constitutes a contract? Evidently they are, but they give scant evidence of their perspicacity.</p>
