   <p>At the time Doctor Koracek, Minister of Finance of the Czechoslovak Republic, issued the four percent Czechoslovak loan, it was expected that the loan would be subscribed to at home. But when this did not happen, an idea was conceived in Prague that the Bohemians and Slovaks in the United States could also participate in the subscription. Two representatives of banks in Prague, Doctor Pisecky, of the Bank of Bohemia, and Arnost Loewy, of the Bohemian Union Bank, were sent here to take care of certain business matters and also to seek subscribers for the four per cent loan. But because here, just as in Czechoslovakia, the loan was not properly advertised, very little was known about it except what the Bohemian and Slovak newspapers had reprinted from newspapers of Prague. Therefore, representatives of the banks in Prague found the market unprepared and after the transaction of their other tasks and several unsuccessful <span class="page-break">2</span>attempts to create interest in the loan, they departed for home. But another man was on his way here to work in the interest of the four per cent Czechoslovak loan. It was Mr. Vaclav Niederle, who formerly lived in Chicago. While living in Chicago, he voluntarily joined the French Legion and after the war departed with the Legion for Czechoslovakia. He arrived in the United States, recommended and accredited by the Minister of Finance of Czechoslovakia, to work here for the benefit of this loan. His enthusiastic articles and invitations for subscriptions were published in Czechoslovakian newspapers. But they aroused only a very little interest. Mr. Niederle then sought the aid of Czechoslovak bankers. He visited them and requested them to take hold of this cause. After consultation with several of them, a meeting of bankers was called. The meeting was attended by representatives of all our Czechoslovakian banks in Chicago and the proceedings of the meeting were very interesting. Mr. Niederle brought before them the cause of his mission. The answers he received were very true. It was <span class="page-break">3</span>pointed out to him that the loan did not meet with success in Czechoslovakia because it was not sufficiently advertised. How could the loan meet with success here, where nothing is known about it except what was published in our Bohemian newspapers? The Czechoslovak Government and banks were censured because they never consult Bohemian national, commercial, or financial circles in the United States. Plans are made for America in Prague, and representatives from Prague are sent here to carry out these plans: they are unfamiliar with prevailing conditions and do not consult local organizations. It was pointed out that Bohemian banks in Prague, with the permission and approval of the government, sent two Bohemian financiers to the United States in 1919, to negotiate a twenty-five million dollar loan. The representative of the Minister of Finance was already in the United States. The Negotiations took place in New York where, of course, any international loan is closed. But Bohemian financiers were left unnoticed; no one negotiated with them and the representatives of the Bohemian banks of Prague, after spending only two days in Chicago, merely <span class="page-break">4</span>mentioned that the loan had not been closed in New York because of unfavorable conditions. Nevertheless, the opinion predominated here that the Western, agricultural States, including Wisconsin, Minnesota, South and North Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska, with its hundreds of thousands of industrious and wealthy farmer, devoted to their native land, would be able to subscribe a loan of several million dollars. In a like million could be subscribed in the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio, swarming with the thrifty Czechoslovakian people, not to mention Chicago, Cleveland, and other cities, with their hundreds of thousands of Bohemians and Slovaks. And how about the States of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, where the farmers were willing to sell their cotton to the Czechoslovakian Government on credit. Would not this money and cotton have come in handy to the government, industry, and commerce of Czechoslovakia in 1919, if the Bohemian banks and the governmen had negotiated directly with our circles at that time? Would not the financial position of Czechoslovakia be strengthened if, for instance, the Czechoslovak Government had made a loan of ton or fifteen million <span class="page-break">5</span>dollars among our people, when it was impossible to get a twenty-five million dollar loan from Morgan or the Guaranty Trust Company?</p>
   <p>These opinions were expressed by all the representatives of the sixteen Bohemian banks and it was resolved, to organize themselves as an American-Czechoslovak Bankers' Association, and to extend the organization all over the United States where Czechoslovak, or partially Czechoslovak, banks exist. It was also resolved not to participate in, or subscribe to this four per cent loan, but to participate, as generously as possible, in the subscription of the next loan which is being prepared for American subscription. Because the next loan will amount to at least fifty million dollars, the Bankers Association will endeavor to secure the good will of the large group of New York bankers for the realization of the loan. This can be accomplished if our banks participate in the subscription of the loan in large amounts, and if they take the sale of bonds to the <span class="page-break">6</span>Czechoslovak people into their own hands. After this meeting, an organizational meeting was held; bylaws were adopted and officers were elected. Officers of the association are: James F. Stepina, president; Frank G. Hajicek, secretary; Otto Kaspar, treasurer; Frank J. Skala, president of the publicity committee.</p>
