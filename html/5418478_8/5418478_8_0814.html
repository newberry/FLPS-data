   <p>p. 1. Col. 5--Yesterday Chicagoans were at last given the opportunity to hear again the most celebrated violinist of the present day, Jan Kubelik, who appeared at the Auditorium.</p>
   <p>This gigantic theatre was filled to capacity by the public, of which Bohemians formed a considerable percentage.</p>
   <p>As the time for Kubelik's appearance drew near, the eagerness with which the public awaited him was apparent. As soon as his popular figure appeared on the stage, the Auditorium was shaken by a thunderous applause which was followed instantly by a tomb-like silence as soon as he raised his instrument and his accompanist seated himself at the piano. Immediately thereafter there sprang from his instrument a stream of pure tones, full of power and feeling, completely transporting the minds of the listeners into the mysterious realm of music.</p>

   <p>The program was on the highest artistic level, containing such names as Bach, Handel, Ernst, Tchaikovski and Paganini.</p>
   <p>The master demonstrated to us with this his first performance in our city, that he is unsurpassable, that the judgement of the critics which follows him upon his second tour of America is deserved.</p>
   <p>Kubelik's success yesterday seems natural to us and we are rejoicing over it, for he is a Czech and only yesterday he became the object of admiration by the Americans.</p>
   <p>The next concert will be given at the Auditorium, at 2:30 o'clock, Saturday.</p>
