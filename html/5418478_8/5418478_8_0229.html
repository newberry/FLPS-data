   <p>Jan G. Masaryk, Czechoslovakian minister to the United States, was the guest of the University of Chicago, yesterday afternoon. The University of Chicago is the famous educational institution where his renowned father, Thomas G. Masaryk, conducted a series of lectures, about fourteen years ago, while visiting the United States. At 4 P. M., in the university auditorium, Kandel Hall, at 57th Street and University Avenue, many people had assembled. Among those present were members of the university's faculty, students, and also many representatives of the Czechoslovakian people. When our dear guest appeared on the speaker's platform, he was greeted by enthusiastic applause. His speech, in which he discussed the actual conditions in Czechoslovakia, created a deep impression. In addition to him, representatives of the university spoke, expressing their sympathy with the Czechoslovakian people and their President. The meeting lasted until late in the evening and was a success in every respect. Among the large assemblage we noticed Professor Kasparek, who has just returned from Siberia where he had been sent by the Czechoslovakian government on an important mission.</p>
