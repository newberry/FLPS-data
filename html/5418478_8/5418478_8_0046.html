   <p>Not a single week passes that newspapers do not bring a report of callous conduct of the immigration officials on Ellis Island in New York. People are often deported and, it can rightfully be presumed, this happens even without sufficient reasons, especially in cases where the unfortunate immigrant has no one to come to his defense. Quite often we read about the deportation of our Bohemian people, as well as of Slovaks or other Slavonic peoples. The immigrant is simply detained at Ellis Island and just as soon as any reason is found his deportation follows without ceremony. Some are detained because they do not have the amount of money required by law, and they must remain on Ellis Island, where they are held as though they were in prison until their relatives are notified to help them with the necessary amount. At times other reasons are found for detention, and then it is necessary to seek the aid of congressmen or other influential persons in order to save the unfortunate from a compulsory return to his native land.</p>
   
   <p>The immigration officers in New York show extraordinary zeal in carrying out the law, and, because of their excessive anxiety to prevent the entry into the United States of undesirable people, they have no sympathy for the unfortunates, who, in their opinion, do not comply with existing immigration laws in every detail. It happens quite often that, as a result of the unreasonable judgment of these almighty gentlemen, a family is torn apart forever, a wife separated from her husband or children separated from their parents. At Ellis Island even such a strange decision is considered just, so long as it satisfies the requirements of the law according to which no unhealthy or otherwise undesirable people are to be allowed to enter the United States.</p>
   <p>Although the present immigration laws are very strict, some people in Congress are attempting to have them made even stricter, and to make more difficult the admission of upright and industrious immigrants. Congress has, to be sure, the right to pass such laws as would prevent the entry into the United States of criminals or people who would become public charges, but this does not give the immigration officials the right to class every immigrant as a criminal or as one who is unable to make a living. Secretary Nagel, who has charge of the immigration department, said that they should follow, not the letter, but the spirit of the law, so that an injustice might not be done to any immigrant. For that reason he often overrules the nonsensical decisions of the immigration officials and permits the entry of people whom the gentlemen at Ellis Island would want to deport. A case of this kind happened just a few days ago when two elderly women, who came to America after their nephew, were to have been deported. They had raised him from childhood, and he wished to show his gratitude by providing for them in their old age. He sent them money to pay for their passage, but when they arrived in New York they were detained and were to have been deported to Europe. The immigration officials ascertained that the nephew earned twenty-five dollars per week and this, in their opinion, was not enough for him to be able to provide for a group of three persons. Perhaps those gentlemen do not know that there are in America thousands of laborers, who, with half or even less than half of this income, must support large families, and they are forced to do so even under the present high cost of living; they do not thereby become "undesirables". This nonsensical decision was brought to the attention of Secretary Nagel, who had so much good sense that he directed that both women be permitted to enter immediately.</p>
   
   <p>Another glaring case which recently provoked warranted indignation within our sokol circles was the detention of our countryman Vaclav Treska of Detroit. Mr. Treska was one of the contestants at the sokol slet in Prague and on his return was detained on the information of some person who, in an anonymous communication, branded him as an anarchist. A person would think that the officials would not pay any attention to unsigned letters, but it was very suitable for the purpose of the gentlemen at the immigration office, and they caused Mr. Treska inconveniences which he will never forget. Who knows, had it not been for energetic defense, but that they might have decided that he be deported, in spite of the fact that he had lived in this country for six years, had his family here and is respected among sokols and the general public. He had to submit to a veritable inquisition, and was treated, he said, like some criminal. No doubt, the officials thought they had succeeded in making an important discovery. Hence the unfortunate Bohemian "anarchist" from Detroit was detained in the filthy and odorous Ellis Island atmosphere until finally the officials were convinced that they had been guilty of real asininity.</p>
   <p>Mr. Treska, on his return from the old homeland, underwent a bitter experience.</p>
   
   <p>It should serve as a warning for tourists in the future. In our newspapers it has often been pointed out that tourists to the old homeland should always provide themselves with citizenship papers and passports if they wish to avoid any unpleasantness.</p>
   <p>We think that a man who lives in the United States several years and has his family here, should not hesitate to secure citizenship papers. Then if he wishes to visit the old homeland he may rest assured that he will meet with no difficulties on his return. As a citizen of the United States there can be no occasion for his meeting with injustice, or detention at Ellis Island pending an investigation by the immigration officials. No one can then prevent his reentry into the country or into his family circle. No one should forget to take these precautions and thereby avoid all difficulties.</p>
   <p>This, of course, in no way excuses the brutal actions of the immigration officials in Mr. Freska's case; and it would be only right that an energetic protest be sent to the President requesting that a thorough investigation be made. This would in no way help the Detroit sokol now. However, it could help to better conditions on Ellis Island and thereby benefit thousands of our immigrants who are placed at the mercy of the immigration officials.</p>
