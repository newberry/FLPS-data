   <p>Seventy years ago yesterday Thomas G. Masaryk, was born in Hodonin, Moravia. There are still fresh memories in the mind of each one of us, of many events of the past stormy epoch, and it is unnecessary to explain to any of us, all that Masaryk was, is, and will be for a long time to come, to our nation. The whole life of our beloved President Masaryk is nothing else but a crystal-clear, swift stream, from which everyone who has come in close contact with it, has obtained a refreshing, delicious, and healthy drink. But this stream finally became a terrific torrent, which by its enormous force, soon swept away the cause of our ancient subjection. Principally he is given credit for the fact that today our nation is free. Perhaps this nation is first experiencing the most dangerous period of stormy fermentation; a period of immature unfettered youth, which even if it wanted to, could not hold its passion in check. But today it is well known to the whole world that this nation is as genuine as old gold.</p>
   <p>Everyone of us knows and remembers very well, all the achievements of President Masaryk for the cause of his nation and homeland. But just as he, who standing at the foot of a high tower, is not able to see the top of it, regardless of how hard he tries, just as he, who standing at the foot of a sky-reaching mountain, cannot fully comprehend all of its magnificent splendor and majesty, so it is for all us contemporaries of President Masaryk--the proper perspective is missing. This is an inevitable condition, for the proper measurement of that enormous height, with which President Masaryk overtops his whole surroundings, like an ancient, luxurious pine tree overtops the forest undergrowth. To appreciate fully his significance, is only possible from a distance, after many years have passed, when everything is properly adjusted, crystallized, when truth, like the wind scatters the confusing fog rising from unclean swamps, carries away all gossip, suspicion, jealousy, and other like things full of a mixture of personal dislike; when truth comes to the surface of history like pure gold in a smelter. But today this much can be said that the great majority of the Czechoslovak people look toward their leader, toward their first President of this new-born republic, toward their Father Masaryk with fervent love, highest esteem, and deepest respect.</p>
   <p>Proof of this was yesterday's enthusiastic celebration of his seventieth birthday, held in Sokol Chicago Hall, by our foremost national organizations. Despite the fact that the celebration was arranged at the last moment and was not advertised much, it was attended by so many people that the spacious hall was filled to capacity. The piety and enthusiasm of the people during the course of the celebration, especially were evidence of this.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Paskovsky, secretary of the District Committee of the Czechoslovak National Alliance, opened the celebration with a short prologue and introduced the first speaker, Mr. John Matlocha, secretary of the District Committee of the Slovak League.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Matlocha first mentioned that twenty or more years ago, students of Thomas G. Masaryk, as for instance, Srobar, Hodza, and others, met together, dreamed and planned schemes for the liberation of Slovakia, in which after a long time they finally succeeded. He related further about the love and fondness Masaryk enjoys among brother Slovaks, who proclaim him a Slovak, just as Czechs proclaim him a Czech, but he said that Masaryk is ours. Then he read a brief biography of Masaryk, leaving it to the following speaker to bring out Masaryk's activities.</p>
   <p>After this speech, the Bohemian Central Singing Society sang Bedrich Smetan's sublime "Veno" (The Dedication), which, by its faultless presentation, so pleased the audience that the singers were compelled to give an encore. </p>
   <p>The next speaker was Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal, who began his speech with a citation of Sir Walter Scott's poem: "Breathes there a man, with soul so dead, who never to himself hath said, This is my own, my native land--?" This poem, as it is known, deals with a man in whose mind all sentiment toward his native land had died. Basing his speech on the wording of this poem, the speaker told how hard it is for a man, in this enormously complicated struggle for existence, to preserve at least a bit of idealism. Woe to that nation, where this sacred spark has died. The speaker then cited Stevenson, who has said that everyone of us is made out of two different substances; in every one of us there are two creatures: animal and man. "The animal lives in us as an animal, and only the man in us longs for something better, and higher. Man begins only where the struggle for existence ends. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for everyone of us to hold fast to people who excel their surroundings, in order to preserve our idealism and not perish morally. This then is the main reason why today's observance of Masaryk's birthday is held.</p>
   <p>"Today, Masaryk is still the old promontory upon which is destroyed the fruitless malice of all our enemies, be it internal or external. A great, ill-fated error was made by that man, who, after the Armistice was signed, was the first one to say: 'On this day, end the political actions of Bohemian-America!'" According to the speaker, today Masaryk is passing through a more strenuous period than at the time of the war.</p>
   <p>Professor Zmrhal then read the resolution adopted by the Czechoslovak National Alliance on November 15 and 16, 1919, in which we solemnly promised Masaryk that we would not let up, but that we would persevere until the end. Then he asked if we actually kept this solemn promise. He said he was glad that at least it was possible for him to announce that yesterday the sum of one million Czechoslovak Kronen had been sent to President Masaryk, although, according to the present low valuation of Czechoslovak currency, the sum is not enormous. "This is the only thing we have done toward the fulfillment of our solemn promises. Let us begin this celebration of Masaryk's birthday with deeds. Conditions in our republic are improving, but a heavy cloud, which is the enormous and feverishly executed propaganda of the Hungarians, appears upon the horizon of our young republic. They have already enforced a plebiscite in the German part of Hungary and, today, it is possible that the Treaty of Versailles will be modified to such an extent that the possibilities of a plebiscite in Slovakia will not be excluded. The obstinacy of the Hungarian agitation is known, and it is unnecessary to say what the results might be. Whose fault would it be, but ours? The liberation of Slovakia from the Hungarian yoke was costly; many lives were lost. Should all this be in vain? Just as our people died for our country during the war, now we must strenuously live for our country.</p>
   <p>First then, it is our obligation to Masaryk to preserve one of our fore most institutions, the Czechoslovak National Alliance. This Alliance has made many enemies in the past, and now has many enemies only because of its unexpected success." The speaker admitted that even this body has made certain mistakes, but one of its greatest mistakes was that it tolerated in silence all the detractions and abuses, and did not immediately cause the arrest of the first person who said that robbery was going on within it and did not compel him to prove the charge. "Of course, other mistakes were made, for nothing in the world is faultless. Everyone, especially those who are not able to accomplish anything themselves, claim the right to criticize." The speaker then briefly mentioned the tasks which President Masaryk has already accomplished, in spite of the most unfavorable circumstances in Czechoslovakia, and he said that, first of all, it will be necessary to educate the people of Czechoslovakia in patriotism, which, of course, will take some time. "What a large nation we are already is evident to everyone, since we were able to resist the avalanche of enemies, coming from all sides, and to defend our hard won liberty." In conclusion, the speaker appealed to all Czech people in whom, thus far, all sentiment for the native land and mankind has not died, to prove their love and respect for Masaryk, not only by words but by deeds. He also said that we should continue in the struggle to defend that which we have gained. The speaker ended his speech with the enthusiastic exclamation: "Hus's and Masaryk's nation and people, our nation and people!"</p>
   <p>Secretary Paskovsky then read a resolution, to be sent to President Masaryk, which was unanimously accepted and the celebration was ended with the singing of our national anthems, "Kde domov muj?" (Where Is My Home) and "Hej Slovane" (Ho! Slavs).</p>
   <p>The resolution reads as follows: "Czechoslovak people, assembled on March 7, 1920, on the significant day of your birth, in a public mass meeting arranged by our national organizations: the Czechoslovak National Alliance, the District Committee of the Slovak League, the National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics, the Central Sokol Circuit, the Czechoslovak Legionnaires, and the Bohemian Art Club hereby take the liberty to express their sentiment of love and respect toward you, as one of the greatest sons of our nation, our leader in the victorious revolution, which brought to our heavily burdened nation long desired freedom. We offer our most sincere good wishes. We also most heartily wish, for ourselves and for our nation, that we may be able to send you our good wishes for many years to come, so that, as long as possible, our nation may enjoy the fruits of your distinguished work, blessed by a most genuine love for it."
