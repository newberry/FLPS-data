   <p>Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, our undaunted leader, acknowledged by the United States Government as president of the future Czechoslovak independent state, was guest of honor at a banquet given by the Union League Club yesterday. The latter is known as one of the most exclusive and influential bodies of its kind in Chicago. Men of wealth, public officials, and others of prominence in the city, state, and nation are included in its membership.</p>
   <p>The banquet was held in the Club rooms at 69 West Jackson Boulevard. Besides the guests of American and foreign extraction, there were a few Czechoslovaks and other Slavs. In general, there were as many ladies as gentlemen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Scott, president of the Club, opened the banquet by touching upon the present phase of the war, emphasizing that it is the duty of supporters of the Allies, and of the people of the United States, to work against the acceptance of any peace proposals until Germany has surrendered unconditionally. This remark drew tumultuous applause. In speaking of Czechoslovaks, he expressed great pleasure at the opportunity to welcome the great representative of not only the Czechoslovaks, but of outstanding men of this era--Professor Thomas G. Masaryk. At the sound of the name turbulent applause filled the room,and the audience rose from their seats.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk thanked everyone for the ovation, then spoke on the question of changes on the map of Europe after the war. Austria-Hungary must be dismembered, and an independent Czechoslovak state created to block Germany's expansion toward the East. A strong Yugoslav state will also have to be created before there can be any thought of a permanent peace in Europe. The speaker substantiated his explanations by means of a map, which informed those present on the existing conditions. He reiterated the declaration of the former speaker, that without an unconditional surrender of Germany there can be no thought of peace. In closing, Professor Masaryk invited the gathering to ask questions, which he would endeavor to answer to the best of his knowledge and ability.</p>
   <p>Four questions were put to him. They were about the Czechoslovak Army in Russia, the difficulties it had to surmount, and the sufferings its soldiers had to endure before the army had fought its way over the vast lands of Russia, and into Vladivostok, Siberia. Masaryk also dwelt upon the opposition and resistance which Czechoslovak soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian Army offered to its government from the very beginning of the war. He spoke of the mass desertions of Czechoslovak soldiers and of executions, and of the final success which was attained by the deserters in forming a Czechoslovak army.</p>
   <p>In referring to the Czechs, he declared that that they are the most intelligent people in Europe, and that their education excels that of any other people. And that is the very reason, he declared, why the Czechs are not eager to absorb culture--i. e., German culture--because they have their own culture.</p>
   <p>After the questions had been answered, the audience again acclaimed Professor Masaryk and rose.</p>
   <p>Mr. James F. Stepina was one of several prominent Czechoslovaks present. He functioned as head of the committee for the State of Illinois Centennial celebration in the Auditorium Theater the day before yesterday. Among the foreign guests were the Russian and Japanese consuls and their wives.</p>
   <p>Last nights' event may be regarded as another milestone toward further success, to which Professor Masaryk has contributed so materially. He, and Mr. J. Cisar, his secretary, will leave at 10 A.M. today for Washington, D. C., where highly important business is awaiting them.</p>
