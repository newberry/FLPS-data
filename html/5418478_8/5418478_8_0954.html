   <p>Mrs. Anezka Bedlan-Salek one of the oldest settlers, and a member of one of the first Czech families settled here in Chicago, died yesterday morning. She had lived in this new land fifty-seven years. With her parents, she experienced all the hardships of pioneers, but this only ennobled and strengthened her character. Regardless of the fact that she spent more than half a century in a strange land, she remained a sincere Czech, and raised her family the same way. She is survived by her son. Frank Bedlan, and a daughter, Bessie Krdlicka.</p>
   <p>The deceased was born near Frague, sixty-six years ago, and came to this country with her parents when she was nine years old. After she grew up, she took an active part in our national and social life, and in that manner she has made an everlasting impression upon our memories. Interment will take place in Bohemian National Cemetery. </p>
