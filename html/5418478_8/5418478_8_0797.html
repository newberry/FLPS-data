   <p>P.2, Col.3--Sixty years has elapsed since the day Professor T. G. Masaryk was born, in a little community of Moravia.</p>
   <p>The greater part of his life he had been confronted with tremendous struggles to protect his thoughts and ideas and in many instances, forced to disagree with his own friends even perhaps making enemies of them, because he could see no worthwhile reason of their disagrements with him.</p>
   <p>In Czechoslovakia, on the evening of his birthday, his friends, including many of his former enemies, held a party in his honor. They know now, that he is a great man, who is not afraid to follow his own proven ideas, whether it concerns politics or religion, and they acknowledge his ability to be leader of men.</p>
   <p>Professor Masatyk is not a stranger in America. He has married an American woman and has many personal friends here, some of whom are his former students It is for this reason that we celebrated and honored this great Bohemian man.</p>
   
   <p>The Bohemian people of Chicago held a meeting in his honor, last evening at the Park of Svat. Cecha. (now known under the name of Dvorak Park). Several prominent speakers present, spoke of professor Masaryk's achievements and of his successful progress in life, in general. Miss Jane Addams who was to preside at this meeting was unable to do so, because of sudden illness, but was represented by Miss M. McDowell who is also well-known.</p>
