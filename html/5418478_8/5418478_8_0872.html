   <p>Mr. John A. Cervenka, one of the leaders in our political and social activities, suffered an accident at the last bazaar sponsored by the Czech National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics. In a fall he split a bone in the leg, which had previously been broken in several places in an automobile accident. He is confined in the St. Anthony Hospital. Professor Masaryk recently paid a visit of condolence to his bedside, and expressed best wishes for the patient's speedy recovery. Mr. Cervenka was deeply moved and thanked Professor Masaryk. He then remarked, with a smile, that he did not regret the accident now, since it brought him the honor of Masaryk's visit.</p>
