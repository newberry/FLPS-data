   <p>The victory of the Russian people and their establishment of a democratic government has echoed in joyous sounds throughout the Slavonic world. Professor Thomas Masaryk, leader of the Czechoslovak people, was the first to congratulate the Russians upon the revolution successfully accomplished. He sent the following manifesto, in the name of the Czechoslovak people, to his old friend and fellow-protector of the Slavonic nations, Pavel N. Miljukov, Minister of Foreign Affairs:</p>
   <p>"In the name of the Czechoslovak National Foreign Council I can say: 'We are joining your great work for the Slavonic nations and for mankind. The Slavonic questions are solved, and free Russia has now the full right to liberate the Slavs from the German-Magyar-Turkish yoke. We have joined our Slavonic brethren in this war. Austria-Hungary has taken horrible revenge, but the sacrifices of our martyrs are outweighed by the triumph of your splendid revolution.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The union of the Polish countries under a free Russia, the unification of the Galician and Hungarian Russians with Russia, the unification of the Servo-Croatians with the Slovenians, and the liberation of the Czechs and Slovaks--all this will be realized through the rebirth of Russia. Not only the Slavonic peoples, but also the Romanic peoples, the French, Italians, and Roumanians, will see their just national hopes fulfilled. A free Russia means a most crushing blow to Prussianism and Pan-Germanism. A free Russia spells death for the treacherous enemy of all Slavonic nations, Austria-Hungary. A free Russia is equivalent to a strengthening of the Allies. A free Russia, together with France and England, will solve the ancient question by an organic union of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Your great eastern republic can connect this phase of world politics with a reconstruction of Europe and a reorganization of mankind.'"</p>
   <p>Masaryk also sent a proclamation to Rodzianko, president of the Duma. It read:</p>
   <p>"The Czechs and Slovaks welcome the triumph of your revolution. The ideals of the Slavonic leaders will materialize. The vastness of the Slavonic lands will be equalled now by the magnitude of Slavonic intellectual culture. We have always <span class="page-break">3</span>loved the Russian people, and we have joined oar Slavonic brethren in this war against the common enemy. The thousands who perished by the fierce vengeance of Austria-Hungary are martyrs now for the freedom of Russia. The Slavonic questions are solved, now that the freedom of Russia is assured. Devoted to you and your glorious cause, Professor Masaryk, representative of the Czech people and president of the Czechoslovak National Council."</p>
   <p>The central committee of the Czech National Association in America sent the following cablegram: </p>
   <p>"To the President of the Ministry, Prince Lvov, Petrograd: Thousands of Czechs in America are greeting the Russian people and their democratic government, hoping that Russia will get rid of the enemies of all Slavonic peoples now, and will put an end to the German-Hungarian tyranny. The Czechs, united all over the world under the leadership of Professor Masaryk, are greeting the Russian people, the head of all the Slavonic peoples."</p>
   <p>Miljukov, Minister of Foreign Affairs, was sent the following cablegram by <span class="page-break">4</span>Doctor L. T. Fisher, president of the Czech National Association:</p>
   <p>"In this moment when Russia has accepted a government by the people, we, the Czechs of America, hasten to express to Your Excellency our feeling of boundless joy over this happy change. We salute the exalted Russian nation which has gained liberty not only for herself, but which will win it also for the smaller Slavonic nations. We hold sincere admiration for you as one of the founders of New Russia. In the name of our leader, Professor Masaryk, we hope for an early victory of great Russia, convinced that this will also bring freedom to the Czechs and Slovaks."</p>
