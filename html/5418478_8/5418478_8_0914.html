   <p>After only a few days of illness, Vaclav Lenoch, one of Chicago's oldest Czech amateur actors, passed away recently. He was known to every older resident of our settlement, and in earlier times was declared to be our best story teller. He came to Chicago when he was twenty-one years old. In 1869, he appeared on the stage, became active as an amateur, playing mostly in the old Slovanska Lipa (Slavic Lindentree club), but finally he played alternatively in almost every hall of the Chicago Czech community. His high artistic level would easily have enabled him to become a professional actor. There was ample proof for his excellent qualities, for he passed through a considerable period as the first actor of an outstanding German theatrical company.</p>
   <p>During his later years, he wrote a goodly number of short stories, some of which were reprinted in the calendar of the Denni Hlasatel; many memoirs depicting the life of the early Czech immigrants issued from his pen. One play, "Zelena Pepicka," portrays our early settlers. He translated "Robert and Bertram," a comedy known later as "Lisak A Smola." He also was a newspaperman, having spent some time with the editorial staff of the Denni Hlasatel.</p>
   <p>He will be buried in the Bohemian National Cemetery.</p>
