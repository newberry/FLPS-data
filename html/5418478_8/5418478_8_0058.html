   <p>In view of the indignation caused by the preliminary report of the Census Bureau on the nationalities of the foreign-born white inhabitants of the State of Illinois, the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), in order to receive an official explanation of the matter, sent the following communication to Director of the Census Mr. E. D. Durand:</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:  The special report, distributed by the Census Bureau to the Press Associations for publication on or after May 2, containing a preliminary report on the nationalities of the foreign-born white inhabitants in the State of Illinois, as shown by the thirteenth decennial census held on April 15, 1910, caused great indignation among the readers of Bohemian newspapers of the United States. The Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) and the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar have been requested to intervene in the matter, and to ask the President and the Congress of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>United States to secure compliance with the Congressional resolution in regards to the ascertainment of nationalities during the Thirteenth Census.</p>
   <p>Not wishing to cause the Census Bureau any annoyance, we therefore ask you for an explanation. We realize that said statement gave only comparative figures for the years 1900 and 1910, and therefore could remain in the scientifically worthless classification of the 1900 census; but, nevertheless, we say that it should have mentioned that for that reason only the scientifically impossible and unjust record of lands of origin was kept.</p>
   <p>The classification, as it was given in the statement released May 2, was obviously unjust. Several of the privileged nations were actually favored, as, for instance, in the statement under the title "Nationality" Canada was divided into two parts: French Canada and Other Canada, although geographically and politically it would be proper to use only Canada if the word "Austria" is used in the same sense; Finland is equally independent, although <span class="page-break">\3</span>it is politically united with Russia in the same manner as Bohemia is united with Austria-Hungary. Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England are listed in four separate columns instead of under one heading--"Great Britain". The Slavs are not favored in the same manner. If the European Anglo-Saxons can have four separate columns; if the Canadian-French can have a special column; so should the Bohemians, who culturally, both past and present, are their equals.</p>
   <p>Scientifically the statistical conception of Austria is an impossibility. It is warranted neither ethnographically (there is no Austrian nation, only the inhabitants of Upper and Lower Austria could be so called, but they do not wish it; they call themselves Upper Austrian and Lower Austrian Germans), nor linguistically (there is no Austrian language; only Bohemian, German, Polish, etc., exist there), nor politically (there is no law which officially creates the title Austria, the western half of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, because the official title appearing at the head of the Empire's Constitution reads "Kingdoms and Lands represented in the Empire's Council").</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Therefore, because scientifically the figures under the heading "Austria", 1900--67,072, 1910--164,966, for the State of Illinois; and 1900--57,676, 1910--133,201, for the City of Chicago, are altogether meaningless, permitting of no real scientific deduction, we must only regret that these figures appeared in the statement, as they represent wholly useless effort.</p>
   <p>For instance, what do the figures "Chicago, 1910--133,201 Austria" mean? Who are they? Germans, even if coming from Austria, were listed under the heading "Germany". However, how many Bohemians are there in Chicago? The City Manual, published by the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the City of Chicago, lists for 1910 in Chicago: Americans 699,554; Germans 563,708; Irish 240,560; Poles 173,409; Swedes 143,307; Russians 123,238; Bohemians 116,549.</p>
   <p>What then is the relation between this official Chicago figure of 116,549 Bohemians and the Census figure of 133,201 Austrians? The results cannot be upheld; therefore, all the great effort of the Census Bureau to ascertain the figures listed under the title "Austria" is worthless.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Hoping that your reply will be satisfactory in the sense that it will disperse our fears, and that the Congressional Resolution sponsored by the Honorable A. J. Sabath (Resolution Number 23, approved March 24, 1910) will be strictly adhered to, we are [Signatures follow].</p>
   <p>A copy of this communication was also sent to Congressman A. J. Sabath with a request that he intercede in the matter with the Census Bureau.</p>
