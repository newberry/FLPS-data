   <p>It it a long standing custom among all nationalities to remember their meritorious men when they have passed the age of fifty years. What if we also should follow that example? Liberal-minded Bohemians of Chicago could begin immediately. Recently, we delved in Habenicht's "Dejinny Cechu Amerikych" (History of American-Bohemians) and here we found out that Bartos Bitner was born July 12, 1861. Therefore, in a very few days he will pass his fiftieth anniversary. Mr. Bitner's merits as an author, as a journalist, and as a liberal-minded man are recognized by all of us, even those who do not agree with him from the viewpoint of religion. What if in some way we remember Mr. Bitner, who thus far has harvested so little material recognition for his labors? It would surely serve to stimulate him to new exertion of his powers, and our people would be benefited thereby.</p>
