   <p>Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the most remarkable historic edifice in the union. There is the Liberty Bell....and pictures of men on the walls--pictures of revolutionaries for whom, as such, golden gallows had been prepared--but who, in the judgment of a just fate, have won an unalienable place in the history of the Union, and a spot in the heart and soul of the free American man. There are places where the tongue is awed into silence, and where the throb of the heart speaks the logic of history.....</p>
   <p>There is the cradle of American independence, where the American eagle spread its wings for its first free flight, to project itself into heights never dreamed of.</p>

   <p>At those monuments of American history, a group of men paused in August, 1909. Dr. J. E. Scheiner, head of the Czech Sokol community [in Europe] and of the Slav Sokol community, headed the party which was bound for Chicago, there to attend the first all-Sokol rally. The sentiments of the visitors are preserved in the memorial book of that historical museum. The words were from the pen of V. J. Klofac [Czech representative in the Austrian parliament]:</p>
   <p>"Sons of a subjugated nation admire and honor the men who won liberty for their motherland."</p>
   <p>Only a few plain words, but what deep meaning is in them!</p>
   <p>There is a similarity in the development of nations who blazed the path to the enticing rays of freedom which is born from tears and blood. This very ocean of suffering, through which the American people had to go, strengthened its sympathy for oppressed nations, wherever they may live on this globe.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>When President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed that no government should rule over a people without its consent, he merely expressed the will of one hundred million Americans, who lean on the traditions of the freest and greatest republic in the world. This tradition is reflected in the recognition of the rightful demands of the Czechoslovaks, who, like Prometheus of the myth, have been chained for centuries to the black and yellow [Austrian] rock, undaunted, and calling loudly for our political rights and advancing our just claims, even in times when the world passed us up, never touched by our sighs of despair, which meant more than a voice in the desert.</p>
   <p>September 3, 1918, was celebrated as the day of resurrection for the large family of Czechoslovaks. On that day the historical proclamation pronounced the death sentence over this outmoded feudal system.....</p>
   <p>We are still alive and full of fight!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The fight is not finished by far. The utmost exertions will be necessary to down the rabid Hun, but when the stormy sea will have become calm....the day of September 3, 1918, will mean a national holiday just as does September 20, for the Italians.....</p>
   <p>Just like the name of Garibaldi, the name of Thomas G. Masaryk will be indelibly inscribed in the heart of every honest Czechoslovak as our hero in our defense against Austria. With his name will be pronounced the name of President Woodrow Wilson, recognized spokesman of world democracy, the man to whom our people will forever be bound in gratitude for our national rebirth.</p>
   <p>How thankful the hearts of the Czechoslovaks can be was best demonstrated at the manifestation held yesterday under the auspices of the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America, and the Slovak League, in Grant Park, on the grounds of the War Exposition.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>An uncounted multitude of our people came to express gratitude to our President and the American Government. They did it in such grandiose style that Czechoslovak Day became one of the most magnificent events in our community. It became a holiday of the Czechoslovak settlement in the broadest conception of the word.</p>
   <p>What the arrangements committee considered a mere request to our people was accepted by them as an order and a command, which was obeyed in all parts of our community strictly and eagerly. Our national discipline has shown itself in the most beautiful light. The overwhelming majority of Czechoslovak shops and stores were closed all afternoon. Those business houses which, for one reason or another, could not close, surely did not find many customers to serve. We are positive, however, that most Czechoslovak employers closed gladly, to give their employees an opportunity to attend the celebration. Everyone in our settlement felt it instinctively his duty to do everything to enhance the success of a day of such towering significance for us. Every Czechoslovak district was a veritable sea of waving flags and other decorations <span class="page-break">\6</span>in the national colors.</p>
   <p>Hardly more than one week has passed since the first meeting, called by the arrangements committee, was held in the hall of Sokol Havlicek Tyrs, yet so vigorous was the action begun by representatives and members of our associations, clubs, and other organizations that the results were splendid. Announcements of participation came in large numbers. At 3:30 P.M., every street opening into Michigan Boulevard from 14th Street north was jammed with members of our organizations and individuals. The vicinity around the Illinois Central railroad station was literally buried under countless banners and service flags.</p>
   <p>In spite of the immense number of participants, the parade moved with clocklike precision, a vivid testimony to the thoroughness with which the plans for the occasion had been laid. The committee had ingratiatingly complied with the wishes of managers of the smaller groups, and so contributed to the smoothness with which the parade started north on Michigan Boulevard.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>This boulevard, ordinarily a thoroughfare for endless rows of auto-mobiles, presented an entirely different aspect yesterday afternoon. All traffic was stopped and the sidewalks were lined with dense crowds, lending our parade a colorful background and heightening the importance of the scene.</p>
   <p>Sixteen police officers, led by Captain J. E. Ptacek, and a band from the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, headed the parade. An array of our flags was followed by officers Holy, Niederle, and Horvat, of the Czechoslovak army, accompanied by Dr. Ludwig Fisher, and a large delegation of officials of the City of Chicago, most of whom were our fellow countrymen. The group following was decidedly one of the most beautiful of the entire parade: Slovaks, led by the picturesque "Ride of the Kings," adjudged to be the finest attraction the Moravian Slovaks can boast of. Large numbers of our Slovak brothers and sisters in their colorful costumes followed this cavalcade. Almost every district from the Hungarian part of Slovak lands was represented in this group. The entire Slovak part of the parade was <span class="page-break">\8</span>abundantly dotted with costumed children, self-consciously marching to the beat of the music. They attracted a great deal of attention.</p>
   <p>Others who followed were: The United Czech Singing Societies--Home Guards, led by Mr. Frank Pecival--students of the Red Cross Training School for nurses--Rubringer's Band--Sokol girls--Red Cross groups--eighteen standard-bearers--bugle and drum corps--members, male and female, of the Czech Sokol community in America--Slovak Sokols--a delegation of Hungarian-Ruthenians--various citizens' organizations--Czech butchers in the garb of their guild, with their own band--members of the C. S. P. S. (Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek-Czecho-Slav Aid Society)--members of the Association of Czech Ladies--Beseda Fric (a patriotic aid society)--representatives of the Slovak league--the Tatra Aid Society (Slovaks) headed by twenty-five banners--members of our Catholic societies--Prazaci (club of Czechs hailing from Prague, Bohemia)--Socialist associations--members of the International Bakers' and Candymakers' Union #13--and various other associations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>There were about one hundred large banners and service flags and twelve good bands. It may be said that the procession was splendid and held its own against any other parade that ever moved through Michigan Boulevard, no matter by whom arranged. The paraders paid their respects before the Blackstone hotel [where Professor Masaryk stops], then turned south through Eighth Street to the Exposition grounds.</p>
   <p>Three quarters of an hour elapsed before the procession passed through the gate and filed into the Exposition grounds, where large crowds had assembled. Our people clustered around the Statue of Liberty, where banner bearers and members of our singing societies were placed. The program proper then began.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Governor Oglesby welcomed the Czechoslovaks in the name of the State of Illinois, and read Governor Frank O. Lowden's message, greeting the Czechoslovaks in a most sympathetic manner. In it, the Czechoslovaks are called the best citizens of whom the State of Illinois could ever boast. They were congratulated on the successes which have crowned their efforts in <span class="page-break">\10</span>behalf of the cause of liberty so far won.</p>
   <p>Mr. Creel, head of the government's Committee on Public Information, spoke enthusiastically. He was followed by Mr. Karel (Charles) Pergler, who, as a worker in the foreign section of the movement, has performed services which Czechoslovak history will duly appreciate. Mr. Pergler spoke as our diplomat-representative. For lack of space, we have to delay reporting on all of these memorable addresses till our next issue.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Pergler's address, there followed an episode which filled the celebrants' eyes with tears. The singing societies sang our ever-beautiful anthem "Kde Domov Muj...." (Where my homeland is) while Messrs. Holy, Niederle, Fisher, and Horvat raised the Czechoslovak flag, after having kissed it. This simple song has become the anthem of our subjugated nation.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak flag was placed among those of the Allies, as a symbol of our freedom, and to demonstrate that we Czechoslovaks are breaking our tethers <span class="page-break">\11</span>after century-long sufferings....It was a most solemn moment which brought tears to our eyes and, at the same time, filled the heart with the sweetest delight.....</p>
   <p>The Slovak anthem "Flashes of Lightning over the Tatra [mountains]" then filled the air, sung by our Slovak brothers with fervor and indescribable enthusiasm. Perhaps never before has this Slovak hymn appeared to us as infinitely dear as on this occasion, when we felt that we are, for all future times, part of their nationality, and that their exultation is also our own joy.</p>
   <p>Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal read President Wilson's proclamation which, for us, possesses the same significance as the Declaration of Independence of 1776 has for America. The multitude listened in awed silence, and in rapt attention, to this proclamation which will, in times to come, be greeted with exuberant feelings by our countrymen in the old motherland, to whom it brings the long-sought freedom and liberation from oppression by the Hapsburgs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>President Wilson's message was received with frenzied applause. When it subsided, Professor Zmrhal addressed the meeting in his own words. He laid stress upon the accomplishments of our Czechoslovak army, to whose deeds the political recognition of our independence is to be ascribed in a very large measure. After his address, Professor Zmrhal presented a group of Ruthenians from Hungary, a nationality not so much heard of hitherto, but which is also groaning under the yoke of Austrian terrorism. These guests were warmly welcomed; the enthusiastic reception made an obvious impression upon them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ondrej (Andrew) Schustek, well-known and accredited worker for the Slovak national cause, took the floor in behalf of his fellow countrymen. His address was short, but heartfelt and inspiring, and was delivered in the mellow Slovak language, the tongue of a people who have suffered long, and for whom the rays of hope for a better future have finally begun to shine. Stormy applause rewarded the speaker who was then followed by Mr. Jan Straka, for the Czechs:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>"Czechoslovaks have been revolting against Austria and Hungary for the past four years. Great sacrifices were made by the people in the motherland and the Czechoslovaks in this country, before the just nationalistic demands were recognized.</p>
   <p>"Our people across the ocean have suffered intensely. They were persecuted, jailed, and even faced with the gallows. They clung firmly to their just national rights granted to them by divine and human judgment--they demanded independence for Czechoslovak lands.</p>
   <p>"We, in this land of the free, we American citizens, are conscious of our obligations toward our new homeland. Our slogan is always and everywhere 'America first!' As sons and daughters of Czech and Slovak mothers, we could not look disinterestedly upon the struggle in which the existence of our nation is at stake. We went to help our brothers across the ocean; we propagated and financed this movement for liberation. Our people, here and across the ocean, have declared war against Austria and Germany, our enemies <span class="page-break">\14</span>for many centuries.</p>
   <p>"This war demonstrates that our old national legend of the 'knights in the Blanik' [a mountain] is coming true. When distress was deepest, our Blanik knights left Austria to join the ranks of the Allies. These valiant Czech warriors are battling in Russia, and on the French and Italian fronts. They command the admiration of the whole world. To these Czechoslovak forces goes first credit for the recognition of our independence.</p>
   <p>"Our nation, the Czechoslovak army, and the Czechoslovak Council--the Czechoslovak government now--were recognized first by France, then by Italy, England, and, finally, by the Government of the United States.</p>
   <p>"No wonder we Czechoslovaks have come here in a festive parade, to this public place, where the government-sponsored War Exhibition is being held, to testify to our gratitude to the American nation which has, through President Wilson, given the Czechoslovaks a rank as an equal among free nations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\15</span>
   <p>"Today's parade on Michigan Avenue symbolizes, indeed, the triumphant induction of the Czechoslovaks into the ranks of the Allies, warring against Germany and Austria.</p>
   <p>"In this solemn moment we renew our pledge of loyalty to this country, and swear fealty to the Stars and Stripes. In deepest reverence, we thank our President for the recognition of the Czechoslovaks. In looking up to the Czechoslovak flag waving at the side of the Stars and Stripes--and fully conscious that our work of four years' duration has won the recognition for our nation--in this moment of mighty emotions, every Czech soul may justly intone the 'Te Deum,' and we may well add: Glory to thee, our motherland and home of the brave, glory to the Czechoslovak soldiers and their banners!</p>
   <p>"On the occasion of today's celebration let us promise to each other to hold out in serried ranks till final victory!</p>
   <p>"Let us support our Government in every one of its efforts, particularly by <span class="page-break">\16</span>buying Liberty bonds in the campaign which is to open soon. We are ready to give until it hurts, our goods and our blood, everything for Czechoslovak independence. After this celebration closes, let everybody hasten to take his place on deck of the ship! There is a task for everyone! Everyone should stand behind our leader, Masaryk. Everyone, on to the fight for the liberty of the Czechoslovak nation!"</p>
   <p>After Mr. Straka's address, the assembly sang "America," which closed the program of this beautiful and momentous celebration. All the participants left, convinced that they had given expression, in a befitting, dignified manner, of gratitude to the American people and its great president, Woodrow Wilson. They all felt fortified by their virtues, which won for them the distinction of being called "the most desirable citizens of the North American Republic."</p>
   <p>We cannot conclude the report on this festivity more aptly than by voicing the gratitude and the heartfelt greeting which is today on the lips of every <span class="page-break">\17</span>one of our people here and across the ocean:</p>
   <p>"Be praised, great American people, raised upon the pedestal as protector of oppressed nations because your sons have shed their blood. Greetings to the Star-Spangled Banner, symbol of everything that is good, sublime and noble! All hail to you, President Wilson, who, by fortitude of character have realized the dream of the greatest thinkers in the history of mankind--to see a world free and without slaves."</p>
