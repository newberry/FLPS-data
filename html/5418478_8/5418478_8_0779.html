   <p>The banquet held last night in honor of Count Frantisek Luetzow was the most significant of all the important and elaborate celebrations in the history of the Chicago Czechs. The banquet which was given in the Gold Room of the Congress Hotel, was an event such as we have never had before, and such as we will seldom enjoy in the future. It was a beautiful evening and several hundred leading Czechs of Chicago gathered in the Gold Room to honor the well-known guest of Czech-America, the famous scholar, and intrepid defender of the Czech people, Count Frantisek Luetzow.</p>
   <p>It was indeed a grand affair, the complete success of which was not only gratifying to the organizers who can be congratulated upon the result of their labors, but especially significant because of the interest manifested by prominent participants who were of other nationalities. Not only the foremost workers in our own national and political fields, were present but also many distinguished Americans who were actually astonished by the splendor <span class="page-break">2</span>of last night's affair. Even the speeches of the non-Bohemian guests had no little significance, because some of them were delivered by persons whose knowledge of Czech conditions and the Czech people of Chicago is of great importance to the future. In that respect we mention the speech of Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, Superintendent of Schools, who emphatically expressed herself in favor of teaching the Czech language in the high schools; the speech of Professor Miller of the University of Michigan; and the speech of President Harry Pratt Judson of the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The festivities were begun shortly after 8 P. M. when about four hundred Czechs and non-Czechs sat down to richly prepared tables, each of which was set in the splendor and luxuriousness for which the Congress Hotel is noted. Count Luetzow, his wife, and the other speakers, together with some members of the press bureau, were seated upon an elevation along one side of the hall.</p>
   <p>A special program followed the dinner, but time permitted the presentation of only three numbers.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The president of the Ceska-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), Mr. J. F. Stepina, introduced the toastmaster, Judge J. C. Karel of Milwaukee. Mr. Karel performed his task in a truly remarkable manner. His lengthy speech in English was full of patriotism. He spoke as an enthusiastic Czech-American who, dispite the fact that he was born in this country, has preserved a full measure of national consciousness. Judge Karel spoke of the great significance of Count Luetzow's lectures and demonstrated that Czech immigrants with their indomitable diligence and industry, with their honesty and their patriotism, have really become the most desirable immigrants. His speech was often interrupted by applause, but a veritable storm of applause ensued when Count Luetzow arose to address the gathering. He thanked the Czech people of Chicago in heartfelt and simple words for the honor shown him and proudly called attention to the American flag which Judge Karel with enthusiastic joy had pinned upon his breast. The Count said that he was more than pleased with the recognition accorded him and assured the gathering that he would continue to work for a better understanding of the history and of the Czech people by the English speaking public.</p>

   <p>After the conclusion of Count Luetzow's speech, Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan stepped forward to present the Count with a certificate of honorary membership in the Cesky Umelecky Klub (Bohemian Arts Club) of Chicago. Then President Harry Pratt Judson was introduced. He mentioned that yesterday afternoon the University of Chicago was honored by the distinguished guest, Count Luetzow, who had done such an excellent job of acquainting the audience with the glorious history of the Czech people. He also said that, with the exception of the time several years ago when he visited Prague, he never saw so many distinguished Czechs gathered together as there were on this occasion. President Judson spoke at length about immigrants and the significance of so desirable an immigrant element as the Czechs.</p>
   <p>The next speaker introduced to the gathering was Mrs. Ella Flagg Young. Her speech was given the closest attention. Mrs. Young said that she became acquainted with Czech children twenty-five years ago in the Throop and <span class="page-break">5</span>Longfellow schools, and from that time on she has had the opportunity to follow the mental and physical ability of Czech youth. She declared emphatically that the Czech language should be a subject of study in the high schools. If you want these children to become good American citizens, provide them with an opportunity to learn their mother tongue and to become acquainted with the history of their parents' native land. Have them instructed in the history and literature of the old homeland, and in that way you will also make good and great Americans of them.</p>
   <p>The excellent speech of Mrs. Young was often interrupted by storms of applause, and when she concluded, Mr. Mangasarian came forward and spoke with enthusiasm about the history of the Czech people and their valiant struggle for spiritual freedom. The next speaker introduced was Prof. Herbert A. Miller, who described the fervor with which he is studying the Czech language and Czech history and ardently recommended the introduction of the Czech language as a course of study in the public schools. He said that it would prove to be advantageous to introduce the study of the Czech language, not only in the <span class="page-break">6</span>high schools, but in all grades of the elementary schools in neighborhoods where the Czech population predominates. He also expressed the hope that the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) will not cease in its efforts until the Czech language becomes a course of study at least in the high schools.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Mr. Enrique S. Vraz, whose speech in the Czech language was indeed the high point of the evening. He spoke with profound feeling about the work of Count Luetzow, thanking him and his wife for their visit to America and assuring them that all Czech-America fully appreciates the importance of this mission in the interest of the Czech cause. Mr. Vraz greeted them and bade them farewell, but he expressed the firm hope that the Count was not leaving Chicago forever.</p>
   <p>Count Luetzow was moved by the fervent words of Mr. Vraz and with apparent emotion thanked him for his ardent manifestation of recognition and sincere friendship. It was 12:30 when the last speaker concluded, and the toastmaster, Judge Karel, brought the banquet to an end by wishing the guests good night.</p>
