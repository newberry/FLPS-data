   <p>P.1--The immigration authorities in Washington have handed down a decision in which Alois Zdarsy and Marie Sudova are ordered to be deported. They will be sent to New York and turned over to the company that had shipped them to this country. They had lived at 1629 S. Throop St. in common household, without being married and this violated the immigration law.</p>
   <p>Zdarsky was arrested Jan. 29 on behalf of attorney W. Truce, representing his client Fr. Brazda 1615 Blue Island Ave., who had been mulcted out of $600 by Zdarsy. Brazda was the "good fellow" who had financed the "Artists' Cabaret," which, as is known, met with an inglorious finish immediately after the first performance. The whole enterprise had been calculated on a fraudulent basis by Zdarsky, who had received $600 from Brazda to bring to the United States six good performers from Prague. Upon his arrival he had with him, besides his own distinguished personage only Marie Suda, who had been his illegal mate in the old country already, and an obscure pianist. He not only did not endeavor to pay back the rest of the money, <span class="page-break">\2</span>but had only sneers for Brazda, when an accounting was demanded. The latter in the course of an investigation by his attorney, found that Zdarsky and Marie Suda both had abandoned their lawful mates in the old country. Mr. Schubert, immigration officer, states that deportation for the couple is inevitable. The two delinquents are being held in the county jail, from where they will be taken to New York next week. Zdarsky seems to be taking his predicament with equanimity; the woman however is in a state of collapse and professes not to be able to survive her shame. Zdarsky had made no friends during his abode in America, as he had continually tried to fatten upon the honest earnings of his good-hearted acquaintances, and after having taken advantage of them turned his back on them with derision. This is the reason, why no one of his fellow countrymen made any attempt to save him. This would have been futile, however, as there is no recourse from the final decision of the immigration bureau in Washington.</p>
