   <p>Mr. Frank E. Kendricks, Jr., private secretary of the minister to the Balkan States, Mr. Charles J. Vopicka, resident in Bucharest rode through Berlin today on his way to Bremen, and from there he will sail for New York, on the steamship Grosser Kurfuerst.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kendricks says that he has resigned from his office, but refuses to make further comment.</p>
   <p>It is said that it was Kendricks who circulated those untruthful, absurd, compromising reports about Minister Vopicka to the whole world.</p>
   <p>With the deletion of Mr. Kendricks, Minister Vopicka received the satisfaction due him. It is a certainty that all this calumny heaped upon Minister Vopicka was the outcome of national intolerance and jealousy because a Bohemian was so honored.</p>
