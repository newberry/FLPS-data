   <p>This is a sad coincidence. Just fifty-nine years ago today the Bohemian nation in the old country suffered a loss that is still being felt. It was the death of a man whom the whole nation revered. He died in his prime, and at a time when his insight, his energy, and his sterling character were most badly needed. On the twenty-ninth day of July, 1856, in Prague, the noble spirit of Karel Havlicek Borovsky was released. An immense sorrow and sadness enveloped the whole country.</p>
   <p>The anniversary of this day of grief finds our Bohemian colony again in deep mourning and pain. Hundreds of families of our countrymen, our close friends, have lost members who had been their hope for the future, whom they loved, who were their supporters and providers. In other cases, <span class="page-break">2</span>the whole family became extinct, perished without leaving even one single member with us. A black blanket of intense grief covers our colony on the treacherous Lake Michigan, and thus we fell closer to the spirit of the sad anniversary in the old country. But no matter how intense our sorrow over the loss of so many dear ones, who, almost under our very hands, disappeared, we may be able to assuage our pain by meditating about the suffering in which we find our country at the time of the anniversary of Havlicek's death. [Translator's note: Havlicek was the first important publicist, journalist, and political leader of the re-awakened Bohemian nation.]</p>
   <p>Such news about the losses of young lives and destroyed hopes as have shattered our souls these days, is reaching our families in the old country daily, and in incomparably greater numbers. Over there, hardly an hour passes that a mother does not mourn the death of a son, a wife shed tears over the loss of a husband, children realize the passing of a father, and sister weep over the passing of a brother.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Here our friends were going on an excursion, in high spirits and looking forward to a pleasant day of rest and recreation. Many of them died, but those who did not perish, survived in good health, with the possible exception of those who suffered bruises and minor accidents that do not mean more than a summer shower.</p>
   <p>But over in the old country the picture is quite different. The thousands of young men who bid good-by to their mothers, wives, sisters, and children, embrace them as would those who have their homes against their own will, against their own conviction, knowing that they may never return, and that if they do they may come back to their native hearths maimed for life, pitiful ruins and remnants of young men once healthy, husky, and strong.</p>
   <p>May the realization of the incomparably greater suffering which, for over a year now, has been the daily lot of our countrymen abroad--a suffering without hope for an early end--alleviate the sorrow of our friends here.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>However, the anniversary of Havlicek's death reminds us today again of our duties to the old country, duties which we cannot neglect even in a time of our own general mourning. It is remarkable indeed that the six decades dividing us from the decease of our unforgettable Havlicek have not been able to change anything of the validity and aptness of his ideas and views concerning the future of the Bohemian nation, have not been able to weaken anything he had written. This fact may perhaps be taken as an indication that our nation has not yet, politically and economically, gotten over the stage of re-awakening, or perhaps,--and that is more likely--it is an indication that the foundation of the life of any nation must remain firm and permanent if it is to expect a strong, healthy future. If this is the case, Havlicek's merit, not only as a political prophet but also as a most honest teacher, (persists to this day) because there has been nobody after him who has penetrated closer to the Bohemian soul, has known better its most secret places, understood better how to communicate with it openly and honestly. Havlicek understood also the significance of our history and its inevitable consequences for the present and the future of our <span class="page-break">5</span>whole nation. In the times through which we are now living it is most appropriate that we should repeatedly call to our minds his views, his ideal of an independent Bohemian state as the home of a brave and enlightened Bohemian nation which has preserved the character of its Slavic spirit and Slavic tongue. It was because of his subscribing to this ideal that he used stoutly to maintain that "political liberty without national liberty is without any value whatever. A nation in whose administrative offices, schools, and public affairs a foreign language is used, has no true liberty, no true democracy. It is ruled by an aristocracy, of the worst kind--the aristocracy of language.</p>
   <p>Considering the present state of affairs in the old country we cannot but see the truth of these words: The history of the whole world proves that governments and rulers respect the rights of nations more because of fear than because of love. But a nation only inspires fear when it is mature in its political convictions. It is therefore our foremost duty to bring all classes of our nation to such political maturity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Does not this same consideration point out clearly the direction which our efforts should take in this country? Is it not our duty to proceed in accordance with this principle if we want to secure a place of importance and influence in the public affairs of this country? It is remarkable how very much "real American" there was in that Havlicek whose monument, after such a long period of years, came to be erected on American can soil.</p>
   <p>Havlicek's Slavic feeling was practical, devoid--particularly in his later years--of any romanticism. This he expressed concisely when he said: "While it is our desire to remain Slavs, we do not wish to become Russians;  but we certainly should prefer being Russians to being forced to become Germans. His practical political ideal was to unify all western and southern Slavic nations, and by this unification assure each of them liberty and national progress.</p>
   <p>"This far, we have been attracted to each other more by instinct, by the <span class="page-break">7</span>feeling of a common danger, by common inclinations, than by anything else. But now it has become necessary to work together like well-organized political sections of one whole. The tie of mutual support and protection between the Poles, the Bohemians and Slovaks, the Yugoslavs, and the Ruthenians is the only solid foundation of liberty for the smaller Central European nations. A firm, but elastic union must be formed for the protection of our rights against powerful enemies and aggressors.</p>
   <p>"The complete emancipation from Germany in every respect must be our eternal and ever-present slogan. Therefore the study of Romance literature and languages should be the principal endeavor of our more able, more talented youth."</p>
   <p>These principles of his, and many others, have remained in full force until today. They are valid for us also in this country, although they would have to undergo minor changes in their practical application.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>His honest love of practical democracy, his yearning for truth, his clean record in political, literary, and sociological controversies, his intrepidity and courage accompanied by tactful ways of defending what has been found to be good and true, may be the foundation of Bohemian culture, prestige, and power also in Bohemian America, not only now, but also in the time when this great nation will have grown out of this period of astonishing moral and economic changes and will start to live a calmer life of real and worthy cultural work of its very own, and will base its existence upon foundations which will be quite different from the mere materialism that now prevails.</p>
   <p>This time may be far distant, but it will come. And then Havlicek, projected by the Bohemian man into the field of the present American struggle, will shine again like a clear, fine, Bohemian garnet, proud to proclaim his Bohemian origin.</p>
