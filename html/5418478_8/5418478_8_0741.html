   <p>The number of Americans visiting Bohemia is growing steadily. Of course, visits of highly educated Americans such as scientists, writers, research men, and prominent businessmen are most welcome of all, because such men, upon returning to their own country, talk about their travel experiences with their friends and in this way make Bohemia and Bohemians better known, thus helping the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) achieve its principal aim.</p>
   <p>A direct result of the activities of this bureau was the visit of Mr. Allen D. Severance in Prague. Mr. Severance is a professor of history at the Western Reserve University of Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
