   <p>P.7--Jaroslav Kocian, famous violin virtuoso, Kubelik's closest rival, will again undertake an artistic tour of America. The Bohemian band-leader and virtuoso, Bohumir Kryl, offered him a contract for fifty concerts, which Kocian has signed. These concerts will be given in November and December 1910, and January 1911, in the most important cities from New York, to San Francisco, California.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen, among whom Kocian has won many friends, by his cheerful, cordial character, will read this report with pleasure. Kocian will surely gain great success before the American public and further insure his artistic triumph.</p>
