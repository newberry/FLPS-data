   <p>Mr. Vaclav J. Klofac was given an enthusiastic welcome at the depot of the Michigan Central Railroad. Several friends and admirers went to Michigan City, where they boarded the train and brought him to Chicago. The group welcoming Mr. Klofac consisted of members of his [National-Socialist] party organized in the Narodne Socialni Vzdelavaci Beseda J. V. Fric (J. V. Fric National-Socialist Educational Circle), the president of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), Mr. E. St. Vraz, Alderman Felix Janovsky, numerous representatives of the Sokols (gymnastic Union), representatives of the newspapers Denni Hlasatel, Svornost, and Slavie (the latter represented by Dr. J. S. Vojan), and many more prominent Chicago Bohemians. The party went to the Pilsen Auditorium where refreshments were served and formal speeches of welcome and thanks were exchanged.</p>
   <p>Mr. Klofac urged the audience to recommend to their friends that they send their children to Bohemia for one or two years. He himself expects to send his children to the United States for a similar period, and so will many other parents in Bohemia. In this way the contacts between the old and the new country will be strengthened. A large amount of time was devoted to the discussion of political conditions in Austria and Bohemia.</p>
