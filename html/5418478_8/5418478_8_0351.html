   <p>Every Czech and Slovak rejoiced over the decision of President Wilson, by which the Czechoslovak nation is declared free, and on a par with the other Allied nations. Each one, regardless of how much he helped the cause, is overjoyed, and considers every act of our President a wise measure designed to bring about a victorious ending of the war.</p>
   <p>We should not find fault with his executive orders--not even with his latest, although it sounds the knell for our beloved beverage, beer.</p>
   <p>Considering the quality, however, in which beer is dispensed at present, it will not be missed very much.</p>
