   <p>Josef Prasek, 11, son of Mr. Vojtech Prasek of Chicago, on his way from Bohemia to his father's home here was detained on Ellis Island for an entire week. He was released after Reverend Vanek, Chicago, appealed to the director of the Czech immigrant home, Mr. Koukol, who then took care of the boy. About 2,000 persons are now detained on Ellis Island, some for several days, before they are turned over to their relatives or friends.</p>
