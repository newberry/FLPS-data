   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Americka Obchodni Vyprava (Czechoslovak-American Commercial Expedition), for which extensive preparations have been made since December 1921, has become a reality. The expedition will leave today and tomorrow. The vanguard will leave the "garden city" today and will consist of those men who, although they will occupy cabins of the second class, are aliens not having taken out their second citizenship papers. These will have to leave a day earlier because they will have to adjust matters which have bearing upon their status, in New York City.... They will be accompanied by Messrs. Frank J. Skala and Josef Dusek who will look after their safety and comfort. [Here follow the names of these members of the expedition. The list is one-sixth of a column long.]</p>
   <p>Some of the regular members of the expedition left earlier because they wished to spend a few days in New York and other eastern cities. But the <span class="page-break">\2</span>bulk of the expedition will leave tomorrow at 10 A. M. from Dearborn Station.... Their leaders will be Messrs. John K. Valha [president of the expedition], V. L. Rezabek, Reverend Vaclav Vanek, Messrs. Josef Dusek and Karel Vesely. Those who will leave tomorrow have had their baggage sent ahead.... The expedition will pick up some of its eastern members en route. One stop will be made in Buffalo, New York, to give the members a chance to see Niagara Falls.... After their return to Buffalo, they will have a joint supper and board a train of the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad, arriving in New York City early Saturday morning. They will rest before embarkation. After a joint breakfast they will leave for the dock and embark on the ship "George Washington"....As far as we know the ship will weigh anchor shortly after noon on Saturday...</p>
   <p>.. All that remains, therefore, is to bid adieu to all members of the expedition.... We are doing this in the name of the publishers of the Denni Hlasatel, its editorial staff, etc., and extend our best wishes to Messrs. John Valha, Frank J. Skala, V. L. Rezabek, Frank Maly, and to the publishers <span class="page-break">\3</span>of our local newspapers....We hope that their sojourn in Czechoslovakia may bring them many happy experiences, and that they may return in good health. The trip they have projected ought not only to contribute to their physical well-being, but also to enrich them through new experiences which should bring profit both to Czechoslovakia and to America. Let no one forget that this is the first venture of its kind, and that it devolves upon them, therefore, to interpret our best wishes to our brothers in the old homeland, conveying to them our assurances that the Czechoslovaks in the old homeland, conveying to them our assurances that the Czechoslovaks of America will always be ready to work for them whenever and wherever it is necessary.</p>
   <p>Bon voyage and au revoir!</p>
