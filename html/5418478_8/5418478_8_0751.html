   <p>We were greatly pleased yesterday. Mr. Brittain, the American Consul in Prague, has honored us with a visit. He came with Mr. Frank G. Hajicek.....</p>
   <p>This afternoon he will be a guest in the new building of the Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club) on Douglas Boulevard, and no doubt a comprehensive program of other entertainment is being prepared for him by our prominent citizens.</p>
