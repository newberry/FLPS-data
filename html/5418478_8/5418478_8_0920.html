   <p>In the name of the entire community of readers of our newspapers, we published an article yesterday morning welcoming the return of United States minister K. J. Vopicka to his home town, Chicago. Today, we are conveying sincere greetings from the minister, not only to the readers of our newspapers, but to the entire Czech-American community, which has demonstrated so much interest in him. He is at home now. Those who were present at the Union depot, can form a conception of how great are the numbers of his friends when they saw the thousands who began to wave and shout greetings when his familiar features appeared in a window of the train.</p>
   <p>We did not ask for an immediate interview, in consideration of the many who sought to get near their fellow-countryman. Later, however, we were granted the privilege of an hour of his precious time. In order to have <span class="page-break">2</span>a full knowledge of the happenings during the time of Mr. Vopicka's arrival, we gained information from Dr. L. E. Jelinek, one of our well-known dentists, member of the "Ceska Beseda" (Czech circle), and one of the managers of the manifestation, which gave such ample proof of the esteem in which Mr. Vopicka is held, and the attachment which his fellow countrymen have for him. Doctor Jelinek said that the program prepared will have to undergo some changes on account of the fatigue of the members of the arrangements committee. Among those first to welcome the minister were: Reverend R. Kohlbeck, J. R. Psenka, and Alderman John Toman who saw to it that sufficient traffic policemen were available to maintain order.</p>
   <p>After five o'clock, the representative of this paper was given the time promised for the desired interview. Mr. Vopicka's first utterance was an openhearted assurance that he was very glad indeed to be home after an absence of so long a time. He spoke of his activities as a United States minister, and of the concomitant duties which rendered his position anything <span class="page-break">3</span>but a sinecure. He spoke of the satisfaction that comes from duty fulfilled, declaring that when called upon to defend human rights no one should hesitate to sacrifice even his life.</p>
   <p>"You cannot fathom my emotions when in contact with soldiers. I have spoken to thousands and found that most of the wounded in the hospitals wanted to know first when they could be returned to the front. Those examples of a splendid sense of duty should be emulated by every real American in these critical times. No one can doubt what everyone ought to do when needed. If my stay abroad has borne no other fruit than that my experiences gained there which enable me to distribute information with admonition, then I am certain I have done some good for America, not only for the future, but for the present also. It is necessary in the interest of her people that America possess the same undaunted spirit as those soldiers suffering from wounds in the hospitals. I earnestly desire that the Americans should <span class="page-break">4</span>acquaint themselves with some European nations, particularly those from the Balkan peninsula, who stand out with some admirable characteristics. All of these, the big ones and the small ones, need one thing only: to be known by America, and be understood."</p>
   <p>After this introductory talk, Mr. Vopicka related how he met with soldiers of various walks of life, among them a former member of the Bohemian National theatre named Hajek. The greatest number of prisoners and wounded he encountered on his travel was through Serbia. The Serbian and the Austrian governments had urged him to become the chairman of an international commission for the investigation of prison camps, and for the amelioration of conditions therein. He yielded to these demands only after an emphatic recommendation from Washington. It was in this additional capacity in the commission that he found thousands of Czech soldiers in prison camps, and extended every possible help to them.</p>

   <p>After his turbulent travel to Norway (mentioned in Denni Hlasatel of March 28), and his final landing in the United States, he was received in personal audience by President Wilson, who evidenced an intense interest in the observations made on his experiences, and declared to have followed with great attention the cablegrams and various reports sent from the United States ministers in European realms of activity.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vopicka intends to enjoy his first vacation soon after a period of strenuous work, the intensity and magnitude of which may be grasped when considering that he had lately conducted agenda for America, Germany, Austria, England, Russia, Serbia, Italy and ex-officio, Rumania.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vopicka finally gave us an explanation regarding news designed to disparage his qualifications, ridicule his person, and to shed an unfavorable light upon the manner in which he conducted official business. They all can be traced to a man of slanderous inclinations, a discharged employee <span class="page-break">6</span>of the United States foreign service. It is preposterous, Mr. Vopicka said, alluding to them, to imagine him bragging about wearing shirts at twelve dollars a piece. One of the rulers, with whom he came into contact during his service abroad, heard of this ludicrods assertion through the Reuter News agency, and caused a denial to be published, in which he declared Mr. Vopicka to be a diplomat whose conduct has gained for him the highest esteem and favor of the court. Another nonsense printed, dealt with Carmen Sylva (non de plume of the old Queen of Roumania). Mr. Vopicka was regarded as her friend. The Queen dedicated several poems to him, and received him in audience fourteen days before her death, and the last person to be so honored. There is also an anecdote current to the effect that he had told Queen Ileana "he would phone her when he would have the time to do so." Another story of a similar category tells of his having insulted the Emperor of Austria. Would he then have been asked by the Austrian government to head the international commission for the betterment of prison camps? He is certain to have won and held <span class="page-break">7</span>the respect and the good will of all the potentates with whom he came in contact, which fact manifested itself in various acts of friendly politeness towards him.</p>
   <p>These statements finished the interview, which Mr. Vopicka closed with a promise to give several lectures about subjects, not infringing upon matters purely diplomatic, but to give us an idea about what War really means.</p>
