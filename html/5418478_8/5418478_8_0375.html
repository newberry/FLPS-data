   <p>Another contingent of Czechs of America left Chicago, July 20, to join the Czechoslovakian Army overseas. On that occasion, the volunteers, gathered at the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, were addressed by several speakers, among whom Vojtech (Adalbert) Linhart, Chicago Czech, attracted special attention. He had volunteered for the Canadian Army, and was wounded in action, losing his left leg. His words made a deep impression. We think it appropriate to print his address in full.</p>
   <p>"To my highly esteemed friends, and to my dear comrades! I have returned from over there. You are on your way. I am not going to tell you what a soldier should look like, or what his duty is when he is about to fight for the liberty of his country. By coming here and enlisting in the Czechoslovakian Army, our <span class="page-break">2</span>revolutionary army, which today is fighting throughout the world, you have shown that you do not have to be awakened or agitated.</p>
   <p>"I stand here before you a one-legged soldier--I left my left leg on the battlefield. They gave me an artificial leg, which is not easy to walk on. I am, nevertheless, a thousand times happier than any man of my age who shirks his duty, and walks the American soil on both feet.</p>
   <p>"Believe me, the time is coming when the people of our nation will be classified according to what they have done for their country. The question today, of joining the ranks or standing aside, a coward, is merely one of personal honor. Those who refuse to come to us, are going to feel the consequences of their shirking. We are in a revolution, and every young and healthy Czech, should and must fight the tyrant. He who says that he is not concerned, that he can see no advantage for himself in suffering, is not only a bad Czech or Slovak--he is a reprehensible person; he is an egoist and a scoundrel of the first order.</p>

   <p>"When the Czech National Theater in Prague was being built, a peasant came along, and began to look at it with a smile of great gratification. When he was asked why he was gazing so intently, he answered joyfully: 'Why, this is my own brick.!' Dear comrades! We are building the temple of our national liberty. Is there anyone among us who does not want to be one of those individual bricks?</p>
   <p>"Our temple must, however, be built of stronger material than clay. Our republic must be made of rock. We Czech and Slovak soldiers, in whatever uniform we may be, must not lose sight of this. You dear boys especially, who are on your way to France to increase the numbers of our glorious Czechoslovakian Army, should always behave in a manner appropriate to valiant soldiers.</p>
   <p>"Our Czechoslovakian detachment in the Canadian Army, to which I still belong, has accomplished all that it possibly could, even though there were only a handful of us. It propagandized effectively for our cause, made a good showing <span class="page-break">4</span>before the enemy. I am informed that at present our detachment numbers two dead, and fifteen wounded. According to the latest reports, our boys in the Canadian Army have joined the Czechoslovakian Army. I hope you will meet them there.</p>
   <p>"There were moments, particularly last fall, when some of us began to sink in body and in spirit under the burden of heavy duty and bitter fighting. We always remembered, however, that we were Czechs and Slovaks who were fighting that our country might live in freedom. Enthusiasm and love [of our country] stood us in good stead at such moments, and we did our duty without grumbling.</p>
   <p>"You will, no doubt, also experience such moods. This is only natural, and will occur especially during the first days of contact with the enemy. When gloom begins to descend upon you, remember why you are there. Do not leave your position, obey your leader, and first of all, maintain an iron discipline. Always remember that you are not forsaken, that your comrades are behind and with you. Never allow yourself to become discouraged. Always be real, <span class="page-break">5</span>undaunted Taborites [soldiers of the Hussite armies].</p>
   <p>"We who are returning, disabled, are going to see to it that you who follow us, will always be foremost in our consideration, and first to be remembered. I speak to you sincerely, as to my comrades. I have no reason to conceal from you the fact that everybody is afraid to die. One [person] is more afraid, the other less. During the first days, before one gets accustomed to that dog's life, the instinct of self-preservation will gain considerable hold upon you. We Czech soldiers should, however, remember one thing--that we are revolutionists. We are soldiers of our oppressed Czech nation. We have heavier duties than any other soldier. We are out to win liberty for our nation--not to preserve liberty!</p>
   <p>"I am firmly convinced, and I trust unwaveringly, that the army of which we have become members, will not disappoint our nation, and that when this army has finally cleared its way to the former motherland, it will be welcomed gloriously, <span class="page-break">6</span>royally. Do not be afraid to die for your homeland, for your nation! When one is on the battlefield, one hardly has time for such thoughts. If a man is doomed to fall in battle, he will fall, without anybody's noticing it--cigarette in mouth, a smile on his lips--that is how he will die for his nation, for his ideals.</p>
   <p>"Those of you who will be wounded, lightly or seriously, will be carried away--to a place where medical science is working veritable miracles. You will return to us, happy in the knowledge of duty performed, no matter how much you may have had to endure. Keep one assurance in mind--that you will not have to depend on charity.</p>
   <p>"We won't be commanders, true enough, but we shall represent the will of a nation that will be respected and esteemed by all. Particularly in our Czech country, the soldiers in the national army will be the core of moral strength, all of us, who have enlisted of our own free will and conviction. We do not intend to abuse our power. We shall, however, have grown [to be] better and <span class="page-break">7</span>more honest men. This will be the result of privation endured and danger braved. We shall thus lead our nation to liberty, freedom, and brotherhood!</p>
   <p>"I sincerely hope that you may have a happy voyage, that you may be successful in combat, and that you may have a victorious return to the motherland, the future Republic of Czechoslovakia."</p>
   <p>We wish to thank all the generous individuals who contributed to the hospitality extended to our volunteers at the farewell party given for them last Saturday. [A list is given of the hosts and hostesses.] All the food was eaten at the supper, and nothing was left except some little sausages. The "Vcelky" (Little Bees), "Czech California" branch, were among the hostesses. Not only did these ladies do a lion's share of the work, but they also collected $85.83 for tobacco. It was a beautiful affair, the memory of which will linger for a long time.</p>
