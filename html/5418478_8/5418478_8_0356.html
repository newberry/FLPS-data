   <p>John R. Palandech Views United States Recognition as Factor for Victory.</p>
   <p>Foreign language editors of Chicago are unanimous in their belief that recognition by the United States of the Czecho-Slovaks as an independent nation means the certain overthrow of the foes of the Allies in Russia and the ultimate establishment of a Russian government that will be a strong factor in the defeat of the Central Powers.</p>
   <p>"It is one of the greatest things that have happened since the United States entered the war," declared John R. Palandech, editor of the Balkan World.</p>
   
   <p>"It means not only that the Czecho-Slovaks of Europe will continue the struggle with greater courage and energy, but also that we Czecho-Slovaks of the United States will rise unanimously in an effort to get every one of our people into the war against Prussianism at the soonist possible moment."</p>
   <p>Mr. Palandech is a candidate for the Republican nomination for the office of county commissioner.</p>
   <p>V. A. Geringer, editor of Svornost, a Bohemian daily, was also enthusiastic over the situation.</p>
   <p>Peters S. Lambros, director of the Chicago Association of Foreign Language Newspapers, endorsed the expressions of Mr. Palandech and Mr. Geringer.</p>
