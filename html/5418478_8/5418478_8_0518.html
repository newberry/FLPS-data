   <p>The fact that the schools are filled to overflowing with Bohemian children is the very best refutation of the insult which the Austrian Ambassador, Dr. Dumba, inflicted on the Bohemian workingmen by saying that they are uneducated. As a charateristic of the prevailing conditions we wish to mention that we are not only the first ones, but so far the only ones who have uncompromisingly taken the part of our workingmen against the accusations of Austrian Ambassador Dumba, who has said that the Bohemian element is uneducated. This, of course, does not mean that we are alone in protesting against these insults and against the attempt to damage Bohemian families, a circumstance which will be clearly explained to Dr. Dumba in the very near future.</p>
