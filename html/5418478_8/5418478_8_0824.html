   <p>The office of Hlasatel was honored yesterday by the visit of Miss Alice G. Masaryk, the daughter of professor T. G. Masaryk, who is known to all of us. Miss Masaryk recently began a one year course of study at the University of Chicago. We were pleased to recognize in Miss Masaryk a lady possessed of a general education and pleasing appearance. Miss Masaryk has a thorough command of English, and she should be able to master her studies with ease. She was escorted by Mr. Emil Bachman.</p>
