   <p>A certain farmer in Michigan, whose name we shall publish in this paper eventually, makes a remarkable proposal. A national tax should be levied, he says, which would amount to one dollar per house for house owners, and per one hundred acres for farmers. [Editor's note: This Bohemian "national" tax is intended to supplement or replace voluntary donations to national activities such as was relief.]</p>
   <p>As a starter he send five dollars for his four hundred acres. Will there be any followers? Will there be anybody to give this proposal serious consideration?</p>
