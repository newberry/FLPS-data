   <p>Dr. J.E.S. Vojan, a journalist, is a cultural worker who has few equals in Bohemian America. Although an attorney graduated at the Prague University, he devotes much of his time to music.</p>
   <p>His columns, which appear in various publications, have many enthusiastic and interested readers. Doctor Vojan's style has a tone of conciliation and even tolerance that in the time of Pastor, and even Bittner, would have been pilloried as a weakness or as timidity before the antagonist.</p>
   <p>Vojan's Bohemian-American letters are very valuable. In 1908 he compiled a large New York Guide, containing valuable information and illustrations.</p>

   <p>Born in 1872, in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Doctor Vojan is still in the best creative period and we expect more valuable work from him in the future.</p>
   <p>When he was director of the Bohemian-American Press Office, he had several timely and valuable ideas. For example, his million-cent collection for the benefit of schools in his mother land; the suggestion to take a census of Bohemians, giving their original language and descendance; and many other valuable undertakings.</p>
   <p>He came to America in 1904 and two years later engaged in journalism. He worked for several New York publishers, spending about ten years at this work. Since 1914, he has been in charge of the advertising department of the Triners Bitter Wine Company, in Chicago. He writes also columns for American publications.</p>
