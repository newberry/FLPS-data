   <p>Lately, unfavorable reports have been coming from Czechoslovakia to America which naturally arouse the interest of the Czechoslovaks who live in the United States. First, they are interested because Czechoslovaks never disavow their origin (at least not the first generation), and secondly, because they themselves are very much a part of the Czechoslovak Republic which they helped to build. Therefore, they read the present columns of newspaper report from Czechoslovakia sorrowfully.</p>
   <p>At the beginning when the first unfavorable reports came, local Czechoslovaks were hoping that conditions in Czechoslovakia would improve and become more stable in a short time, because [social and political] ferment of this sort does require a certain amount of time to subside. Therefore, our people here waited patiently. But inasmuch as conditions were not improving--on the contrary, they were getting were and worse--patience here began to be exhausted. Conditions became so bad that today people read these reports from Czechoslovakia either anxiously or reluctantly.</p>
   <p>We are not a bit surprised. We ourselves are very anxious when the mail from Czechoslovakia is delivered to us. Whenever we begin to read the newspapers from Czechoslovakia, and especially those published in Prague, we tremble with fear, expecting more unfavorable news. This anxiety, this fear is aroused in us because of sincere and honest Czechoslovakian sentiment which cannot be smothered by the great distance and the ocean separating us from our native land. It is understandable. On the other hand, we are not a bit surprised when we hear that a Czechoslovak is reading these reports reluctantly. Even this we consider natural.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak people of America accomplished miracles during the struggle for our old homeland's independence. And all this was done with a love and enthusiasm for the cause. By accomplishing these deeds, they did not sacrifice themselves; they only did what was their duty. But most of these deeds were effected by people of small means--by our poor people. While the richest and most well-to-do class of Czechoslovak-Americans either slept or pretended to be asleep, the ordinary, poor working people drudged almost to exhaustion in order to contribute toward such a cause as the liberation of our old homeland. We ourselves know not only of one case, but of many cases where our common people contributed all their savings for the benefit of this really beautiful and consecrated cause, savings that meant a fortune to them. These people would have given much more, but could not because there was nothing left. But, nevertheless, they drudged and contributed again in order to help wherever assistance, according to their convictions, was needed. Many a time they contributed their last penny when they were convinced that it would help.</p>
   <p>Such a Czechoslovakian workingman of America had to work like a slave for every penny he contributed. Working conditions in America are not as easy as they used to be in the old homeland. It is true, of course, that in the old homeland wages were never too high, but the workingman, under the prevailing conditions, did not have to work so hard; or at least he did not have to work as hard as he does in America. Here, indeed, there is a chance to earn money--a great deal of money--but quite often a man has to work like a mule, because in America nobody gives you something for nothing. No wonder, then, that this Czechoslovakian man of America, and especially the hardworking man, in reading these reports from Czechoslovakia, suddenly realized that by performing his duties toward Czechoslovakia he also gained certain rights.</p>
   <p>In consequence of these rights, he asks himself: "If I have to work here like a mule all my life, why are those who are just beginning to live as a free nation not willing to work, at least reasonably hard? Knowing that only honest hard work will preserve their hard-earned freedom, why are they not willing to work in order to keep alive their Republic which surely must be dear and sacred to them? Why do not our brothers and sisters beyond the ocean prove somehow that they themselves are deeply and really interested in seeing that the life of their Republic is put on a sound and healthy basis so that none of us have to be afraid of her future?"</p>
   <p>And in disgust, the Czechoslovak-American will say "phooey" in the knowledge that probably the people of the old homeland will forever depend upon outside help, especially upon help from Czechoslovak-America; and that our brothers across the ocean figure that it would be foolish to work when all that is necessary is to call upon Czechoslovak-America, and the Czechoslovaks of America will outdo each other in sending the required assistance.</p>
   <p>That such is the situation is evidenced by a report which was published by newspapers of the entire world. This report comes from Prague, Czechoslovakia, and states that the present official cabinet of the Czechoslovak Republic decided to send in its resignation because the Social Democratic party, with the aid of Germans, induced the parliament to appropriate the sum of two billion Czechoslovakian Kronen to be used as relief for the unemployed. This shows that today the people of Czechoslovakia do not feel like working. Everybody over there would like to live comfortably upon the government, which itself is out of funds. Shall the government steal? If the-people of Czechoslovakia were really honest and sincere Czechoslovakian people, having at least a bit of love for their homeland in their hearts, they would be ashamed to eat out their own country. They would look for work until they found it, and then they would work steadily in order to help themselves and by it also help the Republic. The Republic could then stand upon her own feet in a very short time. But today, everybody in our old homeland is trying to get a government job, whether he is qualified or not, especially if he is an adherent of the governing party, Everybody would like to play the lord, leaving the work--the real work--to a comparatively small number of real Czechoslovaks. Those among the rest who do not hold any government jobs do not care to work and are receiving government relief for the unemployed from the impoverished Republic. And these people are not ashamed to take relief--not even when they know that the Republic is in bad financial distress. Apparently they think that somebody will help them out again, and that Czechoslovak-America is good enough to provide more aid and further support.</p>
   <p>Czechoslovak-America, however, would do well if it did not even move a finger in behalf of the Czechoslovak Republic until the people within the Republic change, until the people go to work to the last man and woman in order to prove that in the first place they will depend upon themselves, and as a last resort only will they depend upon outside help.</p>
