   <p>Bartos Bittner is not among us any more. This wise Nestor of Bohemian-American newspapermen, whose name is known throughout America, who fought for the rights and enlightenment of our Bohemian-Slavonic people for more than a quarter of a century, suddenly and quietly departed from the drudgery of this troubled world. That sharp pen of his, which for twenty-eight years here in America hammered without mercy against everything that was rotten and wrote for the better future of our Bohemian people in this land, has finished and will write no more.</p>
   <p>To fathom all of the literary activities of Bartos Bittner in the brief period of time allowed us for this obituary is an impossibility. From the day of his entrance into this country in 1884, Mr. Bittner was in the employ of various newspapers; and no matter where he was, he was read and admired for his extraordinary journalistic talents. He was born poet of unusual genius, and many of his poems published in Ruch and other papers while he was still a student aroused the attention of the general public.</p>
   <p>Bartos Bittner was born July 12, 1861, in the village of Milavec,Bohemia. After completing his studies in the public school in Milavec, he was sent to Domazlice to study in the Gymnasium, from which he graduated after eight years with high honors. Mr. Bittner was an excellent linguist, and his knowledge of classic and modern languages was amazing. He next entered the seminary at Linec, Austria, at the request of his mother, who wanted him to become a Catholic priest. He remained there only a few months, because he did not like the German atmosphere which prevailed there. Next he went to Kralove Hradec to continue his studies. However, he soon left the seminary because he could not agree with the teachings which were being instilled there.</p>
   <p>He began the study of law in Prague. During that time he was a private tutor for two sons of an aristocratic family of Prague. When even the dry science of law did not satisfy him, he departed for America in the spring of 1884.</p>
   
   <p>Bartos Bittner settled in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Bohemian-American "Athens," where he taught in a Bohemian Free Thought school. On February 8, 1885, he returned to New York and entered upon the thankless road of Bohemian-American journalism. They were hard times, those first beginnings of Bohemian-American journalism, with much work and little money. In New York Mr. Bittner edited the Americky Delnik (American Worker) and the Sunday paper Sotek. He was also employed as editor-in-chief by the New Yorske Listy, which, in addition to its daily paper, published the New Yorske Humoristicky Listy. In New York, Mr. Bittner was greatly esteemed and admired.</p>
   <p>From New York he moved to Chicago where he was employed by the Svornost and Duch Casu. Mr. Bittner was a very prolific writer. Besides many educational, belletristic and poetic works, he wrote a biography on Jan Amos Komensky, the famous teacher of nations, on the occasion of the three-hundredth anniversary of Komensky's birth. He also wrote a catechism for Freethinking youth. Hundreds and hundreds of his excellent educational articles, poems, and treatises are to be found in the various newspapers to which he contributed, as for instance the Dennice Novdveku, Americka Osveta, Hlas Lidu, New Yorske Listy, Spravedlnost, and others.</p>
   <p>From 1893 to 1905, Mr. Bittner published his own paper in Chicago, the name of which was Sotek, and which is still remembered by many countrymen. It was a democratic, Free Thought, humorous, satirical weekly. At first the paper was printed in his own shop at 625-627 Laflin Street, but later it was printed in various shops. The paper enjoyed a large circulation in Free Thought circles and also widely distributed outside the limits of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In 1894, the year after the Columbian Exposition, Bittner was the defendant in a suit brought by the Bohemian Benedictines because of several articles which he wrote attacking them. During that period Bittner suffered a great deal. He was forced into hiding in order to escape an arrest warrant issued against him. In that critical period, his best friends in Chicago came to his assistance and furnished a $20,000 bail bond so that he would not have to be confined in jail while awaiting trial. Bittner's Chicagsky Sotek was published for the last time on September 22, 1905. At that time Mr. Bittner sold his entire business to the Narodni Tiskarna, which then began the publication of the weekly paper Rozhledy.</p>
   <p>Bartos Bittner was employed by the Denni Hlasatel from July, 1911, to the day of his death. Prior to that time, he contributed many articles to the paper and to the Kalendar. His articles were read with the greatest interest throughout America.</p>
   <p>Exactly when Bartos Bittner died will remain a mystery forever. According to the report of the coroner, Dr. Hunter, the cause of death was heart failure. Other details are lacking.</p>
   <p>Funeral expenses will be paid by Bittner's friends.</p>
