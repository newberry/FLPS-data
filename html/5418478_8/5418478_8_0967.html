   <p>P. 1--Some day, after the old people's home and the orphanage have become a reality, when Bohemian old people and orphans praise those who so enthusiastically worked to provide for their welfare and happiness, let them not forget to go to our National Cemetery and at the grave of Josef V. Matejka to remember thankfully him what beneath that sod dreams in perpetual sleep. Josef V. Matejka took upon himself the task of establishing, as soon as possible a refuge for those who in their old age had no place to go. He dedicated himself entirely to that purpose, working for it with willingness and enthusiasm, setting a good example for others; he aroused the wavering from their lethargy. Matejka could always be found wherever the old people's home or the orphanage were under consideration. To be sure, he did not live long enough to see his work completed. Stricken by death, he sank into his grave, but the seed which he sowed so well will surely bear fruit. May his memory live forever!</p>
   <p>He was buried in the National Cemetery yesterday, in that cemetery of which <span class="page-break">2</span>he was so endlessly proud because it is a Bohemian cemetery, the pride of Chicago Bohemians, in the success of which Matejka always took pleasure, for he saw in it a powerful support for all our national and philanthropic projects. He was buried in a dignified manner, as befitted a man who had consecrated his whole life to Bohemians. From the house where he had lived with his family, and where he died, at Nineteenth Street and Blue Island hence, his body was taken to the hall of the Bohemian-American School, where it lay in state to be viewed for the last time by his enormous circle of friends. The curtain of the stage was draped in mourning. Indeed, Matejka was an ardent supporter of the theatre, and it is difficult to decide which he was more enthusiastic about, the theatre or the old people's home. Shortly after ten o'clock the sad ceremony was begun by his brothers of the social organizations to which he belonged. Josef Matejka was a very active member of the Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society and of the Bohemian-American Foresters, and for that reason many members of these powerful organizations arrived to escort this brother of theirs to his final resting-place.</p>
