   <p>Recently a collection was begun among our countrymen from Kardasova Recice, Czechoslovakia, for the benefit of the Sokol Kardasova Recice Building Fund, and although many have not thus far remembered their native town, still Mrs. Frantiska Stejskal continues to receive contributions. Previously, the sum of $48.50 was acknowledged and the collector now announces these further contributions: [Translator's note: List of names and amounts follows.] Total, $12.50. Further contributions may be sent to Mrs. Frantiska Stejskal, 2509 South Hamlin Avenue, Chicago.</p>
