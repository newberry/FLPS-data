   <p>Today at last, just before the departure of Count Frantisek Luetzow upon the second half of his tour, I find a little time to write what I have been preparing to write since the time when my wife, faithfully remaining in Chicago, sent me a clipping from the February 6 issue of Spravedlnost. I am not sorry, however, that I did not write sooner. In the meantime the Spravedlnost has sunk still lower in its questionable practices, and I can write of other occurrences.</p>
   <p>On Friday, Febraary 2, Representative Victor Berger conducted himself in Congress in a way which every Czech must call insulting. Before the address by Dr. Luetzow he arose, and without any information, spoke a few impolite sentences. He said (I quote from page 1738 of the Congressional Record), "The Count was never, to my knowledge, a member of any parliament. (Had he</p>
   
   <span class="gap">[gap]</span>
   
   <p>his methods."</p>
   <p>That probably would have been enough so that Mr. Berger would have recognized that Count Luetzow is not merely a titled man but really an illustrious scientist. Therefore he meets the specifications set up by Mr. Berger.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Spravedlnost could have said diplomatically that Mr. Berger was not properly informed and further than that it could have kept quiet. Our attitude would have been that of the old Bohemian saying, "Well, why try to reason with him when he doesn't care to understand?" Instead of that, Spravedlnost took an attitude of unreasonable fanatic orthodoxy and said to itself that it must at all costs uphold Mr. Berger's point of view as correct.</p>
   <p>Something of that kind is foreign to me. I am capable of recognizing the fact that my best friend made a mistake, because it is only human to err. Spravedlnost, with its orthodoxy, found itself following the principle of an inclined plane.</p>
   
   <p>On February 6, Spravedlnost published an article, "Berger's Point of View," as reported by the National Socialist Press. There we read, "It is said in Washington diplomatic circles that the Count is not important in aristocratic circles." This story evidently emanated from the Austrian consulate which is dominated by Mr. Hengelmueller. He had announced quite a while prior to the arrival of Count Luetzow that he did not intend to present the Count to the President. That means that Count Luetzow is not on friendly terms with the Austrian Government. To be sure, this is understood. The scholar who, in his lectures at eleven universities tells American listeners that "Austria is not a genuinely constitutional, but a bureaucratic state"; that the constitution of 1860 is merely "a semblance of self-government"; and that "the German officials of Vienna elaborated a representative institution based on an unrivaled system of gerrymandering"; that a Hungarian minority governs in Hungary and a German minority in Austria governs over a Slavic majority, etc.; a man who gave ten thousand Kronen to the radical newspaper Samostatnost--such a man, in all respects a sincere Czech, cannot enjoy the love of the Hungarian-Jewish representative of the Austrian monarchy at Washington.</p>
   <p>We are not surprised that the National Socialist press accepted Mr. Berger's statements as the truth; it can be excused on the grounds of ignorance of Austrian conditions. But we are surprised that Spravedlnost did not immediately sense the source and that it reprinted the words.</p>
   <p>The Spravedlnost article further states that Mr. Berger arose partly for the purpose of insuring a hearing for Socialist guests in the future and partly so that the members might be informed of such occurrences in the future. In so far as the first is concerned, Mr. Berger could have safeguarded his purpose without any slighting remarks about Count Luetzow, and as for the second, we say that Mr. Berger was informed that Count Luetzow was going to speak. Congressman A. J. Sabath had sent a letter to all congressmen announcing that "Count Luetzow of Bohemia, who is making an academic tour of the country," would speak in the House of Representatives on Friday. "The distinguished visitor enjoys an enviable reputation as a savant in Europe. He is the author of numerous historical works published in London, enjoys honorary degrees in several literary, scientific, and historical societies, etc."</p>
   <p>I have a copy of this letter, and I intend to use a facsimile of it in my book about Count Luetzow's tour. If Mr. Berger paid no attention to this letter and threw it into the waste basket, that does not excuse him.</p>
   <p>Now Spravedlnost took a tragic pose and wrote: We deny "Dr. Vojan the right to speak in the name of comrade Dr. [Frantisek] Soukup." To be sure, that does not affect me.....I hereby publicly announce to Spravedlnost that the moment I had a copy of the Congressional Record at hand, I sent it to Dr. Soukup with a request that he read it and then inform me whether or not I had the right to write Mr. Berger, and that Dr. Soukup would have been little pleased if he had heard Mr. Berger use his name against the Bohemian Count Luetzow. Dr. Soukup will surely answer me, because we were always good friends--and for that reason it is altogether immaterial to me whether Spravedlnost denies me anything or not. I have known Dr. Soukup for the past twenty years, and that is perhaps longer than anyone connected with Spravedlnost has been a Social Democrat. If Spravedlnost wrote further that the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) writes "arrogantly," I reply simply, "If you please, I am willing to quote for Spravedlnost a thousand and one far worse cases of arrogance from its own columns during only the past month."</p>
   <p>Spravedlnost wrote that "of those who are now basking in the light of the Count's name, many knew very little about Count Luetzow two years ago." Surely this does not concern me, for as editor of Nova Ceska Revue (New Bohemian Review) I had dealings with Count Luetzow in June, 1904, and acquired for my periodical his beautiful essay "Novodobi Dejepisci Cesti" (Modern Bohemian Historians) (printed in September, 1904, in Praha by Topic, Nova Ceska Revue).</p>
   <p>The worst of it is that the editors of Spravedlnost are people who have not read Count Luetzow's works.....Count Luetzow spent a full ten years in research in preparing his work on Jan Huss. Read his book, gentlemen, and then judge the literary work of this scholar. Expressions such as, "We have been visited by a scholar who is much greater than Thomas G. Masaryk," are nonsensical to an educated person. Scientific work is not measured by pounds. Every scientist works in his own sphere, and the differentiation "lesser, greater" does not apply.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stepan Skala writes in the Spravedlnost of February 24 that "Count Luetzow, by his visit, has brought the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar back to life." That is an insulting error. The Tiskova Kancelar is active all the time....It does not matter if Spravedlnost does not want to spend the few dollars each month required for the reports of the Tiskova Kancelar. The unfriendly attitude of the Spravedlnost does not mean disaster.....On the other hand, it would do no harm if part of their "Court Reports" were replaced with Tiskova Kancelar reports. This would in no way injure the quality of the paper.....</p>
