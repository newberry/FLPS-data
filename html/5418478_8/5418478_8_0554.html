   <p>We appeal again, and most urgently, to all our countrymen to apply immediately for their first citizenship papers, that is, to file their intention to become American citizens. Also, those who have already filed such intention and have not yet received their certificates of citizenship should apply for them at once, in case they are already entitled to them.

   <p>It is impossible to stress sufficiently the importance of every Bohemian's getting rid of his Austrian allegiance as soon as possible. This is now not only a requirement of national honor, but also a matter of necessity. It is quite possible that those who forget to perform this duty toward themselves will regret their negligence, but it will be too late. There should, by this this, be no Austrian subjects of Bohemian nationality in America.</p>
