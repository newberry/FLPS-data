   <p>Six years ago Professor T. G. Masaryk, the leader of the revolutionary party of Czechoslovakia, was convinced that not only money,which was generously contributed by the Czechoslovaks of America, but also military help was needed [for the liberation of our old homeland]. That dictum was brought to us by one of the most famous sons of our nation, the now deceased General Stefanik.</p>
   <p>After a conference with the local leaders here, the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada Americka (Czechoslovak-American National Council [the central office of which is located in Chicago]), issued a call for volunteers who would be willing to risk their lives and shed their blood so that our dear native land might be wrested from the usurping Hapsburgs. And lo, the very first day that the call was issued, many of our boys volunteered, boys who were proud to be able to serve in liberating the land of their fathers from the German yoke. The cars of the train carrying the first contingent of these boys were swathed in garlands <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of flowers, and the eyes of all who came to bid them adieu were filled with tears of pride and gratitude.....Our boys were leaving for battles with the enemy for mortal combats, but our silent wishes accompanied them, wishes which, if expressed would say: "Come back to us as victors; and since no sacrifice was too great for you, nor will any sacrifice be too great for us [who are left behind] to make possible the freedon of our native land!"</p>
   <p>The terrible World War is ended, and the land which cradled us is liberated. But while we here followed the events of the theater of war, and went about peacefully in performing our daily work, our boys were shedding their blood. They came back victorious indeed, but not all of them returned. Ninety-seven of them laid down their lives upon the altar of their fatherland. And their widows and orphans, poor and pitiful people, now mourn their former <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>supporters. Who made promises to these legionnaires? We! Who should therefore care for these widows and orphans. We!</p>
   <p>One hundred and fifty of our boys came back as invalids and are unable to work and earn their daily bread. Who should care for these men? We! We promised that we would! The revolution ended successfully but our work is not ended until we have discharged our obligations fully.</p>
   <p>The Narodni Rada recently issued a call to Czechoslovak-Americans to collect money for a permanent fund of $100,000 for the alleviation of misery and suffering among our invalids and the widows and orphans of Czechoslovak legionnaires. As enthusiastically as the boys went to war,.....as enthusiastically must we also end our revolutionary activities by establishing this fund for the widows and orphans of our fallen heroes, and for legionnaire invalids. We asked for their blood and their lives! Who will now refuse</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>[to contribute to the fund]? Nobody! For whoever does is a heartless wretch devoid of feeling.</p>
   <p>For the committee:</p>
   <p>Mr. Jan A. Cervenka, president [of the National Council];</p>
   <p>Mr. Frantisek Horlivy, secretary.</p>
