   <p>The celebrated Bohemian violinist,Jarosl Kocian, upon his arrival in Chicago early yesterday morning, was welcomed quietly but heartily by representatives of the Bohemian colony.</p>
   <p>Among those present at the Union Depot, Adams and Clinton Streets, were representatives of the Bohemian Singing Union. The Bohemian journalists were represented by L. J. Tupy for Hlasatel and Jar. Psenicka for Svornost.</p>
   <p>Although the train, which brought our celebrated countryman from Cincinnati, arrived at 7:40 A.M., the delegations were on time.</p>
   <p>This evening he will appear for the first time before the Chicago public,and his countrymen, who live in this city, will surely attend this concert in large numbers. Friday evening Kocian will be the guest of the Bohemian Club at a grand banquet.</p>
