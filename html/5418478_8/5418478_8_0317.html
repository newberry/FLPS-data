   <p>Let us all work hard for the nation. How it is done is immaterial if the good will is here. The "Ladies Auxiliary for the Czechoslovak Army" was formed from members of the Czech National Alliance, on June 21. The directorate of twenty is composed of well-accredited workers, who represent all women's groups. The directorate will soon be augmented by additional representatives of other organizations.</p>
   <p>This Ladies Auxiliary is under the sponsorship of the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America, and the Slovak League. It was, in fact, constituted out of members of these bodies, under whose guidance it endeavors to make the best success of its activities. This Auxiliary comprises all groups of the "Vcelky" (Little Bees), regardless of creeds, attitudes, and opinions. The Slovak Vcelky and other Slovak women's auxiliaries also belong to this body.</p>

   <p>All information is given out by the chairman of the Czech National Alliance. The latter, as well as the Catholic Alliance and the Slovak League, has given us financial support which helped us considerably toward our goal.</p>
   <p>Within the short span of two months, the Czechoslovak women have filled seventeen very large boxes with hand-worked articles, both linen and woolen, for soldiers of the Czechoslovak army. Our boys will surely remember those very thoughtful women who work for them whenever the occasion arises, be it in our Bazaar or our Posviceni (people's old-fashioned festivity).</p>
   <p>All this recognition does not stop the "Little Bees" from doing more work. They keep on knitting, sewing, collecting and piling up goods in their beehives and garners. They make every effort to acquire everything needed by the soldiers, and arrange collections under the auspices of the Czech National and Czech Catholic Alliances, and the Slovak League. They also strive in every way to lighten the heavy burden of those three bodies. Czechoslovak women never relax in the pursuit of their aims. The following <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>women's organizations are represented in the Auxiliary: The Czech Ladies Unit, Catholic Foresters, Sisterhood Auxiliary Unit, Catholic Women's Central Organization, Beseda Fric, First Slovak Women's Unit, Zivena, and the Evangelic (Protestant) Slovak Women's Association. Many others are about to join in the near future.</p>
   <p>We are doing everything in our power to prove to our boys across the ocean that we fully grasp the magnitude of the sacrifice they are making, and to render their situation as tolerable as possible. We can do this only by providing them with things they need. Our boys do not get tired. This is shown by their successes. We must not, therefore, show fatigue either. Let us continue to work, together. We ought to feel proud of our boys--those who are already overseas, and also those who are on their way to the battlefields.</p>
   <p>Czechoslovak mothers be true to yourselves, by asking yourselves whether you feel you have done your duty! Today you can help. Do not hesitate and postpone till it is too late. Those in battle offer their lives for us. Let us likewise do our duty and place a penny or two upon the altar of our land, to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>give our boys what they need to alleviate their suffering.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludwig Fisher, chairman of the Czech National Alliance, and lieutenant colonel of the Czechoslovak army, is giving out information according to which we are expected and urged to do everything possible for the Czechoslovak army. Our soldiers need warm clothing and various other necessities, as for instance, soap which is almost unobtainable overseas. They need sundry utensils, such as scissors, brushes, needles and thread, writing paper, etc. Christmas will soon be here. It is time for us to begin preparations so that we can give our boys a pleasant surprise for the holidays. Dr. Fisher suggests that we take up collections and send money for each company, so that our boys can have a Christmas tree. If we succeed in getting the money, then Christmas tide will be the most beautiful time we have had during the whole year.....A mother is a wonderful being. She cares for her son and defends him, even when all others condemn him. She makes one mistake only--she leaves him, and leaves him forever, alone.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Czechoslovak women! Let there be not one among you who would forget to do her sacred duty! Let us demonstrate that we are faithful daughters of our motherland, and loyal citizens of the country of our great president, woodrow Wilson, whose nation has recognized our nation as equal to other, free, nations.</p>
   <p>We will start the collection soon, and will see every Czechoslovak woman. Every woman conscious of her descent keep your door open for us! We wish to thank all those women who contributed so generously for the benefit of our soldiers, on the occasion of the raising of a service flag on Lawndale Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets. We also thank the mothers who helped at the celebration on Springfield Avenue between 26th and 27th Streets. The former contributed $72,57, the latter $72, and those on Lawndale Avenue near 31st Street $102. The moneys were received by Mrs. Antonia Cervenka, and directed to the proper place. We thank each one in the name of our soldiers.</p>
