   <p>Many members of the C.N.S. (Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni--Czech National Alliance) residing at Cicero find it hard to make the long way to Cicero branch, which is located in the Sokol Karel Jonas quarters on 25th Street. They have founded a new branch at Warren Avenue Park. There was a meeting, arranged by the Cicero branch, at which the division was performed.</p>
   <p>Professor J. Zmrhal and Mr. F. J. Kubec, chairman of the district committee of the C.N.S., spoke. The new branch will make it easier for members to pursue their purpose and continue their activities to promote the revolutionary movement which has the liberation of Czechoslovak lands as its ultimate goal. The attendance at the meeting was good. The new branch has members from Cicero and from Morton Park; besides these, thirty-seven new members were gained. Officers were elected after the two speakers had addressed the meeting.</p>
   <p>Both speakers took the audience off its feet. Their ardent words were <span class="page-break">\2</span>tumultuously greeted and rewarded with applause. We regret very much not to be able, for lack of space, to publish them.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope that all our fellow countrymen of Warren Avenue Park will become members of the new branch and thus show that they are doing their patriotic duty. The next regular meeting will announce the results of the election of officers.</p>
   <p>"Thou must not do less than the simplest Czech soldier," says Professor Masaryk. This slogan should be in everybody's mind, and all should obey it. It is always better to come late than not to come at all. Best of success to the new branch!</p>
   <p>For the Cicero Morton Park branch of C.N.S.</p>
   <p>F. J. Kubec, chairman</p>
   <p>K. Teplian, secretary</p>
