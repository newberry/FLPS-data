   <p>In a few days you....will be en route to our native land--Czechoslovakia which you helped to liberate. In a few days you will be on your way to the land where your cradle stood, the land which you left with many others while still young, and to which you are returning today as ripe and hardened men enriched by experience. Among us there will be some who were born in America but who cherished in their hearts the desire to see the native land of their parents, a land of heroes. Therefore, may God speed you! You may consider yourselves lucky to have the opportunity of seeing the thresholds of your native homes, to look at the roofs under which you spent your childhood days and dreamed your childhood dreams. It may be that many of you will still find under the same roofs your aged fathers and careworn mothers who will clasp you in their embrace and tell you about their sorrows and their pleasures while you dwelt abroad. Only a few days more and you will see that dear beloved homeland. She is your mother, and we, who remain in this country ask you, who will soon tread her soil, to remember us, to kiss that native <span class="page-break">\2</span>soil and to take greetings from us to the homeland....Say that we do not forget, and that we are battling for the right to speak in our native tongue, that we are preserving the heritage bequeathed to us by our fathers and mothers, and that [Bohemia] will always remain our mother as long as our hearts will beat. This I desired to tell you before your departure.</p>
   <p>A few words more....When you notice some things in your old homeland which you will find unpleasant....be not hasty in judging, remember that during your long sojourn in the land of the Stars and Stripes you became accustomed to other and quite different conditions. But be assured that our people [of Czechoslovakia] are not idle. They build. Let us hope that you will find your homeland kind to you. And you, who will take your children along, children who were born to you in this country, do not fail to show them the beauties of your homeland, its places of historical interest, places which speak of the old glory of Bohemia. Show them the castles and cathedrals, <span class="page-break">\3</span>but also the humbly thatched huts in which the great men of Bohemia were born. Show them the heart of Bohemia, its many-towered city of Prague, and insist that while they remember these things they should never under any circumstances deny their [Bohemian] origin. And now 'God's speed'.....</p>
