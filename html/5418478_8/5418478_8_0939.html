   <p>All Democratic factions were represented at the banquet in honor of Mr. Charles J Vopicka, United States Ambassador to the Balkan States, yesterday. Mayor Harrison, Governor Dunne, and even Roger C. Sullivan forgot all their healousies; their petty and big peeves, their political differences, and came to participate in the festivity given for Mr. Vopicka by the Iroquois Club in the Blackstone Hotel. They all tried to do their best to show their appreciation and full recognition of Mr. Vopicka's merits. Yesterday's banquet marked the first time in seven years when all these three men sat together at one table and spoke to the same audience. Other speakers were Dr. Em. Hirsch, ex-mayor of Butte, Montana, Thomas P. Nerney, and the Iroquois Club president, Albert F. Reichman. Among the prominent Democrats of all factions were Congressman [A. J.]Sabath, Samuel Alschuler, State's Attorney Maclay Hoyne, Corporation Counsel W. H. Sexton, and others.</p>
