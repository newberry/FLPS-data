   <p>A committee to plan for a business expedition to Czechoslovakia was organized in this city last Wednesday. The expedition will leave Chicago in April of next year. Its purpose is to make business, industrial, and agricultural contacts in Czechoslovakia, to investigate business, industrial, and agricultural conditions, and to encourage our American countrymen to sensible investment of money in our new Czechoslovak Republic, as well as to bring back reliable information about business, industrial, and agricultural opportunities available to our countrymen who would be interested either in investing their savings in the old country or in returning there to live.</p>
   <p>The expedition will take over the whole second cabin space in a fast ship, about 450 second-class cabins. At present, the lowest price for a second-class cabin is about $150, better located cabins are more expensive, and there is a war tax of five dollars. First cabins also will be available <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for $220 and up. No third cabin reservations will be accepted. Every participant is to pay five dollars for current expenses of the committee and various extra advantages which the expedition will offer.</p>
   <p>The expedition is headed by well-known Czechoslovaks not only of Chicago but of other parts of the country. The chairman of the committee is Mr. John K. Valha. The Reverend Vaclav Vanek is its secretary, and Mr. Josef Dusek, the well-known produce and fruit broker of Randolph Street, is its treasurer. The subcommittee on special trains to New York is headed by Alderman Anton J. Cermak; the subcommittee to negotiate with the Czechoslovak Government, by Lawyer Karel Vesely; the press subcommittee, by Mr. Vaclav L. Rerabek. Reservations accompanied by twenty-five dollars, of which twenty dollars will be credited to the price of the ticket and five dollars used for current expenses, are being accepted now. Checks and money orders should be made out to Mr. Josef Dusek, and sent to the undersigned secretary.</p>
