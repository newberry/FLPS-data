   <p>P.1--During the first two months of its existence, the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) received three communications, which were erroneously thought to refer to the Bohemian people. The "Judge," on the 23rd of December 1909, wrote about the "Kingdom of Bohemia," whose insignia are three balls, and of "Pseudo-Bohemians," who have much regard for neckties, but not for marital ties, (by this I am trying to allude to the pun: Regard for neckties and disregard for family ties). The Chicago Inter Ocean, on the 9th of January 1910, mentioned "Bohemian fashion," as characteristic of taking someone from the office directly to dinner and then to the theatre, without having called for him at his home first. The January Detroit News, had the following caption: "Bohemia bad for girls,"because "Bohemia does not further talents, on the contrary, is detrimental to them, teaches young girls how to smoke cigarets, drink whiskey and cocktails, and renders them unfit for family life." In all of these three cases neither the Bohemian kingdom nor the Bohemians were meant, but "Bohemes" and their dominion, were referred to.</p>
   
   <p>On August 11th, 1907 the Denver Post brought a long article headed "Bohemia and a book" in which the book "The Belove Vagabond," extolling the charms of Boheme-life was reviewed. This caused the feeling of the Denver Bohemians to run high, and subside only after stormy discussions. It seems, therefore, advisable to deal in detail with the three kinds of "Bohemians" as they are known in the English language and the French as well.</p>
   <p>I. "Bohemians" in the proper, oldest and purest sense, are we, the Czechs. The latin writers called our old homeland "Bohemia" and the nation dwelling there "Bohemians," which word became commonly known in all languages. The Germans call us and our land "Bohemian" and us "Bohemians." The English use "Bohemia"--the latin word taken over without a change--and "Bohemians"; the Italians have "Bohemia" and "Boem."</p>
   <p>Our homeland was, before Christ, peopled by a gallic tribe, named the Bois, which passes historically, in general, as the first settler of the Bohemia of today. Their abode may have been spread over a larger area, but the names "Boj-land," "Boiohaemum," and "Boihaemum," finally adhered to the country which is Bohemia. The famous Roman historian Tacitus, in the first century after Christ, writes in his "Germania" that the land in which the Bojs had dwelled is still called "The land of the Bojs"--manet at hoc Boihaemi nomen. Velleius Pateropoulus, Roman historian from the same century, writes, that the country in which dwelled Marobud, king of the Markomans, is called Boiohaemem. The Markomans came to Bohemia after the Bojs had moved to the South. Caeser in his "De bello Gallico" (Gallic War) correspondingly states that in 58 B. C. the Bojs did not any more inhabit the Herctnian Forest which also comprises Bohemia.--Similarly the Greek historian Strabon writes "Buiamon." This name "Land of the Bojs" clings to our homeland in the form Bohemia, giveniit by the Latin writers. The Germans used "Beheim" and the German poet who mourns the Bohemian king Przemysl Otakor II writes: "Kuenic Uz Behem Lant," in modern German "Koenig aus Boehmen land."</p>
   <p>And in the same manner, as they named the land "Bohemia" the chroniclers also called the Slavic people, settlec in it "Bohemi." This word has nothing in common with "Czech," but we have today an over thousand year old right to this name. It is to be noted, that when our forefathers came to the "Land of the Bojs" they had no common name. They were several slavic tribes, one of whom settled in the central part of Bohemia and was called the "Czechs." Not until the twelfth century did these tribes take on the collective name "Czechs," and the country Cechy (Czech-land).</p>
   <p>We have therefore acquired a name very much in the same manner, as in the Bohemian country, the new owner was given the old name adherent to the estate. We have been bearing the name "Bohemians" for over a thousand years and there is no doubt about our historic right to it.</p>
   <p>II. In two languages only, the French and the English, have the names Bohemiens and Bohemians, been acquired by a nomadic tribe, dispersed over all of Europe, which we Bohemians call Cikani (Tsigans, Gypsies). They came, by all indications, from Asia, appeared in Turkey in the eleventh century, spreading over Hungary to Polans, and are mentioned for the first time by Bohemian chroniclers in the year 1416.  They may have been in Bohemia in the year 1242 as spies sent out by the Tartars, as hinted at in the ancient history written by Dalimil.  After the Husit-wars they rapidly multiplied in Bohemia, especially in the sylvan southern portions of the country; but their presence even in the city of Prague is recorded in the year 1450. Bohemian tolerance suffered them to remain, although the Gypsies poorly rewarded the hospitality shown to them, by participating in espionage for the Tartars. From Bohemia the Gypsies spread to France about the year 1427, where by reason of their coming from Bohemia they were called by the French--who have never been great geographers--Bohemiens. Mr. Psenka (the publisher of the Denni Hlasatel) was told by Mr. Ledoux, French consul in Prague, that in his investigation of the erronecus appearance of the name Bohemians for Cypsies in the French language, he arrived at the conclusion, that the notorious emperor Sigmund, known for his pronounced dislike of the Bohemian people, had had a part in it, and Marousse's dictionary says: "In France, the Gypsies were mistaken for exiled followers of John Hus."</p>
   <p>That the English confused Gypsies with Bohemians is nothing to be wondered at. The English had no better knowledge of history than they had a hundred years ago. Sufficient to place before the reader, Shakespeare's "A Winter's Tale," in which Bohemia is located at the sea shore. The third scene from Act III, defines as the place of action "Bohemia, a desert country near the sea." The learned Ben Johnson chuckled over this geographical ignorance of Shakespeare and yet, nine years later John Taylor, who styled himself "The King's Majesty's Water Poet" relates how, after having visited Prague in 1620, the capital of Bohemia, he was asked, in an interview with Gregory Gandergoose, alderman of the City of London, "If Bohemia be a great town, whether there be any meat in it, and whether the last fleet of ships be arrived there." The good man had drawn his knowledge of geography from that of William Shakespeare.</p>
   <p>III. From the Gypsies, with their carefree life, there was naturally only one step to the third meaning of the word Bohemians. This step was taken by the writer Mrs. George Sand, who in the thirties of last century concludes her roman "Derniere Aldini" by the outcry "Vive la Boheme! Let us deride the pride of the Great, let us laugh at their foolishness, let us merrily spend fortunes, if we have any, let us carelessly embrace poverty, when it appears, let us, before all, preserve our freedom, let us enjoy life at any price, long live the Boheme!"</p>
   <p>In these words of George Sand, is contained the entire realm of the third meaning. Bohemians are artists of all kinds, who live gaily through certain periods of their lives, during which their talents, their wit, and their gifts gained, to sweeten their lives, but could not, up to that moment, bring about the condition so necessary for earthly welfare--affluence of money. They know now to muddle through without "mammon," and to spend it wildly and the instant they acquire it, while their heads are forever full of daring ideas, unconventional plans, scorning all of the accredited and settled order of things. These among them, who are ingenious, rise to prominence after a time, but, many of course, perish, remaining on that level. "The Boheme life is an era in artist life which is the prelude to either the Academy, or the hospital or the morgue," says the inimitable Henry Hurger, whose "Scenes from Boheme-life" brought him fame. The originators of "Boheme-life" are the French literati, students and artists.</p>
   <p>The name Boheme presupposes a real talent, actual ingeniousness, and therefore we distinguish, as the "Judge" writes, "real Bohemians" from "pseudo-Bohemians." The latter ape all the good and bad behaviour in Boheme-life without any latent talent budding in them. They inbibe like Bohemians, but produce nothing of artistic value.</p>
   <p>And now to the conclusion: The third meaning is here to stay; it has become acclimatized in the world-languages. We ourselves and our writers, like J. S. Machar in his "confiteor" use the word in the sense just described. It only remains to be desired that other nations make the distinction between Bohemes and us, the Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The second name Bohemian leads to confusion only in the English and the French language. The Germans have Zigeuner, the Italians Zingari, but even in English one may use Gypsies, and in French Tziganes. We should, therefore propagate the use of Gypsies in English. In examples of more ancient use the change a cannot easily be effected any more. The character in Michael William Balfe's opera "The Bohemian Girl" is not a Bohemian, but a Gypsy girl.</p>
   <p>And how, the question arises: Shall we use Bohemian, or the newly coined word Czech in English, Tcheque in French, Tscheche in German? Sheer convenience would speak for the new term. But there is something to be said for "Bohemians" as well. In Bohemia for instance the word "Die Tschechen" is inadmissible, as it infringes upon our state rights. It is being pointed out that if "Tchechen" were introduced, while Bohemia is still called "Boehmen," it would indicate, that in "Bohemen" there live "Tschechen" and "Deutsche"--in other words, Bohemia could be divided into a "Czech" and a "German" territory. But as long as the country is "Bohemen" and the nation "Bohemen" (Bohemians), the country remains indivisible, and every "Boehme" has to be a citizen in his full right in every part of the country, and not a member of a minority with less rights.</p>
