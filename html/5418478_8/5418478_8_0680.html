   <p>Chicago, October 10, 1914.</p>
   <p>At the very beginning of the war when Russia, France, and England threw their weight into the scales, many of our American countrymen awakened to the realization that Europe was experiencing historical times which should not find the Bohemian nation sitting idly with her hands in her lap. That the Bohemian nation would voluntarily lie down to a political sleep at a moment when its future destinies were being decided, is simply inconceivable. How is it to be explained that at a time when people speak about an independent Poland, about full rights of citizenship for the Russian Jews, about autonomy for Finland, when the Lithuanians are calling an overseas congress of small nations, when maps of Denmark with Schleswig as its territory are being drawn, nothing is being heard about the requirements and desires of the Bohemian nation, almost as though it did not exist.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian nation has thousands of reasons to proclaim most loudly to the whole world that besides the small nations whose independence and liberation are discussed in journalistic, literary, and perhaps even diplomatic circles, there exists a nation of eight million people that has at least as much right to an independent state as any other nation in Europe. In the critical period, however, when the time approaches for a rebirth of Europe, there is not a single little voice from Bohemia to call the attention of the world to the nation of John Huss, Jan Amos Komensky (Comenius), and Karel Havlicek.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian nation does sleep, but it is not a voluntary, spontaneous sleep; it is a narcosis, a sleep artificially brought about by subtle provisions of the Austrian Government which, it seems, has recognized its former mistakes, and if it never has known how to handle the Bohemian nation, it now shows an unusual degree of cunning. The news that has reached America concerning revolution and bloodshed in Prague, the execution of entire Bohemian regiments, arrests and executions of Bohemian members of parliament is untrue. All these were unfounded rumors originating in Russia or in Italy; and direct news from Bohemia is proving them to be false. The Austrian Government has good reasons not to proceed ruthlessly against the Bohemian nation, and the Bohemian nation is keeping quiet and peaceful in expectation of things that the future will bring it. Thousands of the sons of Bohemia are bleeding on the plains of Poland, in the Balkan mountains, even at the gates of Alsatian cities; the whole nation suffers under conditions brought about by the war and are preparing for the possibility of famine, misery, and perhaps plague.</p>
   <p>The government has ordered "Hej, Slovane!" and "Kde Domov Muj?" ("Hey, Ye Slavs" and "Where is My Home") [both are Bohemian national anthems] played for Bohemians. Someone was beaten up in Vienna for using vile language against the Bohemians, and instead of the expected severe measures the chief district officials have received orders to proceed "in fatherly fashion". The newspapers are bringing conciliatory articles and enthusiastic reports from government offices while the people, or at least the greatest majority of them, are being made to strike as Austrian a chord as even Bach [ruthless centralist Austrian prime minister] could have ever dreamed of. The Austrian Government, which never knew how to deal with the Bohemians according to their merits, has found, in the most critical of moments for Austria, the proper way. Had it acted as in 1848, or even as it has treated the desires of the Bohemian nation during the last fifteen years, it would have had behind its back a nation stirred up to complete opposition. Thus, under the influence of the Emperor's proclamation "to my loyal nations" and the extremely careful manner the government has adopted in these critical times, the Bohemian nation, with all the demands it had been fighting for, has become conciliatory and patient in the expectation of what it will receive as a reward of its proverbial fealty and loyalty; and it would not be at all surprising if the world press should proclaim one of these days that the Bohemian nation is definitely discrediting, through the mouths of its political leaders, any rumors circulated by overseas Bohemians that the Bohemian nation demands freedom and independence; that, on the contrary, it is extremely contented under the Austrian Government; that it never will desire better rulers than the Hapsburgs. The narcotic works wonders: it produces a deep slumber; the pains are felt no more. But the awakening from any narcosis is always bad.</p>
   <p>The following is not meant to be a prophecy. Nobody, however, can deny certain possibilities in our speculations. Let us suppose that Austria and Germany will be defeated and that the Allies who will dictate the conditions of peace will decide that Austria, having caused the war, will be deprived of all such lands as do not voluntarily make its parts, and thus take away from Germany the only support it has had so far. The independence of Poland will be discussed. France and England will hardly permit their ally to break his word, and anyway it seems that the Czar himself is coming to the conclusion that it is much better to deal with contented nations than with enslaved ones. Alsace-Lorraine will be given the full choice of joining France or the Swiss Federation. The Russian part of Galicia will return to its mother country together with Bucovina; Rumania and Italy will get for their neutrality, or possibly for their help, such parts of Austria-Hungary as are inhabited by their nationals. Serbia will get Bosnia and Herzegovina with an outlet to the sea. But nobody will think of the lands inhabited by the eight million Bohemians. Why should anybody think of the Bohemian nation if it fails to do something for its own independence? The faithful, loyal Bohemian nation, so enthusiastically devoted to the Austrian Emperor; the nation which proclaimed through the mouths of its most prominent men that it is proud to shed its blood for the integrity of Austria and for the Hapsburg dynasty--this nation will be incorporated as a province to whatever will be left of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. And there it will be free to resume its ancient fight for every bit of recognition, every inch of justice, each school, each office, each Bohemian word in official publications. And then the fight will be much more difficult because the Bohemian nation will be isolated; it will lack the support of the support of the other Austrian Slavs whose majority then will be in the newly established countries and busy with their own affairs.</p>
   <p>There are few people today who do not believe that the whole map of Europe will have to be revised, and it is therefore imperative to take these possibilities into consideration. Austria, defeated, maimed, and deprived of its importance, would have left one of only two roads. Either profit by the teachings of history that only contented people make a strong state, repent, and give to its non-German nations which will be left to it after the war all their long-denied rights, introduce justice, remove national friction, and by following sensible internal and international political principles try to heal the wounds it has received. This is what Austria could, and should do. But knowing the Austrian Germans as we do, knowing Vienna politics, and knowing the Hapsburg perfidy, we are afraid that Austria will select the other road, the road of revenge on those whom they believe caused its defeat and the disgrace of Austria's pride by their indifference and lack of proper support. And then, woe to the Bohemian people; untold woe for every Bohemian soldier who threw away his gun in preference to shooting his brothers; woe to every deserter who perhaps joined the Serbs or Russians; woe to every sign of disloyalty during the war. The present comparative and surprising indulgence can change overnight into the old "lash them with rods of iron," and it is by no means impossible that the post-White Mountain times will return. In that case it would be useless to complain of injustice and tyranny to the world.</p>
   <p>All this is clear to our countrymen in America, and hence does not need further elaboration. Much less clear, however, and much more difficult to answer is the question of what should be done, and how it should be started. Entire Bohemian-America with its nationals of all small countries of Europe residing in the United States feel that it is impossible for them to remain phlegmatic and idle in these most serious times. They also feel that it is their duty to put forth their best efforts toward the improvement of their nations' conditions of existence. All that is necessary is to look around without bias and see the work now being done by the Slovaks, Poles, Ruthenians, Serbs and Croatians. It will be noticed that they emulate the efforts of the Danes, Belgians, Swiss, or Italians. This, of course, is quite natural. Indeed, no nation would deserve any future whatever which would not realize that it is deeply involved in the present struggle; that its very existence is at stake.</p>
   <p>All Bohemians in America realize this also, and none of our newspapers, no matter how they may differ in temperament and views, plainly acknowledge that "something" should and must be done. In reviewing our Bohemian-American press, almost in the tenth week of the war, we cannot escape the impression that its voice in spite of very different standpoints of various individual newspapers, is experiencing certain changes, a certain transition in opinions which eventually will crystallize. Let us hope, then, that in the near future they will crystallize enough to permit speaking of at least one standpoint they all would have in common--that all of them would agree that we can get no positive results with our present disordered lines, and that a large measure of sagacity, self-denial, and mutual confidence is necessary for the success of any unified effort.</p>
   <p>Voices are already being heard, pointing to the fact that anything we may be undertaking is, and must be, far from playing in Bohemian-American public life customary petty club and party politics. These voices are an evidence that even Bohemians in America, living in conditions to which they are not fully accustomed, will gradually become well capable of a unified, deeply political effort, such as is now indispensable to Bohemians in the old country. Even if there should not be full agreement in every detail, the general consensus of opinions, particularly the more serious ones, is that our country needs very real help, and that to render such help is the sacred duty of all of us, without any exceptions. Gradually we are coming closer to a definite answer to the question of what can Bohemian-America do for the old country in these times. In spite of some skepticism, the answer is: A great deal.</p>
   
   <p>Whoever has had an opportunity to follow the activities of some of the institutions in the old country will understand how much it means to secure the sympathy of other nations. Let us give an example. Some ten years ago, the average number of foreign visitors to Prague did not exceed seventy thousand per year. As soon, however, as the beauties of our country were presented to the attention of the world--by periodicals, newspaper articles, invitations to prominent foreigners, participation in exhibitions, etc.--the annual influx of visitors grew by some ten thousand a year, and today Prague belongs to the most popular cities of Austria-Hungary. And at that, the principal purpose in the effort was not simply to increase the number of visitors. Everybody who has become acquainted with Prague has also become its friend and a friend of our old country. And to make such friends was the principal purpose.</p>
   <p>In America itself there are a number of prominent men (Professor Monroe) who have remained our friends and whose friendship is treasured by every good Bohemian. Just at the present time it is a question of making not only the American, but the world public acquainted with our desires, to gain its sympathies, to show it the place our nation has--or could have, if given freedom and independence--among the cultural nations of the world. The securing of friendship and sympathy abroad is an important element of the work we have become accustomed to call the work of liberation of the old country.</p>
   <p>This is a matter of efficient dissemination of information so that it will reach those who will play a direct or indirect part in the arrangements of future Europe. Should Bohemian-America be incapable of this task? This is a task of the first importance. It determines the victory or the failure of everything else we may undertake. Who would not know how anxious and thorough are the efforts of the Hungarians to make their desires known and thereby sympathetic to the whole world. And yet, how far are most of their political desires from right and true justice which are the aims of the Bohemian nation.</p>
   <p>If the American Bohemians accomplish nothing else but succeed in giving our American Bohemians a true picture of the desires of the Bohemian nation and gain their active sympathies--a goal which can be reached by purposeful information service such as the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar has been conducting for years, and now will continue in its present capacity of the press committee of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) --a very great deal will be done to assure the independent development of Bohemian lands.</p>
   <p>And now, when the ears of the world are open to the voices of the smaller nations as they never have been before, it should not be impossible for us to be heard where we have not been heard so far. Such propaganda, such information will not be a wasted effort even if it does not lead directly to the desired results. On the contrary, it will make up, at least to some extent, for what we have neglected in the past, and in what other nations are so far ahead of us.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that none of us will continue to believe in the virtue of being a modest violet, a retiring wallflower! So now we face the problem of deciding on the best ways of making the world acquainted with the situation, conditions, desires, rights, and requirements of the Bohemian nation. Unfortunately, many obstacles will have to be removed in order to reach a degree of unified opinion in this respect.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly there is some truth in what some of us maintain that every one of us, every one of our communities can do something in this respect. There is more truth, however, in the contention that our action will be successful only if conducted with single purpose and from one center, according to a unified, preconceived and well considered plan. It is quite natural that two or three simultaneous actions in one and the same matter cannot favorably impress the public; that they are uneconomical, and even for that reason only, quite wrong. Even those who are now of a different opinion will, after some experience, come to this conclusion. But will that not be too late, and will our cause suffer in the meantime?</p>
   
   <p>The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, formed for the purpose of undertaking whatever will be necessary in these times, and composed as it is of representatives of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar, and the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) stands before great tasks and approaches them in full awareness of its responsibility. It is now up to our public to give the Sdruzeni its moral and financial support and thus enable the Sdruzeni to bring its work to a successful conclusion.</p>
