   <p>The Chicago Evening American, which up to the present has given little attention to our affairs, printed an article in last night's issue in which it says in particular:</p>
   <p>"On the last day but one of the War Exposition, residents of the Czech settlement marched to the Statue of Liberty, where Secretary Lansing's message, informing them about the recognition of an independent Czechoslovak nation, was read.....[A description of the celebration, and ethnographical data on the Czechoslovak nation and its history follows.]</p>
   <p>"....President Wilson's declaration became the beacon light for them: 'We are going to fight for what is nearest to our hearts.'--And the Czechoslovak flag in the parade proclaimed: 'We shall fight for the high ideals of our president.'</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"A famous Frenchman once said that every people will get that liberty for which it fights and which it deserves. Czechs have battled for centuries to uphold their ideals in an unequal struggle. No wonder they rejoice over their reward."</p>
