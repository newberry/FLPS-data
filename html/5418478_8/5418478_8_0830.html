   <p>The Bohemian Sokolists, (for whom we can not use the German term turners, out of regard for our German Turn brotherhood), have returned from the trip to their native land. In their possession is a valuable garnet brought from Prague and intended as a gift to Mrs. Cleveland as a token of their most humble respect. The garnet, which is in the safe-keeping of Adolph Kostner, will be sent to Mrs. Cleveland this week, unless the Bohemian Turners decide to dispose of the precious stone in some other way.</p>
