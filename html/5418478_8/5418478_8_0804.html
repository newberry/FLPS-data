   <p>p. 1.. The Bohemians in Prague enjoyed the excellent smoked meats donated by Mr. Bohous Mak, whose business is located at Laflin Street and 18th Place. The well known dealer in smoked meats, Mr. Joseph Vesely, from Prague, was advised, while here on the 5th Bohemian-American Sokols meet, to introduce to Prague the excellent smoked assorted meats produced by Mr. Bohous Mak. This made Mr. Joseph Vesely anxious to acquaint himself with his Chicago colleague.</p>
   <p>The result was that he ordered about 200 pounds of these excellent smoked meats and salami sausages. Mr. Hak did not accept this as an order, but donated this merchandise instead. Perhaps now no one will assert that here in America we have not as good a quality of smoked meats as those they have in Prague. We can proudly say they are as good, or maybe even better, than those produced in Prague.</p>
