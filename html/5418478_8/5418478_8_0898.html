   <p>It is an honest pride which a national group in the United States feels when by its presence in the great melting pot it has contributed values to the character of the whole nation. Among the traits most appreciated in America are perseverance, assiduousness and undaunted spirit. The New York University incorporated these three virtues into its motto as far back as eighty-five years ago. How this sentiment has permeated the whole country is best shown in the completion of the Panama Canal, the creation of which had met with innumerable obstacles, which were overcome by American pertinacity. The Czech people have always counted obstinacy and resoluteness as its national characteristics, and so proven itself as a valuable increment to the American nation.</p>
   <p>The building, 1333-1339 South Ashland Avenue, houses the big business which is founded and headed by the most outstanding Czech-American industrial chemist, Josef Triner. He succeeded in creating his establishment, <span class="page-break">\2</span>the chemical laboratory, through his spirit which could not be dampened by reverses, some of them threatening his enterprise with the violence of a tornado. Today, after thirty-seven years, the Triner Chemical Laboratory stands on a firm basis.</p>
   <p>Josef Triner was born in 1861 in Kacerov near Kralovice, Bohemia. He went to school in Kladno, then to high school in Slana. He would have continued his studies, but the means of his parents being limited, he came to Chicago with his father and mother in 1879, and has been a resident here ever since. After having moved through various occupations, he finally introduced into the market his specialty, Triner's "Bitter Wine." In the ensuing business activity, he found the proper outlet for his mercantile ambitions. He also improved the quality and the usefullness of his product, the curative and restorative powers of which were recognized and acknowledged by the authorities in Washington, D. C., so that his wine was permitted to be sold as a medical remedy without a license.</p>

   <p>In due course of time, Mr. Triner succeeded in having other remedies admitted; namely, Triner's Angelica Bitter, Triner's Liniment, Cough Remedy, Red Pills, Triner's Aromatic Liquid Extract, and others.</p>
   <p>The founder of the business supports every decent Czech enterprise. He is a member of the C. S. P. S. (Czecho-Slovak Aid Society), the Taborites, Forresters, Czech Beseda, etc. He was treasurer of the Cesko Americka Slovanska Rada (Czech-American National Council), Illinois Manufacturers' Association, Illinois Athletic Club, holds a life-membership in the Press Club, and the Art Institute; and he is also a 32nd degree Mason.</p>
   <p>Mr. Triner is married, his wife Mrs. Katherine Triner, nee Wecker, gave his four daughters, and two sons. One of the latter died in the prime of life; the other, Joseph Triner, Jr., is a student at Columbia University, New York, studying medicine and pharmacology.</p>
