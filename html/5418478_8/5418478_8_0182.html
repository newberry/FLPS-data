   <p>The well-known Bohemian banker, Mr. James F. Stepina, received a rare distinction recently. The Jugoslav government, in appreciation of Mr. Stepina's distinguished services rendered to our sister nation, Jugoslavia, particularly during the war, conferred upon him an order of merit, the distinguished Service Cross of Mercy. Mr. Stepina is the only Bohemian in the United States who has thus been honored. To celebrate the occasion, his friends have arranged a banquet in his honor which will take place tomorrow at 6:30 P.M. in the Hotel La Salle. Many countrymen as well as leading citizens of other foreign-language groups will participate in the celebration.</p>
