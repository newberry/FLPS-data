   <p>The Czechoslovak army has not only won respect and admiration for our nation, but it has also fought and won for our homeland, recognition as an independent Czechoslovak state with its own provisional government, the Czechoslovak National Council, headed by Professor T. G. Masaryk. In addition the military efficiency of the Czechoslovak army has forced Austria to sue for a separate peace. This is an establisned fact. Our next purpose must be to preserve the advantages won, and to multiply them. This will be possible only when every Czechoslovak between the ages of 18 and 45 years is willing to do his duty!</p>
   <p>Our Czechoslovak army does not recruit any soldiers for Russia now, since our military force there is sufficiently strong and has discharged itself of its task very well. The part of our army fighting on the Italian front need not be supplemented, for it draws its reserves from Czechoslovak lands, and <span class="page-break">2</span>directly from the Austro-Hungarian army [by soldiers who desert and offer their services to the Allies]. The Czechoslovak army fighting in France needs to be strengthened. Some of these are from the Russian battlefields, some from the Austro-Hungarian armies, and others are volunteers from America. That is not enough. Many more are expected from the Czechoslovak branch in America.</p>
   <p>Czechoslovaks in the old country have furnished soldiers for two fronts, the Russian and Italian, and in part for the French front. We have a complete army in Russia, one corps in Italy, and in France, for the time being, three regiments.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak army, and its soldiers in France, expects us to do our duty and send several more regiments. If Czechoslovaks in America will not heed the call, then we will have to get soldiers from somewhere else. We absolutely must have in France at least one army corps, in order to preserve our prestige there. Several regiments are needed to make up a Czechoslovak corps.</p>

   <p>American Czechoslovaks, don't forget your duty! All those who are signing up now, and those who signed up last year, should be ready to leave for the training camp. You should report to the nearest recruiting station. If none is in your town, send notice to the main recruiting bureau: Czechoslovak Army, 154 Nassau Street, New York, New York. You will thereby be performing an honorable duty.</p>
   <p>Here are some examples [of men who did not keep their promise]: A well-known member of the Sokol lives in Chicago--he hails from Moravia and signed up for the Czechoslovak army one year ago--and now he has a sore leg.....</p>
   <p>Another example: A student of the University of Chicago signed up here for the Czechoslovak army. The London, England, branch of the Czech National Alliance had paid the expense of his voyage to America. All members of the London branch of the Alliance are now at the front, or at least in uniform, but our university student who received his education on the money furnished by Czech America, and who enlisted last year, has not yet kept his word of honor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Another man, one from the intelligentsia, who taught in Czech Chicago schools, signed up last year, but has not yet redeemed his pledge.</p>
   <p>If anyone who has signed up happens to fall sick, he ought to submit to an examination by our doctor, who will surely release him from his promise if circumstances warrant it. Do not allow your self to become a deserter. The names of those who have singed up as volunteers are kept in our military records, which are preserved as documents for the future. Don't allow your name to become known as one whose bearer broke his promise, while all of our able-bodied men served in the army and fought for both the Czechoslovak and the American nations.</p>
   <p>Those who know fellow countrymen between the ages of 18 and 45 should approach them and urge them to be mindful of their duty. Of course, only noncitizen Czechoslovaks are eligible for our army. Let Czechoslovak-Americans become famous on the French front!</p>
