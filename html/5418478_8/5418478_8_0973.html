   <p>Merciless death again mowed down one of the young workers in the national field, and thereby took him from the arms of his beloved family at a time when, after hard work, his duties were easing somewhat. B. E. Janovsky was truly a self-made man. As a 17 year old youth, dependent only upon himself employed in the stockyards, in a relatively short time he became the owner of a print shop, a Notary Public and an Insurance Agent, with a successful business.</p>
   <p>He came to America in the year 1887 from Vlatne, Cechach, (Bohemia). He worked in the stockyards and the theatre introduced him into the national life. He first took part in the play "Zibot Za Pritele" (Life For A Friend). He became acquainted with Mr. J. B. Benes, who at that time began to publish in the Town of Lake "Ozvenu" (Echo). He visited him after work and learned to set type. From then on there probably was not a simple theatrical performance in which he did not take part. Here his talents were recognized <span class="page-break">\2</span>and his acquaintance enlarged.</p>
   <p>When he reached his majority he did not idle, but became a citizen and took an active interest in politics and here, also, he gained many friends.</p>
   <p>He opened a print shop in the "Town of Lake" at 4659 Gross Avenue, which property he bought with his brother, Karl, who learned to set type, and together they conducted a printing business. He also attempted to found a weekly and published four number of "Novomestskych Listu" (New City Paper), but means were insufficient for further publication. In spite of that, he always had it in mind.</p>
   <p>Vlastenec Lodge No. 142 C.S.P.S. (Czechoslovak Benefit Society) was represented by him in the Grand Lodge of Illinois and at the Detroit Convention. He was secretary of the National Grand Lodge of the Labor Society. He was also secretary of the New City Building and Loan Association. </p>
