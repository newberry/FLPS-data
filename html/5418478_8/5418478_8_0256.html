   <p>The directors of the Pilsen Brewery Association donated the sum of two hundred dollars for a gift of honor to Professor Thomas G. Masaryk. This Bohemian enterprise, which during the World War liberally contributed to the cause of Czech liberation, is the first one again to bring its contribution for a gift of honor to Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, and by doing so, sets an example for the rest of our enterprises and institutions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ervin E. Weil, 3321 West 26th Street, contributed for the same cause the sum of one thousand Czechoslovakian kronen.</p>
