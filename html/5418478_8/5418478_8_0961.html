   <p>P.1, Col.3--After a stay in Bohemia lasting about a year Dr. F. J. Fara, returned with his family and will resume his practice.</p>
   <p>We are convinced his patients who know his wide professiorial experience and his friendly demeanor will not fail to remember him when they are in need of medical aid. His home office is located on Clifton Park Ave., and West 26th St., and his business office will be located in Mr. Honsik's Drug Store on West 26th St., and Turner Ave.</p>
   <p>Dr. Fara, did not go to Bohemia for pleasure. He sought to improve himself in his profession, to which he is dedicated whole-heartedly.</p>
   <p>He visited various clinics to widen his knowledge of surgery, and also visited universities in Prague and Vienna.</p>
