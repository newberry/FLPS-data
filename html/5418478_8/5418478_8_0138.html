   <p>[The daily press of Prague mentioned the three Czechoslovak-American expeditions, two of which were composed of Chicago Czechoslovaks. Among other, not strictly relevant, remarks, the fact is mentioned that many of the visitors who came from the United States had not seen their old country for 30, 40, and even 60 years. Much space is taken up with reports on the various charitable deeds of the Chicago organizations for the benefit of Czechoslovakia. Eight of the outstanding Czech leaders of Chicago are mentioned. The gifts amounted to 125,000 Czech crowns.</p>
