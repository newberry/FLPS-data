   <p>The large Bohemian Community of Chicago has lost one of its pioneers, a man prominent and active in national and political life. He will be mourned and remain in the memory of everyone who has known him. Mr. Baumrucker died yesterday at 6 A. M. after a prolonged sickness, confined to his bed for a long time.</p>
   <p>Every Bohemian in Chicago received with sorrow the news of the death of a man who possessed the complete confidence of Chicago's Bohemians. He will be buried in the National Bohemian Cemetery. He died at 53 years of age. He was born in O<span class="gap">[gap]</span>lta in Bohemia, and came to the United States in 1867. He opened a tailor shop in partnership with Mr. Klipal, starting on Canal Street, and then moving to W. 19th Street. Mr. Baumrucker was very active in social and political life. He participated with ardor in the Socialistic movements. He struggled all his life to gain for the working people all possible privileges and necessary representation in politics. His only ambition was to improve the situation of Bohemian workers.</p>

   <p>Afterward, when the socialistic party collapsed, Baumrucker joined the Democratic party and adhered to it because he was convinced that this party would protect the working mass.</p>
   <p>In 1894, Mr. Baumrucker was nominated postmaster of the Lawndale Station, keeping this position until the end of his life.</p>
