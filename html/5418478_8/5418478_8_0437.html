   <p>The Czech National Alliance sent an appeal to all Czech Aid societies in the United States asking them to pass a bylaw according to which every member of each lodge is to pledge himself to pay five cents per month as a national "head tax". The money thus collected will be used for patriotic purposes in the pursuit of one aim, i.e. the liberation of Czechoslovak lands from Austro-Hungarian rule. Hardly had the appeal begun to circulate when there poured in reports which demonstrate that not less than forty-seven lodges will be glad to impose the tax upon their members. A similar response came from Sokol societies.</p>
   <p>All other Czech organizations will be asked to do likewise, and are expected to join wholeheartedly. The Czech National Alliance in introducing the head tax does not intend to burden associations, Sokol groups, aid societies, or educational or singing clubs that are unwilling to make the contribution. What is asked of them cannot in any way compare with the sacrifices made by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the Czechoslovak volunteers of America, or recruits of the Czechoslovak army in France and Russia. Everyone is only asked to do what he feels to be his duty.</p>
