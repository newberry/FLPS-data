   <p>The nationals of all the countries that are affected by the European war are working here feverishly for their brothers abroad, trying to help them to victory if they are belligerents, or alleviating their suffering if they are in distress. The Germans are, as always, the most diligent ones, sending enormous sums of money to Germany, and helping in the promotion of German interests here and abroad even though their work is detrimental to our own great Republic. The Italians, the French, and the British, all do their patriotic duty, and so do the Serbians, Montenegrens, and the rest of them. But we Bohemians, after a somewhat weak initial spurt at the beginning of the war, have slackened down a great deal, and there is danger that when our help is most needed, our indifference may become complete. Some say we cannot help this because such is our unfortunate natural character that our enthusiasm catches fire rapidly, like a sheaf of straw, but burns out just as rapidly. They say we have not enough energy, endurance, unselfishness--those qualities which ensure real success in the life of a nation. But, of course, we do not want to admit this, and we cannot admit it because, if it were true, it would mean the death sentence of our country.</p>
   <p>In these great historic times every nation must make the greatest sacrifices, every nation is required to furnish the strongest proofs of its ability, energy, and will to live, of its justification to continued existence. Not even the Bohemian nation will be given anything it does not deserve. We want to believe that our brothers in the old country are doing all they can in this respect. But that certainly is not the case in regard to the Bohemians in America.</p>
