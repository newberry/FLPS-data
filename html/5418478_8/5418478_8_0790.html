   <p>p. 1-col.7--Bohemian-Americans will surely receive with satisfaction the report that one of the best Bohemian theatrical companies, known as the Prochazka Male Artist Ensemble, is preparing itself for a tour of America.</p>
   <p>We have been informed that this company will arrive here to play during the next season.</p>
   <p>The company has already selected its repertoire for the tour, composed of plays which have been successfully performed upon the Bohemian stage. The company promises to show us how far Bohemian dramatic art has progressed, and its members, aware of the importance of such a task, are preparing themselves for it with confidence and enthusiasm.</p>

   <p>Our readers will be interested to learn that one member of the troupe was formerly an amateur actor and also a reporter for this paper--Mr. Frant. Kovarik. Mr. Kovarik was a distinguished actor and devoted to Bohemian drama.</p>
   <p>For this reason he traveled to Bohemia to become a professional actor.</p>
   <p>The company plans to produce about seven plays in Chicago and several in New York, Cleveland, and cities west of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We have been asked by the management of this company to extend an invitation to all those who can aid, as for instance in the providing of halls or other premises suitable for the production of plays.</p>
   <p>Any one who would like to do something to help in this matter should communicate with the secretary of the Jirkovsky-Herein Theatrical Company in Prague.</p>
