   <p>Professor Thomas G. Masaryk's sojourn in Chicago was of short duration. He came last Sunday afternoon and was given a tumultuous, magnificent welcome incomparable to anything heretofore witnessed in our community. This morning he left Chicago on his way to Washington, D. C. where the most important duties call him.</p>
   <p>At the capital he will enter an ardent plea before the most influential authorities in behalf of Czechoslovak independence. He worked for this cause in an identical manner in Paris, London, Russia, and other cities and countries. Professor Masaryk will present our government circles with the most reliable information about the conditions in Austria with which he is more intimately acquainted than anyone else. The length of his stay in Washington is not definite; it may stretch over several weeks.</p>
   <p>Since the Professor will not be in a position, until he returns, to give his <span class="page-break">2</span>fellow countrymen here an outline of the work accomplished by him during the past several years, he called representatives of the press yesterday to express his appreciation for the reception accorded him by the public. This intimate interview took place in the Blackstone Hotel where Professor Masaryk was stopping, and where he received a great many distinguished visitors in spite of the limited time. Those who paid him this call could not help noticing a certain fatigue about the aged man, unquestionably the effect of the many interviews he granted. Nevertheless he devoted a full hour to us, an hour of friendly confabulation that will ever belong to our most precious memories. Present at the interview were Jindrich (Henry) Ort for the Denni Hlasatel, A. V. Geringer and R. J. Psenka for Svornost, Thomas Kraus for Narod, and J. Novak for Spravedlnost. Attorney Karel (Charles) Pergler, the Professor's inseparable companion on his American tour was also present. Just before the group of Czech-American journalists entered, Professor William R. Harper, of the University of Chicago, had made a call.</p>
   <p>As mentioned before, our visit took on an informal character, and can hardly be <span class="page-break">3</span>classified as a typical interview. Masaryk comes to us as a statesman on an important diplomatic mission, and is, consequently, reluctant to answer certain questions. What Masaryk imparted to us was no more or less than a handful of reminiscences from his propaganda work of several years devoted to our ideals and cause. Some of them were known to us and had appeared in the columns of our papers before. Masaryk declined, at least for the time being, to play the part of a source of information. He desired, on the contrary, to obtain directive information on various details to serve him when in Washington.</p>
   <p>And right here his attention was called to a movement which is ever growing, and the ultimate aim of which is nothing less than the suppression of all foreign-language newspapers. Professor Masaryk was entreated by us to oppose this movement with the entire weight of his influence. There can be no doubt about the vigor, and the virulent character of this movement. It was propagated by the Chicago attorney, Levy Mayer, at the governors' conference in New York, and by United States Senator King, from Utah, who is preparing to propose a similar law. Masaryk's attitude on this question is purely rational. He believes in rigorous <span class="page-break">4</span>censorship of the press in France, England, and the United States as well. At the same time he supposes that the government recognizes the valuable service rendered by the loyal foreign-language press which forms a bridge between the government and an overwhelming majority of the immigrant element. He assured his visitors that he would do his utmost to bring clarity to the viewpoint of the highest government circles in Washington.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk then spoke of our own Czechoslovak Army, on which his activity is especially concentrated. What he chose to reveal was extremely interesting. Most of our volunteers, of which this army is composed, are in Russia at present. There were fully 50,000 in that country, all of them eagerly expecting to be transported to the battlefields of France. Meantime this number has surely increased by another 50,000. The majority of the volunteers are former prisoners of war taken by the Russians from the Austro-Hungarian Army. In Italy, also, there are about 20,000 Czech volunteers. How many of them have been transferred to France by now cannot be definitely stated at this moment. Should Masaryk succeed in providing means for the transportation of volunteers, we could, <span class="page-break">5</span>within a short time, boast of having several brigades in France. To achieve this is one of the primary aims of Professor Masaryk's propaganda tour in the United States. The Allied governments have cheerfully agreed to pay for the upkeep of this army.</p>
   <p>The political action for the transfer of our volunteers must be financed by voluntary contributions. Political action without funds is unthinkable. The Allies have, true enough, proffered financial aid to Masaryk. This was done indirectly, in editorials, booklets, and other journalistic media. Masaryk, however, declined the offer. He felt instinctively that to accept would damage rather than benefit our cause. The heavier the sacrifices on our part, the more we will be justified in our demands at the peace conference. The Czechoslovak Army in Russia presented more difficulties than could be perceived at first glance, we were told....</p>
   <p>The Professor continued by giving us a brief description of the method and procedure by which Czech soldiers in the Austrian Army went over to the Italians <span class="page-break">6</span>and Russians....On one of these occasions Captain Fierlinger, then in the Czechoslovak Army, "captured" his own brother who wore the Austrian uniform.....The narration volunteered by Professor Masaryk absorbed the rapt attention of the journalists. They regret that they cannot let the public know everything that was said. Our leader asked the co-operation of the press, emphasizing, however, "that behind every line that is printed, the cruel and tyrannical methods employed by the Austrian government against the people that seeks liberty should be branded and pilloried as such".....</p>
   <p>A painful, dolorous chapter from the account of sufferings was touched when the Professor spoke of his daughter Alice who had been kept in jail for months. The only reason that the Austrian government did not go to the extreme limit of punishing her for the "high treason" with which her father was charged is to be ascribed to the protest by American women, led by Miss Mary McDowell, well-known settlement social worker of the University of Chicago. In the face of their manifesto of indignation, even the Austrian government, which knows neither shame nor mercy, had to capitulate.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>It was almost 8 P. M. when we parted from the aged man whose work will be properly appreciated some time after the war is over. When we put to him a last question, asking what else might be done toward Czechoslovak independence, he answered in the manner which is peculiarly his own: "Work along as you have up to the present or, rather, work still more persistently. Be good Czechoslovaks, and especially, be good Americans. These two conceptions must be identified in you."</p>
   <p>Thus speaks Masaryk.</p>
