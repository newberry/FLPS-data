   <p>Chicago, November 11, 1914.</p>
   <p>A news article reaching the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar from London tells about the difficult situation of Bohemians settled in Great Britain caused by the fact that the British authorities, in contrast to the French, do not recognize any difference between "Austrians" and members of the Bohemian nation. The Bohemians have always cherished sincere feelings of friendship toward England, and the only reason that the cordial relations of Bohemians and Britons of high standing have now been forgotten seem to be military precautions. Such events as the exceptionally cordial reception of Lord Mayor Strong of London and forty London aldermen at the City Hall of Prague, two years ago. and the subsequent welcome accorded the Bohemian delegation <span class="page-break">2</span>consisting of the Mayor of the city of Prague and a number of Prague aldermen at the City Hall of London, remain a pleasant memory. Therefore, it is to be supposed that the present provisions against Bohemians in England--obviated by the war--will be removed as soon as the necessary explanations are made, and that the Bohemians in England will soon enjoy the same privileges as have been accorded them by both the civil and military authorities of the French government. To this end, a conference was held Wednesday afternoon between the president of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar, Mr. James F. Stepina, and the British Consul in Chicago. The conference, after a thorough analysis and discussion of the question, resulted in a telegraphed communication to the British diplomatic representative in Washington, and direct intercession with the British government in London. We are glad to state that the British Consul General, Mr. Horace Dickinson Nuget, has taken up this matter with a great deal of understanding and assured the president of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar of his whole-hearted support. This step, made with the agreement of the Bohemian National Alliance will no doubt result not only in the betterment of our countrymen's conditions in Great Britain, but also in <span class="page-break">3</span>calling Great Britain's attention to the position taken by the French government on the Bohemian question, a circumstance of the utmost importance under present conditions, and absolutely indispensable for steps to be taken by us in the future.</p>
   <p>It is up to our public to give the necessary support to the work that the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar is doing on behalf and by order of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni. This support will enable the Tiskova Kancelar to fulfill its mission in these fateful days for our nation. </p>
   <p>The telegram sent by the president of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar to the diplomatic representative of Great Britain in Washington reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"To His Excellency, Ambassador Spring-Rice, Washington, D. C.:</p>
   <p>"According to information we have received, our Bohemian countrymen in <span class="page-break">4</span>London are considered as enemies of the British Crown. They are, as Austrians, held under police supervision in spite of the fact that they are in reality absolutely against the Austrian government. This is proved by the fact that thirty-one of them have left London in British uniforms which they bought with their own money, and have joined the French army in order to fight against Germany and Austria.</p>
   <p>"Four hundred Bohemians in Paris have joined the French army as volunteers, although they are not French citizens. The Bohemians in France and Russia are not considered enemies of these countries and continue enjoying the same freedom as they did prior to the war.</p>
   <p>"Our organization will take the liberty of presenting to your Excellency, through the British Consulate General in Chicago, certain letters we have received from Europe, together with an appeal for the benefit of Bohemians living in England. A delegation representing the Bohemian-American Committee <span class="page-break">5</span>of New York as well as our own organization will call at the British Embassy in Washington, Friday, in order to present these documents to your Excellency.</p>
   <p>"May we ask your Excellency to give this matter your kind attention.</p>
   <p>"The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni Vamerice</p>
   <p>"Dr. Ludvik Fisher, president,</p>
   <p>"A. G. Melichar, secretary.</p>
   <p>"The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar</p>
   <p>"J. F. Stepina, president,</p>
   <p>"J. Psenka secretary."</p>
   <p>Simultaneously with the dispatching of this telegram a wire was sent to the Bohemian-American Committee of New York, which had advised us of its proposed intercession in Washington, requesting the Committee to instruct its delegates to represent also the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe and the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar. In this way the action will assume the proper importance and meaning, and show that the Bohemians in America act voluntarily and in unison.</p>
