   <p>President Wilson has ordered the arrest of one Rudolf Malik, Bohemian born but of Austrian conviction, because of writing an indecent letter to the President. Well, we could put in jail dozens of people who berate us because of our stand toward the Austrian Emperor, and send their letters by mail. But why should we do harm to these poor souls. No such letters can get us angry or excited. We remain calm and composed and put them aside.</p>
