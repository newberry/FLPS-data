   <p>P.1--The well known singers, organized into the Bohemian Vocal Quartet, who came back to us again after three years, from old "Mother Prague," through their appearance yesterday, at once gained the friendship and sympathy of the public. Everyone, who heard the singers three years ago, and with them many of their friends, came to the concert, which we held in Czechoslovak Hall at 588 W. 18th St. If the Bohemian Vocal Quartet gained favor among us with their first appearance, they increased it this time. The entire program was carried through with the greatest success and for that reason the hall echoed with thunderous applause after each appearance.</p>
   <p>We must admit that our guests have doubled their popularity through yesterday's appearance and we hope, that we shall hear them again several times, before they depart from our "American Prague" (Chicago). Everyone of us.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>yearns for those old beautiful folk-songs, and our singers have not sung all of them for us, as yet.</p>
   <p>We are informed, that the Bohemian Vocal Quartet will appear in our "Ceska California," however. We expect that afterward, they will appear in our "Pilsen" once more. Yesterday's entertainment was an enjoyable affair. Let us hope, we shall have the same pleasure a few more times, while the Bohemian Quartet sojourns among us.</p>
