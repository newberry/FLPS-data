   <p>A certain lady who desires to remain anonymous and who has recently returned from the old country where she had had an opportunity to follow the developments ever since the beginning of the war has intimated to us in a conversation a number of interesting observations which we do not hesitate to pass on to our public. We do so after a thorough deliberation and careful consideration of all we have been told. What follows is not our opinion, but a true reproduction of what we have heard from her. The subject matter is so important that we consider it imperative to divulge it for the purpose of general information and discussion. It refers to conditions in the old country and to our action, particularly our political action conducted here in behalf of the land where our cradle stood in Europe.</p>
   <p>It seems that the people in Bohemia are not pleased with everything we have been doing here in America. The political action, which no doubt, is <span class="page-break">\2</span>conducted with the best of intentions, is reported to us as having, so far, done more harm than good over there. The people of Bohemia are of the opinion that there is not enough deliberation behind our actions, that we do things with undue haste, and that we do too much talking rather than acting. Our action is said to have dragged the names of many people in Bohemia into public discussion by the press, and these people are now paying for it in being subject to the agonies of Austrian persecution. Austrian political authorities in the old country, it is said, are very well informed about everything that goes on here. And that is very detrimental. They know all about our political action, and the authorities.</p>
   <p>The idea seems to be that we here in America should act wisely and with proper deliberation because any hasty act, no matter how trifling it may be considered on this side of the Ocean, is liable to cause damage the magnitude of which we cannot possibly have any conception. Less talking and more doing should be our slogan. Boasting cannot do any good and does a lot of damage. What is needed is deeds--deeds of truly deliberate, serious, men <span class="page-break">\3</span>and women who are fully aware of what they are doing and know how to proceed in order to be helpful to the old country, rather than deeds of people whose lack of perspicacity causes damage. The lady in question has talked with many prominent Bohemian political leaders. All of them approve of Professor Masaryk's activities because they do not doubt his honesty. They suggest, however, that we should be careful how we spend the money we collect, and that we see to it that that money goes principally to the Bohemian nation, because it is the Bohemian nation that is, and must remain, the first concern of American Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The lady also said that Bohemians in the old country would like to be sure that the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) is really an organization of just such character as it is believed to be in Bohemia. But they want more deeds. All they have seen there are many solicitations of funds and readiness to send the money to the right place at the proper time.</p>
   <p>Our visitor told us also, after considerable hesitation, that she herself <span class="page-break">\4</span>had almost become one of the victims of the Bohemian-American lack of perspicacity. Also she was being persecuted by Austrian authorities who went so far as to threaten her with inprisonment. Believing that that lady could render them good and important services, they urged her to promise them to become their spy in the place where she resided at that time, and later on also in America, in which case they would discontinue their persecution. Of course, our lady gave them an angry and most emphatic refusal. This offer has been repeated several times with great urgency, and just as many times refused, finally with the remark that they should deal with her just as they deal with other people in similar cases and in full accord with their famous methods of persecution. Some of the lady's friends urged her to give in--seemingly at least--to the authorities. It took a long time and much money before she succeeded in escaping from the old and return free to her new country. She has come back with a definite mission which she will carry out in all details, particularly in regard to the Narodni Sdruzeni. That mission is the <span class="page-break">\5</span>reason why she wants to keep her identity a secret. If it became known it would do harm not only to herself but also, and more particularly, to those whose company she had kept in the old country.</p>
   <p>While still in Bohemia, she had heard and read that the Bohemians in America wonder why there was no revolution in Bohemia the minute the war broke out. She had to smile, she said. They do not want a revolution in the old country, because they know that it would fail. They know the Austrian government only too well and know that it had expected and was prepared for a revolution in Bohemia, and that the fact that it did not occur was a sad disappointment for Austria. A revolution would have been nipped in the bud, not only by her own German and Magyar regiments that are stationed everywhere that the outbreak of revolution had been expected, but also by parts of the German army that were standing ready for just that emergency. For these reasons the people remained quiet and even went so far as to offer help in the form of hospitals, which are now the most serious concern of a large majority of the Bohemian people. The people do not <span class="page-break">\6</span>want to give the government the slightest cause for any kind of intervention, because the war is quite enough of a catastrophe and a sufficient source of misery and sorrow for them.</p>
   <p>Otherwise she was not very communicative in regard to conditions over there. All she said was that the living is very expensive in the old country and that a great deficiency, even absence, of all foodstuffs and other commodities is expected very soon. Prices are extremely high and there are cases where a person who has the money to spend is unable to buy what he wants. Daily there are sad and pathetic scenes in front of shops where victuals are sold and which are under the supervision of the city and the military authorities. Similar scenes occur in front of the places where the so-called "bread cards" of unhappy renown are being issued to the people, and in front of bakeries where they are exchanged--with the addition of money--for bread. The old country has an altogether different appearence from what it used to have. It resembles an immense hospital into which a steady stream of freshly wounded soldiers is flowing and on whose grounds <span class="page-break">\7</span>convalescents try to recapture their health by walks in the fresh air. But what a sight the majority of these convalescents offer! Many are without arms, legs, and other parts of the body, cripples for life with the possibly sadest outlook into the future. And these are all over, in cities, towns, down to the smallest villages.</p>
