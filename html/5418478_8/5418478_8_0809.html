   <p>P.1--Bohemian artistic circles will surely welcom with pleasure the arrival of Frant. Kuchynka, contrabasso, who for a period of five years was a valued and famous member of the National Bohemian Theatre orchestra. Mr. Kuchynka came to Chicago directly from Prague, last Sunday. He was invited to come here by his former conservatory fellow-student, the well known artist, Mr. Jiskra. Mr. Kuchynka honored the editorial department of this paper by his visit, in the company of the virtuoso Mr. Machka. He is an intelligent young man, who sharply criticizes conditions in the old country, and there is no doubt, that he will quickly adjust himself to local conditions. That he is a real artist is widely known and proven by many testimonials of which Mr. Kuchynka can boast. He has testimonials from the celebrated Otaker Sevcik, professor of violin at the renowned Prague Conservatory; form Oskar Nedbal, the celebrated conductor, from the conductor of the Bohemian National Theatre orchestra, Mr. Novsrevia, and from the orchestra leader of the German Theatre, of which Mr. Kuchynka was a member or two years. We are convinced that Mr. Kuchynka will secure in Chicago not only a good engagement, but a reputation in not such as he is entitled to</p>
