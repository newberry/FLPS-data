   <p>According to telegraphic news received here from London, England, Miss Alice Masaryk was set at liberty after two years in an Austrian prison. She is the daughter of Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, prominent leader in the political movement for the liberation of the Czecho-Slovak people.</p>
   <p>The report seems incomplete, and contains a note by the Austrian government to the effect that the young woman was released only on account of the illness of her mother. Miss Masaryk, like other Czech girls, had been imprisoned for no other reason than that her father was able to escape the clutches of the Austrian government.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Mary McDowell, a settlement co-worker of Miss Masaryk, was the recipent of the message, as she was known to have taken an interest in the vicissitudes in the life of the girl. The two have been acquainted for several years, and were active in the University of Chicago Settlement.</p>
