   <p>Mr. William Kasper, founder and president of the Kaspar State Bank, passed away yesterday, and we perceive with sadness the thinning ranks of our pioneers. After difficult but successful careers they leave, one by one: but they leave to their progeny and their countrymen shining examples of perseverance, industry, enterprise, and all the other beautiful virtues which adorned their character.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the oldest Bohemian pioneer, both as regards age and length of sojourn in this land, was Mr. William Kaspar. He was one of the most successful of our countrymen, for he founded a strong banking institution which had the full confidence of the entire [Czech] colony, commanding the respect of the highest financial circles in the United States. Everyone who knew Mr. Kaspar and who <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>had the opportunity of meeting him frequently, wondered at his physical buoyancy and his mental alertness, both of which traits Mr. Kaspar retained till they very end of his life. His personality and that of his bank seemed to have fused into one. Being a farseeing man and bearing in mind, therefore, the possibility of a disorganizing shock which the institution would suffer by his sudden demise, he entrusted the direction of all business to his son, Mr. Otto Kaspar, five years ago. Thus Mr. Otto Kaspar not only became a vice-president of this bank, but also the president of the board of directors. During that five-year interim Mr. Otto Kaspar learned to hold the reins of the government of his bank and will now continue to be its head.</p>
   <p>Although Mr. William Kaspar unloaded the heaviest burden of management upon the shoulders of his son, he continued to work in the bank; his pleasant smile greeted every customer. Everyone will miss that smile; everyone will bear painfully the loss of the old gentlemen; everyone will miss his smiling face and his sincers handclasp as well as his friendly discourses. His leaving produced a niche in the old institution, a niche which will be difficult to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>fill. But as regards all the business matters, these shall continue to be handled by Mr. Otto Kasper, handled in the same able and strictly honest manner as was the wont of the old gentleman.</p>
   <p>The death of Mr. William Kasper occurred last night at 8:45 P. M. at his residence, 3234 West Washington Boulevard. It was reallty an imperceptible transition from a temporal sleep to an eternal one. His ailment lasted only four days, and his demise will therefore shock our entire public: for outside of the immediate family no one imagined that his condition was so serious. It was only recently that most of us either saw him or spoke with him, and none of us saw any signs of an approaching physical breakdown.</p>
   <p>The biography of Mr. William Kaspar contains many interesting and enlightening features and should be recorded in detail to leave an example for all future generations. Mr. William Kaspar was born in the town of Holice, Bohemia, on September 1, 1835; he died at the age of eighty-seven years and two months. He came to the United States as an eighteen-year-old lad in 1853. A remarkable.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>coincidence is the fact that his foot touched the soil of his new homeland on November 2, that is, on the day of the month that, sixty-nine years later, he journeyed to eternity.</p>
   <p>Young William Kaspar settled in the East, in Massachusetts. Chicago at that time had not yet become attractive to the immigrants. He worked in Boston and in other cities. In September. 1862, he joined the Union Army as a man of twenty-seven years to fight for the preservation of the Union. He was assigned to the Fourth Massachusetts Infantry Regiment and with it was sent to Louisiana, in the vicinity of New Orleans. His military service ended in August. 1863, when he was honorably discharged as a sergeant and an invalid. During an assault on Fort Hudson, June 14, 1863, he was badly wounded and later declared unfit for further military service.</p>
   <p>He came to Chicago in 1864. Here he found a flourishing Bohemian settlement which he joined and in which he tried to utilize his knowledge of language and conditions, both of which he gained during his eleven-year stay in the East <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>and in military service. He started out as a grocer, and there are several countrymen who still remembers his grocery store on Canal Street and De Koven Street. Even in those days he became the confidant of many countrymen who, looking upon him as a man of experience and trust, asked him to guard their earnings. This induced him to open a private bank in August, 1888. He took as his partner Mr. John L. Karel, and the bank was managed under the firm name of Kaspar and Karel.</p>
   <p>In 1905 Mr. Kaspar caused his bank to be incorporated as a state institution, thus insuring its brilliant future. Out of its humble beginnings it developed into an institution of many millions [of dollars], and Mr. Kaspar took care that it continue to grow even after his death.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kaspar was a good Bohemian; it was always easy to see what pleasure he derived from a Czech conversation. He contributed willingly to our national and charitable institutions. He leaves a wife, Pavla (nee Mandel), two sons, Otto and Eugene, and two married daughters. One of his granddaughters, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Miss Weisel, is to celebrate her wedding with the some of Mr. Janovsky of Town of Lake; the grandfather was anticipating this event with such great pleasure; alas, he did not live to be present at that wedding which, because of his death, must now be postooned. Two of his brothers and a sister also morn the departed one.</p>
   <p>Funeral services for Mr. William Kaspar will be held tomorrow, Saturday, at 2 P. M., at the Masonic Hall on Millard Avenue. The obsequies will be at the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov. (Bohemian National Cemetery). The undertaking establishment of Carmak and Kostecka will be in charge of the funeral.</p>
