One telegram read: "Heartfelt thanks for the manifestation of your interest and sincere wishes for an early realization of your legitimate hopes. - Bakhmeteff." The English embassy answered as follows: "I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your telegram in which you proclaim the gratitude of your organization for the attitude taken by us in regard to the Czecho-Slovaks.
