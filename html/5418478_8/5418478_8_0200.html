   <p>After several days' absence from Chicago, the party of our beloved overseas guests led by Brother Rudolf Bilek returned to us yesterday at nine o'clock in the morning. But they have not returned for any protracted stay: only for a short twenty-four hours.</p>
   <p>Their first trip, on their return to Chicago, was, of course, to the hall of Sokol Pilsen, where they were given every opportunity to spend the last hours in Chicago in the most agreeable way. In the afternoon they went to Lincoln Park but returned to the West Side in order to dine in Brother Placek's restaurant, and the evening saw them attending a farewell party with the general public at the Pilsen Park pavilion.....</p>
   <p>There was dancing to excellent music....until the early hours of the morning....</p>
