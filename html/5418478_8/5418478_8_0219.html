   <p>Friends! In the infinite where of life and the unrestrained flow of time, the hour when we celebrate the second anniversary of the "Declaration of Independence" of the Czechoslovak Republic is approaching again. This hour is celebrated by us as a result of our revolutionary work in Czechoslovak America; a sweet kiss of redemption after centuries of despair; a glowing sun of freedom after a long period of slavery; a dawn of our better future; a splendid fulfillment of the desires and dreams of our forefathers; a divine fulfillment of all our longings in days of bitterness; the highest ideal of free men and women and nations.</p>
   <p>Independence arrived at the moment when the predicted hour had struck and the prophecy of Jan Amos Komensky (Jan Amos Commenius), one of the noblest sons of our nation, was fulfilled: "I fully believe that after the tempest of wrath has passed, the rule of thy country will return to thee, oh Bohemian people!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>That for which our forefathers strove in vain for centuries; for which they sacrificed their lives; for which they fought and died--all that has been achieved. Bohemia, with sisterly Moravia and Silesia, has grasped the brotherly hand of Slovakia, discarded the shameful foreign yoke, and advanced its people to the ranks of free people of the world.</p>
   <p>The old Bohemian lion has risen again; the variegated Moravian eagle and the black Silesian eagle have spread their wings and flown to the Tatra Mountains where the cross of Slovakia glitters. The historic old flags again rustle in the breeze, bringing new life to our dear old colors, the white, red, and blue. Under these flags, behind their aged leader, marched our proud legions with whose blood our redemption was consecrated.</p>
   <p>The moment had arrived, the predicted hour had struck, and dreams and longings became realities. Fate favored us, poor, insignificant creatures that we were, and permitted us to witness this great day which our nation had dreamed of for three hundred years. It gave us the opportunity to live through this great change of the world which is becoming a milestone in world history, bringing <span class="page-break">\3</span>redemption and resurrection.</p>
   <p>It allowed us to put forth our best efforts and help truth and justice to conquer. Now we can co-operate in the establishment of a real world democracy.</p>
   <p>It is a memorable and glorious day in the history of our nation! It is our wish that each of thy anniversaries pour new strength into our hearts, invigorating the fainting enthusiasm of tired souls, kindling a new fire of love and generosity in indifferent hearts, purifying fanatic souls, and leading all those who are astray to the right road of perception, under the one and only flag.</p>
   <p>May thou be a glowing sun which, by its rays, pours a new enthusiasm and fervor into the hearts of all workers, that they do not break down, but continue to work upon the holy task of love!</p>
   <p>We greet thee, day of our freedom and the most glorious holiday of our hearts!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Let us hope that thy anniversaries will be countless!</p>
