   <p>P.1--The statements made about conditions in Bohemia by Dr. Rose Wistein, who has returned from a two-year visit to that country, were denied by Bohemian-Americans yesterday. Dr. Wistein traveled to her mother country for the purpose, as she said, of uplifting her sex there.</p>
   <p>"The women of Bohemia enjoy as many privileges and receive as much attention as American women," said Dr. J. F. Fara, of 3523 West Twenty-sixth Street. "I believe that the standard of morality in Bohemia is a little bit higher than in America."</p>
   <p>Frank Honsik, a druggist at 3335 West Twenty-sixth Street, said: "Our Bohemian women are renowned for their motherliness. Bohemian men do not treat their women any worse than do men of other nationalities."</p>
   <p>Even the American press has printed this report, and it thus becomes necessary <span class="page-break">\2</span>to point out that Bohemian men are not barbarians, as people of other nationalities might think that they were, since one of our own people has cast reflections upon our race. If some one who makes claims to leadership among us expresses a burning desire to aid the enslaved Bohemian women, he or she casts an unfair reflection upon our nationality before other nationalities, we are thereby represented as ignoramuses whose eyes have just been opened by our immigration to America. In Bohemia live thousands of educated and enlightened women, who have no need to travel to America to acquire intelligence. Their activities will surely suffice for the preservation and elevation of Bohemian women and of the Bohemian people, especially since they work quietly and do nothing of which they need to be ashamed before the people of other races.</p>
