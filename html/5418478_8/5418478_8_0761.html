   <p>Since the time of the first mass pilgrimage made by Bohemian-Americans to the land of their birth during the first half of the eighties when the so-called theatrical excursion was arranged, many such pilgrimages, important to all Bohemian people, have been enthusiastically undertaken on various occasions from America to the heart of Europe--the beautiful land of Bohemia. There have been Sokol excursions, the Centennial Jubilee Exhibition excursion, and the National Economic and Industrial Exhibition excursion. However, in none of those national pilgrimages did so many people take part as in this year's, which is unique in many ways. Every fellow countryman knows what the real inducement of this year's excursion is. During the last days of June and the beginning of July, a group of beautiful Sokol and national festivities will be held in our dear old Prague. There will be demonstrations <span class="page-break">2</span>at which Bohemians from all corners of the earth will be represented. Sokol youths in large numbers will come from places where sons of our nation live. They will be joined by other enthusiastic sons and daughters of our people in order to witness these grand exhibitions and evidences of strength not only of the Sokol movement, but also of the entire Bohemian people. The great ideas expressed by Tyrs and Fuegner will be embodied there. Thus, everyone will be convinced that our nation is alive and that its own typical national life is safeguarded, because in the healthy bodies of the Sokols, in all those members of our nation who have been raised according to the Sokol principles and who are enlightened and energetically proceeding toward a common goal, there lives and luxuriates a spirit which will not allow itself to be fettered by any unfriendly provision of the government or by any violence on the part of age-old enemies of the Bohemian people.</p>
   <p>Every good Bohemian will rejoice during the festive days about to take place in Prague, but the greatest and purest exultationwill fill the hearts of those Bohemian-American participants, members of our excursion, with whom we are now parting. For a long time, in Bohemia, we have been considered <span class="page-break">3</span>lost children of our common motherland. However, we have given them proof that we are alive and that we are growing, becoming more powerful; that we are a branch of the Bohemian stock which will not wither, but will bear fruit if only our national gardeners do not willfully cut us off from our common lifegiving national trunk and discard us.</p>
   <p>That a different opinion is held of the Bohemian-American branch than used to be the case is best proved by the visit of the Sokols about three years ago, by the expansion of the Narodni Rada (National Council) to America, and by the lively conduct of national and business contacts with us.</p>
   <p>Today we are recognized as an important national branch and this will be demonstrated in the welcome which will be given our pilgrims in Prague and also in the earnest explanation they give us of all our common plans and tasks. We recall that heretofore they wept in Prague at the sight of guests from America, but now they only rejoice. No longer will the Bohemians regard Bohemian-Americans as their lost sons. On the contrary, they will see that their children, although driven far from the motherland by fate, still have the same enthusiastic feeling for their homeland and work for it just as hard as those who stayed at home.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>For this reason this year's pilgrimage to Prague will be more joyous than ever before. The participants will be welcomed everywhere as good and valuable members of our nation in every respect. The attitude adopted toward them will not be sentimentel. There will be no sighs and such expressions of regret as: "Too bad that so many of you strong and healthy people have gone to foreign lands; too bad that so much Bohemian blood strengthens non-Bohemian blood!" Today they know in Bohemia what we Bohemian-Americans can be and what we will be if they do their duty toward us and do not call upon us unjustly to do ours.</p>
   <p>We expect good work and good effects from the present excursion, resulting in the strengthening and improvement of relations between the Bohemians of our native land and those of the United States of America.</p>
   <p>Our pilgrims will be considered not only as guests in our native land, but also as eagerly awaited assistants, recognized fellow workers in the hereditary national field. That will enlighten our pilgrims; it will make it possible for them to have the greatest pure joy and permanent benefit from <span class="page-break">5</span>things they see and experience.</p>
   <p>We have convinced ourselves that this year's excursion includes men and women with clear minds, sincere patriotic hearts--men and women trained in the hard school of life, capable of profiting from experiences gained for themselves and for all those who are dear to them, and primarily for our people, for that great Bohemian-Slavonic family, the love of which urges them to take this long, expensive pilgrimage.</p>
   <p>The leaders of our Bohemian people will surely enter into conference with them; they will ask about their opinions and ideas and will know how to use this information best. If this happens, then this year's pilgrimage will be profitable to the Bohemian people and to us Bohemian-Americans. The sacrifices will bear fruit a thousandfold. From the bottom of our hearts we hope that this will happen.</p>
   <p>Travel on this joyous pilgrimage, but do not forget its importance to all of us. Much rejoicing awaits you, but there will also be much serious work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Do not evade it, but perform it in such a way that we can be proud of you, that we can be grateful to you.</p>
   <p>Go, travel safely, and throughout the journey remain indeed brothers and sisters; enjoy the festive days not only with your eyes and ears, but also with your heart and soul; do not forget our defensive national societies; and, finally, return to your homes strengthened and happy, and we shall be awaiting you with eagerness!</p>
   <p>Good luck till we meet again!</p>
