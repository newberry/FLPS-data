   <p>On November 25, 1919, in the Saint Mary of Nazareth Hospital, 1120 North Leavitt Street, one of our best-known countrymen, Mr. Emanuel Beranek, died after a long illness. Recently his last will and testament was submitted to the Probate Court. From this last will and testament, it is apparent that Mr. Emanuel Beranek, just like many other immigrants, came to the United States comparatively poor and achieved a remarkable success, because the estate is estimated at $95,000. Mr. Emanuel Beranek's last will and testament was made and signed July 7, 1917, and was witnessed by his associated in business: Messrs. Wenceslav F. Jarosh, George O. Jarosh, and William J. Jarosh, all of 1030 Milwaukee Avenue. The Illinois Trust and Savings Bank is named as one executor and it will also act as trustee. In this last will and testament of Mr. Beranek, many of our Bohemian institutions are remembered, and these donations give evidence of his generosity.....</p>
   
   <p>The bequests to our public institutions are as follows: Ceske Utulne a Sirotcinci (the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), $1,000; Cesko-slovenskemu Narodnimu Sdruzeni (the Czechoslovak National Alliance), $1,000;  Sokolu Cechie (the Bohemian Falcon Association), $500; Ceske Pevecke Spolecnosti Lyra (the Bohemian Singing Society Lyra), $200; Ceske Debrocinne Spolecnosti (the Bohemian Charitable Association), $200; Ceske Opatrovne (the Bohemian Children's Home), $200; Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (the Alliance of Bohemian Rationalistic Schools), $500; Karel Jonas and Jan Amos Komensky Skolam (the Karel Jonas and Jan Amos Commenius Schools), $100 each; Frantisek B. Zdrubek Skole (the Frank B. Zdrubek School), $100. Altogether there were about thirty beneficiaries, and among the other recipients named are: Cekse Narodni Museum v Praze (the National Museum in Frague); the United Encampments No. 192 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows; the Sisters of the Holy Family, operating the Saint Mary of Nazareth Hospital. [The amounts bequeathed to these institutions are not given]. The court hearing in regard to this last will and testament of Mr. Emanuel Beranek, will be held sometime in April of this year.</p>
