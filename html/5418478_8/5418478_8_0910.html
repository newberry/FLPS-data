   <p>In today's issue, we offer a biographical sketch of the life of our young fellow-countryman of whom the Czech settlement may justly feel proud. He is Mr. Otto Kerner, outstanding Chicago lawyer, popular alderman of the Twelfth Ward, and lately, master in chancery in the circuit court of Cook County. His life is one chain of unqualified successes, which appear the more significant upon consideration of the fact that they came through his own assiduousness, energy, and perseverance.</p>
