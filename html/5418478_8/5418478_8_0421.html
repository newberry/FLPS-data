   <p>"As long as we did not have an army, we used to hear ignorant or malevolent people making remarks which disseminated distrust among our ranks in our movement. Leaders were accused of a lack of understanding of our needs. The call for an army became audible. The untiring work of the Cesko-Slovenska Narodni Rada (Czechoslovak National Council) succeeded in drawing the interest of the entire world to our cause, and finally the creation of a Czechoslovak Army was permitted. We would anticipate with joy some composure in our camp; we would welcome more vigorous action, more sacrifices, the awakening of justified consciousness and self-assertion.</p>
   <p>"Yet, there are still some people who, for reasons incomprehensible to us, feel incapable of joining those who, urged by sacred inspiration, take up arms and go across the ocean to defend the rights to liberty of our nation, <span class="page-break">\2</span>to break the fetters forged around the necks of our brothers by the German-Magyar hordes.</p>
   <p>"Thousands of our heroes fell; thousands are still alive and although their health is undermined, they have a smile on their lips because they feel blessed by the consciousness of a duty fulfilled. Who can smirk at the sight of these heroes?</p>
   <p>"Our military action is on the right track and on a firm foundation. If there should seem to be shortcomings here or there, do not become excited and condemn the whole action, but hint at or advise improvements, and thus become participants in the great work which is going to turn out better the more good people keep it in mind and further it.....</p>
   <p>"Do not disappoint the confidence of our nation--the nation which is battling in the old homeland, hoping and trusting that our young men, our volunteers, <span class="page-break">\3</span>will come and smash its prison with their strong, honest hands.</p>
   <p>"The Czechoslovak Army is the flower of the best and most valiant sons of our nation. Hasten, and join their ranks!"</p>
