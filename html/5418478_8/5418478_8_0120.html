   <p>From the poor son of an imperial serf to the presidency of an important republic and a statesman of international stature and repute, the story of Thomas G. Masaryk's career reads like fiction. He worked as a youth in a blacksmith's shop, but went to the university and eventually attained his doctor's degree with a dissertation on "The Essence of Plato's Soul". On to Leipzig he went for more study, and there he met Charlotte Garrigue of Brooklyn. He followed her back to America and married her in 1878. This was the first of four visits to America.</p>
   <p>On each visit he saw a little more of the democracy and freedom, which he was to champion all his life. An outspoken opponent of Germany's encroachment on Austria, and more especially of Austria's encroachment on the Balkans, he was forced to leave Prague when the war broke out. Almost penniless, he continued, from Switzerland, Italy, England, and America his unceasing battle for the freedom of the Czechs and Slovaks.</p>
   
   <p>Even with his daughter imprisoned, Austrian spies following him incessantly, and his son threatened with hanging, he never wavered from his purpose. With Edward Benes as his collaborator, and Woodrow Wilson as his friend and admirer, he finally secured recognition of the Czech National Council in 1917. He was proclaimed the first president of Czechoslovakia, and he has been re-elected ever since, (four times).</p>
   <p>His task has been difficult. His country was surrounded by hostile neighbors. Internally there were large numbers of Germans, Hungarians, and Ruthenians. The Czechs were exponents of religious freedom. The Slovaks were militant Catholics.</p>
   <p>But by his wisdom, courage, and foresight, Masaryk has succeeded in welding all those antagonistic elements together. It has been a colossal job, but Thomas G. Masaryk was a colossal man. His influence was the outcome of high moral character; the power and authority of his personality are the result of a rare combination of idealism and realism. In short he was a statesman really worthy of the name.</p>
