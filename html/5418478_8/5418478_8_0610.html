   <p>Chicago, March 22-The whole question seems to be "up in the air". Whoever makes a study of Bohemian-American and Slovak-American life cannot escape the impression that there exists a certain "something"--some definite points and questions--around which people walk carefully and as though on tipetoe; in order to avoid being obliged to deal with a matter whose importance they cannot deny, but for whose tacking this does not seem to be just the proper time. There are various reasons for these tactics of evasion: These people either do not know the substance-- the foundation--of the problem, a problem which is today as vital to the whole Bohemian people as it is vital to one of its parts, the Slovaks of Hungarian Slovakia, who are and will remain <span class="page-break">2</span>a branch of our nation in spite of the extremely queer arguments to the contrary which are frequently advanced. The Hungarian Slovaks' brothers here [and] overseas avoid tackling the question, some because of un-pardonable laziness, others because of personal egoism, and yet others because they just simply avoid everything that is not "business".</p>
   <p>It is not the purpose of these lines to determine which of these groups is the stronger one, or which is the least strong, but it certainly is no mistake to say that the number of those who are aware of the vital importance of the relationship between the Bohemians and Slovaks is very small in America, both among the Bohemians and among the Slovaks, and that this lack of understanding may become fatal to the future development of Bohemian and Slovak affairs, if many important questions that are now pending do not soon find a solution, that will be correct from the realistic, political, and national point of view. This solution must be such that "the commonweal may not be impaired."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In the finished parts of the memorandum which I have prepared for our political action and which, in accordance with the original decision of the Ceska Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance), is to be submitted to the Allies, I have tried to make clear the essential unity of the Bohemian-Slavonic nation from the Bohemian Forest to the Patra Mountains; and in dealing with the wrongs and injustice meted out to the Bohemians in Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia by the various successive governments of Austria, I naturally have made it a point to deal in detail with the deplorable conditions in Slovakia which I had frequently had the opportunity to observe personally on the occasion of my visits to this captivatingly beautiful, but severely tried bit of world at the foot of the Tatra Mountains.</p>
   <p>Although some of the leaders in literature and in politics, both in Slovakia and Bohemia, have had differing opinions about the unity of the two Slavic branches, the clear conviction that they form one nation has never disappeared from the patriots' minds and hearts. The consciousness of an essential unity may be weakened by various arguments, influences, and interests, by this <span class="page-break">4</span>weakening can be temporary only. This awareness, perhaps frequently obscured and sometimes unadmitted, has always existed, and it reaches with its consequences into our life in America. Sensible men who know how to think politically and feel unselfishly, are never able to ignore this problem of Slavic unity in their dealings. This was plainly demonstrated at the recent congress of the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League) in Pittsburgh, where this problem was not only a stumbling block to the smooth working of the congress, but also a test of the political maturity of certain groups and certain individuals.</p>
   <p>This problem of unity, which, for people of good will, is no longer a problem but is an urgent demand, has raised its head also at the congress of the Yugoslavs, and will finally become the essential feature of the proposal for the reconstruction of Austria-Hungary, which the Allies will make the Monarchy accept after the war. For us in America the Bohemian-Slovak question can be safely considered a criterion of the Slavic feeling of many so-called Slovaks. There is no doubt that their choice as between the Bohemians and the Hungarians, <span class="page-break">5</span>is also an indication of the sincerity of the Slavic feeling, just as the insistence upon unity with the Slovaks is nothing more nor less than an evidence of political sincerity, honesty, and common-sense perspicacity.</p>
   <p>We Bohemians have a reckon with the Slovaks just as the Slovaks have to follow the same trends as we do in case they expect to achieve any kind of political success in the old country. The strengthening of Bohemia is automatically a strengthening of Slovakia, while a stronger Hungary means complete ruin for Slovakia. This seems so clear to me that I simply fail to understand why this common logic can be anything but self-evident to every sensible person.</p>
   <p>In the Slovak camp it is frequently asserted that the Bohemians want to take political hold of Slovakia and Bohemianize the Slovaks. Men are not lacking who maintain that" the Slovaks would be worse off under the Bohemians than they are now under the Hungarians," and, to cap the climax, at a recent <span class="page-break">6</span>Bohemian-Slovak conference held in New York under the chairmanship of Mr. Tomas Capek, I overheard a Slovak remark to the effect that "after all, it is just the same, to become Bohemianized or Hungarianized!" And "if a people has to lose its future, it should prefer to lose it in its own land."</p>
   <p>I share neither these apprehensions, nor this pessimism, nor any of such or similar opinions. Anyone who pays more attention to facts than to designing fabrications simply knows that there is not a single political party in Bohemia, nor a single politician who would even for a minute entertain a thought of subjugating Slovakia. Knowing too well the "delights" of such national humiliation, we respect the liberty of others in order to remain worthy of our own liberty. This belief in right and justice for all is so firmly rooted in our nation that it forms the principal characteristic or our history, in which there is continual evidence of the fact that the Bohemians have frequently sacrificed their own liberty in order to assure it to others. This, after all, may be known even in Slovakia. My own experience with regard to "Bohemianizing"</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>would point just the other way: I have found the Bohemians who have settled in Slovaks have become "Slovakized" in their language, while Slovaks, after a ten-year sojourn in Bohemia, have remained as Slovak as their pines and spruces under Ruzomberk and Strba [places in Slovak Tatra Mountains] ..... But even so it certainly would not be a matter of indifference whether the Slovaks should become Bohemianized or Hungarianized. In the first place I do not believe at all that there would be a real danger of either,-- that a nation of three million people,-- young, strong, one that, in fact, has practically no political experience of its own, should be afraid that it would lose its individuality, if it does not let its head long down in despair, or knowingly become the prey of political profiteers and schemers. But even in such a--certainly improbable-case, it would certainly be more profitable to "sacrifice this people and let it become "Bohemianized" than to have to be Hungarianized. The whole question, however, is quite absurd and really should not be discussed at all in the present article.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>In addition to these most frequent objections to unity, we find a few others pertaining to the field of politics and national economy. Without doubt, free and independent Slovakia would offer an excellent market for the Bohemian manufacturer, artisan, businessman, and agriculturist. The Hungarian part of Slovakia is in just as great a need of economic as of political awakening. Slovakia is by no means a poor country, as many seem to imagine. It is true that some thirty thousand Slovaks flee to America every year to find here a living, but this is not because of their country's poverty. The reasons for this lie in Slovakia's politico-economic conditions. As far as Slovakia is concerned, the Hungarian government simply doesn't care. The first attempts to introduce agricultural machinery were made three or four years ago, after the government had seen that hundreds of Slovaks were going to Bohemia to study at agricultural schools. The same government has been preventing, by various police and customs measures, the Bohemian businessman from penetrating into Slovakia and inaugurating there a certain degree of economic progress-which, after all, -- is the foundation of any cultural and political progress at all. The government's failure or rather unwillingness, for purely political reasons, to introduce a measure of progress in this beautiful country, a <span class="page-break">9</span>country very rich in ores and lumber, has retarded the intellectual and economic development of the whole people. But as soon as Slovakia gains its independence and opens its doors to all business, and consequently also the Bohemian business, the immense richez of that country will be discovered. It will be the benefit of the whole Slavdom if the Bohemian businessman shares in these developments. Experience shows that the Slovak learns most quickly from the Bohemian and--let us tell the truth--once having learned from him everything there is to know, he becomes his keen, and frequently not especially thoughtful, competitor. But that, of course, is an attribute of all business in general and outside the narrow pale of Bohemian-Slovak relationships.</p>
   <p>I view of all this, I cannot get rid of the impression, that all the apprehensions of Bohemianization discussed in some quarters are not quite sincere; in fact, that their validity cannot be seriously defended.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>There is more reason to fear Slovakianization, because many Bohemians do get Slovakianzied by contact with Slovaks. But that, of course, is no misfortune; in fact, it is desirable for the Bohemian literature and for the Bohemian character in general, to take on some of the fine characteristic qualities of the Slovak people and be influenced by some of the specifically Slovak qualities, at the same time opening for the Slovaks, a wide doorway into such parts of world literature, as the Bohemian soul has already digested and absorbed.</p>
