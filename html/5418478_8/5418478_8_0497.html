   <p>"I feel obliged to offer you my apology and an expression of my deep regret that I am unable, because of illness, to keep my promise to preside over the inaugural lecture of Professor Masaryk. I have congratulated the Royal College on his acquisition, and I have been able to give him the assurance that he is cordially welcome to London as a teacher whose personality and wisdom have made an impression upon the whole Slavic world, and also as a man whose great courage we fully appreciate. We are convinced that his presence in London will add to the sympathy existing between the Russian nation and Great Britain. The Allies are waging the war, in the first place, for the freedom of small nations, for their liberation from the tyranny of their more powerful neighbors, and to enable them to develop <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their own national talents and governmental constitutions. Our thoughts and sympathies are now primarily directed to Serbia, whose intrepidity is gaining for her new friends and increasing admiration.</p>
   <p>"H. H. Asquith".</p>
