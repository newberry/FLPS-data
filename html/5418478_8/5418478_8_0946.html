   <p>Mr. Enrique Stanko Vraz, one of our foremost travelers and authors, who embraced our Bohemian-America wholeheartedly, has just returned from a journey through the Northwest, but we have not had the pleasure of his company for very long. He is already on a trip to Texas. Mr. Vraz is deserving of a hearty welcome everywhere he goes, and all of our sincere countrymen should willingly and enthusiastically work hand in hand with him. His lectures have one purpose: to awaken in the hearts of all Czechs the slumbering love toward the land of their birth and the people from whom they are descended. Mr. Vraz is poorly rewarded at times for his efforts, but this in no way keeps him from continuing with the energy and enthusiasm peculiar to him.</p>
