   <p>The expedition committee of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) has decided to extend the deadline for applications of members who wish to take part in the projected expedition to Czechoslovakia until March 31, 1922. There are still a few desirably located cabins left..... The Chicago participants will receive instructions in a few days to call at our offices for additional information, such as the applications for passports, their issuance, visas, etc. All these necessary details will be taken care of by the expedition committee. Non-citizens will have their first papers returned to them, so that they will have no difficulties on their return trip. Participants living outside of Chicago are asked to mail their citizenship papers to our office so that we may proceed to have their passports issued.....</p>
