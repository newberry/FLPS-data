   <p>Czech-American scientists, headed by Dr. Ales Hrdlicka and Professor Boh. Simek, and Czech-American artists and writers, headed by Professor Pressig, R. Ruzicka, and the Ondricek brothers, issued a proclamation in which they express their confidence in the leadership of Professor T. G. Masaryk, the Czechoslovak National Council, the Czech National Alliance, and the Slovak League of America.</p>
   <p>"....We declare that we shall follow you and shall not allow ourselves to be misled from the path along which you and we have been directed by the incorruptible Czech conscience, which subordinates personal and party interest to the common national weal.</p>
   <p>"We shall follow the example of our brothers, the Czech writers and artists <span class="page-break">2</span>in the old homeland. We appeal to our fellow countrymen beyond the borders of Czech lands to remain unconditionally under national discipline, for our innermost conviction tells us that the fate of the Czechoslovak nation is in the hands of men of reason, men who are honest and ready for sacrifice.</p>
   <p>"We gladly submit ourselves to this discipline; and we are going to persist, as we did in the past, in working for the liberation of our people.</p>
   <p>"September, 1917.</p>
