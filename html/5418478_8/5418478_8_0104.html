   <p>We Bohemians are the best voters, at least in the eyes of the elected politicians. When we elect someone to an office, we do not trouble ourselves as to whether he supports our interests as workingmen, retailers, or immigrants, and it does not strike us at all that we should give our elected representative any instruction as to how we wish him to act in this or that matter. There is pending in Congress legislation pertaining to immigration, which is of the utmost importance to our national existence. It is generally expected that a very detrimental immigration law will be passed. All foreign born nationals are agitating against it, making every effort to stop this threat to their national existence. Only we Bohemians with true Turkish resignation in the matter stand idly by and wait to see what our Congressmen will think up for us.</p>
