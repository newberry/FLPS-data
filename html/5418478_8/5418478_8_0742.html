   <p>Our esteemed guest, Mr. Vaclav J. Klofac, a member of the Austro-Hungarian parliament in Vienna and the Bohemian parliament in Prague, made a number of important calls yesterday. Accompanied by Dr. Jaroslav S. Vojan, he visited Mr. Karel J. Vopicka, with whom he discussed the Balkan situation and Mr. Vopicka's prospects for nomination to the ambassadorial post there. In regard to this latter point, the dry elements have stirred up such strong opposition that his prospects appear to be weakened considerably, in spite of the fact that Mr. Vopicka has the faithful support of Senator Lewis and Congressman A. J. Sabath.</p>
   <p>With Congressman Sabath, Mr. Klofac called on Mayor Harrison, who was keenly interested in Mr. Klofac's account of conditions prevailing in Austria and in the Balkans. During the visit the municipal bailiff, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, came to welcome Mr. Klofac and to show him through the City Hall.....</p>
