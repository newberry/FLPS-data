   <p>P.1--Mr. Leo Slezak, a Bohemian tenor, made a very impressive appearance at the Auditorium last night. His audience was held spell-bound by his singing in Verdi's opera Otello and accorded to him the loudest applause, that has ever been heard in the Auditorium.</p>
   <p>Mr. Slezak is also appearing in another opera, La Boheme, singing one role in the afternoon and the other in the evening. He is considered the best master of his roles among all the performers because he sings them as the composers of the operas intended them to be sung. With his aid the Metropolitan Opera foresees a successful season.</p>
