   <p>In Chicago, Illinois, July 5th, 1922, Jaroslav V. Lunak died. He was an editor of no mean ability and remained such until his election as Secretary of the "Bohemian Slavonie Benefit Society" in 1905.</p>
   <p>In spite of his 76 years he was active almost until the last. He was forced by ill health to resign his office in February of this year. His greatest services were rendered to the "C. S. B. S." It was his one thought, one love and one ideal.</p>
