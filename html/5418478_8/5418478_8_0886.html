   <p>One of our fellow-countrymen, widely known in our community as well as in the entire Czech-American world, is the real estate dealer and notary public, Frank J. Petru, whose office is located 1443 W. 18th Street, and who resides with his family at 1345 S. 61st Street, Cicero, Ill.</p>
   <p>He was born in Chicago, December, 1880. His parents are Vaclav and Marie Petru. At the age of thirteen, having finished grammar school, he became a messenger boy for the Postal Telegraph Company. He remained there seven years, advancing to the highest position in the bookkeeping department. When he saw no further prospect of advancement in that large corporation, he joined the staff of H. O. Stone, one of the foremost real estate firms in Chicago, as director of their West Side clientele.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>During his ten years of employment he sold much of the property owned by old settlers in the neighborhoods of Dekoven, Bunker, Halsted, and Twelfth streets, where he closed some of his biggest deals.</p>
   <p>He intended to go into business for himself, and in order to acquire an educational background he attended Birmingham College for two years. In 1905 he graduated from a school of business law.</p>
   <p>Having purchased property at 1441 W. 18the Street, he established himself in business in 1909. He handled real estate, insurance, and loans. After a time his office space proved inadequate and he expanded by buying adjacent property, and building additional offices.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Petru was intrusted with the sale of sub-divisions owned by prominent parties, e.g., Levy Mayer, Moses J. Wentworth, Joseph Vial, Emma Powell, T. W. Phinney, the Newberry Library, etc. He has sold more than 700 one-acre <span class="page-break">3</span>lots in Lyons (west of Riverside), 160 acres in La Grange, 160 lots in South Chicago, 282 lots in the Tabor sub-division on 42nd Avenue and 14th Street, and lots in the Hawthorne sub-division between 31st Street and 52nd Avenue in Cicero.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petru has always been an opponent of private banking and has never entered that business, although he has received many promising offers. Instead he developed his acquaintance with judges and prominent lawyers whose regard for his was instrumental in his appointment as receiver or administrator in good many cases.</p>
   <p>He married Miss Anna E. Saidl in 1906 and is now the father of two children.</p>
   <p>For the past nineteen years, Mr. Petru has devoted his evenings and most of his leisure time to work among our benevolent, aid, and building societies. He belongs to an endless number of societies, clubs and lodges, most of which have elected him to some important office. In the recent April elections, <span class="page-break">4</span>the Town of Cicero elected him as a trustee on the School Board.</p>
