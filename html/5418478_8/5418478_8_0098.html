   <p>Local English and other newspapers are crossing themselves, because of the great numbers of immigrants coming here. However, this avalanche of industrious, capable workers should fill them with pleasure and pride. Pleasure, because the number of those who work for the prosperity and welfare of this land is so satisfactorily increasing, and pride, because immigration is the best proof of how far in the forefront our country is in comparison with all the European states. There, these industrious workers cannot earn enough to maintain a dignified life, therefore they are hurrying to come here, where there is so much room for all who want to work. But it is not only better working and economic conditions which bring the immigrant stream to the United States, but also the local political and social arrangments are powerful magnets, which are drawing many subjects of the militaristic European states. When America no longer will offer the immigrants guarantees, that they can find a happier home here than that which they have in their native lands, immigration will stop of it's own accord, without the need for any strict laws. Americans should work to the end, that this may never happen.</p>
