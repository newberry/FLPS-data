   <p>We are calling the attention of all our readers to the fact that we have again received mail from the old country. It came yesterday, for the first time after a long while. In that mail there were several periodicals dated August 11, which shows that they were nineteen days on their way. No doubt, first class mail reached Chicago yesterday. We are asking those who cither have received or will receive letters from friends and relatives in Bohemian to lend them to us and give us permission to publish all they may contain that deals with the war and conditions in our badly abused and tortured homeland. We shall be very grateful for any help of this kind.</p>
