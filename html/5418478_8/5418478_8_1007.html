   <p>P.2, Col.3--The Health Commissioner issued information on how children should be cared for during hot summer weather and dvises that all milk should be boiled. He stated that Bohemians boil all milk they use. In that way, typhus and other summer ailments of children are avoided. Everybody should follow the example of the Bohemians, and boil all milk, so long as the weather remains hot. But it should be remembered that this alone is not enough. The milk must then be cooled quickly and kept at a temperature below sixty degrees until it is used. If you have an ice-box, keep the milk in it. If you cannot afford ice you can keep the milk cool by wrapping the container with a wet towel or cloth. So far as grown ups are concerned the health commissioner gives the following advice: "While the hot weather lasts, people should remain outdoors day and night. If you have a flat roof, you have an excellent place for sleeping, for there it is always several degrees cooler. Lacking such a roof you may use a porch for this purpose. If you have no porch, you can sleep in the yard. Children under two years of age should sleep in a cool place. Chicago has many parks, large and small, to which small children should be taken for their afternoon nap."</p>
