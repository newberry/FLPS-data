   <p>The members of the Cesko-Americka Obchodni Vyprava (Bohemian-American Commercial Expedition) made several joint trips to various parts of Czechoslovakia and were everywhere warmly received. A large number of them visited the town of Plzen (Pilsen), the famous old town of Domazlice...and on May 31, 1922 a visit was made to the town of Podebrady where our friends were warmly received....The above picture serves to illustrate the occasion and many of our readers will recognize the faces of our Chicago countrymen such as the Reverend Vaclav Vanek, Dr. O. S. Pavlik, Mr. Anton Schnabl and wife, Dr. H. L. Brown and wife, Libuse Bartusek-Brown, Mr. Jan Bartusek and wife, Mr. Frantisek Zajicek, Messrs A. J. Zahrobsky, Jan F. Zetek, Vojtech Zikmund, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Dr. Marie Sorna, Mr. N. Krametbauer, Mr. Josef Dusek, Mrs. O. S. Pavlik, Miss Mildred Pavlik, Mrs. M. Jiran, Mrs. A. Zahrobsky, Miss Anna Zahrobsky, Mesdames Frantiska Hulka, B. E. Jirka, E. C. Janousek, Marie Zeman, and Marie Dusek. The above group, therefore, is exclusively a Chicago group, and our local countrymen will be glad to know how well they fared in the old homeland......</p>
