   <p>Last Sunday we started the publication of highly important articles dealing with the American Constitution, jurisprudence, and political organization. The author of these articles is Mr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka, a well-known student of such matters. His articles explain in an interesting and easy way all that is necessary to become an American citizen. It is not without a definite purpose that Mr. Smetanka has taken upon himself to write these articles, and that we have opened our columns to them.</p>
   <p>The information offered in these articles is of great importance. Its value will be fully recognized by all candidates for citizenship when they will have to face the judge and answer his questions concerning the United States. He who is unable to give the correct answers cannot become an American citizen. We print Mr. Smetanka's articles, knowing that we shall oblige all those who want to become citizens of the country which they have chosen as their new <span class="page-break">\2</span>homeland. And that desire should be in all of us.</p>
   <p>In the first place, it is our moral duty. Furthermore, citizenship accords certain advantages, the lack of which--so frequently felt by those who are not citizens--is a natural result of indolence and indifference. For example, one advantage is a safe return to America from a trip to abroad. Without naturalization papers, even if a person had lived in the United States for many years, difficulties would be encountered on Ellis Island or in any other port of entry. Why not avoid such a danger when the solution is in our own hands? Or is it perhaps without advantage to exercise the rights of citizenship?</p>
   <p>Every good citizen participates in elections and votes for the candidate whom he considers worthy, one who can be expected to administer properly, honestly, and diligently his office of president, of governor, or whatever other federal, state, county, or municipal office will be filled by the election. It is up <span class="page-break">\3</span>to you who are not yet citizens to take out citizenship papers, and in that way put yourselves in the position of casting your votes for men known for their uprightness, courage, and public spirit. Being a citizen offers another advantage. We know that there are among us many able and well-educated men who would worthily and honorably represent the Bohemian people if they could and would hold a public office. Our abilities and talents could command consideration when many a federal, state, county, or city job is to be filled. But this can be done only if we are citizens, because only a citizen may hold a public office. Some of our friends occupy positions of influence and would be glad to help us get such a job. But they cannot do anything for us as long as we have not received our citizenship.</p>
   <p>Citizenship carries many other advantages, and we could fill several columns in dealing with them. That, however, is not the purpose of this article. We would rather call the attention of our readers, and particularly those who have their first papers only, to something of much greater importance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In June, 1906, Congress passed a law which invalidates any first paper--declaration of the intention to become a U. S. citizen--issued seven years or more ago. This means that the first citizenship paper of a person who did not apply for his second or final paper within seven years after its receipt, becomes worthless. Its owner must again declare his intention to become an American citizen--get another first paper--and in due time thereafter apply, in accordance with the law, for his second paper. Excluded from this provision are only such first papers which were issued to the owner prior to the year 1906. Since, however, the law which was in force at that time also limits the validity of the first paper to seven years, such papers will become invalid this year. Those who have a paper that old must lose no more time. The dead line is September 26 of this year. Those who do not apply prior to or on this day will lose the right they have acquired so far.</p>
   <p>This warning is of particular importance to our countrymen who live in a state where the possession of the first paper entitles its owner to vote. They have <span class="page-break">\5</span>a considerable advantage over us who are settled in the State of Illinois; they should see to it that their advantage is not lost through procrastination, idling, not to say indifference. If they do not apply until September 26, they lose such rights of citizenship as they enjoy now. It is a generally known fact that the number of persons who have had nothing more than this first paper for many years is enormous; and they are not only in states where this paper brings voting privileges, but also here in Illinois. It is also generally known that the naturalization proceedings will be made more and more difficult gradually. Let us therefore get our citizenship now when the getting is easy, or at least not very difficult. We admonish you again and repeat our warning.....</p>
