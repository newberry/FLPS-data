   <p>p. 9--Countrymen, Bohemians and all you of the Slavic race!</p>
   <p>The Austrian Government which within its domain oppresses the Slavic nations, attempting to Germanize them is reaching now into the Balkans. After the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina it is preparing for a war against Serbia and Montenegro. Bohemian, Moravian, and Slovak regiments are being transferred to the Serbian border. Again Slavic regiments are to fight for Austria in fratricidal struggle. Slavic brethren's blood will be spilled; and why? In order that German political ambitions may subjugate one more expanse of territory and rule it.</p>
   <p>Slavic men are to bear arms against their brethren of the Balkans. We must not remain indifferent to this danger, and we are therefore going to rise in mighty protest against this bloodshed among our races.</p>
   
   <p>If we permit the Austrian Government any longer to oppress, ravish, and murder the Slavic nations, then we deserve to be called the nation most destitute of honor and of character of all the nations of the world. In every town there is surely one who will undertake to call a meeting to aid our efforts in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Fellow-countrymen and Slavic brethren! On Sunday the tenth of January at 2:30 p. m. there will be a meeting in the Bohemian-American Hall on Eighteenth street, called by the Bohemian committee to gather all Slavic people, Croatians, Slovanians, Slovaks, and Serbs, who will all distribute literature for the cause among their countrymen. Therefore our duty demands that as many Bohemian-Americans as can do so shall attend the meeting.</p>
   <p>We earnestly entreat all Bohemian journals to place themselves effectively at the disposal of this movement by urging collections for the imprisoned, the wounded, and those who have suffered damages at the hands of raving fanatics in the so-called "closed German territory." Contributions will be accepted by the treasurer, Fr. Ring, 604 West Eighteenth street, Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>Every Slavic man who resents the oppression of his race should attend the meeting on January 10.</p>
   <p>The permanent committee of the United Bohemian Societies.</p>
