   <p>Congressman A. J. Sabath has four propositions before the House, one of which is of special importance for us Czechs and for all other immigrants. It is concerned with a change in the immigration law and aims at the elimination of all the nativistic clauses adopted by Congress in its last session. One of these supplemental clauses demands of the immigrant a knowledge of the English language and of certain articles of the Constitution of the United States. The clause would have a decidedly restrictive effect upon immigration and would be harmful to our people.</p>
   <p>The immigrant is in the majority of cases one who makes his living by hard labor and has lacked the time to study the language; in consequence he is not well equipped to understand passages of the Constitution. Our people aid in the creation of the wealth of the country, especially in the cultivation of the soil; this has been demonstrated, and they have accomplished it <span class="page-break">2</span>without knowledge of the Constitution which very frequently is all Greek to the native American himself. The law passed by the last Congress is partial and nativistic. It hits the Slavonic people in particular.</p>
   <p>Our nativists are of the opinion that immigrants newly arrived are good enough for digging ditches, for cleaning sewers, for heavy labor in factories and on farms, for risking their health and jeopardizing life and limb, but are not entitled to have equal rights with native citizens. Whoever has come into contact with our federal judges, in whom is vested the power of granting citizenship, has found them to be dyed-in-the-wool nativists; they throw every obstacle imaginable in the path of the applicant for citizen's papers.</p>
   <p>We might mention the increased cost of obtaining citizenship as another handicap. The amendment to the law would considerably lighten the burden <span class="page-break">3</span>laid on the shoulders of immigrants.</p>
