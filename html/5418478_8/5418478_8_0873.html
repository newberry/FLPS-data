   <p>It has been a long time since Czech Chicago and our metropolis itself has been the scene of a burial so dignified in aspect and so charged with emotion, though devoid of pomp, as the rites which ushered Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir into eternal peace yesterday afternoon. The display which usually accompanies the burial of men prominent in civic life was missing. In its place there was a mood which showed how deeply the mourners were affected. They came from all walks of life: High officials, professional men, and merchants mingled with people of small business and trades.</p>
   <p>Judge Uhlir died of pneumonia two days ago after an illness of only one <span class="page-break">\2</span>week. With his passing we lost the first associate judge of the Municipal Court of Czech descent. His sudden death caused painful surprise not only in our community, but also in the whole city.</p>
   <p>The events surrounding his death were sad. They augmented the grief which seemed to reach a climax when the funeral procession passed the house at 2410 South Clifton Park Avenue. There lay the dead man's wife, Mrs. Caroline Whlir, prostrate with sorrow. Up to the last moment she had insisted upon attending the funeral. However, her physician had strictly forbidden her to leave-not only because of her weakened system, but also for the sake of her child, to which she is expected to give birth soon. Moreover, the eldest son, a fifteen-year-old lad, also could not be present at his father's last journey. He was gravely ill, stricken with the same treacherous sickness which had doomed his father to the grave. Only two children, six-year-old Caroline and three-year-old Edward, could go along with the mourners.</p>

   <p>The initial rites were performed in the auditorium of Sokol Chicago. Large crowds congregated not only before the building, but all along South Kedzie Avenue between 23rd and 24th Streets. The services were scheduled for 2 P. M. At that time the large hall was overcrowded. The throngs were held back by a large detachment of the Chicago police and were also directed by deputy bailiffs, all in uniform, from the Municipal Court. Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chief bailiff of the Court, was in charge of the arrangements for the ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The remains of the deceased were placed in front of the stage amidst countless floral offerings. Members of Sokol Chicago, in Sokol attire, stood as the guard of honor at the bier of one of the founders of their Sokol group. The Bohemian Charitable Association, of which the late judge was a charter member, and numerous other organizations to which he belonged or with whom he was acquainted, were represented by delegations. There were <span class="page-break">\4</span>Masons and Boy Scouts, among whose good friends the judge had been counted; strong delegations of Czech Chicago lawyers; and representatives of the entire Czech Sokol community in large numbers. Both the Democratic and Republican ward organizations had sent their members.</p>
   <p>Judges of almost every court in Chicago adjourned after a short morning session to pay their respects to their late colleague. All judicial departments of the city, county, and state governments, and other officials, regardless of political affiliation, appeared, and so did Mayor William Hale Thompson, accompanied by many aldermen. Officers of the Probate Court, over which Judge Uhlir presided for years, appeared en masse. Other Czech men prominent in politics and public service were Judge Jos. Sabath, clerk of the Probate Court; John A. Cervenka; Attorney C. Kerner; and others. Several privates and non-commissioned officers came from Camp Grant, Rockford, Illinois. They also took turns as guards of honor.</p>

   <p>The obsequies were begun by the Czech-American quartet, which sang "Proc Placete A Lkate." (Why Do Ye Weep and Sob?). Mr. Joseph Placek, head of Sokol Chicago, was the first of the speakers to bid farewell to the dead man, who was an old-time friend to him, a brother Sokol, a sincere Czech-American to the community, and one of those who helped found Sokol Chicago twenty-six years ago. Mr. Placek quoted the late judge as having remarked to him: "If only every Czech would belong to one or the other Sokol group, the Czechs would fare much better."</p>
   <p>After a dirge sung by the quartet, Chief Justice Olson of the Municipal Court described the difficulties his colleague had to overcome in building up a career; the chief justice paid high tribute to his ability and diligence, which placed him in the ranks of the best judges of his court. To Judge Uhlir goes the lion's share of credit for the creation of the Court of Domestic Relations. The chief justice did not forget to speak of his dead colleague's inborn modesty and other pleasing traits of character. He <span class="page-break">\6</span>related how the sick man called for his son, Joseph, up to the very end. This son, for whom the father shouted in violent delirium, is himself in a critical condition, being smitten by the same sickness which took his father's life. The man's last thought was with his family to which he was ever devoted. Chief Justice Olson declared that he would do his best to enlist the aid of others and accord the bereft family the care that its head can give no more. He is fully conscious, he concluded, that it will not be possible to make up for the great loss, but he considers it to be the duty of friends not to forget the family that is now in dire distress.</p>
   <p>Reverend Vaclav Vanek, a close friend, spoke on the late judge's activities. He laid stress on his patriotic sentiment as an American of Czech descent. He described how last Saturday, shortly before 11 A. M., the sick man suddenly recovered from his delirium, and in a light moment spoke about the patriotic duties before us and how we can fulfill them. He was happy to be feeling better. Soon, however, he lapsed into eternal sleep. His memory <span class="page-break">\7</span>will ever be treasured.</p>
   <p>The quartet followed the speaker with another funeral song in the English language. This closed the rites in the hall.</p>
   <p>The casket was carried to the hearse by Chief Justice Olson and Judges Rafferty, La Buy, Stelk, Goodnow, Jarecki, Cook, and Barasa. The funeral procession moved through the heart of the "Czech California" district to 26th Street and Crawford Avenue, and from there the carriages rode to the Bohemian National Cemetery.....</p>
   <p>The last rites were initiated by the Masonic quartet. The Order Caslav [a city in Bohemia] No. 205 of the Czecho-Slavonic Aid Society was represented by a speaker. Others spoke for the Association of Czech Lawyers, <span class="page-break">\8</span>the Chicago Bar Association, and the Oriental Lodge. Delegates of the last-mentioned organization performed Masonic rites. The remains of the late judge were laid at rest in the family vault after Mr. Vanek delivered the parting words.</p>
   <p>Judge Uhlir is not among us any more, but his memory will linger for a very long time. This will be a great consolation to his poor family.	</p>
