   <p>Vaclav Rezanka, one of the first Bohemian pioneers, and one of the founders of present day Bohemian social circles in Chicago, who loyalty preserved and fought on the hereditary fields of our people here in this land beyond the seas, died this morning about 3:00 o'clock in the midst of his loving family.</p>
   <p>Vaclav Rezanka, arrived in America in the year 1853 and lived in Chicago since 1861. He was a co-founder of the "Slovanske Lipy" (Slovak Basswood) and when this organization ceased to exist, being replaced by the present "Tel. Jed. Sokol" (Gymanstic Union Sokol), he became a member of the latter. Last summer he paid a visit to the land of his birth, returning late in the fall bringing with him a brother who had been engaged in the ladies tailoring business in Pisek, Bohemia. Shortly after his return to Chicago his health began to fail and he died this morning at the age of 62 years, 6 months, 4 days.</p>
