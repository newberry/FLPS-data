   <p>Friends! For ages the Bohemian nation in the old country has not been put to such a severe trial as it is now. Being deprived of its best sons, who are being sent into the first lines of the front to fight against their Slavic brothers in spite of their own feelings and better judgment; steadily kept poor by the rapacious politics of Vienna; systematically retarded in its cultural and economic development by the Austrian government, the Bohemian nation appeals to you, dear friends, for help and for support. Is there anybody who could refuse in times such as these? Is there anybody who would want to avoid his sacred duty which springs from an unimpaired love of the old acres overseas from where not only cries of despair now resound, but also voices of hope that foretell that the sacrifices the Bohemian nation are now making will live; emotions and material goods will not be in vain, but they will bring about the dawn of a better future? We want to believe that there is not one good son, not one good daughter of the Bohemian nation in the United States and Canada who would not give us a helpful hand to complete any action <span class="page-break">2</span>directed toward mitigating misery and sorrow on one hand and building for a happier, more independent future of our old country on the other hand.</p>
   <p>While remaining loyal citizens of the United States our new homeland, which, unlike the government of Austria, grants every individual freedom of development, we have united in the undersigned Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) in order to seek and apply the best possible means of being useful to the old country, which is in such dire need of help.</p>
   <p>The objectives of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni in America are:</p>
   <p>To build a fund for the mitigation of misery, suffering, and economic debacles that war has caused in our old country by a systematic and continous series of collections in the United States and Canada.</p>
   <p>To conduct a campaign of propaganda by which the public of America and the <span class="page-break">3</span>whole world will be kept properly informed about the desires and the historic natural, and human rights of the Bohemian-Slavonic people in Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Slovakia.</p>
   <p>To use suitable means in an effort to bring about the consideration of the requirements and the liberation of the Bohemian nation when the time comes for the solution of European problems, which will necessarily follow the present war.</p>
   <p>We are well aware of the responsibility which rests upon us with the adoption of the above program, and we direct a warm appeal to all true Bohemians in this country, to our societies, associations, institutions, other organized bodies, and to our press to help us in carrying it out. We invite you into our ranks, and we ask your moral support in order to make a strong enough impression on the American public. But we also ask your financial support. No struggle can be won without money. Our auxiliary committee is in charge of the solicitation of funds for the afflicted people. Its purpose is to <span class="page-break">4</span>alleviate the misery and sorrows caused by the war.</p>
   <p>This activity goes hand in hand with the work of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) and the Tiskovy Odbor (Press Committee) of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni toward making the general American and world public acquainted with the difficult situation of the Bohemian lands, the suffering and oppression, and their fruitless clamor for human rights, and thus enable the Bohemian nation effectively to voice its demands when discussions will be under way as to the fate of our old country.</p>
   <p>This work, aiming at the liberation of Bohemian lands from their present relation to the Austrian government, we consider of extraordinary importance. But if this aim is to be achieved, it will be necessary to have available a sufficient fund for political purposes. We therefore ask that the purpose of all contributions be clearly designated. It is sufficient to say, "For mitigation of need," or "For political action". All contributions will be publicly receipted.</p>

   <p>Friends! The Poles have been striving for their independence for ages, and they willingly make any sacrifices toward that end. No sacrifice is too great for the Irish, our co-citizens, to be put on the altar of their national desires, for the liberation of their country. Let us prove by quick and substantial help that this great era has not found us unprepared; that our love for the old country has not died; and that we are willing to respond with deeds to the call of our old country, the object of our fond memories, our love, and our dreams! "He that gives quickly gives twice!"</p>
   <p>All contributions should be addressed to the treasurer of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni V Americe, Mr. James F. Stepina, 1825 Blue Island Avenue, Chicago Illinois, U. S. K.</p>
