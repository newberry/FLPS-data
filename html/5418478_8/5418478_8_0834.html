   <p>Some of our Chicago Bohemian Citizens called a public meeting for yesterday afternoon, the purpose of which was to elect a committee for the collection of contributions to the rebuilding of the National Theatre of Prague which was destroyed by fire a short time ago. Although the meeting was in behalf of a noble purpose, there were in attendance only about one hundred citizens, among them five or six ladies.</p>
   <p>The elaborate "Slovak Band", under the direction of Mr. J. Koula, rendered several selections after which, Mr. Fr. Kolar called the meeting to order. He said that every brother in Bohemia has already given, in order to help in the rebuilding of the unfortunately burned National Theatre and that is the duty of Bohemians in America to follow this example. At the request of Mr. Kolar, a chairman, a secretary and treasurer were elected.</p>
   <p>It was resolved that all money be sent to the Directors of the Committee for rebuilding the Theatre in Prague at one time, that every donor be acknowledged by name and in amount in the Chicago newspapers.</p>
