   <p>There never were moments more stirring, festive, and glorious in the history of our people in America than yesterday afternoon, when the Czechoslovaks welcomed their beloved leader, their "Daddy," as he is fondly called, in a downright triumphal manner. This endearing name "Daddy" is not a current, meaningless word just picked up on the spur of a moment of elation. Destiny itself willed that Masaryk should be called from the high seat of learning in Prague to become the tribune at the head of his oppressed nation, which yearns for liberty and rescue from Hapsburg slavery. Masaryk grew up within his nation; he has become its political apostle and the leader of its proud revolutionary army. Such is his significance, grasped wherever sincere Czechoslovak hearts throb--yonder, in that quiet cultural corner at the foot <span class="page-break">2</span>of the [mountain] Snezka, and the Cerchov, that mountain ever absorbed in deep thought, at the foot of the haughty Tatra [mountains], on the battle fields of France and Russia. It can fairly well be said of Masaryk, just as was said of the immortal Thomas Paine, whose prophetic words speak to us from the Declaration of Independence--that he was "most beloved and most maligned."</p>
   <p>Declared a heretic by any haphazard Austrian henchman, crucified by any chance official nincompoop, up to the minister of foreign affairs himself, Count Czernin of ill repute, Masaryk rises before the gaze of his people to the heights of a national hero, taking over the sacred heritage from Karel Havlicek Borovsky, the Brixen [a town] martyr. There is nothing within the compass of human conception that this man would not be ready to offer upon the altar of his oppressed people--this man, old in years, but an undaunted, unwavering fighter, a figure so agile and fresh, the very type of ancient gladiator.</p>
   <p>This is why the Chicago Czechoslovak colony welcomed "Daddy" Masaryk with fiery <span class="page-break">3</span>fervor, and in such numbers that yesterday afternoon saw the greatest multitude of our people ever gathered in America.</p>
   <p>Only a few days have passed since our entire community was stirred up into high anticipation by the news of Masaryk's coming, but how much has been accomplished in preparing for the event! No national festivity, or impressive demonstration in our community can compare with the glorious demonstration which our people arranged for their leader yesterday. The "Loop district," so empty on Sunday afternoons, was changed, as if by magic, into a sea of jubilant human beings, who thronged the streets, paralyzing every means of transportation. Traffic was completely disrupted, its lanes being exclusively reserved for the distinguished visitor and his guard of honor, which counted thousands in a colorfully arranged procession--it was the Chicago Czech's and Slovak's day of celebration.</p>
   <p>The welcome given to Masaryk fully equalled that given the Belgian, French, and British deputations before, although he came as a plain adherent of a <span class="page-break">4</span>nation which will not receive its just demands or come into its rights until the peace conferences. Masaryk came, saw, and conquered.</p>
   <p>The call sent out by the reception committee to the Czechoslovak people, and to representatives of other nationalities, met with a lively response from all organizations, and individuals as well. In spite of the short time available for preparation, our organizations appeared in full strength, all of them in national colors and with flags.</p>
   <p>When the hands of the clock were approaching twelve, the neighborhood of Madison and Canal Streets, and that of the Northwestern Depot, were rapidly becoming alive with activity, and the air reverberated with the strains of music from numerous bands. Every streetcar heading toward the Northwestern station was packed with people. Before the entrance of the building a forest of flags and banners had grown up.</p>
   <p>The line of participants in the reception reached as far as Michigan <span class="page-break">5</span>Boulevard, to the Blackstone Hotel, where our distinguished visitor was to stay. The parade was so well arranged that there was no mishap nor disorder, and later it dissolved with great precision according to previous instructions. The performance resembled a perfect drill.</p>
   <p>The Sokol organizations were posted before the depot. They had come in large numbers, and it was a real joy to gaze at these colorfully attired men who represent our national guard. They were led by their chief, Jarka Kosar, and made a stately guard of honor, one part of which wore red shirts, the other blue. Catholic and Slovak Sokol organizations also were represented in large numbers. It was a rally of the whole Sokol family.</p>
   <p>The station building was overcrowded. There were present guests of other nationalities, dignitaries, numerous officials of the Federal Government, the State, County and City, and representatives of the press. Many visitors had come from Detroit, Cleveland, Cedar Rapids, Sioux City, and other towns.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Professor Harry Pratt Judson, president of the University of Chicago, a most sincere friend of the Czechoslovaks, the French consul, Mr. Barthelmy, the Russian consul, Mr. Volkoff, and the British vice-consul, Mr. Bernays, were among those in the waiting rooms.</p>
   <p>Almost every Chicago English-language paper had sent a representative, and so had the Czech, Slovak, Polish, Slovenian, Serbian, and possibly some other Slavonic papers. Masaryk's visit was also given marked attention by various influential organizations, as for instance the Security League, State Council of Defense, etc. Our own prominent fellow citizens and public officials had made their appearance almost to a man, so that the reception for our guest was an extensive, general affair.</p>
   <p>The eager anticipation of the multitude grew from minute to minute. The train was due at 1:30 P.M., but arrived seven minutes later. Attorney Karel (Charles) Pergler was with Masaryk from the time of our leader's arrival at Vancouver. The Reverend I. Kestl, Dr. L. J. Fisher, and <span class="page-break">7</span>Mr. Schustek, had joined the two at St. Paul, Minnesota. Not until shortly before 2 P.M. did the gate leading from the waiting room to the station platform open, and a limited number of representative men were allowed to come out. Masaryk's arrival was announced by a gunshot fired on a nearby track.</p>
   <p>Every sincere Czech and Slovak heart quickens its beat at the mere sound of the words "Daddy" Masaryk. How much more must those have felt who were able to approach our leader, and gaze at his expressive features, admire his smile and his lithe, elastic gait!</p>
   <p>Professor [Jaroslav] Zmrhal performed the various introductions and presentations. Masaryk had a warm squeeze of the hand and a friendly word for everybody. When he entered the waiting room, a spontaneous, turbulent ovation was given him. The jubilant throngs formed a lane through which the venerable old knight of the defense against Austria strode to the sidewalk where a car was waiting. A special guard of honor was improvised for him, quite <span class="page-break">8</span>unexpectedly, by a squad of sun-tanned marines who had come on the same train, and who, viewing the enthusiasm of the crowd, joined in paying homage, following their intuition only.</p>
   <p>The exultation of the masses reached the highest pitch when Masaryk's head became visible in the Whirl of flags, waving hands, and Sokol caps tossed into the air. After the various dignitaries and the members of the arrangements committee had taken their places, the mighty throng began moving east on Madison Street.  The procession was headed by Sokols, and also butchers' associations in the colorful garb of their guild.  Czech and other organizations with their own bands formed the core of the line which moved in step with the music.  The parade turned south on State Street to Eighth Street, where the Blackstone Hotel is located.  On his triumphal ride Masaryk was closely accompanied by Federal dectectives.  Considering what German and Austrian spies and henchmen are capable of perpetrating, one may readily find it advisable to provide protection against these creatures.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Very little can be observed during a parade, even in a great metropolis like ours. The number of participants is hard to guess; it is however estimated at between 75,000 and 100,000. There was one continuous line from the railroad station to the hotel. They were all there, men, women and children. The little ones also formed a line along the street, throwing flowers in the path of our leader's car. Many of the children were accompanied by school teachers. Their loving tribute provided a most emotional element in the reception.</p>
   <p>The crowd was eager to hear their leader say a few words. They were disappointed when Masaryk rose, for it was only to pose for press photographers. The music played "The Star-Spangled Banner," "Kde Domov Muj" (My Homeland), "Hej Slovane" (Ho! Slavs!), and the Slovak anthem, "Nad Tatrou" (Above the Tatra). Everybody joined in the singing, whether he knew how to sing or not.</p>
   <p>Vojta Benes, organizer of the Czech National Alliance, addressed the crowds. His words were not audible to many, because of the wide space and a strong <span class="page-break">10</span>breeze. The applause which followed was proof enough of the effect Benes's words made upon the hearts of sincere Czechoslovaks. We print what we could hear.</p>
   <p>"Czechoslovak people, Czechs and Slovaks! It was the hard-working, plain man who understood, when the call for help came to us from the old homeland. Miners and farmers followed the call that came from Masaryk. They joined in the action and were followed by thousands of others. These people have an opportunity to welcome the man who encouraged them in the struggle, and who has become their leader. Dear "Daddy," your head is gray, but we shall feel that all is well as long as you are with us. Although Masaryk has risen far above us, he has always felt attached to the plain people. He does not look down upon them, but uplifts them to his own level, to his ideals that flame from the lives of our patriots. Liberty and the idea of independence for our people always occupied the foremost place in their minds.</p>
   <p>"Masaryk was the first to appeal to the Czechs in America, and under his hand <span class="page-break">11</span>those legions began to grow which now form the Czechoslovak Army in France and Russia. These legions became famous--so to speak--over night, at the very beginning of their existence. This has been evidenced by the salutes coming from the graves of our heroes to thousands of Czechs and Slovaks. Thousands of our people are welcoming you today, "Daddy" dear, and they hope that your work for liberty will be crowned with success. I welcome you, Professor, in the name of thousands of Czechs and Slovaks, wishing that you would find your well-deserved rest among us after three years of hard work. We wish that the bud of your work bloom into the beautiful flower which means liberty for the subjugated people."</p>
   <p>These are about the words spoken by Mr. Benes. All of us remember how many times he was interrupted by bursts of applause. Certainly no Czech or Slovak doubted that these words came from his heart.</p>
   <p>Professor Jaroslav Zmrhal, member of the reception committee, presented Professor Harry Pratt Judson, president of the University of Chicago, who extended <span class="page-break">12</span>a hearty welcome to Professor Masaryk. He spoke in effect as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Professor Masaryk! I welcome you in the name of the universities of this country, and in the name of the public. I welcome you, who are the leader of a nation which we know and hold in high esteem. We know the history of the Czech and the Slovak people. We may justly state that there are no better citizens than those who have come from your country. They are most loyal to this land. The starry banner is for them the very symbol of democracy, at the altar of which they offer the lives of thousands of their sons. We feel confident that your work will have results, and bring to your people what is the most precious possession of this country, liberty and justice, of which Czechs have ever been the staunchest protagonists. We are extending our fullhearted greetings to you, and assure you that America will do everything in its power to promote the sublime cause personified by you."</p>
   <p>As a reward for these few but significant words, Professor Judson was acclaimed by the huge gathering in the most enthusiastic manner. Our people surely <span class="page-break">13</span>grasped the import of the speaker's words, for they came from his heart.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludwig J. Fisher, chairman of the Czech National Alliance, introduced Mr. A. Mamatey, chairman of the Slovak League, who expressed a wish that found an echo in every one's heart. "Friends!," he exclaimed, "The only wish I harbor is that our tyrants across the ocean could see us at this moment and realize our sentiments. Then they surely would not speak any more of 'lack of solidarity' among the Slavs. These times call for united action. We are bending our efforts toward independence of Czechs and Slovaks. This day is devoted to work. We are welcoming Professor Masaryk, we Slovaks, and the Czechs, our nearest blood relatives, with whom we are fighting for an independent Czechoslovak state. Professor Masaryk! We wish most sincerely that you may enjoy the fruits of your work in our midst for many years to come."</p>
   <p>Our brothers, the Slovaks, broke out into tumultuous shouts of approval, and <span class="page-break">14</span>so did the Czechs. This demonstration reached a climax when Mrs. A. Cajak, from the Slovak societies, presented Professor Masaryk with a floral offering.</p>
   <p>The Reverend F. Jedlicka welcomed our distinguished guest in the name of the Czech Catholics, and was followed by Mr. Tony Novotny, for the Czech socialists and workingmen. Pointing to history, Mr. Novotny declared that great men have always been persecuted by the enemies of our nation. "One such man is Masaryk, whom we have in our midst now. His ideals represent also the ideals of the Czech socialists."</p>
   <p>Professor Zmrhal spoke in the English language, welcoming our guest in the name of resident Czechoslovak men and women. He assured him of American help in the promotion of his ideals, and declared that Czechoslovaks will prove to be conscious of their duty. Just as the American flag is now united with the Czech colors, so America will stand up for Masaryk. Mrs. Mary Stolfa, for Czech women's organizations, spoke in a similar trend.</p>
   <span class="page-break">15</span>
   <p>An unforgettable moment came when professor Masaryk rose to address the multitude. Eagerness to hear him speak had been repressed up to that instant. It discharged itself vehemently in turbulent acclaim. Some may have felt disappointed because he began in English, but he used the Czech language later on. He addressed himself to Professor Judson first.</p>
   <p>"Dear Professor! The honor conferred upon me by your presence here reminds me of former times when I was frequently given the opportunity to speak at your university on the principles and ideals for which we fight and work today. My lectures, which I gave through the good offices of Mr. Crane and the University of Chicago itself, were only a sort of political prophecy by way of mention then, but the problems treated in them are acute now. I am convinced that sane and sincere politics must have a scientific foundation. Real democracy is actual peace, pure and simple. You, my dear Professor, have called us Czechoslovaks good citizens of this country. I assure you that we are. Why? We did not come here merely in search of our daily bread. We came to this land of liberty for something else, too, something <span class="page-break">16</span>more sublime. We came here because of our desire for liberty and independence, these two treasures which are America's cherished possession."</p>
   <p>Suddenly, unexpectedly, the aged man turned to our representatives, addressing them in our dear mother tongue: "Czechs, brothers, Czechs and Slovaks! I do not know what I should tell you, for I have said much already, yet there is something that I would like to mention. I want to confess--I should like to tell you how I joined our political movement.</p>
   <p>"You know how, immediately after the war broke out, they began to oppress us in Bohemia. We were not allowed to hold meetings or councils; newspapers were confiscated and suppressed, gatherings broken up. That was the way the Austrian officials treated us. I was in Germany at that time, on my way to France and England. I returned to Bohemia, and the first thing I saw there was our Czech soldiers refusing to serve against Russia. I took the cue from them, and reasoned like this: If these soldiers dare to do such a thing, then it must be my duty, as their representative in parliament, to do <span class="page-break">17</span>likewise. And so I began to make revolutions against Austria. This is part of my human nature.</p>
   <p>"I should like to tell you about Czernin's mendacity. He had the cheek to contend that Czech mothers do not support the revolution against Austria! I have received numerous letters from Czech mothers which brand Czernin's contention a falsehood. I offer one such letter as an example for others. It reads: 'Your dad is already buried, and so is your brother--and you are still not in the Czechoslovak Army!' This letter was written to her son in Russia. It shows the attitude of Czech mothers, in whom rests the strength of our entire nation.</p>
   <p>"I came from Russia, where I said good-by to some 50,000 Czech soldier boys, who were fully equipped, and waiting to be speedily transferred to the battle fields in France. To accelerate this transfer is my task here in America. I was promised that an additional fifty thousand men will be ready within a reasonable length of time. This is going to answer Czernin's contention."</p>
   <span class="page-break">18</span>
   <p>The effect of the words of our dearest leader was immense. Waves of Sokol caps, hats, hands, and handkerchiefs went up into the air. Handkerchiefs first, before the people had dried the tears in their eyes and could utter cries of enthusiasm. "Kde Domov Muj" closed this gigantic demonstration which will never fade from our memories.</p>
   <p>Professor Masaryk was escorted to the door of his hotel by a Sokol guard of honor and police. Not until then did the throngs begin to disperse, confident that the man whose coming they had so eagerly anticipated would now be able to enjoy rest in perfect safety.</p>
