   <p>On the first day of May of this year, a new society--the Spolek Krajanu Blatne a Okoli (Society of Countrymen from Blatna and Vicinity)--was founded at Mr. Kafka's Hall, South Avers Avenue and West 26th Street. It is to be hoped that many of our countrymen and natives of Blatna Czechoslovakia, especially, will take interest in it and join the new society. All inquiries will be cheerfully answered by either Mr. Jan Krizek, 1900 South 56th Avenue, or by the temporary secretary, Mr. Frank Synek, 2213 South 56th Avenue, both of Cicero, Illinois.</p>
