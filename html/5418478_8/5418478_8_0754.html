   <p>The brilliant, heroic victory of our Yugoslav brothers has inspired the Bohemian nation to deeds of humaneness and charity by which the Bohemians have again proved that their minds are ruled by noble feelings, true brotherly love, and true love of humanity. All of Slavdom is proud of the success of the Slavic armies, and the largesse that the Bohemians have shown to those who suffer was nothing more than our duty.</p>
   <p>But during these times of noble enthusiasm, the Bohemian nation has forgotten its ever-present duties toward the most important interests of our nation and its minorities, whose care has been entrusted first to our Narodni Jednoty (National Societies) in the Bohemian crown lands [Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia] and to the Ustredni Matice Skolska (Central Scholastic Association) [in Prague] with its associate organization, particularly the association, Komensky in Vienna, for the founding and upkeep of Bohemian schools in lower Austria. Thus, our national defense is encountering a need much greater than ever before!</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>But we are not despairing. The largesse of the Bohemian nation, which was shown so selflessly and unanimously during the Slavs history-making days, warrants our trust that our nation will disperse the fears of our minorities and their central bodies by increased contributions, and that it will immediately supply the means necessary to secure all they need and thus enable them to fulfill all their duties and accepted obligations in the very near future.</p>
   <p>A report concerning the critical decrease of income of our central bodies for the protection of minorities has been submitted to the Ceska Narodni Rada(Bohemian National Council) [in Prague] which, in the meeting of its executive committee of November 23, 1912, definitely recognized the need for immediate help and recommended substantial support.</p>
   <p>We are therefore addressing an urgent appeal to all good Bohemians to prove their appreciation of the work of the central bodies for the protection of our minorities by early contributions, and we trust that our expectations <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>will not be disappointed.</p>
