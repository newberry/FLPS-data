   <p>P.2--Two distinguished countrymen will leave for Europe in a few days, Professor of Music Vilim and Dr. Padstata, former director of the institution for feeble-minded at Elgin, Ill. Abroad, Dr. Podstata, will be interested, principally, in institutions for the feeble-minded, hospitals and sanitariums, which he will visit in Germany and Austria. Professor Vilim wants to enjoy the beauties of the Italian country and music. The former will travel via the Hamburg American Steamship Line, whereas Professor Vilim will sail from New York to Naples. He will visit Rome, Milan, and make a trip to Sweden. Then, in Prague he will meet Dr. Podstata and together they will tour Bohemia. It was some 26 years ago, since Professor Vilim was in Bohemia and it is now his desire to acquaint himself with the progress and the changes that have been made since his last visit, generally, and specifically in the musical world. Because he must conduct personally the final examination and annual concert of his conservatory, he will return about June 1. Both men leave Chicago to-night, on the Pennsylvania Railroad.</p>
