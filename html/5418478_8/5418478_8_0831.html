   <p>During the whole of last year there was a movement among the Bohemian citizens of Chicago to arrange a general excursion to the old country; the originators of this idea worked hard, until they realized their undertaking when the time came to start the journey, numerous Bohemians arrived in Chicago from all western states, Nebraska, Kansas, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri; and so forth, to join the excursion which is starting from Chicago. The management of the excursion was in the hands of Mr. Tomas Kral and Mr. Frant Cemus of Chicago. The participants gathered together yesterday at 6 P.M. at the corner of 19th and Morgan Sts. accompanied by eight local Bohemian societies. The members of the excursion, numbering 200-250 people, marched in a gay procession to the Grand Trunk Depot, there to board a train for New York. A few short farewell speeches were delivered.</p>
   <p>The main destination of the excursion is the Bohemian capital, Prague, and the visiting of the new national theater there, erected and opened for the public last year.</p>
