   <p>The Bohemian Narodni Socialni Delnicka Beseda Fresl v Chicagu (National Socialist Workingmen's Club Fresl of Chicago), well known on account of its activities for the benefit of our boys during the war, is at present busy making preparation for an expedition to Bohemia. The Club appointed a committee for that purpose, and the expedition is to be undertaken at the time of the five hundredth anniversary of the death of our great war leader, John Zizka of Trocnov. [Translator's note: Zizka was the chief Hussite general during the first half of the fifteenth century.] The committee has devised a plan whereby the members of the club may make weekly or monthly savings deposits and thus accumulate the money necessary for the fare. The secretary of the Club is our well-known countryman, Mr. Anton Podlipsky, 1833 South Throop Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
