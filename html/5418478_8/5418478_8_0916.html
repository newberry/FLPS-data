   <p>The well-known violin virtuoso, Milan Lusk, son of Attorney Karel D. Lusk of Chicago, returned from Bohemia after three years devoted to studies of music. His goal was mastery of violin playing, in which he received the finishing instruction from Professor Otakar Sevcik, one of the greatest pedagogues of the world. He was welcomed by members of his family and many friends, among them J. H. Capek, also of Chicago, his former teacher, to whom belongs the credit of having been the first to recognize the young talent, and to lay the foundation for its development.</p>
   <p>During the years of his absence from Chicago, Mr. Lusk had changed considerably in one respect. He left as a twenty-one year old Chicago-born boy to whom the Czech language offered considerable difficulties, as is natural for one brought up as an American. He now has perfected himself in the Czech language, and according to his own admission, has forgotten a good deal of his English.</p>

   <p>What he had to relate about our old homeland could fill many newspaper columns. It reminds us of the words spoken by Vojta Benes on last year's Decoration Day celebrated in the Bohemian National Cemetery: "Our motherland is a graveyard."</p>
   <p>Mr. Lusk left Chicago in 1913 and went directly to Pisek, Bohemia, where Professor Sevcik sojourned at that time. He had originally intended to remain in Bohemia one year only, but later moved to Vienna, to finish his studies at the "Meisterschule" (a school for accomplished artists) where Professor Sevcik taught as the head of the violin department, making trips for that purpose from Pisek to Vienna. Mr. Lusk after having finished his studies, gave concert tours all over Austria, and appeared as soloist with the orchestra of the famous conductor, Oscar Nedbal. His intense artistic activity is attested by the fact that he has given fifty-four concerts for the benefit of the Austrian Red Cross for which he received the high decoration which he wore on his coat lapel on his arrival in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lusk gave a detailed account of the present conditions in Austria, and <span class="page-break">3</span>particularly, in Bohemia. He was astonished to hear from the representatives of the press and others that there is a gigantic organization in America, the Bohemian National Alliance, which is the protagonist of the just demands of our people. Mr. Lusk stated that Professor Thomas G. Masaryk is pictured in Austria as a man in the service of the Allies who is a detriment to the interests of the Czech nation. He further said, in essence: When the Allies, in answering the German and Austrian peace proposal, demanded the liberation of the Czechs, the proposition was rejected by Austria as being entirely out of place, and even arrogant, on the grounds that "the Allies had no right to speak in behalf of the Czechs who do not wish to become independent, but want to remain within the Austrian monarchy." The Czech press, which in reality would have been eager to be a sincere guide to the people, was forced to print this stuff.</p>
   <p>As long as Mr. Lusk remained in Austria, no difficulties were placed in his path. But when he appeared on the border to leave Austria, he had to undergo a gruelling investigation. His belongings, except those absolutely necessary, his <span class="page-break">4</span>musical and other annotations, were held back. They may not be returned to him until after the War. He went over into Switzerland, then went to France, afterwards going to Spain, where he embarked for New York. During the four and a half years of his abode in Europe, he had his ups and downs. He was feted when traveling as an artist and reaped rich rewards. But at times he had to suffer all the privations attendant upon war.</p>
