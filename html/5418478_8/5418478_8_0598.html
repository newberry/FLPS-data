   <p>It is about time that we got right down to the bottom of the Bohemian-Slovakian question and stopped considering it from personal viewpoints--whether or not we like this or that fellow in one of the camps advocating this or that opinion-- we do this too often. This certainly is not the time to "get even," to avenge ourselves for various petty annoyances, and--as the Slovan puts it--make little private deals. If our political actions in this gigantic struggle of forces of world-wide importance are to bring any real practical results, we should be the first to realize--it seems to me--that the present political action, here or in Europe, should not be used to serve as personal publicity for some of us, to get good "jobs" for others, or for still others, to judge the Bohemian-Slovakian question by their personal sympathy or antipathy to one or another actual or would-be leader. It is my modest opinion that there is so far no reason to fear, as some of us apparently do, that this great era has not found us on a high enough level, that it has not found us well enough prepared, and that even our hearts are not big enough, or warm enough, or sincere enough.</p>
   <p>If we track down the reasons which some people in Slovakia are using against us Bohemians, we find that they frequently have their origin in the personal failures of some individuals. Bohemian capital in Slovakia was reproached at one time for its failure to co-operate with the Slovaks and its preference for a rapprochement with Hungarian capital. This reproach was justified to some extent. Bohemian capital, organized in Bohemian banks, has never been in principle against co-operation with the Slovaks, but it asked some security for its investments, and the Slovaks, although they had about seventy-five banks of their own, did not seem in a position to give that security because they were too accustomed to the "Hungarian" ways of doing business and investing money. [Translator's note: That is, they give more regard to considerations of nationalistic character for instance, supporting "Hungarianizing"</p>
   
   <p>establishments regardless of the probability of losses.] The Bohemian banks, however, were awake. They made their trained employees available to Slovak financial institutions, and this method soon showed excellent results. It provided a basis for financial and commercial contacts with the Bohemian institutions, and the Slovak financial structure became so strengthened that when, in 1913, one Hungarian bank after another went into bankruptcy, the Slovaks could point proudly to the fact that not a single Slovak financial institution got into serious difficulties during that period.</p>
   <p>The fact that the Bohemian banks not only gave the Slovak financial enterprises the proper training in a short period of time, but also saved a great deal of the hard-earned money of the Slovak people simply cannot be denied. It was only natural that the Bohemian bankers always tried to see to it that the money entrusted to the Slovak financial institutions should be handled as safely as possible. Nobody should have been surprised when, for instance, the Zivnostenska Banka [Translator's note: the largest bank in Bohemia] in Prague, having financed to the extent of almost fifty per cent all the enterprises of the Tatra Bank [Translator's note: the oldest Slovak bank] could not see the American deals of that bank without taking action. It is well known that these deals brought the Tatra Bank to the brink of ruin, and it was only proper that the officers who caused the losses, which amounted to millions, were discharged, upon Zivnostenska Banka's insistence. This should not, however, be used by just those persons in the Slovak camp as a reason for working, here in America, against the closest Bohemian-Slovakian co-operation; although that action may have cost them their "jobs," it also prevented enormous losses to Slovak investors.</p>
   <p>These are the circumstances we have to bear in mind when we hear or read that some Slovaks are against a united Bohemian-Slovakian front. The view that what is being done in the old country is none of our, Americans' business, and that all should be left to the "recognized leaders in the old country"--to use the latest popular expression--is quite untenable and definitely wrong. I know quite well the kind of "political actions" for the benefit of the old country that are being taken here in America, but if we should not be in a position to make clear even the very principles of what the Bohemians' and Slovaks' political demands should be, no matter what happens to Austria-Hungary, and if we should have to wait for directions from home, it certainly would be much better if we here in America left everything alone. I do not mean to say that we should not work together with responsible elements over there, because that is, of course, the first condition of success, but we here must first make sure what our "political ideals" are, or plainly: what it is we want!</p>
   <p>Our political aims, our traditions, the meaning of all our cultural and economic work of the past decade, has been to strengthen Slovakia, to strengthen Bohemian-Slovakian unity. If our work in America follows the same principle, and goes along the same line, it will win praise from "the recognized leaders in the old country". I should go even so far as to maintain that to give the fullest measure of attention to the Slovaks, to try and convince them that they also have certain obligations toward us, is for us, American Bohemians, nothing less than a definite command. Conditions here and in the old country force me to this conclusion. Here in the United States, for example, we Bohemians enjoy being called the most advanced of the Western Slavs. It is, therefore, our duty to help the local Slovaks because we form with them, a block of one million souls in this country. Their progress, therefore, is also a matter of our own selfish interest. It is not at all irrelevant whether there are a million of us here, or only five hundred thousand, or on what cultural level we are, but it is really unnecessary to enlarge upon this matter.</p>
   <p>There are many reasons that date back to the homeland, and they are very important ones. Perhaps the one of greatest practical importance is the fact that the Slovak immigrants are among those who most frequently return to the old country. Anyone who is at all familiar with conditions, knows how much advanced are the ways of a Slovak who has American experience, who has acquired a broader vision, a wider horizon in this country, and what a wonderful influence he can have on others if he is a nationally awakened individual, a man who, in our sense of the term, "knows what he wants". We cannot be indifferent to this situation, if we realize that this country is the only place where we can, without fear of trouble, promote our Bohemian-Slovakian political ideals.</p>
   <p>What I have tried to indicate here so far, is that Bohemian-Slovakian unity is not dangerous for the Slovaks, that the reasons given against Bohemian-Slovakian unity by certain local factions cannot be seriously defended, that the question of that unity is a timely and important question for us in America as well, and, therefore, that we here in this country are fully justified in considering it.</p>
   <p>The future Bohemian state which now, after the capitulation of the fortress of Przemysl must be considered a certainty, will certainly not be a creation of news articles, something that exists on paper only. The fact is that we shall be called upon, for the first time in centuries, to manage our own affairs again. Of course, it is too early to predict now whether Bohemia and the Bohemian lands will be an independent state, or a state within a state. I do not intend at all to try and indicate the future tasks of a Bohemian state, but it seems certain that it will have to pay a great deal of attention to its neighbors. It is certain that the first thing this state will run up against in the discussions of juridical conditions in what is now Austria-Hungary, will be the question of--Slovakia. It is no secret that the Bohemians have never recognized the juridical and state-political [sic] division of the monarchy [into the Austrian and Hungarian parts]. In the event that Austria-Hungary should survive, the demand for reunification, will be again raised by Bohemian politicians, I am informed if for no other reason than to outweigh the influence of the German alpine states and the influence of Hungary. After the present successful advance of the Russian armies into Calicia, it is very unlikely that deputies from Calicia will ever again sit in the Austrian diet. Even though they hardly ever have been or would be on our side, their simple presence has and would bolster up the Slavic consciousness of the deputies of the now dying monarchy. It, therefore, becomes necessary that our relation to the Slovaks and their actions, and their relation to us and our actions, should be fully cleared up in all details.</p>
   
   <p>This, however, is not quite possible right now because our Slovaks support, financially and otherwise, political action of their own in the old country, political action which has no relation to our action, and was started without even an attempt being made to reach an agreement with us in regard to a political line which would be identical, or at least parallel with ours. Even if we in America were not to take any initiative in indicating our political aims, were not to take any political action of our own, it would not mean that we did not have the right to express a definite opinion concerning the scope of the Bohemians' political demands. Without placing any emphasis upon the action of the Jugoslavs who, in their recent congress, expressed themselves quite clearly and openly against Austria, and defined their requirements in their demand for a state in which all the Jugoslavs would be united, I wish to call attention to the standpoint expressed by the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League), an institution which may not be as important as it should be, but officially represents the Slovaks just the same.</p>
   <p>The president of that league says literally in his letter to the Paris congress:</p>
   
   <p>"....It is my opinion that we should join the Bohemians and work with them in an effort to create a Bohemian-Slovakian state, in which the Slovaks would have autonomy. Some of our men, otherwise experienced and well-known political leaders, are of the opinion, however, that with autonomy we would do very well even in 'Hungary', that we would do even better than in some Bohemian, or Bohemian-Slovakian state, because having once won autonomy, the Hungarians would represent a lesser danger than the Bohemians. That is, the Hungarians would not assimilate us, but we should soon assimilate them; whereas we would easily be assimilated by the Bohemians, and would disappear as far as our language is concerned, merging fully with the Bohemian nation."</p>
   <p>Since this is the statement of the president of the Liga, it is certainly not his personal opinion alone, but is rather, an opinion shared by a whole group of individuals, and carries definite weight. It is, at least to some extent, an official opinion, and shows that the American Slovaks are not opposed in principle to Slovakia's eventual union with Hungary, or the Magyars. After the Jugoslov anti-Austrian manifestation and the obvious, though not yet officially proclaimed anti-Austrian stand of the Bohemians, the Slovaks, at least as represented by the Liga, are the only Austrian Slavs who would still look for their salvation within the disintegrating Hapsburg monarchy, even after the sad experiences they have had with it. What is more, the Austrian Poles have now taken a more separatist position, but their attitude has been even more pitiful than that of the Slovaks thus far [sic].</p>
   <p>Now it is imperative that we express our opinion concerning this position because this position has served the Slovaks as a basis for their memorandum to the Allies. The Slovaks' political ideas have been as ambiguous as their political position. None of the many and important Slovak leaders in the old country, whom I know intimately, would or could have agreed with them unless they reversed themselves completely and decided to proceed diametrically against the aims they had been pursuing for the past fifty years.</p>
   <p>If we, therefore, study carefully all the events that would strengthen the idea of a Bohemian state, we cannot afford to leave the Slovak question to mere chance, or to a spontaneous development of one kind or another. Present conditions make it imperative that we come to a mutual agreement with them, and then proceed on a united front basis. That this has not been done before, prior to the preparation of the Slovak memorandum to the Allies, is to be greatly regretted. There is still time, however, to correct this mistake. The great political aims which circumstances have created for the Bohemians and Slovaks, here and in the old country, are worth a thorough discussion of the question in all its aspects. And there is still time.....</p>
