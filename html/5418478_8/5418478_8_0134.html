   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Komora (Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce) has begun extensive preparations for a reception in honor of the delegates of the Cesko-Americka Obchodni Vyprava (Bohemian-American Commercial Expedition [to Czechoslovakia]) and those of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) [who visited the same country]. The reception is to take place on October 18, 1922, at 6:30 P. M., and its purpose is to afford the members of these two expeditions and their friends an opportunity to meet, to be entertained, and to exchange their views and news about the old homeland.</p>
   <p>There can be no doubt that the participants of the two expeditions will welcome this piece of news with great pleasure, for the project was discussed even <span class="page-break">2</span>before the expeditions arrived in Europe. To satisfy the anticipations of the Czechoslovaks of Chicago who were members of either expedition, the Komora got busy and started preparations for an evening of entertainment connected with a banquet to be given for the aforementioned participants.....It will be a reunion which every member of the two expeditions is looking forward to. The next committee meeting, in which details of the affair will be discussed, will be held on September 26, 1922, at 8 P. M. in Mr. Schnabl's restaurant, West 26th Street and Trumbull Avenue. All members of the Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce and the participants of either of the two expeditions are invited to attend. </p>
