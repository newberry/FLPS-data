   <p>The Builders Brick Company, a well-known Bohemian enterprise, in its annual meeting resolved to donate for the cause of Dr. Alice Masaryk Fund the sum of twenty-five dollars and another sum of twenty-five dollars for crippled children in the school of Professor Bakule. [First two names not given; Bakule School for Crippled Children is located in the city of Prague, Czechoslovakia.] This generous deed surely is worthy of recognition by our Czech-slavonic public.</p>
