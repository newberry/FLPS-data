   <p>The Chicago Journal in last night's issue printed an editorial in which Czech independence is warmly advocated, and the United States is urgently requested to follow other powers in recognizing it. The article reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Three powers have formally recognized the Czechoslovak people as an independent ally. France initiated this action, as she always does, in a calm, logical manner. Italy was next, and now Great Britain has taken the same step, prompted by a noble inspiration. The United States should be the fourth power. The sooner it recognizes Czechoslovak independence, the more our prestige will be enhanced, and our policy furthered. Twenty-four hours ago a message was smuggled in, announcing that seventy-four Czech soldiers had been executed, hundreds of civilians arrested, and German and Hungarian garrisons augmented. This is only a drop in the sea of blood <span class="page-break">2</span>spilled. Tens of thousands of Czechs and Slovaks have been hanged, shot to death, or starved in prison since the beginning of the war.</p>
   <p>"If service be the price of freedom, then the Czechoslovaks have the clearest right to it. Although shackled, they have smashed all Austria, which is now held only by the German supergovernment. They have conquered the German and the Austrian armies in an unequal struggle. They are now fighting on the Western Front in France and also rendering valuable service to Italy. They are the main force supporting Russia against a mixture of bolshevism and kaiserism, and their career in that country amounts to an epic not heard of up to today.</p>
   <p>"There are, however, still more potent reasons for the recognition of Czechoslovak independence. It is necessary to choke Prussianism to death. Study your map as you will, and you will not be able to conceive of the <span class="page-break">3</span>idea of a free Europe without an independent Czechoslovak state. That flat land surrounded by mountains is the key to liberty for central and eastern Europe. As long as that land is ruled by Berlin or by Vienna, there will always be the menace of a Pan-German empire. Czech lands must be freed because they need independence--because they deserve their freedom, which is at the same time necessary for our own safety. Why should we postpone acknowledgment of these plain facts?"</p>
   <p>The Evening Post in last night's issue also treats this vital question:</p>
   <p>"The Czechoslovak nation has become a reality through its recognition by Great Britain, France, and Italy and through the sympathy extended to it in the United States. That nation has been organized by the Czechoslovak National Council and is represented by three armies fighting for democracy on three fronts. Its people does not pledge fealty to the Hapsburgs any more, but <span class="page-break">4</span>on the contrary it is a sworn enemy of Austria and Germany. Its country is still under the command of the oppressors, true enough, but its people are revolting, and only military rule is able to maintain a vestige of Vienna's authority in Bohemia and Moravia. This means the beginning of the decay of Austria-Hungary, and the Allies are unanimous in their intention to see Austria-Hungary destroyed.</p>
   <p>"One glance at the map will demonstrate the strategic importance of the Czechoslovak terrain. This territory, hemmed in by mountains, is a sort of mailed fist thrust between the ribs of Germany. It will stultify the designs of Prussia to merge the smaller, weaker countries if it is governed by men who do not recognize the sovereignty of Berlin. Czechoslovakia will take along the eastern Slavs. It will be the beacon light of liberty and revolution for the Yugoslavs and the Poles.</p>
   <p>"It is for the United States to get together with the democracies across <span class="page-break">5</span>the ocean in their attitude toward the Czechoslovak nation. The manifestation of sympathy sent by the State Department recently should be followed up by a full, formal recognition of the Czechoslovak National Council as the trusted representative of the future independent Czechoslovak government.</p>
   <p>"We must not be less bold and definite in our proclamation regarding this matter! There is no reason for giving any consideration to the attitude of Vienna. There can be no hope for a separate peace with the Dual Monarchy--a peace in the interest of Germany. We have a duty to perform toward that great element of our population, the Czechoslovak people, and we should give every help to that valiant nation."</p>
