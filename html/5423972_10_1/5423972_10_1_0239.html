   <p>It seems now that our most affluent and influential Jewish citizens are realizing the Russian Refugees question if we accept the tone of the meeting Sunday last. Although the attendance was not as large asmight have been, yet those that were there were representative business men who will, no doubt, largely aid the society formally organized.</p>
   <p>There will certainly be a large influx of these unfortunate people and Chicago has been an objective point,and their unsystematic shipment has entailed great labor upon some of our business men in the most wanton manner. Since the last meeting some twenty more unfortunates have arrived here, and are being well cared for.</p>
   <p>Some more will now have to be inaugurated by which the general public (will) aid in relieving these refugees.</p>
