   <p>That's the name of the Society that was founded last evening, according to the plan proposed by the Jewish Courier.</p>
   <p>The plan to organize a society of a thousand members, in order to give each one an opportunity to win a farm in Palestine, as it was formulated in the Courier, was realized lastnight when "A Farm in Palestine Society" was founded.</p>
   <p>About thirty people gathered in the house of Mr. Abraham N. Shulman, 24 Newberry avenue. They came there when they read about the plan in the Courier, and were anxious to see that it is set in motion immediately. All were inspired by it. The result of the meeting was that within an hour, it was determined to found a society to be called "Nachloh Bezion." Temporary officers were elected by those present. It was also decided to apply for a charter at once, and to formulate the plan in writing, and to present it to the next meeting to be held the night after the Holidays.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will take place in the Hebrew Institute, the night after the Holidays.</p>
   <p>It is expected that at the next meeting the Society should increase its membership by a few hundred people.</p>
