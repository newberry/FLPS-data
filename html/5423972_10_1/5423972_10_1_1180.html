   <p>Prof. A. A. Michelson, head of the department of physics at the University of Chicago is now devising a new seismograph which will probably be installed in the Julius Rosenwald Hall for use by the departments of geology and geography.</p>
   <p>Professor Michelson has also devised the echelon spectroscope. His recent investigations at Yerkes Observatory with reference to the rigidity of the earth have furnished scientific proof that the earth resists the tidal forces of the moon and sun in about the same manner as though it were made of solid steel.</p>
