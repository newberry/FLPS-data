   <p>At the meeting of the Board, the chairman suggested a resolution in memory of Julius Rosenwald. Mr. James Davis indicated that the Board should go much further than a mere resolution. Mr. Rosenwald was one in a generation and not every generation produced a man of his type. He was one of the founders of the J. C. and through its entire history until his death,was active in its work. Mr. Davis went on to state that no hasty action should be taken. Rather a committee ought to be appointed to discuss the possible ways of establishing a fitting memorial to the memory of Mr. Rosenwald.</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher thought that a committee might be appointed in line with Mr. Davis' suggestion.</p>
