   <p>At the last convention of the Order, Nights of Zion, a Jewish colony was determined to be built in Palestine - a place where Jews will be able to settle under the supervision of the Jewish National Fund Bureau.</p>
   <p>The colony which the Order intends to purchase will be an additional place to the home, which hundreds of thousands of Jews are now deprived of......Many sources have contributed to this fund to date.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Ginsburg, chairman of the National Fund Bureau in Chicago, turned to the Chicago Rabbinate and social workers for support in this movement and it was decided that the rabbis will appeal in every synagogue for this purpose.</p>
