   <p>The nomination of Hugo Pam by the Republican-Party for Judge of the Circuit Court is a splendid testimonial to a young man who has taken an active part in Jewish philanthropic-work. He has, for several years, been a valuable member of the Board of Directors of the Y.M.A.J.C. He has also given much of his time to the Chicago Hebrew Institute, lecturing there several evenings a week.</p>
   <p>Also as a lawyer, Mr. Pam is a man of acknowledged ability.</p>
