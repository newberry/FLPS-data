   <p>A banquet was given Sunday night in the Gold Room of the Congress Hotel in honor of Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt, who is leaving soon for Europe where he will remain for three months. The banquet was attended by five hundred people, men and women who are the most prominent and best known in the Jewish community of Chicago. The banquet was magnificently arranged.</p>
   <p>Judge Henry Horner was toastmaster. He was introduced by Max Korshak. Judge Horner characterized Mr. Rosenblatt as "the man who works in the field of Jewish charity."</p>
   <p>The following people were called upon to speak: B. Horwich, Charles Herron, Judge [Hugo] Pam, Judge [Joseph] David, and Judge [Harry M.] Fisher, who, as usual, gave a very appropriate speech. All the speakers spoke of Mr. Rosenblatt's <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>importance as a Jewish civic worker, and wished him and his wife a happy journey and return.</p>
   <p>The guest of honor replied in an appropriate speech, thanking the public for the honor given to him and assuring it that he would endeavor to make himself worthy of that honor by working in the field of Jewish charities and as a member of the Chicago Jewish community.</p>
   <p>A rich and varied program of entertainment was arranged. Jaques Amado, a celebrated tenor, sang a few operatic arias. He was accompanied at the piano by Professor Isidore Buchalter. They made a great hit. The stormy applause that broke out after each number was well deserved by the rising star in the world of music and by the well-known pedagogue. The rest of the program was taken up by Nat Lewis of the vaudeville, and Miss Hamilton who sang a few songs.</p>
   <p>The guest of honor, on this occasion, was presented with a portrait of himself, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>his wife, and three sons, painted by Dr. Z. Klaper.</p>
   <p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Julius Rosenwald were among the guests present at the banquet.</p>
   <p>The banquet was arranged by Mr. H. L. Meites and by Mr. Max Korshak.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Rosenblatt left last night for New York, and from there, will sail for Europe. A large group of friends accompanied the travelers to the depot.</p>
