   <p>Over three thousand people, Jews as well as Gentiles, filled the Chicago Sinai Congregation yesterday morning to pay their last respects to the deceased rabbi of the temple, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch. A huge crowd stood outside because there was no room in the temple.</p>
   <p>Among the prominent personalities present were: Julius Rosenwald, Judge Henry Horner, Dr. Harry F. Judson, president of the University of Chicago, Bishop Charles P. Anderson of the Episcopalian Church, Alexander Revell, and many others.</p>
   <p>Despite the wish of the deceased that there be no flowers at his funeral, heaps of floral wreaths were sent by those who did not know this. The Chicago Luxemburg Verein also sent flowers. Dr. Hirsch was a native of Luxemburg.</p>
