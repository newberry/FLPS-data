   <p>The response given by the Chicago Jewry to the relief-appeal from the Jews in Palestine showed, once again, that the Jewish people throughout the entire world are a homogeneous race; that the brotherly sympathy of one Jew toward another does not become weakened by distance or differences of nationality; that even now, as in the past, all Jewish hearts beat together and all Jewish eyes are turned towards the East, where the cradle of the Jewish race stood; and which is also the land of our hopes.</p>
   <p>In every Jewish synagogue, was heard the sighs of the Jews who had left the countries of the Diaspora, and returned to the Jewish homeland to study and practice the works of God, or to become pioneers for a new, modern colony. Results show that those synagogues immediately responded to the appeal for bread for the Palestine Jews. The donations, ranging from 25 cents to $100, are pouring in steadily.</p>
   <p>It is needless to say that regardless of how large the contribution of the Chicago Jewry might be, it will not be enough to satisfy our famished brethren. Therefore, every Jew should exert all his energy to cooperate and try to influence other Jews to cooperate. Let no one forget that there are hungry Jews who are in need of bread, and that these Jews in Palestine have no one to depend on except us upon whom God bestowed the blessing of being in a country where peace prevails, and where we share an abundance of everything.</p>
   <p>May our rabbis, preachers, civic leaders, and welfare workers remind the Jewish public on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) of their obligations, and may the Jewish public respond with open hands. All Jews must help the Jews in Palestine.</p>
