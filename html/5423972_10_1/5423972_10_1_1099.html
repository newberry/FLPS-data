   <p>The Jewish Courier announces the appointment of the well-known young lawyer, civic leader and political progressive, Emil N. Zola, as its managing editor, effective at once.</p>
   <p>The new managing editor of the Courier is one of the best known lawyers in Chicago, having attained a national reputation through his political and social activities.</p>
   <p>He began his career as a civic and progressive leader immediately after graduating as a lawyer. When Roosevelt founded the Bull Moose party, Mr. Zola became one of its firmest supporters and one of its leaders in Chicago. In 1913 he was elected State Representative of the 23rd Senatorial District on the progressive ticket, and served his term of two years, establishing a brilliant record as champion of the working people and as advocate of social legislation, especially for women's suffrage, an eight hour working day for women, and many other important acts of legislation.</p>

   <p>In fact, he was the Floor Leader of the Bull Moose Group in all its important activities in the Legislature. He was also the youngest member of the Assembly.</p>
   <p>When the Bull Moose party was liquidated, Mr. Zola remained a progressive, and when Woodrow Wilson was nominated for president, the new managing editor of the Courier organized the Wilson Independent League to which belonged the outstanding progressive leaders.</p>
   <p>In the life of Chicago's Jewry Mr. Zola occupies a unique and prominent position, thanks to his organizational abilities. He is secretary of the Lawndale Club, an active member of the Covenant Club, Bnai Brith, the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities and chairman of the Jewish Campaign of the Third American Liberty Loan in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zola was born in Riga, 30 years ago, and came to Chicago at the age of four. His father, the Reverend Abraham Leib Zola of 2615 North Troy Street, gave him an <span class="page-break">3</span>Orthodox Jewish education, to the extent that he is considered one of the few Jewish-American young men to possess a thorough knowledge of Judaism.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zola lives at 3507 Douglas Boulevard, and is the son-in-law of Mr. Isaac Lurie, of the Lurie Lumber Co.</p>
