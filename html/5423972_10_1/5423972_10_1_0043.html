   <p>In the medical world it is an established fact that a man can talk himself into certain diseases. He imagines that he suffers from a certain sickness, while in reality he is totally sound. He believes, however, in his imagination for so long that he finally really begins to suffer.</p>
   <p>That which is possible among individuals is also possible among nations. The best illustration of this truth is the tumult about the danger to America of immigration.</p>
   <p>This theoretical concept-- that America is suffering from an immigration disease--has been born recently. Nevertheless, it is a fact that this fancy has become wide-spread, encompassing broader and more influential circles. So strongly has it taken root, it even intrigues the friends of immigration. The whimsical idea has gone so far that even the nationalistic Jews are seeking ways and means to regulate immigration in this country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>But, truthfully, is there such a thing as an immigration problem in America?</p>
   <p>If we examine the facts, and if we do not wilfully distort or misconstrue them, we must conclude that there exists no immigration problem in America, and that the whole tumult about the danger of immigration in this country has been artificially created. So far as the life and conditions of this country are concerned, there are no grounds which justify this tumult.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, if we investigate the real conditions and interests of the United States, we can understand readily that our country would be confronted with a most critical problem, if immigration to our shores should cease. It will suffice merely to imagine how the United States would appear today if, let us say, we would have closed the doors of America twenty years ago. Then we can understand what the exclusion of immigrants would mean to our land.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>It is the immigrants who have made this country what it is. It is the constant flow of new labor power, and new energy, which the immigrants brought, which has placed this comparatively young country much higher, in practically all phases of human life, than all other, and older countries. It would be disastrous for this country to check suddenly the stream of new elements onto our shores. Our country would then lose the most significant factor of its development, and would come to a standstill. This truth is, it seems, so clear and simple that it requires no profound wisdom nor scientific knowledge to see it clearly. But the whimsical idea is so prevalent that even our nationalists are willing to admit that there exists an immigration problem, which requires solution.</p>
   <p>The cry about the danger of immigration comes from two opposing and bitterly antagonistic elements. From one side the immigrant is harassed by the "blue-blooded" American aristocrat who seems to think that there is a homogeneous American nation, and he is deeply concerned lest the purity of this American nation be defiled. He begins to tremble when he thinks that the blue blood of <span class="page-break">4</span>the American Yankee is apt to commingle with the red blood of the Slav or German. The aristocratic native is intensely provoked at the foreign traditions, foreign spirit and foreign culture which the immigrants bring with them. And in addition he is convinced that the immigrant brings the spirit of turbulence and revolt against property, law and order.</p>
   <p>On the other side the American laborer steps out against the immigrant.</p>
   <p>The average American worker, who is not a great thinker and who can see no farther than his own nose, looks upon the immigrant as a competitor for his job. He views this in a superficial manner. He knows that, in all times, there are unemployed in America. This indicates that there is not enough work for all. Yet if new people, who seek employment, are added to this lot, it means that the newcomer, who obtains a job, takes it away from some one who lived here before. Thus the American worker sees the situation in this light. And his leaders, instead of enlightening him about his erroneous mode of thinking, play upon <span class="page-break">5</span>the false illusions of the not highly educated worker, and make the immigrant the scapegoat of the workers' own incompetence. The arguments presented from both directions against immigration cannot withstand the slightest analysis. Basically they are false. The native does not understand that this country is not composed of one homogeneous nationality; the American nation is made up of all the nationalities who come here. Consequently, his reasoning about the "purity of the American nation" has no meaning. Just as worthless are his arguments about foreign traditions and foreign culture, because America has not, as yet, one tradition or one culture of her own. If immigrants would have left their spirit and culture behind, America would be without culture. And if we have a beautiful and varied culture, we owe thanks to the first immigrants who landed on our shores and transplanted their "foreign" culture to this soil. Thus we see how false and erroneous are the arguments of the native aristocracy.</p>
   <p>Now let us see of what value are the arguments presented by the American worker and his leaders.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The first and most significant argument put forth by the American worker against immigration is: the immigrant worker will not organize and will therefore work for lower wages than the American, which results in pushing the latter out of the labor market by replacement.</p>
   <p>How much truth this argument contains can be seen by the following figures. In the first fourteen years of the American Federation of Labor's existence, from 1886 to 1900, the Federation counted a membership of one million. For the following ten years, 1900-1910, which were the heaviest immigration years of American history, the membership of the Federation increased by one million and a half. At the end of 1910, the Federation counted two and one half million members. These figures speak for themselves and prove the falseness of the argument that the immigrant refuses to unionize.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that the major labor struggles that occurred in this country were carried on by immigrant workers. The strongest and most radical unions in this country are composed chiefly of workers who have not even learned the American <span class="page-break">7</span>language. And if the unions do not accept all workers, it is not the fault of the immigrant, but rather of the American Unions which are based on the principle of repelling rather than attracting new people. It is a fact that along with immigration, the American labor movement grew, and the heavier immigration becomes, the stronger the American labor movement is. In short, the entire fight against immigration is based upon false and unfounded grounds, and can be contested easily. This should be the duty of the friend of immigration.</p>
   <p>Once and for all, it must be made clear that the anti-immigration movement is just as harmful to America as it is to the prospective immigrant. The friends of immigration might bear in mind, that by their talk about "regulating immigration," they indirectly admit that this country suffers thereby, creating a formidable weapon in the hands of the enemy. To regulate immigration is, generally speaking, nonsense. No one can regulate it as well and as satisfactorily as it can itself. After all, immigration to this country is not a wild stampede which we need fear. People do not come here by falling from heaven. All immigrants who come here have friends and relatives who informed them beforehand whether or <span class="page-break">8</span>not it would pay for them to come. We therefore witness an increase in immigration in good times, and a decrease when the industrial condition of the country is not favorable. All talk about "regulating" is naught but a waste of time and to a certain extent malicious. What the friends of immigration should do is to carry on a systematic educational campaign, and with fact, figures and documentary evidence, refute the false and erroneous arguments of the foes of immigration, and thus cure the American public opinion of an imaginative disease.</p>
