   <p>In 1850 a gifted young teacher arrived in Chicago. His name was Leopold Mayer. He was born in Abenheim, Germany, a village in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, on March 3, 1827. He was educated in the teachers' seminary at Bensheim, and for four years he taught in his native country. His first work in Chicago was as a teacher of German and Hebrew in private families. In 1853 the Garden City Institute was opened, and Mr. Mayer was taken into the faculty as a teacher of these languages. In the Jewish community, Mr. Mayer at once became a power, and to him must be awarded the laurel-wreath for having paved the way for reform-Judaism in Chicago and in the State of Illinois. His interest in reform-Judaism in Chicago made it possible for later friends of reform to establish the "Reform Verein", in which society Mr. Mayer was one of the main moving spirits.</p>
   <p>In 1851 Mr. Mayer established in Chicago, a religious private school, and for the first time in Illinois he publicly conferred the right of confirmation upon a Jewish boy, one of his pupils, in the Anshe Maarabh sygnagogue.</p>

   <p>The confirmant spoke his part in English, and the teacher addressed the congregation in German.</p>
