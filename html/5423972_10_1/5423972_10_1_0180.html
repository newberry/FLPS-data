   <p>Mr. E. W. Levin-Epstein, the well known Zionist and manager of the Carmel Wine Company of America, arrived in Chicago yesterday morning. He will be here only eight days, during which time he will inspect the branch house of the Carmel Wine Co.</p>
   <p>However, the main object of his visit to Chicago is to see what can be done for the good of Zionism in Chicago. Soon after the last convention of the Knights of Zion, the organization showed signs of new life. Some of the old members have reorganized. Many new Gates are being founded and it is a certainty that Mr. Levin-Epstein, with his devotion to Zionism, will accomplish a great deal for the cause.</p>
