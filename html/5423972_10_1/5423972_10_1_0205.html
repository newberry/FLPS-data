   <p>That the time shortly may come when the American and the Jew, each with a country of which to be proud, shall preach and enjoy the doctrine of personal liberty was the dream outlined last evening by Rev. S. Margolies before the mass meeting of Knights of Zion at the Studebaker Theater. Nearly 1,500 enthusiastic disciples of the Zion movement were present and the predictions outlining a speedy culmination of the desire to regain Palestine were warmly applauded.</p>
   <p>"Zionists are optimists," said Dr. Margolies, the chief speaker, "and for excellent reasons. The time for weeping and crying among the Jews is rapidly passing away. Thirty-five hundred years of persecution and sorrow is sufficient and a new era is opening for the Hebrew.</p>
   <p>"It is fitting that the Jews should have a country and a city of which they may be proud. England has her London, Germany her Berlin, America her New York, Russia her St. Petersburg, and the Jew shall have his Zion.</p>
   <p>"Young Americans are told to be proud of their Americanism because America has institutions, privileges, hopes which warrant pride. The young Jew, on the other hand, has nothing now on which to build his nationality.</p>
   <p>"Once with a country of our own, neither Russia nor any other nation will dare to assail our right to life and the enjoyment of liberty."</p>
   <p>Visitors Welcomed to Chicago</p>
   <p>An address of welcome in behalf of Mayor Harrison was delivered to the visiting knights by Dr. Howard S. Taylor, in which the peaceful crusade of the Zionists was compared to the ancient efforts of the crusaders under Richard III.</p>
   <p>Interspersed with the addresses was an excellent musical program, including the singing of the "Hatikvah" or Zionist national hymn, a piano sole by Dr. C. F. Balatka and a selection by Miss Birdie Kaplan.</p>
   <p>The program closed with an appeal to all Jews to ally themselves with the movement by Grand Master Leon Zolotkoff of the Order Knights of Zion.</p>
   
   <p>Meetings were held throughout yesterday at the headquarters of the West Chicago Club, 50 Throop Street, and an informal banquet was given in the afternoon, at which prominent speakers from other cities expressed their views on the Zionist movement in general.</p>
   <p>At the morning session, which opened the business of the seventh annual convention, the keynote was struck when Grand Master announced that nothing less than a return of the Jews to Palestine would satisfy the leaders of the movement.</p>
   <p>Urges Return to Palestine</p>
   <p>The thought was further developed in the address of Grand Recorder, Max Shulman, in the conclusion of his annual report.</p>
   <p>"Only in a home on the soil from whence we sprang," he said, "will we be able to animate our language and our history. Only on the land where our fathers lived, fought and died can we build our nest.</p>
   
   <p>"Gather ye children, of Israel, from the four corners of the globe under our royal banner of national independence."</p>
   <p>At the afternoon banquet, which was given under the auspices of the Clara De Hirsch ladies' "gate," or chapter, N. D. Kaplan, chairman of the convention committee, officiated as toastmaster. Speeches were made by B. Horwich of Vienna, who spoke on "The Products of Palestine," and Rabbi B. Margolis of Cleveland, Ohio. Telegrams and letters from Israel Zangwell, Dr. Max Heller of New Orleans, Michael Davit and others unable to attend the convention, but interested in the movement, were read to the assembled delegates.</p>
   <p>At to-day's sessions reports of the committees on resolutions and on nominations will be heard. The election and installation of officers will take place in the evening.</p>
   <p>The Order of the Knights of Zion was organized in October 1898, at Chicago to utilize the fraternal system of instilling life into the movement and to establish a more effective basis for promoting the Zionist principles.</p>
   
   <p>From a small beginning the organization has grown to a membership of over 2,500 in fifty seven chapters, scattered throughout ten central states.</p>
