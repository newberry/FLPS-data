   <p>Thanks to the unceasing efforts of Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, Mrs. Anna Wolinsky, together with her four children, has been saved from deportation to the land of the Czar. They were detained for seventeen days on Ellis Island because one of the children, the twelve-year-old Moishe, was declared by the immigration officers to be mentally ill. Yesterday morning the entire family arrived safely in Chicago. They were received by Mrs. Wolinsky's brother-in-law, Mr. N. Tarnapole, 1231 South Fairfield Avenue, who had put up a $5,000 bond to gain permission for them to land.</p>
