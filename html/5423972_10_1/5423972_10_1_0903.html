   <p>Mayor Thompson appointed Louis Bomash a member of the Chicago Plan Commission. This honor was bestowed upon Mr. Bomash because of his expertness in real estate values of the city and his familiarity of the future needs of Greater Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bomash was born in Kalvaria, Suwalk, Russia, on January 10, 1869, the son of Rabbi Abram Bomash, a noted scholar. Chicago became his home three years later. His eventual success in the business world led to the presidency of the Independence State Bank, which position he assumed in 1917, and has held to the present.</p>
   <p>He has been vice-president of the Marks Nathan Orphan Home and treasurer of its building committee, and is at present a director of the Jewish Charities of Chicago. Recently his interests were aroused in the Hebrew Theological Seminary to which he contributed $3,000, the largest single donation in the history of that institution.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bomash is also a member of the Covenant Club, B'nai B'rith, Odd Fellows, Chicago Real Estate Board, Chicago Association of Commerce, and the Illinois Bankers' Association.</p>
