   <p>Last week Ferdinand Heimbach, whose face and name were familiar to most members of the Jewish community of two decades ago, passed away. He had been called by Sinai in 1867 to take charge of its day school. Shortly after his arrival, Sinai resolved to abandon its day school but Mr. Heimbach continued in the service of the congregation as reader and principal of the religious school until 1886 when he retired. He entered the employment of the county where he was attached to the sheriff's office. Mr. Heimbach was a native of Germany.</p>
