   <p>Mrs. Solomon Newberger, nee Mollie Netcher, owners of the Boston Department Store, was the donor of two camelopards to the Zoological Garden in Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>This Jewess, a Chicago millionairess, bought these animals from Hagenbeck, the well known trainer of wild animals, as a special gift to the City of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The animals were captured in Egypt and named Anthony and Cleopatra. Mrs. Newberger has not yet seen them.</p>
   <p>The camelopards are one year old, nine feet high, and weigh approximately from one thousand to twelve hundred pounds each. They cost, including their transportation, about eight thousand dollars.</p>
