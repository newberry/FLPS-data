   <p>Russian Jewry is active in various cultural and artistic fields. The more it was betrayed and oppressed, the more it developed its social and cultural talents.</p>
   <p>And, one of the large number of artists who do honor to the Jewish reputation, who possesses the ability to develop the most beautiful melodies, is the famous Russian Jewish pianist, Mossaiye Boguslawski, who has chosen Chicago as his home.</p>
   <p>Boguslawski, aside from his being a first class artist, is a man possessed of radical views and is in addition, consciously Jewish.</p>
