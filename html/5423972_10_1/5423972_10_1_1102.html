   <p>Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, Rabbi of Sinai Temple, declared in a statement yesterday that he will, in his next Sunday's sermon, remove every doubt concerning his loyalty to the United States.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch made this statement on account of the report that a petition is being circulated to demand his resignation from Sinai Temple on the ground that he is pro-German. Dr. Hirsch admitted that he likes the Germans because he was born and reared in Germany. He said that nine relatives of his were in the German army, three in the English, and three in the French army. He also stated that he is in full sympathy with President Wilson's position and does not believe that he (Dr. Hirsch) will be fired after thirty-seven years of service in his temple.</p>
   <p>"I was a pacifist," said Dr. Hirsch, "but now I am no more pacifist than President Wilson. The president's opinions were always my opinions and I fully agree to every word that he has written.</p>
   <p>"I was active in peace work for thirty years and in that time, I was in a peaceful atmosphere, and as for the president, I do not believe that the doctrine of hatred should be preached.</p>

   <p>"This trouble began a few weeks ago, when I received a letter from the State Counsel of Defense, which ended with these words: "It is therefore necessary for all loyal citizens and organizations to celebrate the anniversary of America's admission in the war for the continuation of Christian civilization.</p>
   <p>"I read this letter from the altar of the temple and told the congregation that I believe that the members of the Defense Counsel made a mistake by using the word "Christian" in a letter that is addressed to a Jewish church.</p>
   <p>"Certain persons have, without doubt, interpreted my remark as appertaining to America's entering the war.</p>
   <p>"The United States entered the war, not because she wanted to, but because she had no other alternative, nevertheless, I still believe in peace. I am of the opinion that when peace negotiations will appear, honorable measures will be attained. But in case the negotiations will not succeed, then America will have to battle until the last man."</p>
