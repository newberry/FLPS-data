   <p>In a conversation regarding the Jewish hope for the peaceful acquisition of a home for the Jewish people in Palestine, a respectable Jew recently asked us whether an adult might expect to see, during his lifetime, the Jewish people in possession of Palestine. This Jew asked the question in such a tone as to intimate that if we could prove that such an event was possible, he would be ready to co-operate; but, if not--why should he spend his money and energy on an undertaking from which he, himself, would not derive any pleasure?</p>
   <p>If this respectable Jew were an exception, he wouldn't deserve even three lines of print. Unfortunately he is not the only one; there are thousands like him. If they thought that tomorrow would bring our redemption, a dollar would mean nothing to them. But because they are not certain, a <span class="page-break">2</span>shekel, which is only a dollar, is wasted when it is spent for this purpose.</p>
   <p>This is a deplorable, although a wonderful phenomenon. These people lack the imaginative spark in their spiritual makeup, or if you will, call it the poetry, which makes life so sweet. As some poet has said, life without poetry would be a constant agony--a process of slow death, from day to day. If man was only concerned with the things he could enjoy during the course of his life, he wouldn't build; he wouldn't plant; he wouldn't be concerned about the future of his children, nor would he care about his place in the future world. Yet he does all these things, not because he expects to derive any personal pleasure during his lifetime, but because his imagination envisions a future from which he derives pleasure during his lifetime.</p>
   <p>Nations have similar ideologies and each nation has its own concept of the future. So strong is this concept, among these nations, of a future which the present generation will not live to see, that for the sake of that <span class="page-break">3</span>future, thousands--millions of them go through fire.</p>
   <p>To the Jewish people, the power of imagination--the poetry of a people--was the power which helped them to survive the centuries of infernal torture. For the sake of the future of the Jewish people, which was visualized only in the imagination, Jews permitted themselves to be burned and racked. And now there emerge Jews who ask whether it is worth while to support the noble struggle for the possession of Palestine, which may not be realized during their lifetime.</p>
   <p>This indicates that the intellectual and imaginative strength of the Jews is weakening. Yet there are, in our times, enough concrete facts to excite the Jewish imagination and to forecast a picture of the Jewish future. These facts are more plentiful today than ever before in the history of the Jews in the Diaspora.</p>
   <p>Never, since the destruction of the Holy Temple, have they had a better <span class="page-break">4</span>chance to enter Palestine than they have today; never have the powers of the world given more consideration to Jewish rights in Palestine than at present, and never has the position of the nations been as favorable toward the Jew in his two-thousand-year-old struggle for nationalism.</p>
   <p>When have the Jews ever possessed their own villages and towns, their own trees and gardens, not as tenants but as landlords, in Palestine? When have Jews ever spoken their language, the language of their prophets, their ancestors, to the extent that they speak it now in Palestine? When have the powers of the world spoken so favorably about the Jewish Question as they speak now?</p>
   <p>Recently, we heard Sir Edward Grey officially declare that the interests of the Jews in Palestine would be considered after the war.</p>
   <p>Lord Kromer, British Governor General in Egypt, has taken the trouble to <span class="page-break">5</span>review, in the English magazine, Spectator, the book, Zionism and Jewish Knowledge. He says this:</p>
   <p>"One of the consequences of the war will be, without a doubt, the consideration of the whole Jewish Problem, and this will be done in quite a different manner from what has hitherto been done, under conditions entirely different from those prevailing up to the present time."</p>
   <p>Perhaps the change will not take place as rapidly as many of us would like, nevertheless all signs indicate that the time has come for great events to take place in the lives of our people. Just a little more power of imagination is necessary for the understanding of these forthcoming events.</p>
