   <p>It is quite consistent that the president of an educational institution like ours, should be, if it is possible, a member of the Board of Education. We are particularly proud to be in a position to announce to readers of the Observer that it was made possible for the president of our institution to go just one step further - not only to be a member of the Board of Education, but also to have been elected president of the Board of Education of the fourth largest city in the world.</p>
   <p>This honor we are not unmindful of, realizing that it lends considerable dignity to our institution to be the proud possessors of the president of the Board of Education of the city of Chicago, as the president of the Chicago Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>The Observer takes this opportunity of congratulating Mr. Loeb on his election to the presidency of the Board of Education.</p>
