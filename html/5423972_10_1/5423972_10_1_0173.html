   <p>After you have definitely decided to bring your family or members of your family or friends, from Europe to America, you must then ascertain the most reliable persons with whom to deal in respect to making arrangements for their coming here. Money is not the only requisite to getting your family here. You must make sure your ticket agent is an authorized agent, you should ascertain the ship that will bring your folks here and you must make sure all necessary arrangements have been made. Unless you have made all arrangements properly your family will encounter great difficulties as have so many thousands of other families. You should make sure your family is provided with the necessary expense money aside from their transportation expenses. Above all, make sure you are dealing with authorized agents and not people who will take your money and flee.</p>
