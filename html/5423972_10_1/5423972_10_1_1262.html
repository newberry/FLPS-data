   <p>The well-known Jewish philanthropist, Julius Rosenwald, has come out again with another real donation. This donation was given to the Council of the Grain Exchange, a central organization which looks after the interests of farmers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald divided this donation into two parts. The first part, which is a $100,000, will be placed with the council immediately and the other and biggest part, $900,000 will be given to the council when the success of this undertaking is assured. For the first $100,000, the council will send out one hundred well trained and practical farmers to different parts of the country to teach the farmers how to cultivate the soil, so that it will yield more fruit and better fruit.</p>
   
   <p>When these hundred farmers show success, Mr. Rosenwald will turn over the $900,000 to the council for the same purpose, of course, on a much larger scale. J. F. Merril, president of the Farmers' Council was, of course, overwhelmingly over-joyed. He had no words with which to express his thanks to Mr. Rosenwald for this gift.</p>
