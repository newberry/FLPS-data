   <p>The decoration of the Palme Academique which, about two months ago, was conferred on Morris Kozminski of this city is an honor which has not often been received by an American. It is granted by the French government, generally on account of distinction in literary and dramatic work. Unlike the Legion of Honor, it contains only one grade.</p>
   <p>The honor to Mr. Kozminski is a recognition of the courtesies shown by him to the French Commissioners and other visitors during the Exposition.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kozminski is only 32 years old, but has been for several years the western agent of the French Line of steamers. In 1893, he became a member of the banking house of Kozminski and Co.</p>
