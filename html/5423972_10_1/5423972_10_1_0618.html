   <p>A school of Zionism has been organized under the jurisdiction of the Order Knights of Zion for the purpose of lecturing on the historical "duty" the development, and the purpose of the Zionist movement.</p>

   <p>The founders are intending to make this a wandering school that will deliver each lecture of the course in a different vicinity in Chicago, so that Jews in the various vicinities may have the opportunity to learn something about Zionism. The best lecturers that Chicago possesses, will be selected.</p>
   <p>This school will be opened Monday - when the first lecturers will be made known.</p>
