   <p>The French Alliance Israelite, once the world Jewish organization, is today only a purely French Jewish organization. Jews outside of France say that the activities of the Alliance Israelite are determined by the colonial office and that its schools serve more French than Jewish purposes in the Orient. Such was at least the contention of the Jews in Germany and in Holland twelve years ago, when the alliance still had individual members throughout Central Europe. Its membership is limited to France and its colonies, because it is a French enterprise and because the Jews of all other countries have their own troubles and problems to deal with and cannot carry the philanthropic burdens of French Jewry. Another reason why the Jews outside of France no longer support the Alliance Israelite is because it is just one hundred and two per cent French and not one per cent Jewish. Its schools throughout the Orient bring up Frenchmen and not Jews. A Persian boy, who has attended an <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Alliance school for a period of six years, is a thorough Frenchman, speaks French, thinks in French terms, and likes France more than anything else in this world. The same is true of all other pupils of the schools of the Alliance in all other countries of the Orient. The European and American Jews cannot possibly see why they should support a French enterprise, and therefore the leaders of the Alliance must be reconciled with the thought that they are heads of a French organization and not of a national Jewish organization. This being the case, they have not the right of approaching the Jews of other European countries or of the United States with the request of supporting the Alliance. American Jews would not ask the French Jews to support a purely American Jewish enterprise, and the German Jews would not ask the Polish Jews to support a purely German Jewish enterprise.</p>
   <p>But the leaders of the Alliance Israelite, although perfectly aware of the fact that they represent a French Jewish organization, only that [it] is more French than Jewish, do approach the American Jews for money and do also approach Jews <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in different European countries for money. To the present day many Jews in Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, Egypt, and even in Hungary give money to the Alliance Israelite. Most of them do it because they still think of the Alliance as it existed forty years ago. They still think that the Alliance, as an international Jewish organization, is entitled to international Jewish support. Others do it for political reasons, but none does it because he is convinced that the Alliance is a productive Jewish organization.</p>
   <p>In America, too, there are hundreds of Jews who give money to the Alliance. In many Jewish communities in the [United] States, the Alliance is considered one of the international Jewish organizations worthy of support. In Milwaukee, for instance, the Alliance will get a certain amount of the money collected in the course of the present local charity drive. Why the Milwaukee Jewish community should allot a definite sum of the money derived from a local campaign to the French Alliance Israelite is beyond us. In New York, too, the Alliance can rely on certain elements and many New York Jews contribute annually to the Alliance Israelite.</p>

   <p>It is our contention that the Alliance, being a purely French Jewish organization, and probably a political annex of the French ministry for the colonies, has no right to ask Jews outside of France to come to its support, and it is also our contention that non-French Jews have no right to give money to the Alliance, because it serves French and not Jewish purposes. The attitude of the Alliance to everything Jewish is negative in character. During the Paris Peace Conference, the Alliance indulged in intrigues against the carrying out of the Balfour Declaration and nearly succeeded in wrecking all the plans of the Zionist leaders. The Alliance is not concerned with the bringing up of Jews in the Orient but is spreading French political influence among the natives. Under such conditions the American Jews have no more right to support the Alliance Israelite than they have a right to support an organization in Germany or in England, working for specific German or English purposes. The Alliance Israelite should not have any place on the roster of the American Jewish charities because it is a local French organization and not an international Jewish organization.</p>
