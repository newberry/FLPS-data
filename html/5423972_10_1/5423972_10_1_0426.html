   <p>Mr. Zlotnitski:</p>
   <p>Your letter did not surprise me. I am no longer afraid of you because your own words prove that you are far worse than we pictured you.</p>
   <p>I am happy to know that you are a grateful person, but I regret that I cannot accept the invitation to meet you. The hundreds and thousands of names on the lists of the Jewish pogrom-victims in Poland would make our meeting ridiculous.</p>
   <p>I am also happy that you feel yourself to be a "king". What Pole does not feel like a king? You needn't feel insulted because my colleague, Mr. J. Liebner, in his article "From the Public Rostrum," spoke of you thus: "To characterize such a public personality as you, is our duty, and to be so characterized is your privilege."</p>
   
   <p>The Polish publication of which you, a Jew, are the director, did not mention Jewish ingratitude to Poland. It either denied the pogroms or, in a Jesuit manner, defended them. When a Jew possesses the tragic courage to be a director of this publication, then his moral conscience must be lower than that of a "Balkan cutthroat".</p>
   <p>Should Jews in America ignore the fact that the Poles are making pogroms against their unfortunate brothers and sisters in Poland, simply because you have children and grandchildren there? We, the American Jews, are also interested in Poland, not a reactionary, anti-Semitic Poland, but a liberal, progressive Poland. It is only under the latter conditions that three million Jews can live in peace and security, and can participate in the development of that country. It is only because we are wholeheartedly interested in a liberal and prosperous Poland that we protest against the persecutions and pogroms of your Paderewski-Dmowski's Poland.</p>
   <p>The attitude of the Polish press toward Jews is one that is dictated by the clerical, feudal, anti-Semitic group, which does not desire a liberal, but a medieval, reactionary Poland. Jews are the proponents of liberalism in Poland. They are the industrial and commercial forces of the country, and are, therefore, the liberal element. That is why the clerical feudal group, which is now in power, wants to get rid of the Jews. This they can best accomplish through mass pogroms. It is also your wish that the American Jews should observe these acts without protest. Do you believe that the American Jews are dumb, or are you the dumb one, to believe for one moment that the American Jews would ignore the pogroms?</p>
   <p>Our protest against the pogroms has already accomplished a great deal. The very facts that the English Parliament protests against the pogroms, and that President Wilson found it necessary to send an investigating commission, show that our protests were not altogether futile.</p>
   <p>Your mention of Germany in connection with the Polish pogrom situation proves that though you are a Jew--regrettable--you have learned a great deal from the Polish Jesuits, who have been Poland's ruin. If a murderer thinks he is being insulted, when he is addressed by his proper name, then Poland has been insulted by us and we do not regret it.</p>
   <p>It was not Poland that supported the Jews, but rather the Jews who saved Poland from ruin. Had it not been for Jewish economic genius, there would not be a factory in Poland. Before the Jews settled in Poland, the country was a poor slave state with a helpless, uneducated, superstitious, enslaved population. Even a small Jewish minority could not save Poland from destruction, because the clergy and the nobles had exploited the impoverished and uneducated Polish people to such an extent that when the foreign enemy attacked, the oppressed Polish peasants said to themselves: "It makes little difference who oppresses us. Why should we fight for the country squires?" It was this attitude that caused the downfall of Poland, this lack of moral forces to support the country. So don't talk nonsense about Poland supporting the Jews. If we ignore the pogroms, the Poles will slaughter all the Jews in one day. From the Poland, of today, we can expect little love for the Jews.</p>
   <p>Protests against pogroms in the Ukraine were not as vigorous because those pogroms were not sponsored by the government or the educated classes, but were led by wild mobs over which the weak government had no control. If it were possible for the Ukrainian government to punish the pogromists, it would do so.</p>
   <p>You, yourself, admit that there were pogroms in Poland, but declare that they were directed against profiteers and Bolsheviks. All Polish pogromists argue the same way. They say that the pogroms are not directed against Jews, but against Bolsheviks and profiteers, and all Jews are Bolsheviks and profiteers. In the same way, the Spanish inquisitionists claimed that they were burning nonbelievers, not Jews, and all Jews were nonbelievers. I congratulate you upon being so strongly imbued with Jesuit logic. You know very well that the Jews in Poland are of the middle class, and for that reason alone, cannot be Bolsheviks because Bolshevism intends to wipe out the middle class. You know very well that the Jews in Poland are bloated from hunger, and have no means of profiteering because they have no merchandise to sell. If you must tell lies, do so in an elegant Polish manner--not as a coarse Russian cabdriver would do.</p>
   <p>The manner in which you tell about the horrible crimes in Pinsk and Wilno, where hungry, despairing Jews were murdered in cold blood by Polish criminals, in tattered Polish uniforms, shows that you are a descendant of Azev (Russian-Jewish provocateur). There is no atonement for the Polish criminals of Pinsk and Wilno. Compared to the Polish crimes in those two cities, Kishinev is but a small incident. The last Jew in the world will still shudder at the mention of Pinsk and Wilno. Even in the future, when Poland is deserted and desolate, there will still resound, through its wilderness, an echo "Pinsk--Wilno," which will rend the air with its tragic sound.</p>
   <p>Your witnesses all descend from the same family stock as Azev. All the names you mention are those of Ma Yafas Jews, that is Jews who sell their God, their country and their own souls for an insignificant position in Polish society. Only the Poles could have corrupted the Jews so that they [the Jews] reached such a despicable state. This is a further indication of the fact that no nation has tortured the Jews as viciously as the Poles. The Spaniards burned our flesh, the Russians tortured our bodies, but the Poles poisoned Jewish souls. They despised the Jews to such an extent that many Jews began to despise themselves as Jews, and began to foster a hatred for their own people.</p>
   <p>You speak of Lithuanian Jews in the same way that your organ, the Dva Groghe does, and as your friend Dmowski and other boycotters and pogromists do. If you were less ignorant than you are Jesuit, you must know that Lithuanian Jews and Polish Jews spring from the same stock, namely German; they form one group of Jews who are different from the Jews of southern Russia, who come from the East, and form another group with their own ethnic characteristics. To compare the Lithuanian Jews with the Polish Jews, and to say that the Polish Jews are good, but the Lithuanian Jews are bad, is an old tradition of the Polish landowners. Wasn't Poland itself a Lithuanian province for many hundreds of years? Even today, Poland wishes to annex Lithuania. Well then, if they get Lithuania, will the Lithuanian Jews become Polish and thus satisfy you? But if the Polish Jews are good and are pious, why do Poles slaughter and murder them along with the Lithuanian Jews?</p>
   <p>You argue that Jews are Bolsheviks. I am surprised that all the Jews in Poland are not Bolsheviks, anarchists, revolutionaries, and well-poisoners. Do you really expect the Jews, who are being tortured by the Poles, to say nothing and do nothing? Tzarist Russia produced Trotskys; now Poland is doing likewise.</p>
   <p>You know that your statement that American Jews sympathize with the Bolsheviks, is as true as your claim that the Polish Jews are Bolsheviks. By now, however, I am so indifferent to your provocative arguments that even if you should accuse us of blood-ritual murder, I would not be surprised any more. If the American government and the American people are satisfied with the Americanization of American Jews, then you, "rod of Moses" [derisive epithet], should certainly be satisfied.</p>
   <p>Before I close, I wish to say that while it is true that anti-Semitism, as a program of a political party, arose in Germany in 1876, nevertheless, anti-Semitism, as a political program of an entire people, first arose in Poland, long before Bismarck's grandfather was born. In Poland, an anti-Semitic party would be silly because the whole country, reared in superstition, poverty, and ignorance, is anti-Semitic. A nation ruled by feudal lords and Jesuits could not be otherwise.</p>
   <p>Friendly relations between Jews and Poles will be possible only when the Poles overthrow the clerical, feudal yoke and free themselves from their own parasites. Only a free people can give freedom to another people. As long as the Polish people are not free, and are ruled by Jesuits and feudal lords, so long must we see to it that the world is aware of what the Poles are doing to the Jews. If we do not do this, the Poles will murder three million Jews in one day.</p>
   <p>Each country has as many Bolsheviks as it deserves. If the Poland of today did not foster Bolshevism by its pogroms and its persecution of the Jews, then there would be no Bolsheviks in Poland, and those that do exist, would disappear. But, since the Poland of today does foster Bolsheviks, let them remain to bring you restless days and sleepless nights. Trotsky is our revenge for the pogroms of Tzarist Russia. I hope that something may yet arise to avenge the pogroms in Poland.</p>
   
   <p>In closing, Mr. Zlotnitski, I wish to ask: "Why is there not a single Jewish official in the whole military and civil administration of Poland, if it is true that the Poles have nothing against the Jews?"</p>
   <p>As you see, I have had the courage to print your letter, word for word, because I want the readers of the Courier to read your own words, and thus realize that not a single word written by Mr. Leibner was an exaggeration. Now our readers certainly have a true characterization of you.</p>
   <p>With such respects as you deserve,</p>
   <p>Dr. S. M. Melamed.</p>
   <p>[Editor's note: Mr. Zlotnitski's letter to Dr. Melamed is printed in the same issue, and is coded under III H.]</p>
