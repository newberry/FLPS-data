   <p>The Orthodox community of Chicago will soon bid farewell to a man who, for the past twenty years, has helped to build this community, and who has contributed a great deal to its development. I refer to Rabbi M. Fisher of the Hungarian Congregation. Rabbi Fisher is a scholar in the best sense of the term. He is also a prominent civic leader. Rabbi Fisher has accepted a very honorable position in Detroit, where he will be the spiritual leader of Congregation Bnai Moshe.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Orthodox community is very grateful to Rabbi Fisher for the great services he has rendered in every field of our communal life and deeply regrets his departure from our city. He is a learned man, a conscientious man and has a serious attitude toward his work. There aren't many rabbis like Rabbi Fisher in America. His departure from Chicago is a great loss to our city.</p>
