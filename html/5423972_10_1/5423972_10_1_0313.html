   <p>The late Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, who in many ways helped to determine the moral, cultural, and religious development of a large section of Chicago Jewry, was a man of vast knowledge, secular and Jewish, and a man who had a fair mastery of all Western Jewish problems. The status of Eastern European Jewish affairs, and especially of the Eastern European state of mind, for the last fifty years, was less known to him. He met, of course, many eminent Eastern European Jews, and discussed general and Eastern European Jewish problems with them, but the traditions in which he grew up, the environment in which he lived, and his own earlier conception of Judaism, prevented him from penetrating into the mind of Eastern European Jewry, and made it nearly impossible for him to understand the psychology, and to grasp the problems of the Eastern European Jews.</p>
   <p>The late Dr. Hirsch, like many other leading Jews, often heard tales of Jewish sorrow and woe, but these stories [merely] strengthened his belief that charity <span class="page-break">2</span>alone could solve the Jewish problem in the East. As far as the West was concerned, he could not see that there was any Jewish problem at all, at least not politically and culturally. Brought up in the tradition of eighteenth-century intellectualism Judaism presented itself to him as a religious creed only, and inasmuch as people had ceased to concern themselves with theology, he thought that Judaism was the private business of the individual, and had no bearing on the attitude of the Gentile to the Jew and vice versa. For these reasons, the late Dr. Hirsch, although an educated man and although well versed in Jewish lore, could not see the Zionist light.</p>
   <p>When the Zionist doctrine was first proclaimed by the immortal Theodore Herzl, the late Dr. Hirsch lost no time in displaying his opposition to it. At that time the late Dr. Hirsch taught that Zionism was only one of the romantic symptoms of the time, and that it was a matter of passing significance. When Zionism later on became a force in Jewish life and a factor in international politics, and could no longer be ignored as a romantic dream, the late Dr. Hirsch was too old and too much out of touch with international Jewish affairs <span class="page-break">3</span>to understand the phenomenon, and instead of making peace with Zionism, as many other Reform rabbis, although less learned than Dr. Hirsch, had done, he grew more bitter towards Zionism. It is only natural that an old man would not be willing to give up his cherished ideals of the past and break with the traditions in which he grew up, and it would have been nothing short of a miracle had Dr. Hirsch, in the last decade of his life, embraced the gospel of Zionism. He was too outspoken a personality and too outspoken a character to yield.</p>
   <p>However, Zionism grew to be a force in Jewish life and a problem of vast significance not only to its supporters but also to its opponents, and the late Dr. Hirsch could no longer ignore it. He had to take a position; he had to tackle the problem whether he wanted to or not, and he did tackle it and he struggled with himself to find the right attitude toward it. This explains his many contradictory statements on Zionism. One day he was sympathetic towards Zionism, and the next day, he was denouncing it bitterly. This would indicate that he struggled hard to solve the Zionist problem for himself. We <span class="page-break">4</span>dare say that by sentiment he was a Zionist, or at least, was sympathetically inclined towards Zionism.</p>
   <p>The late Dr. Hirsch was not a sentimentalist. He went through the school of Western European intellectualism and rationalism that dampens emotionalism, and as an intellectual and rational individual, whose attitude toward Judaism was determined by the early Jewish reformers as well as by the philosophy of the eighteenth century, it was hard for him, if not impossible, to free himself from his early rationalist influences and to give free sway to his Jewish sentiments.</p>
   <p>We believe, however, that had it not been for the limitations of his Jewish personality and had it not been for his advanced age, Dr. Hirsch would, in the end, have joined the Zionist forces. Had he taken one trip to Palestine, had he seen for himself the rebuilding of Palestine by the Halutzim [pioneers], and the Jewish renaissance, his mind and soul would have been changed. Many other famous American Reform rabbis who visited Palestine and witnessed the <span class="page-break">5</span>
rebuilding of the Holy Land by Jews, came back convinced and enthusiastic Zionists, and Dr. Hirsch would have been no exception to the rule.</p>
   <p>Zionist theories may not convince everybody of the truth of Zionism, but Zionist facts and Zionist realities must convince everybody, and Dr. Hirsch was Western enough and intelligent enough to yield to facts. He would not yield to theories and arguments, but he would have yielded to reality and we consider it a misfortune for Zionism and a misfortune for the Jewish community of Chicago that the late Dr. Hirsch did not pay a visit to Palestine and did not see with his own eyes the rapid Jewish development of Palestine.</p>
   <p>It is our sincere belief that the late Dr. Hirsch would have come back from Palestine a different man, a different Jew, and a different rabbi. With his sharp and witty mind and with his quick grasp of things, he would have soon come to realize what the rebuilding of Palestine must, in the end, mean, not only to Palestinian Jewry, but to the Jews in the countries of the Diaspora. We dare say that a positive attitude toward Zionism would have made Dr. Hirsch an entirely different type of Jewish leader, and the Jewish community of <span class="page-break">6</span>Chicago would have a different standard of values today. Those Chicago Jews who still have a negative attitude toward Zionism because they follow the lead of the late Dr. Hirsch should bear in mind that Dr. Hirsch was not a young man, accessible to new ideas, that he was a Western rationalist, that he grew up in the traditions of the assimilationists, and that he had lived to see Palestine become an Eretz Israel [Land of Israel]. If they want to do justice to Zionism, to the Jewish people, and to Palestine, let them go to Palestine themselves; let them see with their own eyes what is going on in the Holy Land, and they will soon convince themselves that their theories no longer hold good and that the future of Judaism is indissolubly connected with the future of Zionism.</p>
