   <p>About a hundred friends of the Marks Nathan Orphan Home gathered last night at the institution. A banquet had been arranged there in honor of Mr. and Mrs. S. J. Rosenblatt and Mr. and Mrs. Nicolas Pritzker, who are leaving on a trip to Europe. Delicious food was served (the participants bore the expense) and they were entertained by beautiful music and speeches.</p>
   <p>Mr. Charles Herron, president of the Home, was toastmaster. Judge Harry M. Fisher was the main speaker.</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher said that this farewell banquet, given in honor of the guests, was well deserved by them. He mentioned the great work which they had done for the Home and for many other institutions and wished them a happy journey and a happy return.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenblatt and Mr. Pritzker replied in a few appropriate words.</p>
