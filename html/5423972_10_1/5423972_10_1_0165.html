   <p>When an immigrant gets his first job he has accomplished the first step in his reorientation to his new life. The second step is hurdled when he has learned those few necessary expressions and their meanings in English. The second step is much easier than the first. When he gets his job he has a livelihood and it is only a question of time as to the Americanization process that inevitably takes place. When, however, the immigrant has no employment, reorientation fails to take place and the immigrant gropes in the dark.</p>
   <p>Only when we realize this, can we understand the importance of the Labor Bureau which was created by the United Hebrew Charities and the Bnai Brith, to find employment for unemployed immigrants. The Labor Bureau now accomplishes a great deal. However, the bureau could accomplish a great deal more if our own business people and manufacturers would be more aware of their duties to their people. We feel that if an employer in need of workers would apply to our Labor Bureau, the benefits of the bureau could be extended to a great many more people. We could easily dispense with their charity if they would employ our unemployed but capable immigrants. Work instead of charity should be our slogan, Jewish employers! Use our Labor Bureau when you need workers. Do your duty to yourself and your people.</p>
