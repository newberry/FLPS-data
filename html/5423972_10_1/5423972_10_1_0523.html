   <p>Yesterday evening, at a well-attended meeting in the Hertzel School, Mr. Jacob DeHaas gave a report of the Zionist accomplishments at the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jacob De Haas pointed out that the prospects of Jews acquiring Palestine for a homeland, where in time they can establish a Jewish Commonwealth, are very good and almost certain. In the course of his speech, he also mentioned that conspirators against Jews, employing every possible method to hinder Zionistic activities, have failed and gained nothing for themselves but contempt.</p>
   <p>He also indicated that the problem of making Palestine the Jewish homeland lies not so much in the powers of the Peace Conference as in the might of Jewish efforts.</p>
   <p>"If we desire to create something for our suffering people, there is much we must do, notwithstanding sacrifices," he explained.</p>
   <p>"We expect," he stated, "in the present restless times, that various impatient people will lapse into a pessimistic mood, but we who have seen and experienced these procedures in Paris, are certain that it will be but a very short time (to securing homeland) and that our efforts are assured only if the people will not stand at a distance but will give a helping hand to this sacred work.</p>
