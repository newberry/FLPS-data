   <p>The appointment of Mr. Jacob M. Loeb as a member of the Board of Education by Mayor Harrison was most assuredly a good selection. Mr. Loeb, although he is what we call a South Side Jew, devotes most of his activeness to the West Side in Jewish welfare work.</p>
   <p>His tireless and arduous work in the Hebrew Institute, of which he is now president, makes him still more suitable to occupy this office, and he will certainly be a good member of this Board, which has so much to say about the education of our future generation.</p>

   <p>The educational system is beginning to adopt another form. In the next few years, our public schools will be entirely different from what they are today, and it is of great importance that at this crucial period the Board of Education shall not only be comprised of the best educated and most energetic people, but also of such who come in direct contact with those, who must be educated in the schools. People, who represent various elements, must be on the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>The West Side Jews are very fortunate to be represented on the Board of Education, formerly by Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, and now by assistance of Mr. Loeb, who is acquainted with the desires and inclinations of the West Side Jews. It is assured that the Jewish youth of the public schools will derive a great deal of benefit in the modern educational system.</p>
