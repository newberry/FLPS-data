   <p>According to a London dispatch to the Chicago Post, the English press pays tribute to the late Dr. [Emil G.] Hirsch as a great Zionist leader. They lavish praise upon him, claiming that he aided the Zionists in America politically and diplomatically, and that we owe [a debt of] gratitude to Dr. Hirsch for the adoption of the Zionist resolution in Congress.</p>
   <p>We, in America, know nothing about this. We know the contrary. And if the English press can say nothing else about the late Dr. Hirsch than that he was a great Zionist leader, it should have said nothing at all. To claim that Dr. Hirsch was a Zionist leader is to belittle him. To say that he was not a Zionist leader is to praise him.</p>
