   <p>It is evident, from the rigorous measures adopted by the Russian government against the Jews of that country, that they will soon overflood the United States, if the premonitions of our contemporaries in New York are to be accredited. In a recent issue of the Occident, we have already stated that the larger communities, are over-shadowed by the Russian and Polish influx in the metropolis of our country and their influence is largely felt, upon the communal life of our great cities.</p>
   <p>It cannot be said, that their presence is an advantage to those communities, because throughout the United States, they were in a fair way of progress and reform. The expatriated Russians are unfortunately of the class who are yet under the mediaeval regime. The government of Russia has never permitted these subjects to rise intellectually nor furnished them education similar to that in other civilized countries. The great problem to be solved, however, in this country, is how to provide means for the thousands that have migrated here, and those that will follow them in the near future. The question will undoubtedly become an absorbing one at no distant day.</p>

   <p>The Israelites of this country, owe it to themselves, and the cause of humanity, to provide means on some extensive plan, whereby the expatriated people may be colonized at once and become self-sustaining, forming a potent factor in our republic as yeomen, mechanics, artisans, and thus become good, law-abiding citizens.</p>
   <p>We have a number of philanthropic citizens throughout the United States, such as the Seligmans, Schiff, Seasongood, Lazarus, Silverman, the Michael Reese heirs, and a hundred others, who should form a colonial organization, secure a tract of land on any of the Pacific railroads and pursue precisely the same plan, as has been done by the railroads themselves, i. e., selling parcels of sections of land at a nominal price, to each bona-fide settler, payable in installments from year to year, with a low rate of interest, together with furnishing these settlers with practical instructors in agriculture and horticulture, providing also such implements and live stock as will enable the settlers to engage successfully in agricultural pursuits.</p>

   <p>As a part of the system, let public schools be erected for the children, thus placing them under the benign laws of the United States and its territories, teaching them American principles and the practical methods, pertaining to American citizenship. After consulting with a few eminent gentlemen, we find that from a strictly humanitarian point, such a plan is preeminently advisable.</p>
   <p>The colony association need but lend their influence and the scheme could soon be made self-sustaining as well as profitable. We are more than convinced that the Jewish people of the United States, could with contributions, loans, and bequests, help in such a project; not only from a humanitarian standpoint, but to avert the inevitable pauperism of these people by the Russian government, which would reflect upon the Jews as a class in this and all other countries.</p>
   <p>We are fully satisfied that the government of the United States, would for the first few years grant subsidies of an amount that would aid very materially. This would remove the occasion for Jewish pauperism. The lands along the great highways to the Pacific, could be converted into fertile fields, yielding profitable returns for labor, to the advantage of the entire nation.</p>
