   <p>Through the generosity of Mr. Gerhard Foreman, three of our charitable institutions were enriched this week to the amount of $7,500. Mr. Foreman added $3,000 to the Gerhard and Hannah Foreman Fund of the Michael Reese Hospital, and donated $2,000 for a similar fund of the Home for Aged Jews. He also added $2,500 to the Sinking Fund of the Jewish Training School.</p>
