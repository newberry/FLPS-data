   <p>Together with Mrs. Michelson the famous scientist will go to Bermuda Islands before spring. The Professor is also planning to go to California to proceed with his light experiments.</p>
   <p>"And after I will have that completed," said the Professor, "I will take life a little easier, I may retire then." So declared the man who gave fifty-four years of his life to scientific work.</p>
   <p>Accepting his resignation, the board of trustees sent the Professor a letter thanking him for the great advantages gained by the University of Chicago, through which he is recognized as one of the world's greatest scientists.</p>
