   <p>The American missionaries, who have always taken a hostile attitude toward Zionism, are not satisfied with the position taken by the Paris Peace Conference toward Zionism and still consider the problem unsolved. Since Zionism has been recognized by the [great] powers, the American missionaries have continued to intrigue against it. It is difficult to say whether the English missionaries also participate in this intrigue because the English bishops, practically all of whom are connected with the English Mission Society, have until now adopted a friendly attitude toward the problem of a Jewish Palestine. Whether they are overtly for, or covertly against Zionism, we, naturally, do not know, but we do not think it probable. It is incredible that such men as the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York would carry on Jesuit politics. We also do not believe that the Christian bishops of America are in accord with the missionaries concerning the Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We have enough ground to assume that the intrigues of the missionaries against Zionism have nothing to do with religion nor with the Christian church, because it is not the bishops who support the missionaries, but rather certain financiers and industrial barons who want America to lay claim to the whole of Asia Minor and thus enable them to exploit the vast resources of that country, such as oil, coal, iron, copper, zinc, etc.</p>
   <p>The missionaries are being used in this country as a means of carrying out a certain policy. If the American missionaries were able to speak in the name of the Christian church, then the ministers and bishops certainly would not be ashamed to oppose Zionism openly. This, however, they did not do. On the contrary, they have repeatedly and on different occasions expressed themselves [as being] in favor of Zionism. Our suspicions regarding the American missionaries, that they are only tools in the hands of a certain group of American capitalists, gain in strength when we remember that the English and French governments were reluctant to offer English and French escorts to the American-Asia Minor Commission that recently returned with a report that all <span class="page-break">\3</span>the nationalities in Asia Monor want America to act as mandator and do not want Palestine to be given to the Jews. The plan of sending a commission to Asia Minor arose first in America and was very favorably received in England and France. But as soon as the English and French governments learned from the Asia Minor Commission, of the requests of the American interests, they immediately withdrew, and instead of an Allied, only an American commission left for Asia Minor. Now its activity is being severely condemned in the French and English press. The French press accuses the commission of conducting its investigation in a superficial and biased manner.</p>
   <p>We do not believe that the intrigues of the missionaries will be of any value because England, France and America have pledged themselves to support Zionism.</p>
