   <p>An elaborate banquet was given in honor of Mme. Anna Lifshitz, considered to be the oldest anarchist in Chicago, perhaps in America.</p>
   <p>This banquet was given to celebrate the 40th anniversary of her membership in the anarchist organization.</p>
   <p>Anna Lifshitz is a great idealist and a devoted member of this organization. Her late husband, Jacob Lifshitz, was also a great organizer. One hundred and twenty-five persons participated at this banquet, mostly anarchists, ex-anarchists, and friends.</p>
   <p>The toastmaster of the evening was Mr. Morris Krupnick. Talks were held by Messrs. Yanovsky, Ben. Reitman, Israel Blum, Dr. N. Schoolman, J. Siegel, W. Nathanson, etc.</p>
