   <p>Bernhard Moos, member of the public library board, died on Tuesday afternoon. He was born in Wurtemberg, in 1842, and came to America at the age of 17. Coming directly to Chicago, he with his brother Julius, established the first cigar store, with one exception, in the city. He was chairman of the building committee of the public library board and devoted much of his time to watching the progress of the new library building. Before the great fire, Mr. Moos was librarian of the Young Men's Association. The public library and all its branch reading-rooms were closed on the day of the funeral.</p>
