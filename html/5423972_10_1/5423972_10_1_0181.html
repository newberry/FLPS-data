   <p>Kiever Landsleit! Take Notice!</p>
   <p>"Better late than never" goes the saying. After the terrible happenings in the bloody lands for the Czar, we, a few Kiever landsleit, have decided to organize a Kiever Aid Society to help new immigrants arriving from Kiev, as much as we possibly can. Therefore we invite all Kiev landsleit to join our verein.</p>
   <p>There will be a large mass meeting at Pritikin's Hall next Saturday evening. For further information contact S. Pritikin, chairman, 499 Jefferson street, or B. Pritikin, 166 Maxwell street, the secretary of our verein.</p>
