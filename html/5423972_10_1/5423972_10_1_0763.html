   <p>Julius Rosenwald, the famous Jewish philanthropist and multi-millionaire dies yesterday, after a prolonged illness, at his home in Ravinia at 3 P. M., at the age of 69. All his children, who were called to his bedside, and his wife were with him when the end came. He died peacefully in his sleep.</p>
   <p>Rosenwald was born in Springfield, Illinois, the 12th of August, 1862, of German-Jewish parents, who immigrated to this country. He was born in the same street where Abraham Lincoln lived.</p>
   <p>His parents shortly after his birth occupied a house, which was directly across from the Lincoln estate.</p>
   
   <p>A sum of $30,000,000 of Mr. Rosenwald's personal fortune was set aside in 1917 and designated as the Julius Rosenwald Fund for various philanthropical purposes. The fund, according ot its provision, must be expended within 25 years after his death. Special mention is given in the provisions, to educational needs of Negroes and medical aid to persons of limited means through clinics and other forms of medical organizations, as well as for the study of social problems.</p>
   <p>Rosenwald celebrated his sixtieth birthday with a donation of $687, 500 to charity.</p>
   <p>Julius Rosenwald was recognized as the builder and organizer of the largest mail order firm in the world - that of Sears, Roebuck and Company.</p>
   
   <p>Even during the time of his last illness, Mr. Rosenwald strove to serve his fellow men. One of his last accomplishments was a donation of $250,000 to the Joint Emergency Relief Fund, with the condition, that five other citizens donate the same sum. This was the largest single personal contribution to the campaign until the time of his death.</p>
   <p>A short time ago he was presented with a medal of the Rotary Club of Chicago for his benevolence.</p>
   <p>Thousands of prominent business men gathered on the 8th of September of last year at the Hotel Sherman in his honor. On account of sickness, he was unable to be present at the gathering, but was represented by his son Lessing who accepted the medal in the name of his father.</p>
   
   <p>The medal consisted of a memorandum, commemorating the philanthropist's activities and services to his fellow men. Telegrams of congratulations from President Hoover, many prominent persons of the nation, and important philanthropical organizations were received.</p>
   <p>The bronze plate, presented him by the Rotary Club, was given as a token of his "responsibility in maintaining the social and industrial order; for his personal efforts in creating opportunities for all, regardless of religion or race; for his participation in and contribution to the setvice of all mankind in the field of local and national education, including farm colonization in persecuted foreign countries; Negro schools, better homes, hospitals, universities and museums of science and industry; for his belief in the progress of truth to inspire mankind in its attainment of the highest ideals, and for his active service to society."</p>
   
   <p>But in spite of all these eulogies and recognitions Mr. Rosenwald remained a very modest individual. His life was very active. His business career began in his early life and he was successful in all his undertakings.</p>
   <p>In his early youth he experienced want, for his parents were of barely moderate means, even poor, as some claim.</p>
   <p>Among the first enterprizes, from which he earned a living was the peddling of pictures from house to house. When Lincoln's monument was erected in his home town, he sold pamphlets under the title, "The Life of the President," earning $2.50. This he did, while still attending grammar school.</p>
   
   <p>At the age of 16 he left Springfield for New York, where he became a clerk in a wholesale clothing house.</p>
   <p>He came to Chicago at the age of 23 and opened a retail clothing business. Later he formed a partnership with his cousin Julius Weil and began the manufacture of summer clothing. Nine years later he met Richard W. Sears, who became his main customer.</p>
   <p>Sears was in the mail order business. Rosenwald and his brother-in-law bought two-thirds interest in Sears' firm.</p>
   <p>The business of the company grew with remarkable rapidity and in 1896 Rosenwald became vice-president of Sears-Roebuck and Company. The name of Roebuck was adopted by Sears in earlier years, due to a contract, which prohibited the latter from using his own name. Mr. Sears therefore added the name of Roebuck to his own. Roebuck was a jeweler, from whom Sears bought jewelry.</p>
   
   <p>Sears died in 1910 and Rosenwald became the head of the huge mail order concern of Sears, Roebuck and Company.</p>
   <p>The famous philanthropist has often credited his co-workers with helping him to reach his high position in the business world. He once remarked, that a business man, who occupies a high position, usually credits himself with attaining that position, and often receives credit for ideas and plans, not his own, but belonging to other smart men, quite often co-workers of lesser rank in the same concern. How would such a great businessman look, if no one helped him?</p>
   <p>"Therefore I say," declared Rosenwald in an interview not long ago, "that I personally played an insignificant part in the growth of Sears, Roebuck and Company in bringing the firm to its present successful position. My Co-workers deserve as much credit as I do, for they helped me with word and deed."</p>
   <p>A characteristic trait of Rosenwald's modesty is brought out in a story told about an Oriental rug with which some officials "surprised" him on his birthday a few years ago.</p>
   
   <p>The officials one morning spread an expensive Oriental rug on the floor of Rosenwald's private office. The latter was astonished but not satisfied with the "surprise." He thanked his colleagues, the executive officials, but upon the retirement of the latter, rolled the rug up and put it away in a corner, and soon the rug entirely disappeared. He then remarked to his colleagues, that if"linoleum" is good enough for the auditor of the concern, it should be just as good for the president, and shortly after a linoleum rug graced the floor of Rosenwald's private office.</p>
   <p>As a philanthropist, Rosenwald's name was known not only in this country but throughout the world.</p>
   <p>Here are some of his contributions: $6,000,000 for Jewish colonization in Soviet Russia. $3,600,000 for schools and other educational institutions for Negroes. In Chicago Rosenwald contributed $2,700,000 for "model apartments" for Negroes.</p>
   
   <p>Rosenwald also contributed considerable sums for five YMCA and three YWCA buildings throughout the country. Two million Negroes and 25 cities derived great benefit from Rosenwald's philanthropic activities. For the University of Chicago, Rosenwald gave $5,000,000. He was also honorary president of the Jewish Charities in Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the World War, Rosenwald was a member of the Advisory Committee of the Council of National Defense, established by President Wilson. In 1919 and 1920 he was in Washington as a member of the President's Industrial Conference.</p>
   <p>Rosenwald contributed $250,000 to the endowment fund of the Hampton and Tuskegee Institutes- Negro aid organizations. He gave $250,000 for the building, housing the Jewish Charities in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Together with Mrs. Rosenwald he contributed $3,000,000 for new buildings for the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In 1918, Rosenwald was entrusted with a special mission to France by the then Secretary of War. In 1920-21 he helped in Hoover's Children's Relief Fund. During the World War he gave enormous sums of money for relief, especially for Eastern Europe, on one condition, that it should be distributed toall the needy, regardless of race or creed. In 1918 alone he gave $1,000,000 for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Rosenwald contributed $500,000 and helped considerably in the campaigns in the erecting of 20 YMCA buildings for Negroes. He also helped a great deal in the erection of 4, 108 Negro schools in the Southwest, for which $3,165,917 was contributed by the Rosenwald Fund.</p>
   <p>In December 1921, when the financial structure of Sears, Roebuck and Company became somewhat shaky Mr. Rosenwald pledged $21,000,000 of his personal fortune to strengthen the affairs of the large business institution.</p>
   
   <p>Rosenwald's frequent huge contributions astonished everyone. The same happened in 1925, when he offered 6,000,000 for Jewish Colonization in Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>Rosenwald was held in great esteem everywhere for his large contributions, which helped so many people.</p>
   <p>He was honorary president of the Jewish Charities in Chicago; vice-president of the Jewish People's Institute, Sinai Temple, American Jewish Committee; honorary member of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Historical Society. He was a life member of the American Museum of Natural History, of the American Academy in Rome; a trustee in the Rockefeller Foundation, of the University of Chicago, the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Colleges; a trustee in the Baron Hirsch, Hull House; president of the school for Jewish Social Workers; member of the Committee on American-Japanese Relations; The American Oriental Society and countless other institutions, organizations and clubs.</p>
   <p>Rosenwald was everywhere honored and respected for his benevolence.</p>
