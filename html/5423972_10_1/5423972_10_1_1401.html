   <p>Rabbi A. L. Messing is a native of Argenau, Germany, and was born on June 18, 1840. Toward the end of that sixties and for some time during the seventies, Rabbi Messing was a power in Chicago, especially with his countrymen of Prussian Poland. Congregation B'nai Sholom owes much to this once very popular rabbi, and it has shown its appreciation of his services in many ways. He left the B'nai Sholom Congregation repeatedly to accept other calls, but he is now permanently located in Chicago as the Minister of that congregation.</p>
