   <p>Carl Wolfsohn, the well-known Chicago musician, died last week. He was a native of Germany and studied under Aloys Schmitt of Frankfort, for many years. He came to Chicago 34 years ago as Director of the Beethoven Society, which he founded. This Society did much to shape the musical taste of the Chicago of that day and during the ten years of its existence produced a number of important choral works. Mr. Wolfsohn had devoted much of his time to a special study of Beethoven, and he was conceded to have been one of the ablest interpreters of the Master in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wolfsohn left a permanent memento of his devotion to the cause of Music. He was responsible for the erection, in 1897, in Lincoln Park, of the Beethoven Statue. Mr. Wolfsohn was a member of Sinai Congregation.</p>
