   <p>The Keren Hayesod [exchequer of the World Zionist Organization] campaign of Chicago came officially to an end Monday evening, when the leaders of the Orthodox Jewish community handed over to Dr. Chaim Weizmann a check for fifty thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod, as the contribution of the synagogues to the Palestine Foundation Fund. The actual work of soliciting and collecting funds for the Keren Hayesod will, of course, be continued even after the official termination of the drive. We are confident that Chicago will deliver its quota this year, because thousands of Jews in this city have learned to understand the importance of the Keren Hayesod, and the number of subscribers to the Palestine Foundation Fund is increasing from day to day.</p>
   <p>It is true that in camparison to such minor Jewish communities as Milwaukee, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Omaha, Minneapolis, etc., Chicago has not given an inspiring example and cannot brag about its achievements this year, but comparing the results of this year's drive with those of the last year, Chicago has reason to be proud of its success. Last year we had here actually two delegates, one from New York, headed by the late Mr. Sweltzer and one from Europe, headed by Mr. Nahum Sokolow. Mr. Sweltzer spent four weeks in Chicago, and Mr. Nahum Sokolow two weeks, and the net result of their combined activities here was fifty thousand dollars in cash. This year we had only one delegation, consisting only of a committee of one, represented by Dr. Weizmann. Dr. Weizmann spent only a couple of days in Chicago, and in these few days he succeeded in inspiring the Keren Hayesod workers to such an extent that they went out and collected one hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash, with the prospect of getting one hundred and fifty thousand dollars more during the next nine months. In addition, Dr. Weizmann has made new friends for the Keren Hayesod among influential South Side Jews, as well as among influential Gentiles. One of the leading Jews of Chicago, who has openly opposed the <span class="page-break">\3</span>Keren Hayesod until now, has finally been persuaded by Dr. Weizmann to take an interest in Palestine work and has already sent in his contribution. We hope that this is not going to be an isolated case and that more gentlemen from the opposite camp will come to the aid of the Keren Hayesod in one form or another.</p>
   <p>Taking all in all, one must say that the Keren Hayesod drive now terminated has been extremely successful, and the local Karen Hayesod workers are to be especially congratulated upon the success of their enterprise. We dare say that if the Keren Hayesod workers of Chicago could command more forces to go out and get the money, at least two hundred thousand dollars could have been collected during these two weeks. Only a handful of men have done real work, and the number of actual solicitors does not exceed twenty, and not all of these twenty have given up all their time and energy to the cause during the short drive. For the success of the drive among the Orthodox Jews, Mr. Samuel <span class="page-break">\4</span>Ginsburg, the able president of the Kehilath Jacob Congregation, is largely responsible. He has done work for five and he has organized an unpredecented demonstration of the Chicago Orthodox Jews for the Keren Hayesod at the banquet held last Monday night. This demonstration for the Keren Hayesod and for the cause of a Jewish Palestine will largely contribute to the intensification of the Keren Hayesod work in Chicago among the Orthodox element. The only other few gentlemen who have secured the success of this year's Keren Hayesod drive in Chicago are Max Shulman, chairman of the organization, Mr. Harry Goldman, the keenest driver of them all, Mr. Lubin, who has managed the tour of Dr. Weizmann in the Middle West, and Dr. Abramovitz, the able director of the Keren Hayesod office. These few men are actually the motive power behind the Keren Hayesod movement in Chicago, and if not for their display of ability and energy, this year's drive would have ended in a fizzle, because it was sandwiched in between two other drives which had already exhausted the philanthropic energies of the community. To have got this year one hundred <span class="page-break">\5</span>thousand dollars in cash, in a few days, for the Keren Hayesod is a much greater achievement than to have got last year two hundred thousand dollars in cash in the same period of time.</p>
   <p>We hope that the few devoted Keren Hayesod workers in Chicago will continue the drive in the months to come with the same intensity as in the last four weeks, for one hundred fifty thousand dollars must be collected before the end of the year.</p>
