   <p>Louis Post, Assistant Secretary of Labor, spoke in Evanston, strongly criticising the existing immigration laws.</p>
   <p>At one time, he said, America was the haven for all people who were oppressed in other lands. For the past fifteen years this situation has altered considerably. Laws for immigration limitations have been passed; the authority of interpretation was left to immigration officials.</p>
   <p>Not only were the immigration authorities given the power to permit or refuse the new immigrant entrance, but also the power to reject such persons as have lived in this country any number of years, providing they have not become naturalized.</p>

   <p>There have been times when such people were sent away and we cannot say that this treatment was justified. Such methods reek strongly of despotism and should not, therefore, be tolerated.</p>
   <p>The Immigration Commission possesses a despotic power. One of its members may permit a person to enter this country while a second one may refuse him admission. Such methods are foreign to the spirit of true democracy. To do away with the immigration question, "special privileges" must be abolished, and the immigration law will be saved.</p>
