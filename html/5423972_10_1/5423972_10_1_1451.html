   <p>Major Milton J. Foreman was born in Chicago in 1863. After a period of schooling, he entered the employ of Keith Bros., a wholesale hat concern, as errand boy. He remained with that firm for almost 20 years. From the position of errand boy he worked his way up until he became their most prominent salesman and held an interest in the corporation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Foreman commenced the study of law and after the required period of education, passed his examination to the Bar.</p>
   <p>While he was still studying law, the call came from President McKinley for volunteers to help the cause of Cuba. Mr. Foreman, who was a captain in the First Illinois Cavalry, enlisted in the U.S. Volunteer Army and was commissioned Captain and Quartermaster. After 7 months service, at the close of hostilities, he returned to Chicago.</p>
   <p>When the president was seeking officers to send to the Philippines, Mr. Foreman was offered the position of Captain in the 30th U.S. Infantry. The offer was a tempting one, but he was just starting in the professional work, which he had so long desired to do, and so he was compelled to decline.</p>
