   <p>Mr. Isaac Don Levine, the well-known correspondent of the Chicago Daily News has recently returned to Chicago from a visit to Soviet Russia. His masterful description has helped to illuminate the real condition of that country. Up to now the Russian situation has loomed dark in the eyes of the Western hemisphere due to various false or falsified reports which were circulated for the purpose of further complicating the Russian problem. A representative of the Courier availed himself of the opportunity to interview Mr. Levine. Although the latter is very busy now preparing the Russian material for the Daily News, yet he gladly agreed to give an hour of his time to the Courier's representative.</p>
   <p>Being himself an able journalist and a skilful "interviewer," Mr. Levine knew precisely what questions would be of special interest to the readers of the Courier and our representative was spared the necessity of "pulling it out by <span class="page-break">\2</span>the teeth" which is usally the case during interviews.</p>
   <p>But first of all a few words about Mr. Levine himself; Mr. Levine is one of the most gifted of Jewish young men who, through their personal abilities, "reach the top" in any environment.</p>
   <p>The representative of the Courier saw before him a blond young man of medium height with a sympathetic, intelligent face. Through his spectacles peer a pair of keen and genial eyes. His language is polished, as are his writings, and with the first few words you become convinced that you are dealing with a man who, despite his youth, possesses a broad knowledge and a universal perspective, and, above all, a man who has a warm throbbing Jewish heart.</p>
   <p>Mr. Levine is 28 years of age. He was born in Mosyr, state of Minsk, and came to America in 1911. He lived at first in Kansas City where he completed high school in a short time. The last few years he has lived in New York where he has been a coworker on the New York Tribune and where, after the Russian Revolution, he also published a book in English entitled The Russian Revolution. His parents live in Boston now, where his father Mr. Don Levine is a storekeeper.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The journalist is married and resides in Chicago. His wife is a former Kansas City girl.</p>
   <p>Mr. Levine visited Russia twice. The last time he spent six weeks there visiting not only Petrograd and Moscow, as other correspondents who succeeded in entering Russia for a short period have done, but he also visited Jewish cities and villages in order to become acquainted with Jewish conditions there.</p>
   <p>The conversation was carried on partly in English, partly in Russian and partly in Yiddish. Mr. Levine speaks all of these languages fluently. Much of what was told by Mr. Levine to the representative of the Courier cannot be made public for various reasons. That part of the interview which is of especial interest to the readers of the Courier dealt mainly with the present sad condition of the Jews in Russia. Mr. Levine visited many Jewish cities in Western Russia and the Ukraine and found terrible economic conditions everywhere. The poverty in the cities of the former Ghetto is indescribable.</p>
   <p>Asked as to the attitude of the Jewish population toward the Soviet Government, <span class="page-break">\4</span>Mr. Levine declared that the Jewish population in general is hostile to the Soviet Government, not only the bourgeois but the Jewish worker as well. The number of Jews sympathetic to Bolshevism is not more than five per cent. The reason is twofold. First, it is very difficult under the Bolshevik order for the great mass of small merchants and even workers to make a living. The second reason is a religious one, i.e. although the Bolsheviks do not suppress the Jewish religion, yet under the influence of Jewish Communists they have forbidden instruction in Hebrew; this edict has evoked the greatest dissatisfaction among the orthodox Jewish masses.</p>
   <p>Besides that, the Jewish cities are unfortunately always located in the thick of the war, and under war necessity it happens often that the Bolsheviks force the Jews to labor on Saturday or holidays. This occurred last Rosh Hashonoh (Jewish New Year) in the city of Dvinsk where the Bolshevik commander had ordered a certain number of Jews to work at the front. It is true that the Poles and other anti-Bolsheviks are compelled to do the same and in a more gruesome manner, but that naturally, cannot arouse among the Jews any love for the Bolsheviks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>On the other hand the Jews are practically safe from pogroms in Soviet Russia. Where the Bolsheviks reign, every incitement to pogroms is strongly suppressed. Mr. Levine relates the fact that the first thing the Bolsheviks did when they penetrated the pogrom regions of the Ukraine was to organize immediate relief for the Jewish pogrom victims, especially for the thousands of orphans and widows of the Jewish martyrs. It is the only relief obtained now by the pogrom victims of the Ukraine, for as yet there are no other sources.</p>
   <p>To the question of what the Jews of Russia can expect in the future, Mr. Levine declared that the only hope the Jews of Soviet Russia entertain is the possibility of immediate emigration to Palestine or America. The Jews of Russia will therefore greet with joy the conclusion of peace between Russia and Estonia. They see in it a closer step toward establishing relations with the <span class="page-break">\6</span>the outside world and the opportunity to correspond with their relatives and friends in America from whom they have been away for so long.</p>
   <p>Mr. Levine brought with him a mass of material about the terrible pogroms in the Ukraine. This material will be published shortly in the Daily News exclusively. A part of this material Mr. Levine turned over to the Jewish Committee in Europe. At the request of the Russian Zionists he brought with him a series of numbers of the Russian Zionist organ, the Chronicle of Jewish Life, with articles and facts about the Jewish situation. These he turned over to the American Zionists.</p>
