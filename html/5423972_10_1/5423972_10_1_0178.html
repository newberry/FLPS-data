   <p>The regular meeting of the Chicago Zion Gate No. 1, of the Order Knights of Zion, which was held last Monday, at the rooms of the society, was a big success. The tactics of the Gate to organize open meetings and have prominent speakers lecture, has drawn the people to the society in great numbers.</p>
   <p>The great speaker Mr. O. Z. Bodzinsky, delivered a wonderful address on - Organization. Mr. Bodzinsky is one of our best speakers and talks in a heart-to-heart manner. In his criticism, he mentioned the fact that the Zionists in Chicago consists of Generals without soldiers, but no sooner did he utter these words than a bunch of twenty-five soldiers stood at the Gate demanding admittance.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Bodzinsky's address, Mr. Julius Katz of the Chicago Zion Gate, took the platform and he also made a wonderful talk on Zionism. This <span class="page-break">\2</span>speech was not so long but was to the point. He mostly related the recent accomplishments of the Zionist movement in Chicago and elsewhere. Mr. H. Hurovitz, Grand Orator of the Knights of Zion, spoke last. The audience was very much impressed and departed expressing much appreciation.</p>
   <p>At the next regular meeting of this Gate, which will be held, Monday, Feb. 4, our well known speaker, Mr. Leon Zolotkoff will talk on - What is the duty of the Zionist?</p>
