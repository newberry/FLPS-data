   <p>Mr. Phillip Seman, formerly superintendent of the St. Louis Hebrew Aliance Building and more recently connected with the Removal office in New York, arrived yesterday morning in Chicago to fill the office of superintendent of the Chicago Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>Much satisfaction is being expressed with Mr. Seman as the leader of Chicago's largest institution. This satisfaction is based on Mr. Seman's long record of service as a social worker. Wherever he held a position he distinguished himself with his great energy and faithfulness to his public work. He has thus created a good reputation for himself among the masses attending the institute and also among the rich patrons whose money support the institute.</p>
   <p>Last eveing, Mr. Seman visited the office and editorial rooms of the Courier where he spent quite some time discussing public matters.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seman is still a very young man but already bears a significant name in the social world. Mr. Seman is a Russian Jew of great learning.</p>
