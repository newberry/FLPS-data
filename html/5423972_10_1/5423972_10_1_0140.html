   <p>The Grand Gate of the order of Knights of Zion held a meeting November 3; their report showed as follows: The Gate in Madison, Wisconsin made wonderful progress since its organization. The Gate sent in the per capita tax and requested the Zionist organizations of Chicago to send them a good speaker for next Sunday's meeting.</p>
   <p>A new Gate was organized here in Chicago by the Persian Jews under the name of "Ahair Zion," the organization sent in their per capita tax and also requested the Zion headquarters to send them a Hebrew lecturer or a speaker who could address the audience in Hebrew at their next meeting. These Persian Jews speak their mother tongue only, which is Hebrew. Of course they understand the English language but not well enough to understand a capable speaker, so they must have someone to address them in Hebrew.</p>
