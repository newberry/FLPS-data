   <p>S. J. Rosenblatt, the well-known community worker, returned yesterday from a three-month trip to Europe. He was warmly welcomed at the La Salle Street depot by many of his numerous friends. He also received a similar welcome from a big crowd at the Covenant Club, of which he is a member, and where he had lunch at a table decked with flowers sent by his many friends and admirers. Mrs. Rosenblatt, who accompanied her husband to Europe, remained in New York. She will return next week.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenblatt told a representative of the Courier about many of his experiences in Eastern Europe. He will give a detailed report this evening at a special session of the Chicago Joint Relief Committee, at its office, 720 West Roosevelt Road. Rabbis and synagogue presidents are expected to attend this meeting. [Translator's note: The rest of the article was not translated because it does not fall within the scope of this work.]</p>
