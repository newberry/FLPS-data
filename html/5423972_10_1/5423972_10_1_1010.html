   <p>Minnie Low, superintendent of the Bureau of Social Service of the Associated Jewish Charities, died yesterday morning at the Michael Reese Hospital after having been ill for twenty-eight weeks. She was fifty-four years old.</p>
   <p>Minnie Low was one of the best-known women in Chicago, as well as in the U. S. She made herself known as an active worker in the field of Jewish charity and social welfare. Everybody, far and wide, paid respectful attention to her proposals, plans, and work, which she put forth to improve and better the life of those who are poor and unfortunate. She was, therefore, elected president of the Charities' Correction Bureau, an office which she held with honor. She had a clever head, a warm heart, and a free hand. She deprived herself of many of the pleasures of life and devoted most of her time to the unfortunate of this community. The orphan, the widow, the woman who was afflicted with a bad husband (or vice versa)--all received her advice and help. The large income of the Associated Charities was due <span class="page-break">2</span>to her efforts; the great work that she was doing required more and more funds which caused many of our rich brothers to become philanthropists. It must be said, to her credit, that every cent she received she spent properly.</p>
   <p>Minnie Low began her career as a social worker twenty-four years ago when she, with the assistance of Mrs. Minnie Jacobs Berlin, founded the Seventh Ward Bureau of Charities. The office was on Jefferson Street. A year later the work was transferred to Schiff's Building, and five years ago to Wood and Selden Streets. The founding of the Juvenile Protective League, which later brought into life the Juvenile Court, was due to Minnie Low's work protecting the children on the streets and in the courts.</p>
   <p>The funeral of the deceased will take place tomorrow, Tuesday, at nine-thirty in the morning from Firth Chapel, 924 East 47th Street, to Oakwoods Cemetery. Rabbi Emil N. Hirsch will deliver the funeral oration. The pallbearers will be: Dr. Julius Hess, M. Karp, Abel Davis, A. J. Pflam, <span class="page-break">3</span>M. S. Reynolds, Adolph Kurtz, and Judge Harry M. Fisher.</p>
