   <p>Not every doctor is destined to achieve great things for the prople. It is the special privilege of the gifted individual. To achieve something one must be an idealist, a dreamer, a man with only one aim in life. Such a man was Dr. Theodore B. Sachs. His work was chiefly practical. He was mostly interested in helping the working masses--the poorer class of the population. Shortly after he began practicing on the West Side, he began to devote all of his time to enlightening the people. His first accomplishment was to annihilate the old whimsical notion that the Jews, as a race, are by nature immune to tuberculosis. His investigation revealed otherwise. It showed that a large percentage of the poor Jews on the West Side suffer from tuberculosis. It seems as though the little immunity, that the Jew has gained in the past thousands of years, is a weak and inadequate bulwark against the hazards of modern life with its sweat shops.</p>

   <p>The tailor shops, the cigar factory, the unsanitary home [conditions], the unnatural mode of life and many other causes have multiplied the number of victims of the white plague. The incipient case and the case which is not recognized in time, being without the necessary [medical] aid, have consequently become worse and have infected others in the home, on the streetcar and in the factories. The city made no attempt to segregate the sick from the healthy citizens, or at least, to come to the aid of the sick in time.</p>
   <p>The only solution known was Denver, Colorado. When a poor tailor or capmaker eventually discovered that he was tubercular after a severe hemorrhage, the first thing his fellow workers would do would be to raise enough money, among themselves, for a ticket to Denver. In most cases the assistance came too late. The vacation in the West brought on additional worries about the financial status of the family, the longing for home and many other troubles. The hope of recovery could not be realized when the worker returned home. When he began to work again, his sickness returned. This is an old story.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Such was the situation when Dr. Sachs appeared on the West Side as a young physician.</p>
   <p>First of all, the public was to be awakened to the truth! the public must be made aware of the treacherous enemy--tuberculosis. The masses were to be enlightened, by pounding it into their heads that coughing, coughing up phlegm, shivering, weariness, and loss of appetite might mean consumption. Not only were the masses to be enlightened but also the doctors, in order that they might recognize the significance of the above-mentioned symptoms.</p>
   <p>Consequently, the question of saving those in whom the sickness had already developed, arose. It was necessary to convince the sick that they need not go West to be cured; that recovery could be achieved at home. The cure does not lie in medicine or in any particular climate. Fresh air is the same in Denver as it is on Maxwell Street, and even in the back yards. It is true, however, that in certain respects the air at home is not so good as it is in Denver, but it has one great advantage in that it does not require extensive traveling to attain.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It soon became evident that it was better for the poor tuberculosis sufferers to remain at home than to travel West, because the best climate in the world cannot do a thing for a sick person so long as he is deprived of the necessary nutritious food and has additional worries.</p>
   <p>First, the people had to be taught to accustom themselves to fresh air. Superstition is hard to overcome. Our Jews especially fear a cold. They catch cold very often. With his determination and energy, Dr. Sachs exterminated this superstition and taught the people not to fear fresh air. Many times he would do it rudely, but he triumphed! Many would call him "fresh air crank," and other nicknames, but at the same time, would keep their windows open.</p>
   <p>Around the energetic doctor centered a few young men who ardently wished to participate in his educational work. Various organizations became interested in his work and the result was the construction of the Winfield Sanitarium for the benefit of first-stage tubercular cases. Curing the sick at home was first made <span class="page-break">5</span>possible by the Municipal Tuberculosis Dispensaries, the Visiting Nurses Association and the charity of private individuals.</p>
   <p>The city government acted a bit late, but it finally awoke and began taking an interest in the struggle begun by Dr. Sachs against the white plague. Since then good work has been done. In the last fifteen years, the situation has changed a great deal. The horrible enemy of the working masses, which played so much havoc, has been brought finally under the control of medical science.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sachs began this splendid work and led it to the zenith of success by founding the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium--the pride of Chicago's citizenry.</p>
