   <p>Hed's Concert - Master of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</p>
   <p>Jacques Gordon, a Jewish young man from the east side, who occupies a distinguished position in the musical world of America. - By Jonah Spivak.</p>
   <p>In the Chicago musical world the name of the Jewish young man, Jacques Gordon, the Concert Maestro of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, is one of the most popular and most beloved!</p>
   <p>With the exception of Frederick Stock, Conductor of the Symphony Orchestra, Gordon is, perhaps, the most popular musician in Chicago, and all the activities in the musical domain are concentrated upon him. Stock instructs and coordinates the orchestra, whereas Gordon sees that these instructions are carried out accurately. Stock introduces Gordon quite frequently to the public, in order to show that his gifted concert-maestro has contributed much to the success of the orchestra.</p>

   <p>Nature must bestow on those whose task is to become a tone-judge, many good characteristics. A musician must be born with a remarkable sense of hearing; a keen imagination; a warm temperament; and, especially, an unusual memory.</p>
   <p>And Gordon is endowed with all these qualities.</p>
   <p>Gordon has deep faith in himself, which grew and encouraged him from early youth; he believed that he could perform the tasks he undertook. Upon perceiving the mysterious inspirational spirit which is implanted deep in his heart, he did not permit himself to dream and become impotent, but developed and conveyed it to the world.</p>
   <p>These qualities pleased Gordon on a high pedestal of musical art.</p>

   <p>He was fortunate enough to have his parents, who were wealthy business people in Odessa, where he was born, to select a musical career for him. He seemed to take to the violin instinctively.</p>
   <p>At the age of 6 he entered the Imperial Conservatory. He was taught by the famous musician, Franz Stufka, who recognized his musical talent and devoted more time to him than any other student.</p>
   <p>At the age of 13 he graduated from the Conservatory, receiving First Prize. At the age of 14 he migrated to Germany, where he continued his musical studies. From Germany he went to France, where he studied a brief period, and at 16 years he came to New York with his parents.</p>
   <p>The material condition of his parents, when arriving in New York was fairly good, and he continued his studies in New York, under the instruction of the renowned musician, Franz Kneisler. Gordon felt his fertileness on American soil and he soon became the focal point of the musical world.</p>
   <p>Gordon's first success was amongst the Jewish masses. He was the first one that founded the People's Concerts in the Socialist-Rand School of New York.</p>

   <p>Gordon believes that every man is musically-conscious. He said, "How can music exist and become developed if it does not resound in the hearts of the masses?" Through the sound of music. Man acknowledges the object of life. When a child learns to play or sing a melody he begins to realize that every moment, every thing has a source and an end. And by the science of harmony, man feels and understands all the phenomena of life and the depth of nature.</p>
   <p>He was engaged later in concert-tours throughout the United States and Canada, and met with great success.</p>
   <p>In 1919, Gordon traveled with the New York Symphony Orchestra in Europe. They played in France, Holland, England, Belgium and Italy. He also played for three years with the Berkshire Quartette and played with Harold Bauer and Madame Anna Moisseyevitch.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gordon is now with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, where he holds the high and reputable position of Concert Maestro.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Mr. Gordon appeared this season seven times as Soloist with the Symphony Orchestra, and at three "Joint Recitals" with Rudolph Reiter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gordon is also active in other musical spheres. He is the Conductor of the Sinai Symphony Orchestra, and the head of the Violin Department of the American Conservatory in Kimball Hall.</p>
   <p>Although he occupies a high position in the musical world Mr. Gordon is not conceited. He is a modest Jewish young-man, who makes a very sympathetic impression on everyone who comes in contact with him. He reached the summit of the mountain, but he never ignores those who are in the process of climbing.</p>
