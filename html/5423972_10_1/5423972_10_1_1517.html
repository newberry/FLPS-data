   <p>Benedict Schlossman, one of our oldest and most respected citizens, died March 3rd, at the age of 82. He was born in Steinhard, Bavaria, July 1, 1817, and came to America in 1839. He moved to Chicago in 1848, where he was progressive in business as well as in religion. He was elected president of the K. A. M. in 1859. As president, he induced the trustees to consent to female singing in the synagogue. A new choir was engaged, and the first organ was introduced into the service. He improved the mode of worship, and kept alive the spirit of activity and progress. He inaugurated the custom of removing the head covering during the services, and the seating of families together. He was, however, strongly and bitterly opposed in all his innovations. The reform party became restless and dissatisfied, and twenty-six members seceded from the K. A. M., forming a new organization under the name of Sinai Congregation. Of this congregation, Benedict Schlossman was the first president.</p>
   <p>The deceased was prominent in the early history of Chicago. He was president of the old Concordia Club and a charter member of the Standard Club.</p>
