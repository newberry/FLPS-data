   <p>Before the War, the printing of Hebrew books, both religious and secular, was concentrated mainly in the old press Haalmona Vehaocheem Rome, in Wilna. Most of their books were stereotyped copies of old publications that were very little concerned with modern Hebrew methods. One could find very little delight in the modern literature either, such as their textbooks, spelling books, year-books, etc.</p>
   <p>When Zionism began to seep into the homes of our brothers, together with the desire of rebuilding our Hebrew spirit and language, then many of our educators began to avail themselves of Hebrew books. Hebrew schools opened everywhere, and numerous Jewish families began to think of a Hebrew education for their children. Both teachers and parents soon recognized hindrances, the fault of which could be seen in these modern Hebrew textbooks. All these books and literary exercises failed to interest the Jewish child. The boy who had known the value of the European publications, which possessed so much beauty in their style and material, looked disdainfully on these books so unattractive to him.</p>
   <p>Lovers of the Hebrew language and literature believed it was their duty to establish a modern publication that would embody the Hebrew book in a modern form and attract the attention of the modern readers.</p>
   <p>But living conditions in diaspora lands and the coming of the war, put an end to this plan.</p>
   <p>If circumstances for printing a Hebrew book were bad before the war, they are now tragic. Five years of war has placed everything in a critical position. The blight of war that covered with such devastating force the Jewish centers of Lithuania, Poland, Galicia and Ukraine stopped the production of new books entirely, and destroyed the old. The mass wandering from one place to another made it impossible for possessors to safeguard their treasured private libraries. Whatever was left, was destroyed. Such was the fate of all Jewish books that Jews in war zones owned.</p>
   <p>In Russia, the former center for production of Hebrew books, one cannot find even a Gomara, a Mishna, a Tonach, or a prayer book. And who could even mention Hebrew grammars, of them not a trace can be found. From everywhere one hears the cry: "Give us books, a Sidur, a Tonach." But there are none we can give them.</p>
   <p>The division of Russia into various political groups, the political chaos, the high cost of materials, and the hardships of transferring goods, all taken together makes it impossible to print Hebrew books in Russia. Schools are closed because of this. The deficiency is felt not only in Russia, Poland, Galicia, Rumania, Turkey, Greece, and Egypt, but also throughout the entire Jewish world, and especially in Palestine.</p>
   <p>In the Hebrew newspaper of Cairo, The Renewal of the Land, Mr. Zaltzman, the editor of the Razsvelt, in Moscow, quotes that he personally investigated conditions in the above mentioned countries in reference to Hebrew books, and he found them to be such as have been here described.</p>
   <p>In his articles, printed in The Renewal of the Land, Mr. Zaltzman shows how necessary it is to build a modern model printing shop, not simply anywhere, but in Jerusalem proper.</p>
   <p>"Before and during the war," he says, "plans were formed for such a model to be established in Wilna, Warsaw, Moscow, Switzerland, America, and other places. But now, after the dismemberment of Russian Judaism and the destruction of its spiritual center, there is no doubt that such plans are no longer practicable except in one place, Palestine.</p>
   <p>"According to activities of the latest political occurrences, Palestine will be the spiritual center of the Jewish world. Here we have the Hebrew spirit and language nurtured by many Hebrew synagogues. Here also is built the Hebrew university. And here is Palestine, whose influence will increase many fold on Jews in all other countries, should the Hebrew book be printed there. This country is the midpoint between East and West. Its central position facilitates transportation. A Hebrew book, printed in Jerusalem, the spiritual center and capital of Palestine, will strongly appeal to Jews of every land and its production will bring a continuous stream of money into Palestine, will create a livelihood for thousands of workers, and will help rebuild Palestine economically."</p>
   <p>The founders of The Jerusalem Printing Association in America may be pleased to find so much sanction of their plan from this authority, who knows the circumstances of the Hebrew book as Mr. S. Zaltzman does.</p>
   <p>Not so long ago, in the Jewish press, it was stated that Mr. Zaltzman came to Palestine as representative of a Jewish-Russian group, bringing with him a million dollars to establish a publication. This, unfortunately, is not true. Mr. Zaltzman, in the article mentioned from the Renewal of the Land, speaks only of a plan to raise a million dollars. The present American plan for the Jerusalem Printing Press is using the best methods for this purpose. As a matter of fact, they have already made a beginning.</p>
   <p>Through the medium of Mr. Levin-Epstein, who is now in Palestine, The Hebrew Printing Group of America were placed in connection with Mr. Zaltzman to secure his services for this tremendous task.</p>
