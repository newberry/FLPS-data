   <p>George Braham, the well known attorney, died at his home last Sunday night. Mr. Braham was born in England fifty-eight years ago, and came to this country when a young man. He had lived in Chicago for over thirty years. He was, for the early part of that period, a newspaper advertising solicitor, but later studied law and had been practicing for over a quarter of a century, making a specialty of collection work. He was attorney for the Staats Zeitung, and for the last five years he had his office in the Staats Zeitung Building, where he operated the American and European Law Collection Agency. He was at one time an active B'nai B'rith member and held a high office in the I. O. of Free Sons.</p>
