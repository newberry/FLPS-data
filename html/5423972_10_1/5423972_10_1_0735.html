   <p>In 1917, when labor troubles threatened to tie up the basic war industry of the meat packing houses, Judge Alschuler was named as federal administrator for that industry, for fixing wages and working conditions and adjusting labor grievances therein during the period of the World War; and as the war did not officially terminate for a long period, the heavy burdens of this task devolved on him for nearly four years. In 1923, he was named by President Harding as a member of the President's Fact Finding Commission for the coal industry, wherein serious labor disturbances seemed imminent.</p>
