   <p>At the meeting of the Board, Dr. Louis L. Mann and Solomon B. Freehof representing the Chicago Rabbinical Association requested an appropiation for a chaplain. The matter was discussed and the conclusion reached that it would be desirable to add to the staff of the Social Service Bureau a competent social worker with sufficient religious training so that the personal and religious problems of the individual inmates could receive attention and that the matter be referred to the Social Service Bureau for appropiate action.</p>
