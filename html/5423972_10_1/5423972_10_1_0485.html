   <p>The four free nations, Lithuania, Ukrania, Estonia, and Latvia, have joined the protest voices raised in the great free America against the terrible state crimes of the twentieth century, the "official" military pogroms on Jews in Poland, by denouncing the barbaric repressive, uprooting politics of Paderewski's "hoodlums" against the national minority in Poland.</p>
   <p>Representatives of three million citizens of these four lands in America, openly denounced the conspiracy of the rapacious Poles in their land. They demand of the Nations Tribunal in Versailles that they acknowledge the independence and absolute freedom of their historical territory.</p>
   
   <p>In presenting such a moral mandate of the sixty million inhabitants in the above mentioned national provinces; and also the brave conscious manifestations in New York's Carnegie Hall, where they appealed to the World for Justice and national rights, yet they have not forgotten also to urge the same justice for the oppressed and persecuted Jews in Poland. Amidst the applause of hundreds of listeners, they accepted a sharp resolution against the persecutions of Jews in Poland, Lithuania, and Galicia, assuring publicly that Lithuania and Ukrania aim to give Jews equal rights and protection as citizens.</p>
   <p>Jewish antonomy in Eastern Galicia, special ministry for Jewish affairs in Ukrania, statements by the attorney and Lithuanian foreign minister Samson Rosenboim (in Paris) regarding the attitude of the Lithuanians to the Jewish population in Wilno and Kovna, are the best proof of substantiating the ideal aims of these just manifestations.</p>
   <p>This is the earnest call of the alert free nations, which understand that their own freedom and national renascence are closly linked to the freedom and peaceful tendencies of all their co-citizens and neighbors, who are thus historically and socially connected with their politics, life, and destiny.</p>
   <p>To be free,a nation is dependent upon the freedom of its Jews.</p>
   
   <p>All minority groups of a land that are economically, commercially, and part culturally grown into the population, having a common root by development dating back to the first century, must all enjoy citizen rights and national profits from whichever country it may be. This is the guarantee for the future and growth of the land; for its inner equilibrium and outer prestige.</p>
   <p>A country of inner unrest and constant national friction, of disorderly and internal political reaction, is under the modern political standards, socially and morally bankrupt, and economically backward. It loses all international sympathy and confidence.</p>
   <p>A state based on peace or unity, on peaceful mutual cultural exchange and harmony of all its constituents on principles of democratic privileges and equality for all citizens, can be a justifiable partner in a modern free-nations pact,and a member in the international family.</p>
   <p>This elementary rule of modern statesmanship, national rights, political discretion and true freedom has been truly nurtured by the striving national groups of Lithuania, Ukrania, Estonia, and Latvia. The Jewish homeless nation extends its fullest sympathies and compassion for their ideal and national strivings.</p>
   <p>We greet with great approval their pointed stand against Poland's grab-politics and against the prevalence of the Middle Age system of plunder and destruction of nations in the robbed Lithuanian and Ukranian provinces.</p>
   <p>We maintain that at the critical moment before the imagined bankruptcy of the "European conscience," the four sincere freedom-seeking democratic nations dared proclaim to the World Jewish equality in their lands, and have approved the Jewish folks' protests against Polish terrors.</p>
   <p>We will record this in the chronicles of the eternal history of an eternal Israel, on a golden page which will illuminate like a star our dark Diaspora path.</p>
   
   <p>But we especially thank those nations for their courageous aggressiveness and appeal for justice.</p>
   <p>They did their duty and wiped away the blotch from Christian civilization. .....</p>
   <p>With their acknowledgment of freedom and human justice for others, they have thereby earned the clearance of their own historical debts from the National Tribunal. Thus they morally and politically won a victory in their struggle for freedom and independence.</p>
   <p>They took their stand, ready to realize the theoretically "dead fourteen points" of peace between nations and thereby manifested the honorable and international worth of their country and the justice of their demands.</p>
   <p>In short, they aided themselves and owe no one any gratitude for it.</p>
   <p>We greet this important step with great approval.</p>
