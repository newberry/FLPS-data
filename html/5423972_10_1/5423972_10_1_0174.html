   <p>On the North West Side of Chicago, a new Jewish weekly publication in the English language has appeared under the name The Jewish Standard. The second number of this publication is before us and we notice in it, an editorial against Zionism. We wish to take issue with the writer of this editorial; for the kind of Jews who are not in favor of Zionism, are simply not Jews of the right kind. The non-Zionists may be Jews, but they are not Jewish.</p>
   <p>In ancient times when the Jews had their prophets, their own country, temple and religion, the word Zionism, of course, did not exist; but since they have lost their promised land, their temple, their equal rights as citizens, their freedom in some parts of the world, etc., a different problem has arisen. During the 2,000 years exile of the Jew, his problems have increased in great numbers, hence he cannot possibly be a <span class="page-break">\2</span>conscientious Jew, unless he is a firm believer in Zionism, for Zionism is here to stay just so long as the Jewish nation is in exile. The ultimate success of Zionism is sure to come sooner or later. It may be slow in coming, but it will come.</p>
