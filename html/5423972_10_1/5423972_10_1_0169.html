   <p>(Zionism). Dr. Levin will visit America.</p>
   <p>Famed Zionist to visit the United States to gather an Education Fund for the Holy Land of Palestine. The Federation of American Zionists has announced that Dr. Schmaryahu Levin will be in Chicago this winter. Dr. Levin left the United States for Palestine, last year. He has made a study of the conditions of colonists in Palestine and is returning to raise a much needed Educational Fund for young Palestinian Colonists who desire more spiritual training, but lack the means or facilities. Dr. Levin therefore decided to gather this Educational Fund in America.</p>
   <p>At the last World Zionist Congress at the Hague, Dr. Levin consulted American delegates about his Educational Fund to be raised in the United States. All the delegates favored the plan and promised to offer every assistance to Dr. Levin. The American delegates decided to form an Independent Committee, not affiliated with the Federation of American Zionists, to help further the plan.</p>
   
   <p>A committee of the Congress at the Hague considered a project whereby all Zionists would be asked to tax themselves the sum of not less than one dollay a year to be paid to the Central Organization.</p>
