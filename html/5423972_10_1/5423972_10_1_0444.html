   <p>Sholom Asch, the noted Jewish writer, who has recently returned from Europe, yesterday addressed a huge audience at the Empire Theater. He told of Jewish conditions in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>"I will present facts," Mr. Asch said, "rather than a description of various scenes. Even in Holland I witnessed the misery of Poland; countless numbers of Jews from Poland, Lithuania and Russia, who, after many hardships, managed to escape from their homes, are found there. They have come seeking a haven, but instead have been interned by Holland's government because they might be Bolsheviks. At present they are still held in camps. Their suffering is hard to describe. Even more annoying is the fact that Holland's Jews do nothing for them.</p>
   <p>"Holland is only a beginning. The real Jewish misery is in the war countries."</p>
   <p>Mr. Asch also told of twenty thousand soldiers in Germany being held as Russian prisoners of war, whom the Allies refuse to return to Russia. Among them are <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>many Jews, and their condition is tragic.</p>
   <p>In speaking of Lithuania Mr. Asch said that Lithuania was totally ruined. Its destruction was begun even in the time of the bloody Tsarist rule in Russia. A decree issued during that time, that Jews must leave their homes within twenty-four hours, was the beginning of Jewish ruin. Four hundred thousand left their possessions and goods, were crowded into wagons, and thus driven from their homes. The decree was rigidly enforced. The sick and feeble were taken from their beds and sent out with the rest.</p>
   <p>Mr. Asch told the story of a Jewish family who applied to the commander for permission to be left in the city because the father was deathly sick. The commander sent an officer to investigate but the officer, upon entering the house, drew his revolver, shot the sick father, and said, "Now you can travel".</p>
   <p>"From that time on Jewish Lithuania has never been the same. I visited Kovno--other than a great cemetery, there remained only a few small houses. Shavli is totally ruined. Ponievietz is in partial ruin, and so are other towns and villages."</p>

   <p>Mr. Asch closed by saying that he thought conditions in Lithuania were not altogether hopeless. If Jews of America wish to help Jews in Lithuania, they should do so by offering constructive aid.</p>
