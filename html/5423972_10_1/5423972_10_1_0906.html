   <p>The French Government, through its minister, Edouard Herriot, announced in Paris, yesterday, that the highest honor conferred by the French Academy, the decoration of Officer of Public Instruction, has been awarded to Maurice H. Goldblatt of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goldblatt is an art expert of international repute. While in Paris last summer, after considerable research work, he proved conclusively to the French Government officials that he could name the real artists whose paintings in the Louvre were erroneously attributed to Da Vinci. One of Mr. Goldblatt's proofs was that Da Vinci was a left handed painter and therefore could not have executed the paintings which showed right-hand brush strokes.</p>
   <p>The "Bacchus" formerly considered a Da Vinci, was given by Mr. Goldblatt to Andrea Salaina, the famous pupil of Da Vinci, as was the "Virgin and Child." The "Virgin of the Scales," Mr. Goldblatt proved to be the work of Cesare de Sesto. These facts were accepted by the directors of the Louvre and the catalogue of painting changed accordingly.</p>
