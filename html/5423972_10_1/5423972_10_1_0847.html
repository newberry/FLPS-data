   <p>To four men may be ascribed the credit for having laid the first stone in the foundation of the social and spiritual life among the Jews of Chicago, who came from Eastern Europe. The four, Abraham Lieberman, Marx Nathan, Jacob Cohen and Joseph M. Berkson, were immigrants from Lithuania and were the first of the new arrivals to manifest a philanthropic and social spirit. Lieberman and Nathan were generous and pious and were instrumental in organizing many social agencies. Cohen and Berkshon were the founders of the first Talmud Torah in Chicago, and the Moses Montefiore Hebrew Free School.</p>
