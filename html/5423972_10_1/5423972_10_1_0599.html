   <p>Our liberal Jewish brothers take an interest in us. We cannot suspect in our philanthropists and millionaires who engage in Jewish politics the world over that their purpose is primarily to do us harm or to betray us. On the contrary, they treat us as true brethren when we are in need; they give us their money; they maintain institutions; they pay the social workers; in short, they are our friends. They will also overlook many of our faults and defend us in public when necessary. But they cannot bear one weakness of ours--the weakness of our being a Jewish nation.</p>
   <p>Whenever the question of a Jewish nation is involved, they become volcanic, hysterical and lose all patience. Otherwise, they apparently seem to be decent, goodhearted philanthropists. But when is this the case? When Jews who are compelled to appeal to them for succor or those who expect cooperation from them as brethren are satisfied to die as a nation or to admit that they are already extinct as a nation. Should these liberals, however, detect in the Jewish masses a rise of Jewish consciousness or a sign of national determination, they then forget about their philanthropy, their brotherhood and their friendship. They are then apt to act like betrayers, like apostates and like the vilest of intriguers, in whom compassion and brotherhood no longer reside.</p>
   <p>Approximately a century ago, the Jewish "war" was waged in the synagogue. The reform movement rendered Jewish consciousness a nonentity in the prayer book. In that book was obliterated the remembrance of Zion and Jerusalem and everything having any relationship to the existence of a Jewish nation and to the hope for Jewish nationalism in the future. For this, we can have no grievance against them, especially not at the present. In former times there were also groups among the Jews who sought to desert their race when it was in despair and undergoing hardship. The Bar Yonahs and Mith Yonim of yesteryear were two such groups.</p>
   
   <p>At the present time, however, the question of Jewish nationalism, and the right of Jews to be a nation, is once more appearing on the world stage. Nations and governments are beginning to reckon with it. It is no longer a question of tinkering with the Bible. Life itself renders evident the fallacy of an unfounded theory of the death of a nation which is really not dead. Even the German government itself is beginning to doubt whether its Reformed Jewish subjects are justified in their assumption that there is no longer a Jewish nation; and the English government informs us through Sir Edward Grey that in due time Jewish interests in Palestine will be taken into consideration.</p>
   <p>In this country our liberal friends, particularly those who come from Germany, stand aghast. Why is that? The whole structure of an extinct nation--the theory postulated by the Diaspora--is shattered and is falling by the wayside.</p>
   <p>At this point our liberal brethren cease to be brothers. In case of death they are willing to render aid, but when we make mention of reviving as a nation, they become our archenemies, and opponents. And the money that they would otherwise use in philanthropy, they will now use in consummating their betrayal.</p>
   <p>We sincerely maintain that they take an interest in us. Their conviction is that the Jewish nation can be saved only through extinction. They have tread and are still treading this path, and have imagined that everything is all right. With them it is only a matter of time. Suddenly they hear a voice, which comes from the broad masses of the people, "Halt! Whither goest thou? We will not obey thee! Thou leadest us into destruction!" Upon hearing this our brethren become provoked.</p>
   <p>The millions that pass through the hands of the German Jews for war sufferers, and the political and social influence they derive therefrom, are carried over from the pulpit to the stage of world politics, in order to impede Jews in their endeavor to revive as a nation. Our friends, the philanthropists and liberals, take an interest in us. But God protect us against our friends.</p>
