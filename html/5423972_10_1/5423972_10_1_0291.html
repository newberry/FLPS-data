   <p>When an old peasant plants a tree in his garden, he knows well that he will not live to enjoy the fruits of that tree, but, nevertheless, he plants the tree, takes good care of it, waters it when it is dry, protects it against the cold and the winter. He knows that he will not enjoy the fruit of that tree; he knows that his children and grandchildren will enjoy the fruit, but that does not prevent him from planting the tree. In this respect the peasant has a sound instinct.</p>
   <p>If we Jews would have this instinct of the peasant, we could save a great deal of money and energy that we are now spending to convince our people of the necessity of building Palestine.</p>
   <p>If every Jew would have the intuition that he himself will still see and enjoy <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a free Jewish Palestine, that he himself will profit from a free Jewish Palestine, that he himself will be able to solve his own problems in a free Jewish Palestine, he would certainly give a large portion of his wealth or of his income for the upbuilding of the land. But the Jew does not possess the sound sense for the future that the peasant does. Therefore, the Jew must be persuaded to plant the tree of which only his children and grandchildren will reap the fruits and that is the reason why the building of Palestine is connected with so many birth pangs. The leader of the Zionist World Organization came to us from afar for the purpose of convincing us to plant the tree..... After having been philosophized with, after having been persuaded in the language of warning and chastisement, in the language of poetic insight and of naked facts, we do [not do] that which the common, illiterate peasant does on his on initiative--even then we do not understand what is being said to us, and even then all of us do not do our duty, because the long life in Diaspora and the unnatural conditions therein have deprived us of our natural national instincts and made us a people of windbags, and a windbag does not think of the future; a windbag does not care about the morrow.</p>

   <p>The Keren Hayesod [exchequer of the World Zionist Organization] is the tree of which our children will reap the fruits. We shall yet live to see the first green leaves of that tree; we shall live to see the tree sprout its roots into the ground and then begin to blossom. We shall yet live to see a Palestine populated by a half million Jews, perhaps not more than six or seven hundred thousand Jews. Our posterity will live to see the great, Jewish, free and prosperous Palestine on both sides of the River Jordan populated by millions of Jews, with a powerful and respected Jewish government, a strong administration and beautiful universities. They will reap the fruits of our present labor. But should not the father care for his children and the grandfather for his grandchildren? Does not the illiterate peasant plant a tree of which not he but his children and grandchildren will reap the fruits?</p>
   <p>We, the great civilized and educated Jewish people, may, in this respect, take an example from the illiterate and uncivilized peasant--and a Jew who does not possess this instinct of the peasant is neither an idealist nor a natural Jew, but rather a windbag. Here today, there tomorrow, living without any regard for <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the happiness of future generations.</p>
   <p>We now have in our midst Dr. Chaim Weizmann, the leader of the constructive work in Palestine. He is the leader and spokesman of the Jewish Palestine and he came to us with a special mission, i.e., to get money for the upbuilding of Palestine from and for Jews. The money that we give for the Keren Hayesod goes toward the planting of trees in Palestine, because a country without trees is not fruitful; the money that we give for the Keren Hayesod goes toward the draining of swamps in Palestine, toward the construction of bridges, toward combating malaria and trachoma, toward laying the foundation for a new Jewish civilization in the land of our ancestors, in order that it shall become the land of our progeny.</p>
   <p>Dr. Chaim Weizmann, builder of a free Jewish Palestine, does not ask for millions nor does he expect us to sacrifice ourselves for Palestine. He only asks of the four hundred thousand Jews in Chicago that they contribute two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as their annual quota, to the upbuilding of Palestine. This <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>sum is so small in proportion to the large Jewish population in Chicago and in consideration of the purpose, that it would be a shame if Dr. Weizmann had to leave Chicago without being assured that this small sum will be raised.</p>
   <p>A good beginning was made and the first week of the drive has been successful. It is now the duty of the Chicago Orthodoxy to guarantee the success of the drive. Let the Chicago Orthodox Jews prove that they have that sound instinct of planting a tree for their children and grandchildren.</p>
