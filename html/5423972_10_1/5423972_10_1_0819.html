   <p>In 1903, Julian W. Mack was elected Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, he came to Chicago in 1890, at the time when Chicago was attracting world-wide attention - not because of its gangsters and criminals, but because it was looked upon as the klondike of the world; the city of great possibilities and opportunities; the city chosen to serve as host to the World's Columbian Exposition.</p>
   <p>In his early twenties, Mack came to the city, not to seek his fortune as did most of the young men who came before and after him, neither wealth nor fame lured him from Cincinnati, to make his home here in this city. He brought with him not only a degree of L. L. B. awarded him by Harvard College, but also the Parker fellowship, which had enabled him to continue his studies at the universities of Berlin and Leipzig, Germany. He is said to have been one of the most brilliant students Harvard ever produced.</p>

   <p>Julian Mack arrived in Chicago unheralded,no flourishing trumpets announced his arrival. In fact, the city was not even mildly stirred by the contemplation of the young man's selection of it as a home for himself and his future bride. Chicago was unaware that young Mack chose it because he saw in the rapidly growing city a wide field for the service he had to offer. With urban indifference, it ignored the as yet unproved idealist who sought a larger scope for the talents and ability which he brought to offer to the cause of common people, and especially those of his own race. But he was not slow in forcing Chicago to notice him. The same year he came here he was admitted to the Illinois bar. Two years later as Secretary of the Jewish Charities, he was diligently working out a plan for reorganization to improve the system of collecting and distributing funds, and to create a better understanding among the heads of the various agencies engaged in bettering the conditions of the indigent immigrants. In 1895, Mack was appointed Professor of Law on the faculty of Northwestern University and remained with that institution for seven years, after which he left to become associated with the University of Chicago.</p>

   <p>When Julian W. Mack came to Chicago, the two Jewish communities - the orthodox community on the West and Northwest Sides, and the reform element on the South Side - had no point of contact except in the giving and taking of charity. The South Side Jews were the givers and the West Side Jews the receivers. A common Jewish culture was still unknown. The reform Jews had culture, it is true, but it was not a Jewish culture; orthodox Jews, on the other hand, had an abundance of Jewishness and but little culture. There was something in the psychology of Mack, perhaps an intellectual curiosity, which urged him on to acquaint himself with the life of the Russian Jew. Like Louis D. Brandeis, who later became his intimate friend, he sought to find an inner beauty in the unattractive, emotional, long-bearded Jew, still bewildered in his new environment; when he did penetrate into the soul and found all the rich intensity of color, and a latent capacity for real greatness, he set to work to bridge the abyss between the two groups. He, like many before him, reached the conclusion:</p>
   <p>"Den wo das Strenge mit dem zarten,</p>
   <p>Wo Starkes sich und Milder paarten</p>
   <p>Da giebt sinen guten Klang."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Mack wished to blend the dissonant chords of a passionate pathos with the rythmic tonality of a reasoning sensibility in order to achieve a harmonious, symphonic whole. He hoped to subdue the harsh discords and bring out the leitmotif. And as he grew to know the Russian Jew more intimately, the more anxious he was to effect the glorious masterpiece.</p>
   <p>I remember a Saturday morning during his first term as judge. I accompanied Judge Mack to the Anshe K'nesseth Israel Synagogue. It was extremely interesting to watch the reaction of the man of culture who, perhaps for the first time in his life, attended prayers in an orthodox house of worship. I discerned something of the mystic in him. In those days he knew less Hebrew than he knows now, but he was carried away by the Hebrew prayers. I watched this man who had listened spellbound to some of the most beautiful operas and symphonies performed in this country and in Europe by the greatest artists, and saw him completely enchanted by the chanting of the cantor whose music lacked every essential of harmony as we know it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The services lasted until about noon and afterwards the two of us went to the home of Mr. Sodwaysky (one of the members of the synagogue) to partake of a bountiful table laden with delicious foods and drinks, for "Kiddush." The judge sat in amazement, awed not only by the abundance, fragrant liquors and wines, nor by the platters heaped high with Gefilte Fish, although as a connoisseur of good foods he could appreciate these, but he was reflecting on the spiritual enjoyment of these people which could be derived from the practice of the religion of their forefathers. He was marvelling at the spirit of contentment and peace which shone from every countenance and pervaded every corner of the house.</p>
   <p>On our way back downtown he sat silent in meditation for a while; then suddenly he turned to me and said: "Is there the same spirit of rest, quietude, and perfect happiness in every orthodox home on the Sabbath day?"</p>
   <p>Under our American system of government, where politics is a factor in every public department, there are two kinds of judges. One is the political type who has been awarded the judgeship in return for services to his party. A judge of <span class="page-break">\6</span>that sort usually remains the politician even under his judicial robes. The other type of judge is a rare one. It sometimes happens that a wave of reform sweeps over a community which, tired of its political judges, seeks to elect men of high standing and proven ability in the legal profession, and to the latter occasional group of judges belongs Julian W. Mack. He knows nothing about politics and has never been the tool of any party. He was swept into a judicial position by a general clamor on the part of the public for honest, capable, incorruptible judges.</p>
   <p>Although a brilliant jurist who, without any great effort, would have made a reputation for himself in any branch of jurisprudence, Judge Mack cared little for personal aggrandizement, but sought instead merely a place where the combined power of a clear brain, a sympathetic heart, and a sincere purpose could be of greatest service.</p>
   <p>The Juvenile Court had been in existence several years prior to this time, but instead of fulfilling the purpose for which it was created, namely, to deter boys <span class="page-break">\7</span>and girls of a tender age from criminal and immoral pursuits, it became the battle-ground of religious zealots who were interested only in the saving of souls, each denomination fighting to gain possession of every wayward child that was brought into court, for its own narrow reasons. Judges were assigned to that important tribunal, not because of their fitness and their interest in the child problem, but because of their lack of ability to be useful in any other branch. The humanitarians, who sponsored the establishment of a Juvenile Court, were greatly disappointed when they saw to what abuse the court was being subjected. At his own request Judge Mack was assigned to the Juvenile branch, where for many years he counselled and corrected young offenders. His first efforts were to free the court from the sinister influences of creed and dogma. This was no easy task for it involved a struggle against the clergy of almost every denomination, an opposition powerful enough to be almost invincible. However, he succeeded at last in divorcing the court from religious bigotry and the first move in the process of emancipation was won. Through his influence, defects in the Juvenile Act were eliminated and the law was amended.</p>
   <p>Six years later when his term expired and he was named a candidate for reelection, those elements which he ousted in his endeavor to elevate the standard of the <span class="page-break">\8</span>Juvenile Court, and others which he had attacked in his uncompromising distribution of justice, combined together in an attempt to defeat him. His antagonists put up a strong fight, but for the second time Judge Mack emerged the victor. In his second term, he continued the reforms he inaugurated in the first, and today much of the present high moral status of the Juvenile Court is credited to Judge Mack's efforts. However, he did not fill out the second term, for a year later the United States Congress amended the Interstate Commerce Law and created the Commerce Court. President Taft appointed Judge Mack a member of that court, despite the fact that the latter was a Democrat and not a member of the party then in power.</p>
   <p>The new appointment necessitated the presence of Judge Mack in the states and cities outside of Chicago, and he was holding court in all parts of the country. At a later session of Congress, the Commerce Court was abolished, but its judges were retained as judges of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, without definite circuits assigned to them. Judge Mack went to live in New York, but Chicago remained, and still is, his legal residence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>In the forty years in which Judge Mack has been a resident of Chicago, he has devoted himself to the activities in the interest of his fellow men and his fellow Jews. Culture and philanthropy were his two ruling passions. He has a fundamental understanding of human behavior and human emotions and he is possessed of deep sympathies. He was the intermediary between the organized group of the Chicago Hebrew Institute and Mr. Julius Rosenwald, in the negotiations to convince the latter of the necessity of building that institution. Judge Mack was also one of the founders of the Jewish Book and Play Club.</p>
   <p>His understanding of his people, his sympathies for their sufferings and his susceptibility to its idealistic appeal brought him to the cause of Zionism, of which he inevitably became one of the leaders. From the very first he cast his lot with the Brandeis faction. For several years he was president of the Zionist Organization of America. He surrendered the office at the Cleveland Convention in 1921, when the break came between Dr. Chaim Weixman and Louis D. Brandeis, Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
   <p>At the writing of these lines, the Zionist convention is again being held in <span class="page-break">\10</span>Cleveland and from press reports, I learn that Zionism won a great victory; a treaty of peace was entered into by the two opposing groups and the Mack-Brandeis group are again in control of the Zionist Organization of America. It is also reported that the hero of the day that is entitled to all the credit for bringing the parties together is - as is always the case - a Chicago man, Judge Harry M. Fisher. In Judge Mack, the East and West are combined in a perfect harmony. He blends the culture of the American man and educated Jew: He who embodies - Hellenism and Hebraism.</p>
