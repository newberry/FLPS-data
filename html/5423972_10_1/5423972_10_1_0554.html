   <p>Speaking last Saturday night before the New York Union of Orthodox Synagogues, Mr. Jacob H. Schiff remarked, "We are not agreed as to the basis upon which life in Palestine should be organized, but we are all agreed that Palestine should be the home of the Jewish nation."</p>
   <p>No particularly great "revelation", but a great truth, lies in the words: "We are not agreed as to the basis upon which life in Palestine should be organized". Neither are we agreed as to the basis upon which life is to be organized in America, in Russia, or in other countries. Nor shall we be agreed upon this matter even when the Jews shall be a nation in their own land. But then the majority [decision] will probably prevail.</p>
