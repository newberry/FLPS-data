   <p>It was perhaps a good idea of the Zionist student organization, Avuka, to submit for debate the Zionist question to two famous Gentile Scholars.</p>
   <p>Jews have already argued enough about this subject; in fact, they have said everything that can be said pro and con. However, to Gentiles this question is fresh and new, and when debating upon it, they will be under the illusion that they have discovered a new hemisphere.</p>
   <p>The choice of the participants in the debate was wisely made.</p>
   <p>Mr. Holms and Mr. Clarence Darrow are both progressive and radical. Both are prominent in the United States; both are eloquent speakers and know the art of conversation. They visited Palestine and saw the land which the Zionists have selected for a Jewish National Home.</p>
   <p>However, in spite of the fact that the debate has brought forth such a sensational manifestation, it did not attract such large an audience as it was anticipated.</p>
   <p>The huge hall of the Mecca Temple was practically empty. This proves that the average American Jew does not interest himself so much with Zionism as he used to do five or six years ago before the depression. In addition to its unsuccessful attempt to attract members, the organization met with another rebuff, in that the manner of presentation of the debate was rather weak and, fragmentary. It certainly did not stimulate the dispersion of Zionistic Propaganda.</p>
   <p>It is true that Dr. Holms is an ardent friend of Zionism. However, he is not deemed to be the great scholar he is with respect to Zionist culture. His arguments support the cultural and spiritual aspects of Zionism rather than the political.</p>
   <p>Gentiles understand far better the cultural [side of] Zionism than the political. They formed the idea that the Jewish nation has to fulfill a mission in the world. Mr. Holms, therefore, influenced by the same idea, merged the two phases of Zionism together and reconcoctioned a very unfamiliar dish which only reformed Jews can digest.</p>
   <p>For other Jews this salad would only serve as an emetic.</p>
   <p>True, Mr. Holms, mustered many good words in favor of the Jewish nation.</p>
   <p>These praises met with the approval of the audience.</p>
   <p>Mr. Darrow is not an enemy of Zionism, yet, he is not a believer in Spiritual Zionism. In fact, he advocates that a land for the Jews would be very good. However, he shares the opinion of Israel Zangwill that Palestine is not suitable for a Jewish homeland. He visited Palestine and became acquainted with conditions from all angles. He also studied a great deal of literature pertaining to Zionism.</p>
   <p>Mr. Darrow arrived at the conclusion that Palestine is inadequate for the occupancy of all Jewry.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Darrow is fully aware of the historical background which Jews have had on Palestinian soil. He believes, however, that Jewry should not allow religious sentiment to gain an upper hand over political and economic policies.</p>
   <p>How can Palestine be built if the wealthy Jews refuse to settle there and the poor ones have not the means?</p>
   <p>Mr. Darrow does not believe that the Jewish nation has a special mission to perform.</p>
   <p>According to Darrow, no nation has any particular mission to perform. Darrow is not an exponent of the new cultural Zionism.</p>
   <p>The result of the debate was debatable. Mr. Holms talked on what Palestine can be, and Mr. Darrow spoke on what Palestine is and what it can be made into in later years.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Holms sought to ignore reality and soar on the wings of fantasy; Mr. Darrow clung to reality throughout the entire debate.</p>
   <p>I hope that the Zionists deem me a partisan in expressing the following views: Zionism did not profit from this debate at this time when conditions are grave. Zionist bonds have decreased in value. Therefore Mr. Darrow's arguments coincided with the present reality. They were, therefore, more convincing upon the listener than the beautiful paradise of a National Jewish homeland painted by Holms.</p>
