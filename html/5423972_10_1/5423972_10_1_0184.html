   <p>The Shelter Home and the Hebrew Theological College are in need of funds. Officials of both of these organizations have sent out circulars asking for contributions in order for them to be able to continue their fine work.</p>
   <p>The Shelter Home explains that since immigration is continuing on a large scale, more and more immigrants find their way to Chicago and these people are usually without visible means of support and therefore are in dire need of a few days of board and room until such a time as they can be placed in some gainful occupation. People are asked to remember these organizations on the holidays.</p>
