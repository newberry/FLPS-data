   <p>Barney Cohen, a recognized power in Illinois labor circles for many years, was the first man selected by Governor Lowden, when the state government was reorganized on a departmental basis, to fill the office of director of labor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cohen has a colorful career. He was born in Prussia. He came to Chicago when a child, in 1870, had very limited opportunities to attend school, and his successful career of work and service has been the result of his natural intelligence, his gifts as a leader, and his tremendously energetic way of doing whatever he undertakes to do. When he was nine years of age he was put to work in a cigar factory. On reaching the age of fourteen he qualified as a journeyman cigar maker, and has held a card in the Cigar Makers International for forty-two years. When he was twenty-one years of age he was elected president of the Cigar Makers Union. From that time forward he has been one of the soundest counsellors and leaders in labor circles in Illinois.</p>
