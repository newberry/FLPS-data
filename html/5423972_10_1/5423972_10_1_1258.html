   <p>It is with profound regret that we record the death of Mr. Benjamin F. Rubel, who has been for the last year a Director of the Chicago Hebrew Institute. From the very beginning he gave the Institute the same devoted attention and interest which made him so successful in business. Mr. Rubel was sick only a short time, being taken ill with Pneumonia on the 11th of April, and passed away on the 18th.</p>
   <p>He was born September 17, 1867, and his entire business-career was in Chicago. He was President of the Fleischman Floral Company, and of the B.F.Rubel Candy Co. His rapid rise started when he took over the Fleischman business and enlarged it, and in the course of a few years Mr. Rubel built up two large industries. He was a member of the Chicago Association of Commerce, the Standard Club, and the Illinois Athletic Club. He was unmarried.</p>

   <p>We feel a keen personal loss in Mr. Rubel's sudden demise.</p>
   <p>A devoted friend has been taken away from us, suddenly, and we know that we shall miss his presence and his kindly assistance. In common with his family, we mourn his loss, and we extend to them our condolence in their hour of sorrow.</p>
