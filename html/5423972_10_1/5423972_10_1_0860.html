   <p>A curative workshop for cripples endowed for $100,000 in the will of Milton L. Hartman, Chicago furniture merchant, will be opened in M. R. Hospital within two months under the direction of Dr. John L. Coulter, and Dr. D. H. Levinthal, both of the Northwestern University Medical School.</p>
   <p>The workshop, said to be the first of its kind in Chicago, will have little resemblance to a hospital room or clinic. Tools and appliances will be installed and patients will be assigned to such work as will exercise their impaired limbs, and at the same time, teach them a practical vocation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hartman's gift was described as the largest ever made for a physical and occupational therapy department in a hospital and M. R. Hospital will have the first endowed workshop in the country.</p>
