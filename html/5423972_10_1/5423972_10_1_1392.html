   <p>Professor Gabriel Bamberger, superintendent of the Jewish Training School, died Friday morning, January 9. He was born in the small village of Angerod in the Grand Duchy of Hessen-Darmstadt on June 3, 1845. The profession of Rabbi was chosen for him, and for this purpose he was sent to Breslau to take preparatory work in the Rabbinical Seminary of that city. But the career of Rabbi was very shortly abandoned, as the boy showed other tastes. He was a pupil of the great educator, Wilhelm Curtmann, in the Pedagogical Seminary of Friedberg, Hessen. After graduating, he continued his pedagogical work by taking a post-graduate course in the University of Giessen (Hessen). Immediately after finishing his preparations as an educator, he entered the service of the German government and he soon was made the principal of a preparatory and business college in Hessen. He came to Chicago in 1890, from N. Y. where he was superintendent of Workingman's School. He became the superintendent of the Jewish Training School of Chicago, and it owes its success and its superior rank as a school almost wholly to his untiring labors and his skill as a pedagogue.</p>
