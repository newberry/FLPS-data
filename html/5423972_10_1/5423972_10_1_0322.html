   <p>The gymnasium of the Hebrew Institute was crowded last night with men and women who gathered there to celebrate an historic event in the life of the Jewish people--the ratification of a mandate by which the League of Nations legalized Palestine as a Jewish homeland. The audience listened with obvious interest to the speakers: U. S. Senator Medill McCormick, Congressman A. J. Sabath, Rabbi Hillel Silver of Cleveland, the English vice-consul in Chicago, Mr. Jasper, and the chairman of the evening, Max Shulman, who was introduced by Mr. Leonard Grossman. Hearty applause greeted the speakers, who spoke of the great Jewish national celebration.</p>
   <p>Senator McCormick received vociferous applause when he said: "I was a Zionist when many of my Jewish friends were not yet Zionists." The same kind of applause greeted his declaration that "one can be a Zionist and still be a good American, or a patriot of any other country of which the Jew is a citizen and <span class="page-break">\2</span>where he intends to remain."</p>
   <p>"I thank you from the bottom of my heart," began Senator McCormick, "for inviting me to come and participate with you in this happy event. Somebody here mentioned Moses Montefiore, who was my father's friend. He was not the only Jewish friend that we had. I have many Jewish friends because, after all, aren't we all brothers working for the common good of humanity? I want to declare right here and now that I have always been a friend of the Jews. Years ago I spoke in favor of founding a Jewish home for the Jews. Many people told me that I was wrong but I told them that I was right and that they were wrong.</p>
   <p>"I am sure," continued Mr. McCormick, "that nobody here will say that the Jews, by obtaining a homeland of their own, will cease to be loyal and patriotic citizens of this country. Jews have always proved their loyalty to the country where they lived. Who organized our industries during the war to work efficiently, if not the Jew, Bernard Baruch? Who represented England in Washington <span class="page-break">\3</span>at that time, if not the Jew, Rufus Isaacs? Didn't the Jew demonstrate, in every country, his devotion and loyalty?"</p>
   <p>Senator McCormick concluded his speech by saying: "It is a miracle that the Jewish people, who have suffered so much, continue to live, and are still so strong in their hope [for the future]."</p>
   <p>The floor was then given to Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, who described, in a beautiful speech, the adoption of the Zion resolution by the House of Representatives.</p>
   <p>"Today, when I can participate with you in celebrating this joyful occasion, is the happiest day of my life," said Congressman Sabath. "Senator McCormick has told you of his friendliness to Zionism. I tell you that the resolution would not have been adopted had it not been for the Senator. He will surely be rewarded for that as he deserves to be. In the House where there are more members than in the Senate, we had greater difficulties with the resolution <span class="page-break">\4</span>because many representatives could not understand why so many Jews were against it, and we had to explain to them that those Jews did not yet understand the great ideal.</p>
   <p>"I am sure, however," concluded Congressman Sabath, "that the number of those who do not understand Zionism is becoming smaller and that all the Jews, and particularly the Chicago Jews, will demonstrate their devotion to the Zionist ideal and will help to build Palestine. I want to remind you, however, that our friend Woodrow Wilson had a large share in the ratification of the mandate."</p>
   <p>Rabbi Hillel Silver, in a brilliant and powerful speech, spoke of the significance of the present moment in Jewish history. "We have waited a long time for this moment," said Rabbi Silver. "Nineteen hundred years ago our forefathers prayed that they might live to see the moment when our persecuted people would regain their pride, and now we have lived to see it. When I think of our past generations, of Rabbi Akibah, the first Zionist, Judah Halevy, and the creator of Zionist thought, Dr. Theodore Herzl, it seems to me that their spirits are <span class="page-break">\5</span>with us now and that they tell us to bless the name of God because we have lived to witness this event, because the ratification of the mandate must and should be the greatest source of joy to every idealist. The hopes, which lay deep in the hearts of many generations, are realized now.</p>
   <p>"Excerpts from Balfour's declaration have been read here. I must tell you that salvation will not come through Balfour, nor through the efforts of any country. Salvation will come from the hundreds of thousands of Halutzim (Volunteers) who will go to Palestine.</p>
   <p>"I ask you," said Rabbi Silver in conclusion, "first to be proud of our great achievement, and second, to help to build our land with your financial contributions. They, the Halutzim, will build it with their bodies."</p>
   <p>The British vice-consul expressed in a few words his pleasure in greeting the Chicago Jews at their celebration of a happy event.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"England has always been sympathetic to the Jews," said the consul. "England has shown her great friendliness to the vision of a Jewish homeland even at the time of Moses Montefiore, in 1840." The vice-consul then gave Balfour's opinion of Zionism, as it is given in his foreword to Nahum Sokolow's book on the new Palestine.</p>
   <p>The consul expressed, in the name of the British government, his satisfaction with the ratification of the mandate.</p>
   <p>Jaques Amado, tenor, sang several operatic arias beautifully. He was accompanied at the piano by Dr. Fox. The audience was enthusiastic in its applause.</p>
   <p>The meeting closed to the strains of Hatikuah [Jewish national anthem], amid thunderous applause.</p>
