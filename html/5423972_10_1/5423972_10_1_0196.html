   <p>Jewish citizens of Chicago are taking steps to give aid to find homes for the hundreds of Jews hwo have fled from Russia to escape service in the army of the czar and are now flecking to Chicago in ever increasing numbers. In order to facilitate and systematize the work of succoring the refugees an organization known as the Jewish Agriculturists' Aid Society has been formed and Dr. A. R. Levy, pastor of the congregation B'nai Abraham, who is corresponding secretary and manager, has received in the last few weeks appeals from hundreds of refugees, who have reached Chicago in search of homes and employment.</p>
   <p>The society has undertaken on a large scale a scheme of colonization of these refugees on the fertile lands of the middle western states, and hundreds already have become tillers of the soil.</p>
   <p>Adolph Loeb is president of the society, which has undertaken to look after the great increase of Jewish immigration into the section, due to the prevailing war between Russia and Japan, and in the course of a few months, he estimates, there will be thousands of thrifty Jewish farmers contributing their efforts in the settlement and development of the mighty west.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Plan to Extend the Work</p>
   <p>Although the great majority of those who come to this country are unaware of the existence of the society, it is believed that this soon will be remedied. A law is to be introduced next week in Congress which will permit the establishment of a bureau of information at Ellis Island. At this station the society expects to place an agent who will advise the Jews who enter the country not to go to the large towns and settle in the ghetto districts, but to establish themselves as farmers with the aid of the society.</p>
   <p>A large increase in the loan fund of the society is necessary to meet the demands resulting from the increase in immigration. Out of the loan fund the society has advanced money to Jews willing to establish themselves as farmers. The amount leaned has varied from $600 to $1,580. With this money the Jews purchase farms or rent is paid for them. The money lent is returned when the farms become profitable.</p>
   <p>The passage of the bill is to be introduced by Immigration Commissioner Savage and the increase in immigration due to the war is expected by the officers of the Jewish <span class="page-break">3</span>Agriculturists' Aid Society greatly to increase the number of Jewish farmers in the country. They are using every effort to induce the immigrants to keep away from the large towns, where there are already more than can be given work, and to establish themselves on farms.</p>
   <p>May Abolish Ghetto Districts</p>
   <p>If the hopes of the members of the society are realized the increase immigration will result in a large increase in the number of Jewish farmers in the country and will tend ultimately to break up the ghetto and districts in which the Jews now congregate.</p>
   <p>The extent of the work which must be done by the society during the present year is shown by the figures of the immigration bureau. These figures show that in the first ten days of the present month the number of persons entering this country was 14,000 and that a majority of them were Jews, many of whom had fled military service in Russia.</p>
   <p>Of this number a great number have come west, the eastern branch of the society in <span class="page-break">4</span>New York City having endeavored to induce them to leave New York and seek homes in the middle west.</p>
   <p>The Jewish immigration for the year of 1904 was over 55,000. This number, it is estimated will be increased to nearly double that as the result of the Russian war. If all of the Jews who flee from Russia settle in the big cities it is feared they will have a hard time of it.</p>
   <p>Society Aids New Farmers</p>
   <p>If, on the contrary, the Jews settle on farms as the society seeks to bring about, it is believed that their entering the country will be welcomed. The officers of the society claim that there is plenty of land on which they can settle and that as long as the loan fund of the society is in good shape its officers will be able to lend them money with which to establish themselves as farmers.</p>
   <p>"The increase in the Jewish immigration has been phenomenal," said Dr. A. R. Levy, the corresponding secretary of the society, yesterday. "While it has been the custom to attribute the increase in immigration to the desire of the Jew to escape military <span class="page-break">5</span>service, I do not believe that this is entirely the cause. The Jews who become soldiers are not allowed to settle near the post at which they were stationed.</p>
   <p>"When they leave the service and pass into the reserves they find themselves without a home for the provinces in which the Jews are settled are already overcrowded and there is not work for them to do. It is therefore a case of reenlisting in the army or coming to America, and with the war in progress it is only natural that they should come here.</p>
   <p>Seeks to Direct Immigration</p>
   <p>"Our society is now trying to direct the tide of immigration. We want to establish the Jews as farmers in this country. We will lend them the money that they need to establish themselves, charging them four per cent interest and allowing them to pay us back in small installments.</p>
   <p>It has been claimed that the Jew will not make a successful farmer, but our experience in the last sixteen years shows that this is not a fact. The Jew is not a farmer by nature, but he is apt. It is equally true that the Jew is not a tailor as it is that he is not a farmer, and yet the Jews who have engaged in the business <span class="page-break">6</span>of making garments have become skillful. Four years training on a farm has made the 300 who own the farms we have established self-supporting.</p>
   <p>"Our society is not a charitable one and on account of the present immigration laws but few of those who enter the country know of its existence. In spite of this fact the number who have appealed to us in the last few months has been remarkably large. We will need a much larger loan fund to take care of these applicants, but I believe that when we get it and when the new bill is passed we will be able to turn the tide of Jewish immigration and establish our people as agriculturalists in the states of Missouri, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, North and South Dakota and in Oklahoma territory."</p>
