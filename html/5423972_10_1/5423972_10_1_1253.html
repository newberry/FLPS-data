   <p>Nature arms each man with some faculty which enables him to do easily some feat impossible to any other, and this makes him necessary to Society.</p>
   <p>No one in our midst is a truer exponent of this fact, nor is anyone executing his trust more conscientiously than Mr. Rosenwald. From the early stage of his career he accepted material success as a deposit to the credit of human welfare; and perhaps to the loftiness of this purpose, that of enriching humankind, more than to any other agency, is due the great measure of his success!</p>
   <p>The sympathetic attractions which have made him beloved by friends and associates alike, proved none the less powerful and fruitful in commercial life. It was productive of loyalty and the good-will of his employees, which mean efficient service; and efficient service under able leadership, spells success. It is a monument to this success that Chicago is today the proud home of the largest mail-order house in the world - Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., of which Mr. Rosenwald is President.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>In this establishment is received a daily average of 75,000 letters, and it takes $8,000 per day to buy their stamps. Ask any traveling man which book is the most widely read among the country people, and the answer is invariably the book entitled "Catalogue - By Sears Roebuck Co." and in evidence of this, last February 400,000 people outside of Chicago sent $8,000,000 for goods ordered from the huge catalogue. It requires 9,000 employees to carry on the business which has been built up in fifteen years.</p>
   <p>And now that selfsame acumen that was instrumental in building up an edifice of power and wealth is being directed by Mr. Rosenwald with the selfsame energy and will, strengthened by years of experience toward the amelioration of conditions, not only of his co-religionists, but that of all humankind, with whom he comes in contact.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Charities first claimed Mr. Rosenwald's Social Service activity. In the five years before Mr. Rosenwald took hold, the annual income of the Associated <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Jewish Charities averaged about $140,000, and in his five years it has increased to about $400,000, all in annual subscriptions, collected at an annual expense of $5,000.</p>
   <p>The diversity of his interests and the high standard of services rendered to each is so self-evident that to him life means work; and recreation, devotion to his fellowmen. He is a director of the Religious Education Association, Boy Scouts, City Club, Immigrants' Protective League, Infant Welfare Society, Jewish Home-Finding Society; a Trustee of Hull House, Tuskegee, University of Chicago, Chairman of Bureau of Public Efficiency; Member Commercial Club; Vice-President United Charities of Chicago, Chicago Sinai Congregation, Chicago Hebrew Institute; President, Jewish Agricultural Station in Palestine, Associated Jewish Charities; is active in the management of other organizations, and contributes to many more.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald gives generously and wisely. He gives his money, he gives himself, usually conditioning his gifts on other contributions, thus teaching others <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the art which he has so completely mastered himself, that of giving without self-interest. He is opening wide the doors of opportunity to talent and worth, and all who will may qualify, irrespective of creed and color; this being contrary to the Rules regulating some of the Zion Jewish organizations that profit so largely by the munificence of this true man of Israel. Yet, perhaps, the very unselfishness of such giving may add another point of light and hasten the day of a more just and human relationship between Jew and non-Jew.</p>
   <p>Social workers draw their inspiration from his great fount of optimism. He knows and understands their problems, and they love him for what he is, - their big brother. He frankly admits that the social and civic side of life to which he gives the major part of his time, interests him most, yet he continues in business through attachment to the men who aided in building up an enterprise so gigantic and fascinating. The health and welfare of his employees are his personal interest, and every effort is made to make their surroundings pleasant and comfortable. It is as their friend he would have them know him, and not as their master.</p>
   <p>Last year he celebrated his fiftieth birthday, with the announcement of gifts to various institutions, amounting to $687,500. How much in total has been <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>given by Mr. Rosenwald, is unknown to anyone, least to himself. The system that made his commercial establishment the most famous in the world is lacking in his charity records.</p>
   <p>His home life is only another instance of pure, exemplary living; surrounding his family with love, peace and honor, the natural shield of one who is so nobly performing his life's duty, counting his riches not by dollars, but by acts and benefits to others.</p>
