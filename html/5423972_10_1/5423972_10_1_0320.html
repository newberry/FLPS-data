   <p>"Dear friend Loebner: In regard to your inquiry, in which you say that certain statements have been made in my name attacking the committee that has been intrusted with the Mexican project, I wish to inform you that these statements are unfounded and unjustified; I have never made such statements. The gentlemen who are in charge of the Mexican project may have the best intentions [in the world], as a Zionist, Mexico does not appeal to me as a home for the Jews because I believe that the future of the Jews lies in Palestine, and that everything possible should be done in that direction.</p>
   <p>"Yours truly, Max Shulman."</p>
   <p>This is the way an honest and responsible man denies a libel spread in his name; this is the way a sincere Zionist defends his viewpoint. Is Mr. Samuel B. Epstein, the Grand Master of the Progressive Order of the West, also a man of the same caliber? A statement has been published in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>his name. He must either affirm or deny this statement. Threats that he will throw bottles of pop at somebody's head, that he will beat up somebody, that he will exclude from "his" union somebody because he is asked for an accounting, will not do.</p>
