   <p>In the early days of Chicago, when it was still in its childhood, about the middle of the past century, three brothers came to this city, three pioneers who left their father's home to come hither to develop their opportunity along with the growth of the city. For almost a half a century these three brothers have dominated the financial, social, and political life of Chicago. One of the Kohlsaats became an eminent lawyer and later a prominent judge; the second brother was a strong figure in the world of finance; and the third molded public opinion and dominated the press of the city as newspaper editor and publisher.</p>
   <p>The story which I am about to narrate is even more romantic; it has more of the human touch, the succession of events is more interesting and more sympathetic; the three brothers who are the central figures in my tale had <span class="page-break">2</span>far greater difficulties to surmount. The Kohlsaat brothers were born and raised in the United States. The language, the culture, the traditions, manners, and customs were instilled into them from earliest babyhood. The three sons of Reb Pesach Davis were born and raised in a foreign land, where everything, even the skies and stars, the sun and moom, were different.</p>
   <p>Reb Pesach was a highly respected member of the Jewish community in his native city; religious but modern. His was a home of true culture and refinement. His oldest son, Haim, became a physician and specialized in mental diseases. James Davis, the second son, was being instructed in a private pension, at Koenigsberg, preparing himself for a scientific career. Suddenly Reb Pesach was overtaken by reverses in his business and his two elder sons, Haim and James, came to America and made their home in Chicago. A year or two later Reb Pesach, his wife and the younger children followed their two sons and also came to Chicago and settled here. Dr. Haim Davis soon qualified himself according to the laws of this state to practice his profession, and in a brief period of time he acquired a lucrative practice; while James engaged in the business of paint and wallpaper.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Abel was the youngest of the three; he was of grammar school age when he was brought here and he entered public school. After finishing high school he matriculated in the law school of Northwestern University. Like most youths of adolescent age, Abel was fascinated by the shining buttons of a military uniform. He was thrilled at the sight of the militia on a parade and he yearned to join a military organization. As soon as he was old enough to persuade his father to give his consent, he joined the First Infantry of the Illinois National Guard.</p>
   <p>When war was declared between the United States and Spain, Abel was still a student in law school. His, was the only regiment of Illinois that was given the honor to march on Cuba; he followed his regiment as a private, and was soon promoted to a corporal and the foreign-born youth volunteered to fight for his adopted country he had known only five or six years. On his return from Cuba, he resumed his legal studies. In 1902, on the very same day when Abel Davis took the examination and was admitted to the bar, he was elected a member to the Illinois State Legislature. In 1904, he was a successful candidate for Recorder of Deeds of Cook County, When the four year term expired, he was renominated, and reelected for a second term.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In 1912, he retired from politics and organized the "Real Estate Title and Trust Company." This new organization, with Abel Davis at the head was making rapid progress, until the Chicago Title and Trust Company, the oldest company of its kind, found it expedient to absorb the new competitor, with Abel Davis retained as director and vice-president in charge of the financial department.</p>
   <p>In 1916, when the First Illinois Infantry was dispatched to the Mexican border, Abel Davis went with the regiment as major. A year later, when the United States entered the World War and the Thirty-Third Division was organized at Camp Logan, the First Regiment of the Illinois National Guard was made part of that division as the 131st Infantry, and Abel Davis was promoted to lieutenant colonel. His division was composed of about 30,000 men; 3,000 of whom were raw and undisciplined and proved a great hindrance to the entire division. The staff officers decided to take out these 3,000 men and with them as a nucleus to organize another regiment. By that time Abel Davis had acquired the reputation of a great disciplinarian, and as discipline was the main requirement for such a regiment, he was promoted <span class="page-break">5</span>to the rank of colonel and placed in command of the new regiment. When the division was ordered to the front he was made colonel of the 132nd Infantry. He retained command of that regiment throughout the war. Colonel Davis received many honors and decorations, among which are the Distinguished Service Medal, the Distinguished Service Cross, officer of the Legion of Honor of France, in recognition of distinguished services which he rendered to his country and the cause of the Allied forces. On his return home from the field of battle, he was again honored; this time by his own state; he was promoted to brigadier general.</p>
   <p>For the Jews of the United States to have a real general in the United States Army, and especially one who made his grades step by step, purely on the strength of his own merit is of no small importance to the prestige of our people, but the honor, in the case of General Davis is especially valuable, because he has always identified himself with his people by his deep devotion to all worthy Jewish causes. For many years he has served as director on the Board of the Jewish Charities and he was among the foremost in rank in the numerous drives for the war sufferers of Europe. Abel's patriotism is of the sweeping and impulsive kind that has no patience with <span class="page-break">6</span>words in time of a crisis.</p>
   <p>Somewhat of a different type is James Davis. His patriotism is not less than his brother's but he is more tolerant and broad minded, with a wider outlook on life and a deeper insight into human feeling and emotions. His vast experience in social welfare taught him to condemn no one and his strong sympathies for suffering humanity made him the friend of all. He is very modest by nature and seeks on honors or recognition for the great amount of good he accomplished in this city. James Davis can add to his credit that he was the first who undertook to fill the spiritual void that separated the West Side Jews from the South Side Jews. He was the first to span a bridge between the Jews who come from Western Europe and the Jews of Eastern Europe. James Davis began his activities to help shape and model the destiny of the Chicago Jewish community, not as a "Charity Worker," not as one who helps dole out food for the poor and needy; he knows the psychology of the newly arrived immigrants and he knows that they crave more for spiritual and intellectual food; thus he first joined the movement for a Hebrew Institute and for the past quarter of a century he has devoted himself and all his energy to the social welfare and spiritual development of <span class="page-break">7</span>the Jewish community. He has been active in all movements and earned the respect and admiration of all classes of Jews. He is a devoted Zionist, an untiring worker for Jewish education, and a member of the Board of Jewish Charities.</p>
   <p>Dr. Haim Davis, the oldest of the three brothers, came to the United States in 1892, and having brought with him a medical diploma of a European University he found no difficulty in passing the Illinois State Medical Board examination. He soon began on his medical career. He occupied several high positions; for almost ten years he was at the head of the Psychopathic Hospital of Cook County; for several years he has served as senior attending neurologist of the Michael Reese Hospital. He is an associate professor of the Medical College of the University of Illinois. Dr. Haim J. Davis is somewhat different from both of his brothers. He lacks the ambition with which the General is endowed, but he surpasses him in impulse. He lacks some of the modesty of his brother James, but therefore he has a greater vitality and is more active and self reliant.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>All three brothers seem to be ruled by the passion of patriotism but the patriotism of the doctor is much different than that of the general and brother James. He demonstrated that it is not incompatible to be a devoted son of his people and at the same time love his country, even though an adopted one, with a zeal and ardor ready to give up his life. When he enlisted in the Red Cross in 1918, and was sent to Eastern Europe he rendered the highest degree of service to his country and at the same time he brought solace and succor to thousands of his suffering brethren.</p>
   <p>Dr. Davis is an extremely interesting personality. He is intense and impulsive in all of his actions and possesses more than an ordinary degree of independence, which is admirable in him. It is difficult to analyze whether his patriotic leanings are more American or Jewish. If conditions were to arise for Dr. Davis to take a stand in favor of one as against the other I am quite certain that he himself would be unable to foretell which policy he would pursue. It would be an impulse of the moment that would decide his choice.</p>
   <p>Dr. Davis has been for many years a B'nai B'rith, and was for a term the president of the Sixth District. He is regarded as one of the important leaders <span class="page-break">9</span>in the councils of the organization. His experience as major of the Red Cross in the war-ridden and pogrom-stricken area of Poland and Ukrainia are too gruesome to be interesting reading matter. The many photographs produced by his own camera are like the paintings of Abel Pan, they are living witnesses to prove "Man's inhumanity to his fellow-man," but the vividness of color and the terrible atrocities which they portray can hardly be reproduced in words.</p>
