   <p>After Rabbi Stephen S. Wise finished his talk at the Sinai Temple, the most prominent members in the first row came up to greet and thank him for his interesting discourse.</p>
   <p>The first one to greet him was Mr. Julius Rosenwald. He pressed Rabbi Wise's hand and said, "I am not opposed to the idea that Jews of oppressed countries emigrate to Palestine, but I believe they should do so on their own initiative." The rabbi clearly remarked, "the appeal which the race is making to the Jews of America about the rebuilding of Palestine is chiefly of their own initiative." However, this retort failed to impress Mr. Rosenwald.</p>
   <p>These words contain so much truth and wholesome argumentative material that they deserve to be analyzed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>I am convinced that if someone would come to Mr. Rosenwald with an argument against the position taken by President Wilson during the Great War, in connection with Serbia and Belgium, saying that the United States had no business wasting lives and money on these small nations, and that they should help themselves, he would consider the statement immoral, un-American, selfish, greedy, and unreasonable.</p>
   <p>A duty of the American is to defend justice and liberty through the promotion of good will among the nations, since through the freedom of other peoples the United States will be more secure and safe with its own freedom and happiness.</p>
   <p>Mr. Julius Rosenwald helped President Wilson in his program to make the world safe for democracy. Why should he discriminate against his own unfortunate brethren and demand that they look out for their own freedom with their own sweat and lives?</p>
   <p>Is the Palestinian case different from that of Belgium, Serbia, and Montenegro? His answer will be yes, but the difference is in time. However, time is an abstract conception and it does not wipe away the conception <span class="page-break">\3</span>of reason and justice.</p>
   <p>If the Belgians have a right to claim their homeland, if France has a right to claim Alsace Lorraine, rights not lost even after a thousand years and claims never forgotten, why should the Jewish people have no claim to Palestine?</p>
   <p>Why should anyone remark that the Jews wishing to possess Palestine should do so through their own initiative? They can at least, treat us as they treat the Negroes. They don't tell the colored people to help themselves.</p>
   <p>The problem of Palestine is very simple. The whole situation becomes complicated because of the opposition against it.</p>
   <p>The Jewish race is not yet asking for an independent state in Palestine, because Jewish settlers there comprise only one-sixth of the entire population. An independent state cannot be governed by a minority. We would be fully satisfied if the League of Nations would put Palestine under the supervision of Great Britain, on condition that England put <span class="page-break">\4</span>the foundation for a Jewish state by proper laws of land ownership, careful rules and regulations regarding immigration, and the rightful administration suitable in such cases.</p>
   <p>Whether or not Palestine will become later an independent state, is a question to be discussed in the future; at present we are content to make Palestine a home for the Jews wishing to live like Jews on their own soil, to enjoy the freedom of civilized nations, and not be forced to sacrifice their idealism and individuality as is the case with many Jews in many countries.</p>
   <p>All sorts of ideas are going on at present in the minds of our rich and mighty American Jews, who keep themselves aloof, ignoring their poor brethren and the Palestinian issue altogether.</p>
   <p>It is not a matter of money or greediness, for these men spend fabulous sums on less important and less promising projects than this. They take this opposition lest the world misinterprets their motives, saying that they are not full-fledged patriots and that their Jewishness outweighs their Americanism, etc. What an unworthy position this is for respectful people to take.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>But even this assumption is groundless and based on empty bubbles. It is only the exile anxiety which makes our newly rich so afraid and tremulous.</p>
   <p>We never heard of an American Gentile questioning or doubting Zionist loyalty or of one displaying less respect to a Zionist than a non-Zionist Jew, as is the case with anti-Zionist Jewish philanthropists.</p>
   <p>A Gentile of an analytical, unbiased mind cannot comprehend how a respectful Jew can be opposed to Zionism.</p>
   <p>That the Jewish race will have a homeland in Palestine is as true a fact as that the future generation will talk with sarcasm of the anxieties that tortured the minds of our rich, powerful Jews.</p>
