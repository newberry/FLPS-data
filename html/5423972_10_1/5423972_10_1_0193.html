   <p>NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE JEWISH AGRICULTURISTS' AID SOCIETY OF AMERICA. (pp. 252-253.)</p>
   <p>Compared with former years, the Jewish Agriculturists' Aid Society of America, with headquarters in Chicago, has more than doubled its work during the year of 1903. Eighty families were assisted to settle on as many farms during the year. Of these, fifty-nine settled under the homestead law, on free government land, each taking possession of 160 acres of land. Seventeen purchased farms in the States of Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and four rented lands in Illinois and Iowa. All these were more or less assisted by the Society, loans having been made to them in sums from $100 to $1,000. In all, the Society loaned out nearly $26,000 during the year. This amount was expended in the purchase of live-stock and implements, for building material, for seed, and for feed needed for the live-stock during the first few months. The transportation of the families from the city to the farm, as well as clothing, shoes, and provisions, which in some instances were furnished to the families, were paid for from the general fund of the Society.</p>

   <p>In doing its work, the Society has followed its old method. The loans made to its proteges are secured by mortgages, which become a lien on the real and personal property of the borrower. The loans are payable in installments arranged to suit the case of the borrower, and they bear interest at the rate of four percent per annum. The Society up to the present has assisted nearly 300 families, aggregating over 1,450 persons. Many of these families have repaid the loans made to them, principal and interest in full, and are now in a prosperous condition.</p>
   <p>The Society proposes to expand its work and operate on a much larger scale than hitherto. Thus far the benefits of the Society have been extended to people in Chicago, and the means for its operations were gathered chiefly in that city, excepting what aid has been extended to it by the Jewish Agricultural and Industrial Aid Society of New York. In pursuance of the policy of expansion, applicants from outside the City of Chicago were assisted during the first half of the present year, from January 1, to July 1, 1904.</p>
