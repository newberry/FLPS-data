   <p>Workmen's Circle delegation receive credentials from Russia.</p>
   <p>Certain elements, aiming to attack and discredit something that the National Administration of the Workmen's Circle does, recently called a meeting in regard to the decision of the Workmen's Circle to send a delegation to Russia to turn over equipment for the Workmen's Circle Hospital in Hummel. At that meeting they determined to send a little squealer as though the National Executive would have no confidence in the Russian Soviet government. The Soviet government, judged the earnest important work, that our great radical organization has done for Russia, as announced in yesterday's Forward. The President of the Central Committee of the Russian Red Cross in Moscow, Dr. Solovioff, telegraphed to the American Red Cross that credentials were prepared for the delegation of the Workmen's Circle elected to buy equipment for the hospital in Russia, and turn it over as a friendly gift to the inhabitants of Hummel.</p>
