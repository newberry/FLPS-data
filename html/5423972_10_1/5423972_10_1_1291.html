   <p>Evening, Honoring Mr. Nathanson.</p>
   <p>During his stay in Chicago, Mr. Charles Nathanson, star of the Chicago Yiddish stage, has entertained thousands of men and women by his acting. He has filled many, many roles and has achieved his goal, to entertain his public. This can be clearly gathered by the great ovation he receives at his performances.</p>
   <p>Tonight has been especially arranged as one of tribute to Mr. Nathanson's noble work. We are planning to do him special honor at his performance tonight in "Solomon the Wise," at the Globe Theater, Wabash at Polk street.</p>
