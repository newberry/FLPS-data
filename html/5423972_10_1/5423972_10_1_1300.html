   <p>Herman F. Fahn, one of Chicago's pioneer jewelers, died on April 9. He was at one time president of the West Chicago Club. In his own special field of business he rose to an eminent position of trust and honor. For many years, he was the president of the local and later of the National Jeweler's Association.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hahn rendered the county a great service last winter. Stories of cruelty and mismanagement in the County Hospital for the Insane had aroused the community. The authorities were moved to appoint a committee, composed of citizens of high standing, to investigate the complaints and to suggest methods of betterment. Mr. Hahn was one of the chosen. He represented the Jewish interests on the committee. Again Mr. Hahn was instrumental in bringing others to realize that Judaism is a force making for good citizenship and genuine humanity.</p>
