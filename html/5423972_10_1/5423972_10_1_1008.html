   <p>Rabbi S. Z. Album has been dead over a year. He was a rabbi in Chicago for over thirty years and he lived like a martyr. Has any one of the Chicago Jews ever realized [the fact] that there is no monument as yet on the grave of Rabbi Album? If not, why not? Didn't Rabbi Album deserve to have a monument placed on his grave by the Chicago Jews?</p>
