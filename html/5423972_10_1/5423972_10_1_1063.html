   <p>Mrs. Rose Lipshultz, one of the most well-known Jewish women in Chicago, an active charity worker, died suddenly, yesterday morning, on the steps of her home at 1300 South Albany Avenue. She was seventy-eight years old. She leaves two sons, Max Lipshultz and Dr. George Lipshultz, who is a captain in the United States Army, at present in Camp Meade, Maryland.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Lipshultz was a scholar and a woman of good descent, coming from a fine Jewish family of Libau, Kurland. She came to this country twenty-nine years ago, and was one of the women who helped to build and support the Marks Nathan Orphan Home, organizing auxiliaries and interesting many women in this important work for our orphans. Of late she had devoted much time to the Mt. Sinai Hospital.</p>
   <p>Although herself poor, she did everything possible for other poor people. Her fortune at death consisted of four dollars.</p>
   
   <p>Her funeral will take place Tuesday at 2:30 P. M. from the Marks Nathan Orphan Home where, from ten in the morning, her body will lie in state in the Memorial Hall. Several rabbis will deliver eulogies.</p>
