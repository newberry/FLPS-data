   <p>Professor A. A. Michelson died on Saturday in his 79th year. Professor Michelson was born of Jewish parents in Strelno, Germany, December 19, 1852. When Albert was two years old his parents migrated to the United States and settled in San Francisco. He graduated from the high school in that city, and was recommended for the Naval Academy, but the quota for that year was filled. Nevertheless, Albert traveled to Washington to apply to President Grant to be included among the special ten nominations, which were the privilege of the president. The ten candidates already had been selected but President Grant, impressed by the young man, made an exception and appointed an eleventh candidate - Albert Michelson.</p>
   <p>After his graduation he was for some years instructor in physics and chemistry at the Academy, rising to the naval rank of Master. During this time he engaged in research in the velocity of light, which he experimentally ascertained to be 186,305 miles to a second. In 1880, he determined to devote himself to a purely scientific career.</p>
   <p>In 1883, he resigned from the Navy and became Professor of Physics in the Case School of Applied Science at Cleveland. From 1889, to 1892, he was Professor of Physics in Clark University and after that date was head of the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago.</p>

   <p>During the World War, Prof. Michelson returned to the Navy with his old rank of Lieutenant Commander. During this period he busied himself in inventing an improved range finder that was immediately adopted by the Navy.</p>
   <p>In 1925, he was named "Distinguished Service Professor" at the University of Chicago. He also served as Lowell lecturer in 1899, and as exchange professor at Goettingen in 1911, and at the University of Paris in 1920.</p>
   <p>In addition to his measurement of the length of light waves and his invention of the inferential refractometer, he also invented the echelon spectroscope for studying the effect of magnetism on light waves. He measured the "earth tides," the flow and ebb of "the great globe itself," invented the harmonic analyzer for tracing compound curves, and the interferometer for studying the lines of the spectrum.</p>
