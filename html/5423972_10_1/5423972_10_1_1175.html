   <p>With the death of Chicago's oldest rabbi, Elezar Anixter, the Chicago Jewish Orthodox Community lost one, if not the only, rabbi of the traditional type of yore, rarely seen in America and now becoming scarce even in Europe.</p>
   <p>He was a great scholar, a deep thinker and an honest man. As a rabbi, he knew his obligations. He did not seek any honor, and evaded anything that was associated with strife. He shared his money with charity. He never bowed his head to prominent or wealthy men or to the officers of his congregation. He did not consider the pulpit as a position. It was his duty which he fulfilled with pride and honor.</p>
   
   <p>He was 84 years when he died. He had spent all his time in study. Those who visited him, regardless of how early or how late, knew they would find Rabbi Elezar in his study. We honor his memory.</p>
