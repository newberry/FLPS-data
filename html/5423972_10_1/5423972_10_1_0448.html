   <p>While the Polish leader of America, J. F. Smulski, in his statement to Mr. B. Horwich, expressed his regrets concerning the pogroms against the Jews in Poland, his organ in Chicago, the Dziennik Narodowy, printed a vile attack upon Mr. Horwich for stating that no fewer than one hundred and twenty pogroms had occurred in Poland. The newspaper labels the noted Jewish civic leader of Chicago a Bolshevik.</p>
   <p>"There arrived in New York a Jewish Bolshevik who accuses the Poles of one hundred and twenty pogroms," states the Dziennik Narodowy, declaring that this falsehood against unfortunate Poles, by which is meant the new pogrom reports from Copenhagen, are spread only by Jews who fear the Polish Government will refuse to accept the treaty guaranteeing Jewish rights, and who seek, therefore, to influence the higher powers to insist on the treaty's ratification.</p>
