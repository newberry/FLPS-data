   <p>With the death of Leopold Simon, of 2243 Calumet Ave., the local Jewish and business communities lose one of their oldest and most respected members. He was born in Sausenheim, Rheinpfalz, Bavaria, in 1813, and came to Chicago forty years ago. He, at once became engaged in the clothing business, the firm's name being Simon, Meyer and Strauss and Co. Later it was changed to Simon, Strauss and Co., and still later to L. Simon and Co.
