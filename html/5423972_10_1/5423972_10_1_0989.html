   <p>I am not a child; I wasn't born yesterday, and I am not easily surprised. However, I was surprised, pleasantly surprised, when I heard, for the first time in my life, the rabbi of Lomza [Poland] speak, last Sunday evening. I remember the rabbis from the old country, who were men of genius. I still remember vividly the present rabbi of Lublin, Rabbi Eli Klatzkin, the old Ma-Yofis, the great Rabbi Isaac Elchonon, the brilliant Rabbi Chaim Brisker. Rabbi [Judah] Gordon reminded me of those men, with their extraordinary erudition, brilliant minds, and remarkable memories.</p>
   <p>Anyone who is interested in the classical greatness of the Torah, who is interested in wisdom and erudition, should go and hear Rabbi Gordon. He is a spring overflowing with knowledge! He is a man to whom the most hidden corners of Talmudic literature are open!</p>

   <p>Chicago is indeed fortunate to number Rabbi Gordon among its citizens.</p>
