   <p>"I left Paris May 18. Our government, together with other powers, is investigating the horrible pogroms that occurred not only in Poland but in other countries of Eastern Europe as well. Authentic information affirms everything that was reported at the large mass-meeting in New York, May 12. All denials prove to be only an attempt to suppress the truth. The Pinsk massacre was worse than the usual pogrom. A military commander, whom the well-known English publisher Henry Breilsford had previously labeled as a person absolutely not to be trusted, an anti-Semite, ordered thirty-seven young persons to be shot without trial upon the unproven accusation of Bolshevism. Since my leaving, Mr. Louis Marshall informed <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>President Wilson, in a personal interview, of what occurred in Pinsk and of all other pogroms. The President, at present, has all details on hand.</p>
   <p>"This horrible gruesomeness shows the necessity of an international protectorate for the minorities in the new and upstarting states of Eastern Europe; to use the phrase of the proposed Peace Treaty ' who are different from the majority in race, speech, or religion.'</p>
   <p>"The delegation of the America Jewish Congress to Paris was sent with the purpose of concerning itself with guaranteeing, for the national minorities of these new states, the necessary rights regardless of race, or religion. For the Jew, both individually and collectively, we demand <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>no more or no less than that asked for the rest. Our delegates worked in unison with others delegated from Eastern European Judaism. We accepted a common platform. Because of the great influence of President Wilson at the Peace Conference, the burden of securing these just rights by treaty fell to task upon the American delegates. Above all other persons, we owe thanks to the steady and untiring efforts of Louis Marshall for whatever good results were secured. I believe that the following will mature:</p>
   <p>(1) Legal emancipation, equality, and citizenship without any possibility of making any exceptions as, for example, was done in Rumania concerning the Berlin treaty.</p>
   <p>(2) A guarantee that all citizens will have equal civil, religious, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and political rights, such as are fundamental to every civilized state.</p>
   <p>(3) The protection of minority groups. The right to use their language, to establish and support their churches, and other religious and social institutions, receiving thereby a proportional part of the public funds which are used for these purposes.</p>
   <p>(4) They must recognize the international character of these obligations. The power for putting them into force and enforcing them is given to the League of Nations.</p>
   <p>"The second important duty of our delegation was to aid in the realization of the Balfour declaration. But the Zionist World Organization, in this respect, already had everything well organized. American Judaism was <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>well represented in this work by Rabbi Stephen Weiss, Mr. Jacob De Haas, and Felix Frankfurter, who is even now still at work there. Thus our delegation was able to devote itself completely to the work of securing just rights in Eastern Europe.</p>
   <p>"The Zionist leaders, Dr. Chaim Weitzman, Mr. Sokolov, and Mr. Ausishson presented the propositions re: Palestine. Even before our delegation arrived in Paris, the propositions were already received very favorably. All strove to forward the Declaration supported not only by all the nations of the Allies but by President Wilson, who received it very warmly. Therefore, there is no doubt that they will be officially accepted under England's supervision, she receiving the mandate over Palestine from the League of Nations. The foundation will be laid for the Jewish National Home, which <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>in time is to become an autonomous state. Every possibility will be given the Jewish people to again rebuild their old Home for their own benefit and for that of all mankind. The rebuilding of the Jewish Home Land will naturally be accomplished so that it does not interfere with the rights of the non-Jewish population in Palestine or the political situation of Jews as citizens of their various lands. It must be considered the duty and the privilege of all Jews in all lands to again aid in transforming Palestine into the "Land of Milk and Honey." The country is able to absorb a population of several millions. Let us hope that from now on the Palestine problem will be settled at the Peace Conference, - and it will actually be settled soon, - then every Jew must consider it his voluntary duty to aid in this historical task.</p>
