   <p>It is an old story, and yet it is forever new. We are acquainted with the tragedies of Jewish life, yet when we encounter such a scene as we are going to describe, it reopens all our old wounds.</p>
   <p>At this time on the "Island of Tears" in New York, there is being enacted one of those quiet Jewish tragedies that are not new to us, yet recall the suffering of our oppressed brothers.</p>
   <p>On the "Island of Tears," a father and two children are detained under orders to return to Russia. An unsuccessful appeal was made to Washington; the sentence was not revoked and father and children will be sent back.</p>
   <p>"The Land of the Brave and the Free," hailed as a place of refuge for all persecuted and oppressed people, has placed sentinels at its doors, and is not admitting all refugees to the protection of its freedom.</p>

   <p>The unfortunate father, in this case, did not come here on business. He had lived in his little village in Russia perhaps with the idea of spending his life there. But, a son was born to him, a son blessed with a rich talent. The soul of an artist was the heavenly grant to this child. With little, thin fingers and bow he drew forth inspired music from the violin strings. It could easily be seen that the child would become a great violinist if given the proper training.</p>
   <p>The father dreamed of developing his son's heavenly gift. He, therefore, sent the child away to study. But then he soon collided with Russian-Jewish intolerance. It was finally necessary to enroll the boy in a music academy, but these higher schools of learning are beyond the boundaries of the "Jewish Ghetto." No Jew is permitted to enter them, to weaken the "Holy Orthodox" foundation.</p>
   <p>The father then decided to leave his country, the land of blood and tears, and bring his child to the New World, to the large Republic beyond the Atlantic where the boy could grow and develop his talent unmolested.</p>

   <p>At the threshold of the new land the guards of the "Island of Tears," always on the watch for "foreign menaces," halted the father and his children, destroying their hopes and dreams. They declared the father was too weak to earn a living here and must, therefore, be sent back together with his children.</p>
   <p>The appeals and the bonds that a rich kin from Rochester was willing to furnish were of no avail. They must return to Russia.</p>
   <p>Such is the tragedy of a father who cannot help his child; of a talent that must be lost, and a race that has no place on this earth for its children to call home. Truly an old story that remains forever new.</p>
