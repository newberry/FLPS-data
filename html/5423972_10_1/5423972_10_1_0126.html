   <p>In the monthly Bulletin of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, we find very interesting figures on how the Jewish immigrants settle in America.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stanley Bero of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, who made a special investigation on the matter of settlement of the Jewish immigrants in the United States discovered that in many country-places throughout America the number of Jewish immigrants increased at the rate of a few hundred per cent.</p>
   <p>These facts should be considered very satisfactory from a Jewish standpoint, because the enemies of immigration used the desire of "certain immigrants to over crowd the large cities" as an argument, that the Immigration Laws should become stricter.</p>

   <p>We should also be pleased with the fact that Jews show a tendency to spread throughout the entire land, because this will lead to both the improvement of their material condition and to strengthening the good-will between Jews and Gentiles.</p>
