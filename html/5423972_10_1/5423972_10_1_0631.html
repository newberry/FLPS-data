   <p>It would be a grave mistake to assume that the Zionist movement has lost ground since the death of its most prominent exponent and leader, Theodore Herzl. Today, Zionism counts among its leaders men of outstanding energy, who are motivated by a holy zeal for the cause of their nation; for it is the national and not the religious aspects by which these men like to have their movement judged. "Palestine for the Jews!" --the Promised Land for the race to which it was originally promised! Anybody not connected with the movement may think this or that about it, but one thing must be granted its followers: Admiration for the enthusiasm with which they conduct their work. Zionism, like its followers, has spread all over the world, and a propaganda agency, directed by educated and competent men, takes care that the movement continues. Among the members of this committee are: Dr. O. Warburg, Dr. E. Tschlenow, Dr. Schmarya Levin, Dr. Victor Jacobson, Dr. Arthur Hantke, and Mr. Nachum Sokoloff. Zionist societies and subcommittees conduct a lively propaganda campaign in many parts of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the world, and the regular annual Zionist congresses, which the world has witnessed, prove Zionism to be a movement of international scope.</p>
   <p>Leaders Hold Speeches Here</p>
   <p>The two Israelitish congregations of the Sinai Temple, whose rabbi is Dr. Emil Hirsch, and the congregation of the Isaiah Temple, with Dr. Joseph Stolz in charge, surrendered their pulpits yesterday to two prominent Zionist leaders who are here on a visit. The eminent Boston attorney, Louis Brandeis, addressed the Sinai congregation in English, while Dr. Schmarya Levin of Berlin spoke in German to the Isaiah congregation. An Abendpost reporter was granted an interview by Dr. Levin before the services began. Dr. Levin is the type of man who gives the interviewer the impression that he knows what he is talking about. His expressive features belie his voice and the country of his birth. Dr. Levin speaks German fluently although with a slight Russian accent. He told our reporter of the tremendous enthusiasm of the German Jews for the war against Germany's enemies; and he asserted that sixty per cent of the young German-Jewish students <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>voluntarily joined the colors. According to Dr. Levin the young Jewish students all over the world are the greatest hope of Zionism, and they are the ones who secure more and more followers to strengthen the movement; for example, the Verein Juedischer Studenten (Jewish Students' League), which was represented at all German universities, is composed exclusively of Zionists.</p>
   <p>Dr. Levin's Speech</p>
   <p>In the opinion of Dr. Levin, the cause for the present war, this conflict of nations, can be traced to the Orient; a spiritual longing of peoples for the East. The people of the Western World were bored to death with their own contentment and felt an urge for Eastern cultural values. This is what Napoleon had in mind when he told his soldiers that antiquity was watching them as they set out to conquer the land of the Pharaohs for the French. But the Zionists do not ask for the entire Orient. All they want for their fourteen million brethren, now dispersed all over the globe, is the land of their fathers: Palestine.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>It would not do to call the Zionists idle dreamers. They are not idle dreamers any more than the English, who are trying to get hold of the Bagdad Railway, built by German capital, or the Russians, who consider the Orient important enough to have it indoctrinated with their own culture. But Palestine once belonged to the Jews, who were the true exponents of Oriental thought and Oriental ideals.</p>
   <p>The speaker took exception to the prevailing belief that the Jew is only interested in material profits. When the Jew was not confined to the ghetto, as for instance during the Moorish-Spanish period, he proved himself to be a capable statesman, physician, poet, and philosopher. Men like Yehuda Haleui, Maimonides, and others were the product of that liberal era. But even during those happy days the children of Israel never lost their nostalgia for Palestine. It was the longing for the home soil which made the Zionist cast his eyes towards Palestine. A true Jew would prefer a life of culture among congenial surroundings to "piling up riches," any time. The Zionist colony in Palestine, therefore, did <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>not strive for a life of luxury, but cultivated a life of hard work, high ethics, and scientific achievement. That was the reason for the founding of a university in Palestine, where men like Ehrlich, Mamroth, and others had worked.</p>
   <p>Do Not Gain Anything by War</p>
   <p>As Dr. Levin pointed out further in his speech, the position of the Jews all over the world will not be improved by this war.</p>
   <p>When the other nations get together for a peace conference, each and everyone will receive his share [of the loot]. But how about Israel? Is she supposed to stand by with empty hands? Until today the Jews have been working for other nations, and now the time has come for them to think about themselves [as a nation]. The speaker expressed hope that America would give active support to the movement. This country's assistance is of vital importance to the movement, for the European nations are now engaged in their war. Dr. Levin <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>branded as false the newspaper report that the Czar of Russia had suddenly remembered his "dear Jews"; the speaker declared that the Jews in Russia are worse off today than they have ever been, and that after the war their position will become still more unfortunate, if such a condition is possible.</p>
   <p>A Generous Collection Taken Up</p>
   <p>Former Judge Brandeis spoke in Sinai Temple and he, too, enthused his audience. His appeal for active support did not go unheeded. A collection taken up after the church services netted the substantial amount of twenty thousand dollars. Mr. Julius Rosenwald alone contributed twelve thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Meeting at Douglas Park Auditorium</p>
   <p>In the evening, a meeting was held in the Douglas Park Auditorium, where at least twenty-five thousand persons gathered, and enthusiasm reached new heights.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Every available seat was taken and many had to be turned away because of the lack of space. The stage was decorated with Zionist emblems. Among the guests of honor were Judge Hugo Pam, Judge Harry Fisher, Attorney Max Shulman, Judge P. P. Bregstone, Bernhard Horwich, Dr. Schmarya Levin, Judge Louis Brandeis, Attorney Leon Zolotkoff, Editor H. L. Meites, Rabbi Joseph Stolz, Rabbi S. S. Cohen, Rabbi Saul Silber, H. Steinberg, and [Dr. M. P.] Ginsburg.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zolotkoff was a competent chairman, and introduced as first speaker Dr. Levin, who spoke to his listeners in the Hebrew language, which most of his audience understood best. He emphasized the necessity for Zionism. By and large his arguments were similar to the ones heard earlier in Isaiah Temple. In the evening Dr. Levin spoke in a more popular vein and spiced his speech with a few anecdotes and jokes. The speaker pointed to the beauties of Hebrew literature, which has gained more in popularity during the last thirty years than during the past four centuries.</p>
   <p>Very effective, too, were the speeches of Judges Pam and Shulman, and when <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>Mr. Brandeis had finished, enthusiasm was at its peak. During the intermission a collection was taken up which netted twelve hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>Dr. Levin and the former Judge Brandeis will go to Milwaukee tonight, where they will speak at another meeting.</p>
