   <p>Freedom can be acquired either by being freely bestowed or by being taken by force.</p>
   <p>The opponents of the national Jewish movement once contended that the Jewish people should wait for freedom by free donation. But since the advent of Dr. Pinsky, the motto of the Zionists has been for years: "God helps those who help themselves." The same idea was brought out by Dr. Theodore Herzl in the opening address of the first Jewish congress: "We Zionists," he said - "must encourage the Jews to help themselves. A nation must help itself. If it does not do so, no other nation will."</p>

   <p>Freedom, development of our national characteristics, equality among nations, can only be accomplished if the Jews help themselves. There are some Jews who believe that the Jewish question will be solved from without, through the help of a Gentile Messiah. While the old pious generation ardently believed that the offspring of David would ultimately appear. They had faith in the strength of their own people and thereupon built their hopes.</p>
   <p>Those who believe in a Gentile Messiah, think that the powerful nations that wage wars to maintain their supremacy, will take pity on the homeless Jewish people, in spite of the fact that Palestine is the "Holy Land" to Christians and Mohammedans as well. They believe that these nations will hand Palestine over to the Jews, in spite of the fact that it is inhabited by some seven hundred thousand non-Jewish natives.</p>

   <p>Our diplomat mediators should ask themselves if it is likely that the world will give to the Jews a country settled by a foreign people. They should remember that it is not practical to divide the bear's skin while it is still on the living bear. At present Palestine is a Turkish province and its inhabitants are Arabians.</p>
   <p>We must first of all proceed with Palestine's colonization and gradually increase it. A nation is not born overnight. The deliverance of the Jews must come about, through the Jews themselves.</p>
