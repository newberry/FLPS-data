   <p>When an appeal was made last Passover in the synagogues, for the Redemption Fund of Palestine, hundreds of Jews responded heartily. Because of the sanctity of the holiday, we naturally could not make any notations of those who gave public promises in the Holy House of prayer.</p>
   <p>At present only some of the synagogues have assumed their duties, collecting what they could from the donors. The Son of Moses Synagogue, on Paulina St., by appeal from Rabbi Budzinsky and president Jacob Cohn, and through the efforts of the beadle, Mr. Berg, collected so far $205. Our People's True Synagogue, on the North Side, collected $134 by appeal of Rabbi Hevesh; and the House of Jacob, at 44th Street and St. Louis Avenue, through their president, Mr. Goldman, and beadle, Mr. Kaufman, collected thus far $75.</p>
   <p>Other Synagogues brought money from their districts, which will shortly be accounted for.</p>
   <p>But the greater number of donations have not yet materialized and to these donors we direct our appeal.</p>
