   <p>Simon Klein, old settler and pioneer business man of Chicago, died Tuesday evening. Mr. Klein was born in Kerzenheim, Bavaria, in 1820. He took part in the German revolution of 1848, and came to America with the band of exiles which included Carl Schurz and Hecker. He married the woman of his choice before leaving, and the trip to the new world was his wedding journey. Mr. Klein came directly to Chicago and opened a dry goods store on Clark street, between Jackson and Van Buren. About 1855, his nephew ,Solomon Mandel, a brother of the present members of the firm of Mandel Brothers, became a partner, the firm's name being Klein and Mandel. The junior partner died in 1860, and Mr. Klein formed a new partnership with Leon and Simon Mandel. This partnership was dissolved in 1865, E. Mandel taking Mr. Klein's place in the firm. Mr. Klein again went into the dry goods business after the war, under the name of S. Klein and Co. His store was located at Clark and Monroe streets, which was swept away in the fire of 1871. Mr. Klein then retired from active business.</p>
