   <p>Mendel Bailis, the Jewish martyr, whose home is now in Palestine, arrived yesterday morning in Chicago, and will be the guest of the local Jewish community until next Wednesday. Next Sunday afternoon, at 2 P. M., he will speak at a mass meeting which has been arranged in his honor at the Ashland Auditorium, Ashland and Van Buren Streets. Miss Jane Addams and other prominent persons will also speak. A banquet will be given in his honor, on Tuesday evening, at Gold's Pompeian Room, 812 West Roosevelt Road.</p>
   <p>Upon his arrival here from New York, Mendel Bailis was met by a committee of prominent Jews and some of his countrymen from Kiev. He asked first to meet Miss Jane Addams of Hull House. She, together with some other Americans, had done a great deal to win the non-Jewish public opinion in this country in his favor, at the time when he was being persecuted in Russia because the "Black Hundreds" accused him of ritual murder, and wanted to brand him and the whole Jewish nation as ritual murderers, who use Christian blood for religious purposes. [Translator's note: The "Black Hundreds" was an organization of reactionary Russians whose main activity was persecuting the Jews and the workers. They were highly influential with the Czarist government.]</p>
   <p>The committee accompanied the guest to Hull House where Miss Addams extended a friendly welcome. Harry A. Lipski, general manager of the Courier, was the spokesman. He introduced the guest to Miss Addams and thanked her, in his name, for all she had done at the time of the "ritual murder" trial. Miss Addams replied that all that she had done for Mendel Bailis, and for the Jewish people, was no more than her duty as a human being and an American.</p>
   <p>Pleased with the visit, Miss Addams invited the guest and the committee to the lunchroom in the building and served coffee to them. The visit to Hull House was not a ceremonial one, but it was simple and impressive.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The next few paragraphs are omitted since they deal with Mr. Bailis' life, before and after the trial.]</p>
   <p>Mendel Bailis is staying at [the home of] Mrs. Zevin, 1510 South Hamlin Avenue. Those who want to see and hear this honored guest next Sunday afternoon, at the Ashland Auditorium, should not fail to procure their tickets.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The rest of the article is devoted to the addresses of the fifteen places where tickets can be procured].</p>
