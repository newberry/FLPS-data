   <p>The Jews of Chicago are not idle in the preparations to receive their oppressed brothers of Russia.</p>
   <p>Chicago Israelites are in the gigantic movement set on foot by the Jews of this country to aid the fleeing immigrants, and though no great stir has yet been created, considerable preparatory work has been done. No Russian Jew has yet arrived here and none are expected for some time, but when they do come they will be taken care of.</p>
   <p>The Jews of the United States have taken upon themselves the care of ostracized Russian Jews and organized so as to look after the immigrants. The organization, a national one, was formed the middle of last February, and is called the Jewish Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>In a financial way the object of the Alliance is to secure every Jewish citizen in this country as a member, a membership fee of three dollars being charged.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The objects of the alliance are:</p>
   <p>First - To instruct Hebrew immigrants in the duties and obligations of American citizenship and to fit them for the loyal discharge thereof</p>
   <p>Second - To aid Hebrew immigrants in America to become self-supporting.</p>
   <p>(a) By directing the current of immigration away from crowded center of population into rural districts and toward industrial occupations.</p>
   <p>(b) By specifically fostering a sentiment and organizing a movement toward making agriculture a preferred occupation.</p>
   <p>(c) By such other ways and means as shall from time to time seem best adopted to promote the general object.</p>
   <p>Local branches of the alliance are composed of delegates from organized Jewish associations or of individual members or of both. At conventions each local branch is entitled to representation thus:</p>
   <p>One representative for every organized body contributing at least $25, annually; and one representative for every additional $25 annually contributed as dues of individual members to the treasury of the alliance.</p>

   <p>Said Dr. Spivak, the originator of the alliance:</p>
   <p>"What we want to accomplish by the alliance is to secure for those of our brethren who overflood the market of hands some honest work. We desire, that the Jewish immigrant shall not crowd into the large sea coast cities; we want to exterminate peddling and petty trading; we propose, in short, to give a possibility to the immigrant to make a living for himself and his family - not to fall a burden upon the various Jewish charitable institutions - and to become an independent, self-supporting citizen of this republic. Agriculture, in the opinion of my co-laborers and myself, ought to be the main spring of the future activity of the alliance. The alliance ought not to be made a charitable institution. Charity in itself is a worthy sentiment, but it has never done any real or permanent good. Let us not give anything for nothing. Only the sick, the old, and the crippled ought to live on charity, and that only under the present system of society. The strong and healthy have to work for a living, and aid in obtaining work is the only charity which is not objectionable and within the province of the alliance.</p>
   <p>"The alliance must not in any way become entangled in the meshes of politics."</p>

   <p>The German Jews of Chicago are just beginning to take a hand in the alliance. Henry Greenebaum is in the movement heart and soul, and with him are Louis Adams, L. Schlossman, E. Rubovitz and the Rev. Messrs. Levi, Moses, and Felsenthal.</p>
