   <p>Mr. Sol Blumgarden in a lecture scheduled for next Sunday at the Hebrew Institute, will tell the Chicago Jewry what he has seen, heard, and felt in the few years he spent in Palestine prior to Turkey's entrance in the war. We would like to see the Institute's gym, which is as large as the Coliseum, packed by Jews and the voice of Blumgarden ringing in every corner. Blumgarden, a talented poet and writer, who has written a great deal on the redemption of Palestine, now is a practical observer and appraiser.</p>
