   <p>Last night, at the meeting held in the Hebrew Institute, the Joint Relief Committee, representing rabbis and presidents of synagogues and lodges, chose a committee of five to initiate an active campaign, the outgrowth of which will be a gigantic movement against pogroms in Poland and Rumania.</p>
   <p>The committee will meet with representatives of local workers regarding united action. They will also contact South Side Jews and get in communication with New York for the purpose of making this pressing movement against Polish and Rumanian pogromists a national one.</p>
   <p>This plan was accepted after such speeches as were made by Judge Fisher, Dr. Melomid, various rabbis, and others.</p>
   <p>Also, B. J. Brownsein read a letter containing horrible details regarding the situation of Jews in Rumania.</p>
