   <p>Chicago Jewry has now an excellent opportunity to see one of the most beautiful art pieces ever created in the Bezalel Art School in Jerusalem. It is a Keter Torah [a crown which is placed on the scroll before and after reading from the Torah on the Sabbath and the holidays in the Synagogues] produced in an enlarged size by an outstanding artist and bearing the star of David mounted in attractive letters. This typically Jewish art piece can be seen free at the Ashland and Twelfth Street Bank.</p>
   <p>The Keter Torah will be raffled. There will be a multitude of participants. The raffle is sponsored by the Bezalel Art School, and will be directed by Mr. Sol Druker, the well-known director of the Foreign Department of the bank.</p>
