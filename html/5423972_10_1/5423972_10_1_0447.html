   <p>The appearance in yesterday's Courier of the names and addresses of Chicago Jews for whom Mr. B. Horwich has brought letters and greetings, which can be obtained in the office of this newspaper, created a great turmoil. At several newspaper stands on the West Side, riots practically occurred, such was the rush to secure the Courier. Everyone sought a personal letter or regards. Newsstands were kept busy telephoning or coming to obtain more Couriers.</p>
   <p>A large crowd gathered inside and outside of the Courier office. Readers who read their names and addresses came to receive their letters and greetings. They began to arrive at seven o'clock in the morning, and kept three office girls busy accommodating everyone.</p>
   <p>Today we are printing additional names of Chicago Jews for whom we have letters and regards.</p>
