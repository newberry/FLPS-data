   <p>Herman L. Reiwitch was born in 1868 in Russia. He came to this country at the age of five. Arriving in Chicago, he found a job in the Tribune office as office boy, carrying copy from the editors to the printers. A year and a half later, R. W. Patterson, then managing editor of the paper, urged him to try reporter work. In 1886, when the 8 hour labor troubles reached their height, he was labor reporter for the Tribune. He was a spectator in the "Black Road" and "Haymarket Square" riots. Miscellaneous work followed these assignments, including the Johnstown Flood.</p>
   <p>Concluding 10 years of service on the Tribune, Mr. Reiwitch resigned to take a better position on the Herald. After a year's service as assistant editor he was elevated to city editor, being then the most youthful city editor Chicago had ever had. This was in the Fall of 1893 and he has continued with the Herald ever since.</p>
