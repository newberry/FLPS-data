   <p>The debates in Congress concerning the Immigration bill, show that the entire anti-immigration movement aims at something which the authors of the bill cannot, or do not wish to express clearly.</p>
   <p>The existing immigration laws are rigid enough to prevent the admission of elements which are depicted in this bill as undesirable elements. But the immigrant fiends are not satisfied with this, their sinister task is to exclude as many immigrants as possible.</p>
   <p>They are ashamed to state openly that the "foreigners" are no longer desired and admit that the country is dominated by a hostile sentiment toward liberty. This attitude is the antitheses of the spirit that animated the grandfathers of the American Revolution and the fathers of the Civil War.</p>

   <p>Some still speak of the land of the free for all the oppressed and persecuted, but the majority of the present generation has, long since, discarded such sentimentality. The Statue of Liberty, standing at the entrance of the country, no longer, expresses the sentiments and actions of present Americans.</p>
   <p>Every misfortune that appears in the world, is only on account of Jews. Our sages have said so and life itself confirms their words again and again. Even now, the first victims will be the Jews. The hatred for the foreigner will affect them (Jews) more than any other nationality. They, the foreigners of all nations, foreign in culture, language, and race, will be the first victims of the new prevailing spirit. Our wandering race can not enjoy the comfort of reforms which other foreigners can hope for in their respective countries, and from whence their brethren need not flee.</p>
