   <p>His Development</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch was born May 22, 1853 in Luxemburg, the son of Rabbi Dr. Samuel Hirsch. Fourteen Years later, he settled with his parents in America and finished the course at the University of Pennsylvania. After having completed <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>his education at the Universities of Leipzig and Berlin, he was elected a Rabbi of the Sinai Congregation, in Baltimore, and one year later became the spiritual head of the Avath Israel Congregation in Louisville, where he remained till 1880, when he received a call to the Chicago Sinai Congregation. Although he received many flattering offers from other congregations, he remained true to the Sinai Congregation until his death.</p>
   <p>In 1878 he married the daughter of a well known New York Rabbi, Miss Mathilda Einhorn with whom he lived very happily.</p>
   <p>He Took An Active Part In Manifold Affairs</p>
   <p>In Chicago he developed great and useful activities. In the same year he became Professor of Hebraic literature at the University of Chicago. Besides this he lectured at John Hopkins University in 1902. Furthermore he was an editor of the Zeitgeist, the Reformer and the Reform Advocate. Not satisfied, he was a member for ten years of the Chicago Public Library's administration <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and also a member of the Moral's Commission, established by Mayor Carter H. Harrison. As an orator he had few equals. In the pulpit he gave expression to his opinion with great frankness and did not spare with his criticism even the most influential members of his Congregation when necessary. Only a man of his importance and genius, could venture to break with the traditional custom of holding services on Saturday, and change to Sunday services.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch belonged to the Chicago Lincoln Club, the Chicago Singing Society, besides, he was an honorary member of the Turngemeinde. He always took an active part in all German-American efforts.</p>
