   <p>The appeal of the local philanthropist Julius Rosenwald for war suffering Jews, which was published in the Courier, made a deep impression not only on the Jews of Chicago but also on Jews in all states of the Great West where the Courier is read.</p>
   <p>The following letter speaks for itself:</p>
   <p>"Joint Relief Committee, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>"After reading the appeal made by Julius Rosenwald, which was published in The Jewish Courier of April 13, 1919, I reread it to the members of the Ladies Independent Convalescent Home of which I am president. Our members decided to withdraw twenty-five dollars from the bank, to be sent to you for the War suffering Jews.</p>
   <p>With Zionist regards</p>
   <p>Mrs. M. Schwartz</p>
   <p>Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
