   <p>According to the recently published statistical figures on the Jewish population in the various countries, the United States now ranks as the third and largest home of the Jewish people. The "American Jewish Year Book" compiled under the direction of the scholarly Miss Henrietta Szold, states that the number of Jews in the United States today numbers 1,777,185. The only two other countries with a larger Jewish population are Russia - 5,250,000 and Austria Hungary - 2,076,000.</p>
   <p>It is believed that within one generation the Jewish population in the United States will be greater than that of Austria Hungary and within two generations it will be greater than that of Russia. Under normal circumstances there could not be such a tremendous increase of the Jewish population in the United States, but in view of the persecutions in Russia, wherein we do not expect things to return to normal for at least twenty five years, the large numbers of Jews emigrating from Russia to the United States will continue. Also conditions in Austria Hungary and particularly in the Polish section of the Reich are not at all desirable, which of course accounts for the wholesale emigration of Jews from that part of Europe.</p>
   <p>Thus it is expected that within the next two or three decades the United States will become the largest home of the Jews in the world.</p>
