   <p>Today or tomorrow there will be introduced a new immigration bill. Congressman Sabath stated, in a speech before the representatives of foreign language newspapers of Chicago, published in yesterday's Courier, that the bill has many possibilities of becoming law. The Jewish congressman, from Chicago, and his few aids are in the minority. The bill, it seems, will have a large majority in Congress.</p>
   <p>The friends of the immigrant are few. Those against him are influenced by organized labor. Mr. Gompers, leader of the American worker, himself an immigrant Jew, at the last convention of the American Federation of Labor, raised the question of admittance of aliens to the United States, accusing the friends of the immigrant of being foes of labor in need of cheap labor and, therefore, in favor of the open door policy.</p>
   <p>The friends of immigration have shown more than once the fallacy of this assumption. Recently, Mr. Isadore Isaac, in a book full of facts presented the assertions of Mr. Gompers. He shows that the immigrant is not responsible for unemployment, nor does he lessen the standard of life of the American worker. On the contrary, in districts of fewer immigrants, the earnings are less and unemployment greater. Earnings and unemployment are determined by what La Salle called "The Iron rules of Modern Industry."</p>
   <p>The fewer the workers an employer has, the fewer his business deals with other employers, and the worse the resulting condition for all. The coming of more workers creates a demand for more business enterprises and new fields of labor. Unemployment is not due to too many immigrants but to present day industry, which produces more goods than people can buy, thus having to lay off workers from time to time.</p>
   <p>The enemies of immigration, among whom are found large groups of aliens who accepted this attitude after getting their first jobs, know that on their side stands organized labor. This gives them twice the courage to fight for an immigration bill, aiming not to increase the amount of fortunate ones who were permitted to enter into this promised land.</p>
   
   <p>The defenders of the immigrant must have a strong love for the immigrant and an unusual courage to defend him, at a time when organized labor, in which there are a great many foreigners, accuse them of being enemies of the workers working in the interest of the employers.</p>
   <p>Those who have the interests of the immigrant at heart, who feel his plight, who remember their own experiences on Ellis Island, when they landed there believing that here was the "tree of life," who have relatives and friends in other countries, who wish that the poor and oppressed of the old world find a haven in this great land with room for whole nations and races, all these friends of the immigrant should now follow this advice and flood their congressmen with a mountain of protests against their unfriendly stand towards immigration.</p>
   <p>Congressmen from every district should be showered with letters requesting them to defeat this bill. If these protests succeed in lessening the numbers of supporters of this bill in Congress, then our purpose will be accomplished. President Wilson, according to Sabath's opinion, will not sanction this bill unless forced to do it as a result of its passage by a large majority of votes. This large majority can be avoided if energetic protests are sent by naturalized citizens and their friends.</p>
