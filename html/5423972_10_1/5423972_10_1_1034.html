   <p>There are rumors in circulation that Judge Joseph W. Shulman of the Municipal Court is seriously contemplating retiring from office, because the burdens, the work, and the worry have become unbearable. Judge Joseph W. Shulman is often besieged day and night by dozens of people who are in trouble and want his help. Being a very humane judge and a good-natured man, he is trying to help all those who need his help, and those who need his help are so many that he cannot possibly handle them all. It is for this reason that he intends to resign from his judgeship, according to rumors in circulation.</p>
   <p>We have not succeeded in having this rumor verified or denied, but we can only say that what Judge Joseph W. Shulman intends to do must not happen. He has proved to be a good asset to the Jewish community and to the community at <span class="page-break">2</span>large. Only a short time ago--during the Federated Drive--he collected singlehandedly eight thousand dollars for charity. He is rendering yeoman service to the community both as a judge and as a citizen, and just as the Municipal Bench cannot afford to lose him, so cannot the Jewish community dispense with his services. Besides, no Jew in office has the right to resign and retire now. As long as Henry Ford's dogs bark at us every day, we must be on our guard, and our men must hold their places in public life. They must not retire now. Especially a man like Judge Shulman, who could do and does a world of good to his fellow citizens and fellow Jews, must not resign at the present juncture. It is true that he is overburdened with work and that he is confronted every day with a multitude of problems, but he must stick it out. He must continue to remain on his job. This is the desire of the people who elected him to office and this is the desire of every Jew in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Judge Shulman must not resign from office.</p>
