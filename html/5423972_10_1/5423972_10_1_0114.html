   <p>Washington, Sept. 27 - The anti-immigrationists rallied to a great victory, taking advantage of the small group of congressmen who attended the session.</p>
   <p>Most of the members of the Immigration and Naturalization Committee are, at present, not in Washington, because, after the House passed the Karensi Bill which is now before the Senate, the congressmen learned that no other bills would be taken up until the special session. Therefore, they returned home for a rest. Grasping this opportunity, John L. Burnette, chairman of the Immigration and Naturalization Committee, staunchest enemy of immigrants, called a meeting of his committee.</p>

   <p>The committee is composed of fifteen members. Only eight attended the meeting. With the exception of Congressman A. J. Sabath of Illinois, all were notorious opponents of immigration. At this meeting, the chairman, Congressman Burnette, introduced the old Burnette-Dillingholm Bill. Most of them were for the anti-immigration bill and a resolution was passed to recommend this bill as favorable in Congress.</p>
   <p>Congressman A. J. Sabath protested vehemently against such a form of recommending bills, and in a two-hour talk accused the foes of immigration of seeking to smuggle through a bill, which is against the will of the best elements in the country, and in a cowardly manner wanting to impose their views upon Congress, knowing that the bill would fall through if it were brought before the full committee.</p>

   <p>The Illinois congressman proposed to postpone the resolution until a second meeting when all members of the committee would be present.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath's recommendation fell through by a vote of seven to one and now the bill will be brought before Congress where the fight between friends and enemies of immigration will begin.</p>
