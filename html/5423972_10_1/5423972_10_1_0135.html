   <p>After six months of work, the Immigration Committee of the Conference of Jewish Women's Organizations is now permanently established. The Immigrants' Protective League, 743 Plymouth Court, will allow the committee the use of its office.</p>
   <p>It is conservatively estimated that about 1,200 Jewish adult males come directly to Chicago annually from the port cities. Among these are many who need the counsel the committee will offer regarding educational, social and vocational opportunities. It has been only the last few years, since the establishment of the Immigrants' Protective League, that an organized effort has been made to offer guidance and protection to the immigrant. However, the League's energies are chiefly directed toward the immigrant girl.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Julius Stone is chairman of the new committee, and Julia Felsenthal, the secretary.</p>
