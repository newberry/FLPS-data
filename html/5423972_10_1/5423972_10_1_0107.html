   <p>Fruma Davinic, 23 years old, of Antipolia, Grodna County, Russia, is being held in Antwerp. With her is her child Liebele, three years old. They have waited over five weeks now for a half ticket on the Red Star Line and $20 that she is expecting from her husband, Mr. M. Davis, who lived formerly at 1804 Madison street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>The woman had paid tickets but they are being held. The Red Star Line has twice cabled to Chicago, but has received no reply. The position of Mrs. Davinic and her child is a very uncertain one.</p>
   <p>Antipolia friends of Mr. Davis and his wife have been asked to find Mr. Davis, and inform him of his wife's sad plight. All other necessary information and news Mr. Davis can obtain at the Courier Office.</p>
