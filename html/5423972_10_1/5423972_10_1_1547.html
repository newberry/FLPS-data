   <p>Col. Martin Emerich was born in Baltimore, Md., in 1847. He received a thorough English and German education at the best schools in Maryland, and shortly after completing his education, entered into active commercial life. Before attaining his majority, he was admitted to the firm of his father and brothers, who were doing a general merchandising business in Baltimore and Washington. Recognizing the boundless opportunities afforded by the ever-growing West, Col. Emerich, in 1882 started a business in St. Louis, known as the Strauss-Emerich Outfitting Co., at present, the leading concern of its kind in that city. In 1884, Col. Emerich came to Chicago and started the well known outfitting establishment on State St. bearing his name.</p>
   <p>It was not until 1892, that Col. Emerich entered politics. In that year, there was a special committee of twenty-five, appointed at a business men's mass meeting for the purpose of suggesting suitable candidates for the Democratic County Convention. Among the names proposed for the office of County Commissioner was Col. Emerich's, and he was nominated and elected by a large majority, leading the entire <span class="page-break">2</span>county ticket. He served as chairman of the committee on finance, chairman of the committee on judiciary. and was a member of various other important committees. It was largely due to the efforts of Col. Emerich that the County Commission of that year made its enviable record of economy and care in respect to the public finance.</p>
