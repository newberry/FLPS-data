   <p>After a three and a half month journey through Europe, in the interests of the Mizrachi movement and relief, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein returned to Chicago yesterday. He was greeted at the depot by a host of admirers, as well as the officials and members of the Congregation Anshe Kneseth Israel, of which he is rabbi. Rabbi Epstein is very happy to be back in Chicago where he is active and influential in the field of charity and Judaism. He listened with interest to the news about the organizing of the Orthodox Jewish congregations into a Kehilah [organization of Orthodox Jews], and declared that he would do everything in his power to assist the organization with word and deed as long as it was necessary.</p>
   <p>A representative of the Courier interviewed Rabbi Epstein yesterday at his home, 1518 [South] Clifton Park Avenue, where the reporter procured information on the condition of the Jews in Poland, and the relief work which is being done there.</p>
   
   <p>"Jews in Poland," Rabbi Epstein began, "are in a terrible situation. They are exhausted from the war, starvation, sickness, and persecution, all of which they have endured, and had it not been for the generosity of the American Jews, they would have perished by the thousands, every day, from misery and suffering. They know how to appreciate the noble work which is being done in their behalf, and they revere the American Jews, blessing them upon every occasion.</p>
   <p>"I have seen the wretched [conditions of the] Jews of Germany, Poland, and Lithuania, and my heart ached. I have seen with my own eyes the brutality of the Poles toward the Jews; I have seen them plucking the beards of Jews, exposing them to pain and derision. I was powerless to do anything against the hoodlums.</p>
   <p>"Rabbi Meyer Berlin, with whom I traveled to Warsaw, almost became a victim of this outrage, but thanks to our American passports and the letter of President Wilson, he was spared the humiliation.</p>
   
   <p>"Similar outrages against Jews with beards occurred in numerous places in Poland in addition to brutal beatings.</p>
   <p>"The breadlines made a horrible impression. In Warsaw, one is prohibited from being on the streets after midnight, but one is permitted to stand at the breadlines where bread is sold by cards. The authorities designated separate places for Jews and Gentiles. Jews are not allowed in the Gentile breadlines. But Poles quite often come to the Jewish breadlines and cause disorder, while the police look on and tolerate it.</p>
   <p>"A Jewish mother of five children was shot dead by the police in a breadline disorder, and upon the protest of prominent Jews to the officer in charge, the latter replied that the Jews deserve these atrocities because the Jews are troublemakers, Bolsheviks, and enemies of Poland, and enemies must be dealt with rigorously.....</p>
   <p>"The hatred of the Poles toward the Jews is tremendous. If it were not for this hatred and these restrictions, the Jews would begin trading again, thereby creating employment, and would thus develop the country. But the Poles refuse to consider or recognize any order that permits the Jew to benefit from it and to live peacefully.</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless the Jew lives on. The assistance extended to him by the American Jews, coupled with that of the rabbis, yeshivoth [theological seminaries], and Talmud Torahs, sustain his body and spirit. The yeshivoth of the various cities in Poland are open, and the Jewish Torah is being taught. The synagogues which were destroyed by the war and pogroms are being rebuilt and are crowded with Jews who pray to the Lord for better times.</p>
   <p>"The Jews of Lithuania are in somewhat better circumstances. There is more food. I visited Kovno and its vicinity, and the poverty there is terrific, but the Jews of Kovno are fortunate in that they are not surrounded by such poisonous enemies as the Poles. The Lithuanians are better people and like to have the Jews whom they consider superior to themselves, and, therefore, are friendly to them. American help is gradually reaching Lithuania and private contributions can now be sent there."</p>
   <p>Rabbi Epstein deserves credit for making it possible to send money from America to Kovno. He worked very hard toward this end, and it is one of the great accomplishments of his European trip.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Epstein met many prominent Jews in Lithuania, Poland, Germany, and England, and discussed the Jewish situation with them. In London he had a lengthy talk with Sir Stuart (sic) Samuels, dealing with the Polish decree which states that every Jew in Poland must register. There are about 200,000 Lithuanian Jews in Poland who are not considered as Polish citizens, and who will have to leave the country if the decree goes into effect.</p>
   <p>Sir Stuart Samuels assured Rabbi Epstein that everything possible will be done by England's Jewry in this respect. He declared, however, that in order to make the protest more effective, the influential American Jews should also participate, and together, through their respective governments, compel the Polish government to recall the decree.</p>
   
   <p>Rabbi Epstein also met Mr. Levy-Epstein in London and Judge Harry M. Fisher in Warsaw. He brought with him many regards to Chicago Jews from their relatives in Poland.</p>
   <p>While in Warsaw, Rabbi Epstein became interested in the case of the Courier's correspondent, Mr. William Zukerman, who was arrested by the Polish authorities upon the false accusation that he came to "undermine Poland" by spreading Bolshevik propaganda. Rumors have it, however, that he has been detained because of the articles he sent exposing Polish anti-Semitism and Polish atrocities against the Jews. Lately, however, the charge against Zukerman has been lightened, and he is permitted some freedom in the prison where he is held.</p>
