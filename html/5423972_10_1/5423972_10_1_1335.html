   <p>Mr. Levin Epstein will speak today at 3 PM, at the "Anshe Chueses Israel" Congregation.</p>
   <p>We seldom get a visitor of his kind here in Chicago. Every time Mr. Levin Epstein pays us a visit and addresses us we never can forget him, for his speeches are wonderful. Mr. Levin Epstein is one of our finest Jewish characters of the present generation. He is well known in all Jewish communities in all parts of the world, and is beloved and respected everywhere.</p>
   <p>As founder of a certain Jewish colony, Mr. Levin Epstein lived and worked for the cause 12 years in Palestine. He also is the founder of the Cannel Wine Co. of America and Russia. He is a great active Zionist, is treasurer of the Federation of American Zionists, and is interested in very many different Jewish undertakings. He always has something good to say and to hear him is quite a treat. He had the confidence of our great Jewish Philanthropist, Baron Hirsch, who trusted him with many Jewish undertakings.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Levin Epstein will address the Chicago Jews tonight on the practical work that is going on in Palestine at present.</p>
   <p>Mr. L. Zolotkof and others will also speak at this meeting.</p>
