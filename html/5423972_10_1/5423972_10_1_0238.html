   <p>Some two weeks since the United Hebrew Relief Association, 200 La Salle St., was again in a state of commotion by the arrival of some twenty self-expatriated Russians, who came for relief, aid, and means to forward them to lands out West. It appears that some ten of them were able-bodied men, the balance were old men, women and children. These people had been informed by their country-men here of the needs and essential requisites for migration to this country, but it seems they have either not heeded the advice or they deliberately hoodwink our charities. If these wholesale imports of humans will continue thus, it will tax our Jewish communities to the utmost. Chicago may be a distributery point but not to the extent that the burden of charity should fall upon us. Should our Eastern cities continue to send us more of such people without adequate means, we would suggest that our society should send them back "stante peder."</p>
