   <p>Editor: The Occident</p>
   <p>As a constant reader of your valuable journal, it has occurred to me that it would be a good plan for The Occident to commence publishing on its first page, pictures of the representative Jewish people of Chicago. Suppose, Mr. Editor, you start this week and begin by giving us the picture of Chicago's greatest Jewish representative, Henry Greenebaum; his history and work would, I am positive, prove interesting reading to all.</p>
   <p>High upon the roll of honor stands the names of Abraham Hart, A. E. Frankland, Jacob Rosenberg, D. Morgentheim, Isaac Greensfelder, Adolph Loeb, H. F. Hahn, Rev. B. Felsenthal, Rev. Joseph Stolz, Rev. E. G. Hirsch, Herman Felsenthal, Lazarus Silverman, Rev. A. Norden, Rev. Dr. Moses, Jacob Newman, Judge Philip Stein, and many others too numerous to mention, while among the women whose hands have been ever open as the day to meeting charity, I recall such noble spirited women in Israel, as Mrs. B. Schoeneman, Mrs. Smalz, Mrs. Martin Burke, Mrs. Henry Frank, Mrs. E. Mandel, Mrs. Charles Schaub, Mrs. Joseph Horner, Mrs. Charles Leibenstein, Mrs. Leon Mayor, Mrs. Jacob Newman, Mrs. Leon Strauss, Mrs. Henry Mayer, Mrs. E. Sandheimer, Mrs. Morris Loeb and many others.</p>
