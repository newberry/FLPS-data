   <p>The local office of the American Red Cross for the last few months has been searching for a Mr. J. Brasner, supposedly of 120 W. 12 St. But there is no such person at that address.</p>
   <p>The Red Cross has a letter for him from Lieutenant Bernard Brasner, Landshturm 20, at present war prisoner in Krasniarsk, Siberia. The letter reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"I am well and hopeful. Best regards to Ludwia's and your own family."</p>
   <p>The letter can be obtained in the Courier's office.</p>
