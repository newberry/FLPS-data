   <p>Dr. William A. Kamin, for many years practicing dentist in Chicago and very popular in literary and radical circles died on Thursday.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kamin was one of the very first Russian young men who made Chicago their home in the early '90's. As he was a lover of good literature his home was the rendezvous of the Yiddish-Russian intelligentsia, who found there the "atmosphere" so dear to their souls.</p>
