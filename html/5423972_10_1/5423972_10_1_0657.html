   <p>Truth was victorious and Mendel Bailis is free. We are all overjoyed at the liberation of this martyr of a martyr people, and yet we feel that yesterday's victory is the kind of which Napoleon said: "Another such victory and our battle is lost."</p>
   <p>We are satisfied that Mendel Bailis is free, that our brothers in Russia no longer fear that their government, at present, will dare to organize pogroms. And yet we cannot lose the feeling of the great insults heaped upon us. The people that have preached the gospel of love, mercy and justice to every living being from man to bird nest at the time when the Slavs were yet cannibalistic; a people whose Torah consists of "Love thy <span class="page-break">2</span>neighbor as thyself," wherein all else is explanatory; a people whose prophets foretold of the far future where the brotherhood of man would form one large enlightened and peace loving international family, all this in the time when other nations lived in barbaric wildness and ignorance - yet, this noble people at present, in the last half of the 3,000 years after the life of the prophet Isaiah, is being punished for drinking human blood.</p>
   <p>It is a victory before other people. But, woe to such a victory that takes place in this modern 20th century.</p>
   <p>Also the joy of the Russian people is not entirely fulfilled. True, this proved to all humanity that the Tsar and his ministers represent only the dark.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Hundreds, but not the white ten millions. Yet they have also thereby shown the weakness of the Russian people who are failing under the yoke of want and poverty; whose children die daily on the scaffold or die slowly in the narrow fortresses of European Russia and in the isolated villages of cold Siberia.</p>
   <p>The Russian people now stand clear of sin in comparison with their government. This same Russian government has always claimed that it could be more progressive, but the people hinder them. But now, all these excuses are of no avail. All of Russia has protested against the barbarism of its government and no longer wish to carry the responsibilities of the crimes of the Tsar and his ministers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Russian people have protested. All humanity knew of its distress thus indicating that there was such a thing as the human conscience through its protests. True, the Tsar ignored these protests. His ministers stated they could not bring such a message to him in spite of the fact that the voice of protest resounded even in the secret rooms of this same Tsar. He finally had to acknowledge this protesting humanity and therefore permitted the jury a free hand in deciding the verdict according to their own judgment, in which they could not do other than liberate the innocent Mendel Bailis.</p>
   <p>Poor Mendel Bailis! How much suffering he withstood simply because he belonged to a race that gave the world a Bible that it thought it would understand.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Mendel Bailis has been made the sacrificial victim of his people. Through him the dark wrath of the Tsar desired to strike at and punish the entire Jewish people, and this mad medieval spirit reached forth and attained its goal. Mendel Bailis was bound with thousands of nerve threads to all Jews. His every sorrow was felt by an entire nation. At the trial in Kiev, Mendel Bailis stood not as an individual but as a representative of a whole people for all generations from the first to the present.</p>
   <p>Jews throughout the entire world feel relieved now, not because they were vindicated of the horrible blood accusation, for such things are more to the shame of the accusers than the accused; but Jews hope that the Tsar will not dare again to harass the lonely bricklayer from Lukionouka or secretly distribute circulars for new pogroms.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Yet overlooking these poisonous vials we see that this is naturally one of those great days that will go down in human history. Let us hope this is the last struggle between light and darkness; the last taste of the dark forces to conquer the world. That these forces will revert to the dark abyss from which the devil himself crowned the Russian throne.</p>
