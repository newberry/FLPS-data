   <p>South Bend, Indiana. Apr. 8. It became known here today that Congressman Adolph J. Sabath and Miss Mae Ruth First were united in matrimony on December 31, 1917. Rabbi Julius Libert performed the ceremony.</p>
   <p>The news was kept a secret by both parties, in order to avoid congratulations and "wedding gifts" from the many friends of the popular Congressman. But as soon as Chicago became aware of the news, it was confirmed by those who already knew about it.

He also told the following:</p>
   <p>"When I was at the Zionist Convention in Chicago, Congressman Sabath desired that I perform the nuptial rites, but first convert to Judaism the future Mrs. Sabath.</p>
   <p>"The beautiful Miss First gladly consented to accept the Jewish Faith, according to the tenets of Reformed Judaism naturally, of which I am a Rabbi. For several successive days she visited me at South Bend, going through the precepts of conversion, as it is written in our Books, and when she became a Jewess in the full sense of the word, both came to me and were united in marriage, according to the laws of Moses and Israel"</p>
