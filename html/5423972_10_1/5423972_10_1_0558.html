   <p>Night before last at the home of Mr. Albert H. Loeb, vice-president of Sears, Roebuck and Company, more than sixty of the most prominent Jews of the South Side of Chicago assembled to discuss the Zionist movement.</p>
   <p>Professor Felix Frankfurter and Judge Julian W. Mack clearly outlined before the gathering the principles of Zionism and the prospects of realizing the main ideas of this great and growing national movement.</p>
   <p>Those present had been very little interested in Zionism up to now, and still less in general Jewish national thought. Nevertheless these ideas had lately begun to force their way into the most hidden Jewish corners and also reached eventually this class of the local wealthy Jews.</p>
   <p>Professor Frankfurter made a deep impression upon the gathering. Most of those present participated afterwards in the arguments about Zionism and the prospect <span class="page-break">2</span>of establishing a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. Mr. Lessing Rosenthal became particularly interested in this problem and it will not surprise anyone of those present if in the near future Zionism should gain new recruits of Mr. Rosenthal's class.</p>
   <p>One of the most interesting things which developed at this debate was the positive statement of Professor Frankfurter that the English Ambassador, Lord Reading, deals not only in accordance with the famous English declaration, but that also, as a Jew, he is doing everything in his power to help this movement.</p>
   <p>Mr. Julius Rosenwald was also present at the discussion.</p>
