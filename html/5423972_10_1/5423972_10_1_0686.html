   <p>While visiting Palestine, the prominent philathropist, Mr. Ben Zion Lazerowitz, one of Chicago's finest Jews, founded a rabbinical seminary in Giroth Saul near Jerusalem. This seminary will complete our charity. This institution will enable young men to occupy positions as rabbis and educators. We, therfore, urge all Jews to help them financially and morally.</p>
   <p>The institution is praised by the greatest men of Jerusalem. It attracted the attention of many young scholars and therefore the support of Mr. Ben Zion Lazerowitz alone is not enough to cover the expenses and the directors have turned to us for support. For this purpose they have sent the outstanding rabbi and scholar, Rabbi Isaac Shapir to collect funds for the institution.</p>
   <p>Those who feel and understand the necessity and importance of such a seminary in our Holy Land will surely do their utmost to support this undertaking. May God bless the contributors.</p>
