   <p>Moritz Rosenthal was born in Dixon, Illinois in May of 1866. He was admitted to the Bar in 1890, and came to Chicago in 1891. He formed a co-partnership under the firm name of Moses, Rosenthal, and Kennedy. From 1894, to 1897, Mr. Rosenthal was assistant United States Attorney. He was considered a terror by the trusts whom he had occasion to oppose as an officer of the law.</p>
   <p>He represented the City of Chicago in the traction fight and was the associate counsel of John S. Miller in the famous "packer's trial." His defense of Inspector Lavin of the Chicago Police Department, who was accused of being an accessory to a burglary charge, was one of the most spectacular and sensational cases in the history of the Chicago Bar. His ability attracted the attention of the Standard Oil Company, who have retained him to defend them in much of the litigation that is now being directed against the gigantic corporation. Mr. Rosenthal is also associated in the defense of the president of the United Railways Company of San Francisco, a case which has attracted much attention. Mr. Rosenthal has attained such marked distinction in his profession that he may justly be called one of the leaders of the American Bar.</p>
