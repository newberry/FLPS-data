   <p>Attorney Max Shulman, president of the Order Nights of Zion, and Mr. Miller, chairman of the Shkolim Committee, launched a great campaign among the Chicago Jewish lodges. Their propaganda is aimed to show the importance of the shekel and to influence the Chicago Jewish lodges to buy shkolim for their members.</p>
   <p>When buying a shekel, a Jew practically adds a brick to the construction of the Jewish community (in Palestine). And what Jew does not want to help the ancient Jewish homeland, to establish a definite place for the wandering and persecuted Jew, to revive the Jewish culture, and to build up the Jewish national pride. Therefore, the campaign to make every Chicago Jewish lodge buy a shekel for each one of its membership will undoubtedly be crowned with great success.</p>

   <p>Among the first lodges which have already determined to buy shkolim are: Dr. Sultan Lodge, Independent Order B'rith Abraham, and the Chicago Branch Lodge of the P. O. W.</p>
