   <p>The banquet was a success in every respect. More than seven hundred reservations had been made and over 1,300 assembled in the gallery.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Saul Silber was toastmaster, and the speakers were Sam Ginsburg, Max Shulman, Joseph Weil, and Dr. Chaim Weizmann, who delivered a brilliant talk in Yiddish.</p>
   <p>Cantor Manewitz entertained the large audience.</p>
