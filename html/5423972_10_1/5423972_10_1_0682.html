   <p>In our midst, there are men who are constantly shouting progress and use it as a criterion to oppose or favor proposed acts; they immediately rush to the scene with their progressive slogan, measure the proportion by their view and then give out their decision that the proposal is not progressive.</p>
   <p>However it often occurs that they are needed to participate in practical things which are associated with real life, and not with any abstract phrases; then they loose themselves, cannot differentiate between black and white, and act extremely reactionary.</p>

   <p>A recent proof of this is furnished to us by the position of the various Jewish groups concerning the question of establishing a Jewish university in Palestine.</p>
   <p>As soon as it was reported that the university question was placed on the agenda of the eleventh Zionist congress, a heated debate arose - as usual - about the matter.</p>
   <p>The majority of voices which we heard on this question were in favor of establishing a Jewish university. We have read about a meeting of Jewish financiers which was held for the purpose of discussing this matter, and they appointed a committee to take care of the financial side of the undertaking.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The studious Jewish youth had accepted the plan with great enthusiasm and Jewish men of knowledge greeted it warmly, promising their support.</p>
   <p>Apparently everything was running along smoothly until the "progressives" in Palestine and in the diaspora, private individuals and party members, belonging to the Hapoel Hatzair and the Poale Zion, scented a danger against progress in this project and they determined to assail the project of the university at the congress.</p>
   <p>We can not know what the "progressives" attitude or aims are exactly until we receive a complete report from the congress. Thus far we know that the opposing faction contends that the university question should be taken up later; in the meantime (they say) colonies are needed to provide the workers with employment and when all the workers are employed then the erection of a university can be considered.</p>

   <p>The progressives forget that the Jewish liberation movement embraces all classes of the Jewish people. Just as food is essential to the body so is food essential to the mind and we must, therefore, establish institutions for the contentment of all needy.</p>
   <p>Today we make use of the experiences of the preceding generations. Just as we are wanting for some technicological developments in Palestine, employing whatever Europe and America invested, so we should not delay the establishment of a university, which is necessary for the development of the entire nation. It would be well if they act progressively and not reactionary.</p>
