   <p>A committee of three left here yesterday for New York to confer with Jewish representatives regarding further steps to be taken concerning the pogroms against Jews in Poland.</p>
   <p>The committee consists of Mr. Julius Rosenwald, elected by the South Side Jews; Judge Harry M. Fisher, by the West Side and Northwest Side Jews; and L. Shaffer, by the radicals. These people were elected at a conference of local Jewish leaders held last Saturday evening at the Standard Club.</p>
   <p>The conference in New York will probably be held tomorrow.</p>
