   <p>More than 2,000 men, women, and children took part yesterday evening in a "neighborhood reception" for Colonel Abel Davis, commander of the 132 infantry regiment, which took place in the street in front of his home at 5125 Ellis Ave. The street was decorated and illuminated with white and blue lanterns. From a grandly decorated platform, set up for the occasion, Judges McGurtie, Holmes, McSurley, Horner, Trude, and Holdom, addressed the crowd. All the judges lauded the Colonel.</p>
