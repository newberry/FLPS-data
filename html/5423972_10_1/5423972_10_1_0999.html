   <p>Julius Rosenwald is known today as the prince of all Jewish philanthropists. His philanthropic disbursements each year exceed the yearly charity budgets of many a first-class Jewish community. Julius Rosenwald is practically the greatest Jewish philanthropist in America. There are many philanthropically inclined civic men but they are not philanthropists. Has any other philanthropist given millions in cash for Jewish purposes? Has any one of them said: "I will give ten or twenty-five per cent of all the money raised for a certain Jewish cause"? No one has given as much money for philanthropic purposes as he. No one has sought to awaken and stimulate Jewish philanthropy as much as this modest, good-hearted Chicago Jew.</p>
   <p>It would be a mistake, however, to think that such a personality as Mr. Rosenwald has only admirers and good friends. There are many people who severely criticize Mr. Rosenwald's activities. "Why," they complain, "is Mr. Rosenwald indifferent <span class="page-break">\2</span>to the problem of Palestine? Why is he indifferent to our national future? A man like Rosenwald should be as much interested in the Jewish future as he is interested in the Jewish present. We cannot put a very high value upon his Jewish philanthropy because it is well known that he gives just as much, if not more, to non-Jewish charities as he does to Jewish." This, they add with a note of sorrow in their voices.</p>
   <p>It is worth while to note that most of his severe critics are to be found in the East, particularly in New York.</p>
   <p>We must declare that this criticism is entirely unfounded because these critics do not understand nor do they want to understand or consider the driving forces of everyday Jewish life or of Jewish history.</p>
   <p>If one observes Jewish life closely, one is easily convinced that two tendencies have always been predominant in Jewish life; one which dreams and acts in behalf of the future, and one which tries to improve the present. Such tendencies are, <span class="page-break">\3</span>of course, also to be found in the lives of other people, but, in this respect, there is a vast difference between us and other nations. These two tendencies are realized in the life of other nations through the activities of the politician and the civic worker. The politician works for the present while the civic worker works for the future, for the good of the next generation. These two tendencies have, in the life of our people, an entirely different significance, and are, therefore, expressed in a different way. Can we say that Moses Montefiore and Kremie, who devoted their genius and talent toward the betterment of everyday Jewish life, of the Jewish present, were politicians? No. They were civic workers. Was Jacob Schiff a politician, he who used all his energy and talents to improve the conditions of the Jews of his time, in his "present"? No. He was a civic worker who cared for his people and not for politics. Maybe he had a false conception of the principal Jewish problems; maybe his opinion about the problem of Judaism was somewhat conservative but all this does not alter the fact that he was a great man among Jews; a Jewish civic worker.</p>
   <p>Julius Rosenwald belongs to this category of Jewish civic men. He is a great <span class="page-break">\4</span>personality though he is more interested in the Jewish present than in the Jewish future. We have no right to say that he is not at all interested in our future but as a big businessman he finds it unnatural to speak of the future. [Translator's note: About ten lines of the text are missing here. Evidently, someone cut out this part of the page.]</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald is, first of all, a very practical businessman. He is not a theoretician and he does not pretend to be. Mr. Rosenwald does not evaluate Jewish history according to sociological or political theories, but according to the daily Jewish needs and requirements. Mr. Rosenwald, looking at Jewish life from that point of view, sees a very dismal picture; hundreds of thousands of forsaken orphans in the Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of worn-out, homeless Jews in Eastern and Central Europe, hundreds of thousands of unfortunate pogrom-and war-victims. His heart goes out to them in pity and compassion. He strives to help them as quickly as possible, to improve their conditions as quickly as possible. This is the leitmotiv of Mr. Rosenwald's philanthropy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Of course, this does not mean that we think that Mr. Rosenwald should not concern himself about the Jewish future and should not help us in our important work. On the other hand, he can answer that one man can do only one part of the work of the community.</p>
   <p>There is, however, one great philanthropist in this country, Mr. Nathan Strauss of New York, who besides being a great philanthropist is also a worker in behalf of Palestine. All others are neither philanthropists nor are they workers in behalf of Palestine.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald is the leader of the American group that is chiefly engaged in the improvement of the existing conditions of the Jews. We are convinced that Mr. Rosenwald, who is not indifferent to any aspect of Jewish life, will someday help us in our important work for the Jewish future, for the building of Palestine. His work in the Jewish institutions has brought him much closer to the Jewish masses, has acquainted him with our people, and broadened his horizon. He will become more and more convinced that it is not only absolutely necessary <span class="page-break">\6</span>but that it is quite possible to create a national home in Palestine. He cannot participate at present in work for Palestine because he is absorbed, heart and soul, in the relief work for those Jews who are living today.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald is not the only man who does this kind of work. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of others. He, however, remains the most prominent figure within this group because he is the most energetic.</p>
   <p>To sum up: the entire criticism against the one-sidedness of Mr. Rosenwald's activity, is not well-founded--if one looks at it from a historical point of view. Mr. Rosenwald is the representative of one of the great tendencies that predominate at the present time in Jewish life. We will be proud if, some day, Mr. Rosenwald also represents the second tendency.</p>
