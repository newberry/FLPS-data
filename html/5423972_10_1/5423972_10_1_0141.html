   <p>There are about 200,000 Jews in Chicago and Cook County, who stand a chance of losing their right to vote in the coming election, because they failed to register on the 8th of October.</p>
   <p>One of the most important reasons for registration in this election is that every Jew in Chicago must vote in all the coming elections in order to help elect the Jewish candidates, such as a Jewish congressman, Jewish county commissioner, and a Jewish judge.</p>
