   <p>The Eastland carried to a watery grave many Jewish victims. The bodies of the following were recovered and funeral services were held for them last week: Samuel Widram, Philip Ginsberg, Louis Moranz, Carl Friedman, Eleanor Orbst, and Mrs. Celia Colande.</p>
   <p>Widram proved himself a true hero. He was an excellent swimmer and when he found himself in the water, he at once struck out and began to rescue women and children. He saved forty in all. Then, while making a dive, he fractured his skull and lost his life.</p>
