   <p>To perpetuate the memory of Walter Joseph Austrian, a victim of the Iroquois Theater fire, a scholarship in his name was established yesterday at Yale University. The donors were his father, Joseph Austrian of Chicago, and his brother-in-law, Henry Block.</p>
   <p>They presented Yale with $6,000. The provision of the scholarship is that the annual income shall be given to a student of strong character with marked ability and promise.</p>
   <p>Walter Austrian was in the class of '07. He lost his life while trying to save several women and children from the crush and flames. He was at home for the Christmas vacation at the time.</p>
