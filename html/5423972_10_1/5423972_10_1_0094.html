   <p>The immigration orgies are not asleep or dreaming. Again we hear heated debates occurring at the sessions of the House Committee regarding immigration.</p>
   <p>The noted Dillingham-Barnett Bill is once more listed on the program of the day. Various amendments are affixed by the committee which will then send it to be voted upon by Congress.</p>
   <p>It is hard to foretell the outcome of this step. Few are the immigration defenders in Congress. The majority, as it appears, are in favor of more limited legal rulings.</p>
   <p>The small group of contenders will not desert the fort, but, will maintain their position to the last. Yet even at that, the result in their favor is very doubtful.</p>
   <p>The trouble lies in the fact that the immigration restrictionists will not listen to arguments, or consider the earnest research made concerning the immigration question. They have a definite pre-established opinion that shifts the blame on the immigrants for all ills and misfortunes connected with the economic conditions of the country.</p>
   <p>They, the newcomers, strangers, oust native-born from their economic situation, and lower the standard of living for the masses. Not so long ago we heard these arguments used at the convention of the American Federation of Labor, the greatest workers organization in the United States.</p>
   <p>In agreement with this, a resolution was passed against the entrance of Asiatics and for the further restrictions of European influx.</p>
   <p>Such an organization exercises a strong influence in the politics of the country, and we now hear their resolutions echoed in the debates of the House Committee on Immigration.</p>
   <p>The committee again presses the issue to adopt the bill of the "Literacy Test," which means that each newcomer be able to read and write. Around this point centers the main debates. We cannot as yet foretell its results.</p>
   
   <p>It will be well to remember also the amendment that has already been passed by the committee in which the Asiatic is barred from the country.</p>
   <p>Under the general term of "Asiatic" are meant the Japanese, Chinese and Hindus. With such a definite decision we sharpen the hostility that fosters a mighty historical foe. We sow kernels of bitter hatred in hundreds of millions of hearts. At some future time will we reap with bloody tears the fruit of this unfriendly seed, which is being sown at present with happy song and trumpet sound.</p>
   <p>The restrictions will not answer the economic question of local life. They can only, for the time being befuddle the mind.</p>
   <p>But, in time the truth will appear to show that the fault does not lie with the stranger.</p>
