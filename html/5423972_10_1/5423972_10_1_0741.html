   <p>The inspiration of the late Rabbi Behr Manischewitz's teachings has guided the Manischewitz Foundation in the perpetuation of its most treasured legacy, the heritage of Hebrew ethics. It has been the particular purpose of the Manischewitz Foundation to encourage the wide dissemination of traditional Jewish teachings. Toward this end the Foundation has sought to bring recognition to distinguished achievements, which reflect honor and glory on its people.</p>
   <p>The Manischewitz Plaque is one of the instruments through which such recognition is made for conspicuous service to the Jewish community. It is manifestly fitting therefore, that the Manischewitz Fine Arts award should be presented to Isaac Van Grove for his imaginative conception of Israel's contributions to the culture of the world - the pageant, "The Romance of a People."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>It is at once a saga of the people eternal and a masterful interpretation of the indomitable spirit which has been its motivating force.</p>
   <p>In this, the very essence of the culture that is Israel, Isaac Van Grove has blended a symphony of color and musical rhythm, and has infused it with the spirit of a living entity - thereby focusing widespread interest on Hebrew lore and enriching it immensurably.</p>
