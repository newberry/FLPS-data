   <p>In 1874, when he was seventeen years of age, he entered the bank of his father, and three years later, he undertook the management of his father's large business.</p>
   <p>He retired from the banking business several years ago, to devote his entire attention to his real estate interests. He is one of the large real estate owners and operators in Chicago, and has handled successfully many important transactions both in downtown and suburban properties.
