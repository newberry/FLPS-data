   <p>The publication in the Courier last Thursday, June first, of the letter of General Obregon to Mr. Paul Rothenberg of Chicago, has aroused a lively discussion in the whole Jewish-American press and in the Jewish political circles of New York. The Jewish newspapers of New York and Philadelphia responded immediately with editorials and special articles about that important document. It would seem that as though by agreement beforehand, they began to demand that the movement, which will arise as a result of the proposal of the Mexican government, should have its headquarters in New York. They propose the Jewish Congress as the proper agency to take over the leadership of the movement and its organization. The organizational committee of the Jewish Congress called a meeting in a hurry and adopted a resolution to appoint a committee to devote itself to the work which will arise as a result of General Obregon's proposal to the Jewish people.</p>
   
   <p>In short: The Jewish press and the Jewish civic workers of New York became very busy. They want to begin to work immediately and to take over the entire campaign. Stress is laid upon taking over the campaign--controlling the whole campaign. The newspaper Day seeks to prove that the work must be taken from the hands of the Chicago civic workers and turned over to the New York civic workers. The Jewish World of Philadelphia makes the same demand.</p>
   <p>The Chicago civic workers' answer is: Wait a while! We will not permit a clique of New York politicians who represent nobody but themselves to take over the campaign; the leaders of all of American Jewry who are to be found in every Jewish community in America, must and will take over the work.</p>
   <p>It is not the American Jewish Congress, which is a minor society with a big name, nor the Hias [Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society], nor the clowns of East Broadway that will be invited to take over the work, but [rather] all the American Jews because those who have led the work, at their own cost up to now, are sufficiently wise to understand that such a task can be solved only by the best forces of America Jewry. The best forces of American Jewry are not to be found in New York. The greatest American-Jewish philanthropist is not to be found in New York. New York only talks a great deal, New York is busy playing politics but in the "country," they act; the country has a serious attitude toward Jewish affairs.</p>
   <p>The idea of Jewish colonization in Mexico originated in Chicago. It was a Chicagoan who undertook, at his own expense, to study the plan, investigate the possibilities, and receive a concession from the Mexican government. Should the Chicago Jews now hasten and say to the politicians in New York: "Take over the campaign and control it; we will stand aside."</p>
   <p>The New York Jews are great simpletons if they believe that the Chicago Jews do not know what New York is and who the New York civic workers are. Chicagoans are very well aware of what the New Yorkers can accomplish. Chicago had to send Mr. Loeb to the New York Jews to remind them to do their duty at the time the relief campaign took place in New York. When the relief organization needed a campaign manager, it had to go to Detroit and invite Mr. David Brown to take over the job. When something fine and productive in Jewish life in America has to be done, they look for a man outside of New York to do it. A Chicago Jew, Julius Rosenwald, gave the first million dollars for relief. A Chicago Jew, Jacob Billikof, was the first relief campaign director.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Jews, considering all this, will surely be in a hurry to turn over, at this time, a movement which they have created and organized to New York speech makers, idlers, and politicians. Chicago Jews are not such fools. New York has five times as many Jews as Chicago but the chief Jewish city in America is not New York but Chicago because Chicago is the most important philanthropic center and because the Jewish civic workers of Chicago are more serious, more devoted, more honest--a thousand times more honest--than the New Yorkers and a thousand times more capable than the New Yorkers.</p>
   <p>Chicago does not want to monopolize everything. Chicago has always co-operated with all of American Jewry and will do so in the present case. Chicago does not recognize and does not appreciate the leadership of New York and it will not, therefore, be in a hurry to turn over the Jewish colonization campaign in Mexico to the speech makers and politicians of New York. Chicago can take care of its own affairs, as far as leadership is concerned. Chicago will first do the preliminary work and will do it alone, without the aid of New York. Then, when everything is ready--legally and constitutionally--Chicago will put the task before the leaders of all of American Jewry, who are to be found throughout the United States, and not only in New York.</p>
   <p>This is what Chicago must say to New York. New York may adopt resolutions, appoint committees, but the preliminary work will be done in Chicago and by Chicago Jews. The New York Jews, as well as all the Jews of America, will be invited, when the proper time comes, to co-operate but not to lead or to boss.</p>
