   <p>Last night the Jewish journalists and literati of Chicago bade farewell to a colleague whom they respected and thought highly of. Mr. Morris Indritz is well known to the readers of the Courier for his work as a journalist. Mr. Indritz not only is a very able journalist, but he also has a certain poetic talent, which is expressed in his beautiful narratives of Chasidic life. Futhermore, Mr. Indritz has taken an interest in Jewish social work, and for a number of years has been active in the Jewish community of Chicago. With his great talent and devotion, he served the best interests of the Chicago Jewry, and his departure from Chicago is certainly a loss not only to the Jewish journalists but also to the Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>I hope that in Los Angeles, where he intends to settle, he will find a field for fruitful work, and will have an opportunity to develop his journalistic and literary talent.</p>
