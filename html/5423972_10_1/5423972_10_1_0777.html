   <p>Benedict Schlossman, one of our oldest and most respected citizens, died March 3, aged 82 years. He was born in Steinhard, Bavaria, July 1, 1817, and came to America in 1839. His first work was carrying a pack, and peddling through the Indian reservations in New York State. He moved to Chicago in 1848, and was elected president of Kehillath Anshe Maario Temple in 1859. Twenty-six members seceded from K. A. M. Congregation and formed a new organization under the name of Sinai Congregation. Of this congregation, Benedict Schlossman was the first president. He was prominent in the early history of Chicago, ever to the front in its charitable and social functions. He was president of the old "Cordia Club," and charter member of the Standard Club. He was married to Sarah A. Naylor in 1844, whose parents were of the Christian faith. She became a Jewess, the same year, through a Rabbi in Cincinnati.</p>
   <p>The funeral was held from the residence of his son, Joseph B. Schlossman, 3652 Calumet Ave; Dr. Emil G. Hirsch officiating.</p>
