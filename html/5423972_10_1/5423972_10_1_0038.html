   <p>The Immigration Bill, which proposes to close the doors of our country to new immigrants, has received another blow. This time the blow was given by the Democratic Senators, who at their caucus earlier this week decided to cast aside all division of opinion until the next session of Congress.</p>
   <p>The Immigration Bill, which was drawn up by Congressman Burnett, and which has gained favor in the eyes of so many others except our Jews, has already been passed by the House of Representatives, and was awaiting the approval of the Senate and the signature of the President. The enemies of the immigrants were overwhelmed with joy upon this victory, and had predicted that the Immigration Bill would be made into a law before Congress adjourned this session. Drunk with victory, they boasted that on their side were such labor organizations as the American Federation of Labor, and also such leaders of the Socialist Party as Charles Edward Russell. Thus they endeavored to show that this is a movement which takes its rise directly from the necessities and demands of the wide masses. This, however, is not true, and evidently the Senate realizes that the motives of the Immigration Bill are not entirely honest. Therefore, it is unnecessary to conduct any further investigations and inquiries on it--on the source from which it flows and the aim it has in view. For this reason, the Senate is in no hurry to act upon it.</p>
   <p>The Immigration Bill, which assumes a patriotic countenance purporting to react to the benefit of the American people, is from the point of view of our higher industrial standard of living definitely against the interests of the further industrial development of our country. The chief argument presented by the foes of the immigrants is that the immigrants in our country come from the lowest strata of society and therefore their standard of living is very low. As a result, they work for low wages, thereby jeopardizing the standard of living of our native workers. Apparently this was a good argument to attract the various labor organizations to their prejudices. One who delves deeper into the problem, however, can see that the limitations imposed on immigration will not improve the lot of the American workers, but on the contrary they will in time make it worse.</p>
   <p>In this country there are many small industries which were started by workers, i. e., by such workers who saved hard-earned money and entered business for themselves. In this manner small industries grow into larger ones, until these same or other workers are paid on the proper scale. If, however, there were no cheap labor, the smaller industries could not exist and consequently could not develop into larger industries and thereby pay the worker a fair wage.</p>
   <p>This would also result in completely undermining the small businessman and the middleman, and the big capitalists--the powerful trusts against whom the labor organizations carry on a struggle--would become the sole rulers of our industry and commerce, making the whole country subservient to them. We can conjure up a vision that if everything should fall into their hands, we would then be left to their mercy. Wages would be cut at the will of the big capitalists, and no person with small means would have the opportunity to begin any business of his own. Consequently, our industries would remain remote from us.</p>
   <p>The foes of immigration would have the American worker believe that the prosperity he is now enjoying is to be attributed to the fact that fewer immigrants from war-ridden countries are now coming to our shores. It is true that our land is now richer than it was heretofore, and that we sell more of our commodities to foreign nations than we buy; but the reason for this can be attributed to nothing other than war. Deducting the commodities sold to the Allies and to our neighboring nations, the total of our trade in 1915 amounted to no more than $303,000,000, whereas the total of our trade in 1913 amounted to $692,000,000. From this it is to be inferred that if we exclude the war supplies we have sold, we have lost nearly $400,000,000.</p>
   <p>From these figures we can clearly see that every dollar that we have earned from foreign commerce is due to nothing other than the war. It will therefore be propitious for this country if the Immigration Bill is not made into a law. The Senate's postponing it until next session provides a basis for good hopes that the bill will be defeated.</p>
