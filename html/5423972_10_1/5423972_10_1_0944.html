   <p>The sudden death of Dr. George Sultan, who for many years was a very popular figure among the Jews of Chicago, came as a thunderbolt to his friends and acquaintances. Dr. Sultan was not only an active and intelligent Jew, he was also a good man. He was beloved by everyone who knew him. The Zionist organization and the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] have lost an ardent and devoted worker. He was active in behalf of the Keren Hayesod. The lodge which bears his name was the first of the fraternal organizations in Chicago to give a considerable sum of money for the Keren Hayesod. He was very active in all Jewish movements, and, considering his circumstances, he accomplished a great deal. For many years, he was the second Grand Master of the Independent Order B'nai Abraham, and the recognized leader of the Jewish fraternal organizations in Chicago. His cheerful nature made him deeply beloved and his death is a tremendous loss to Chicago Jewry.</p>
