   <p>Reformed and orthodox Jews in all parts of the world to-day will join in commemorating by prayer and fasting and special services in synagogue and temple the slaughter of 15,000 and maiming of 100,000 Jews in the recent massacres in Russia. In the United States the observance of the memorial day will follow a form prescribed by the central conference of American rabbis. In many respects it will be the service and prayers for the dead prescribed more than 4,000 years ago. It will include the intoning by the cantors of the 44th Psalm and the 5th chapter of the Lamentations of Jeremiah and the prayers repeated at Yom Kippur.</p>
