   <p>Funeral services for Dr. Theodore B. Sachs were held on April 5 at Naperville, Illinois. He was born in Russia and arrived in America at the age of twenty-one. He obtained work in a clothing factory and attended the University of Illinois, part time.</p>
   <p>After graduating in 1895, Dr. Sachs became house physician at Michael Reese Hospital. From 1900 he devoted himself entirely to the cure of tuberculosis. He was a member of the board of trustees of the municipal tuberculosis sanitarium from its inception. It was this first board which adopted the plans and started the construction of the building. Dr. Sachs practically gave up his practice in order to devote all of his time to getting the sanitarium under way. He was reappointed to the board in 1911 by Mayor Harrison and later again by Mayor Thompson.</p>
