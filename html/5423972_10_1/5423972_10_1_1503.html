   <p>Gustav Eliel, one of Chicago's oldest Jewish residents, passed away on Mar. 10th. He was born in Germany and migrated to America in 1855, settling in Chicago in 1865. He was engaged in the tanning business from 1865 to 1880.</p>
   <p>The fortunes of his firm were wrecked by the fire of '71 and by another conflagration which destroyed his plant in 1880. He was left penniless, but, despite his advanced age, he began the struggle anew. As an insurance solicitor, he was highly successful. He was associated with the insurance firm of R. A. Waller and Co. until his death. Mr. Eliel had been twice elected president of Sinai.</p>
