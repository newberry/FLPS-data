   <p>"American Zionists are to assemble in Chicago so that they may accept their share [of the responsibility] for the establishment, or rather the re-establishment, of a homeland for the Jews. The cause to which they have given their sympathy and their support is not purely religious nor Jewish; it is of grave international political moment. For the Jews the restoration in Palestine has a spiritual significance which it cannot have for non-Jews, but for the world it has a profound political importance which cannot be estimated at its true value. Jerusalem hereafter will be more than a place of pilgrimage for Jew and Christian. It will be that, but it will also be something else. With the fulfillment of the Zionist hopes, it will become, so to speak, a sacred city of refuge for the oppressed.</p>
   <p>"Palestine, as a free state, will be a stronger barrier against the oppression of Jews everywhere, than any frail international guarantees can be. In this sense, we shall witness the end of the long centuries of the Diaspora and the <span class="page-break">\2</span>agony of oppression to which it gave rise.</p>
