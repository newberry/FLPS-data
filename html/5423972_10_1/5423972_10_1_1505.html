   <p>The passing of Dankmar Adler cast a gloom over the entire community. In all circles he was honored for his integrity, high ideals, and his staunch attachment to Judaism. Mr. Adler was one of the pioneer architects of Chicago and ranked among the foremost of his profession in the country.</p>
   <p>He was born in Saxe-Weimar in 1844. In 1859, after his arrival in America, he began the study of architecture in Detroit. Two years later he came to Chicago. When the war broke out, Mr. Adler enlisted in Battery M, First Illinois, and served from August 1862 to the close of the rebellion.</p>
   <p>In January, 1871, he formed a partnership with Edward Burling in time to take the contracts for planning the great buildings that succeeded the fire. Among these monuments to his ability are the First National Bank, Sinai Temple, K. A. M. Temple, Zion Temple, the Auditorium, Chicago Stock Exchange, the Tribune Bldg., St. James Church, Borden Block, Marine Bank, and the Unity Bldg. Outside of Chicago his principal work was the designs for the post-office and the Dooley Block of Salt Lake City, and the big Opera House in Pueblo, Colo., one of the handsomest buildings of the West. He also drew the plans for the Transportation Bldg. of the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Separating from Mr. Burling in 1879, Mr. Adler was engaged in such work as building Central Music Hall and arranging the Exposition Building for the May festival in 1880-82 and for the Republican and Democratic Conventions of 1884. In 1882 he formed a partnership with Louis H. Sullivan and for years the firm of Adler and Sullivan had first rank throughout the country. They reconstructed Hooley's Theater, erected the Hammond Library, and the Troescher Bldgs., and arranged fhe Exposition Building for the Grand Opera festival of 1885.</p>
   <p>Dankmar Adler was the son of the late Rabbi Liebman Adler and was a leading contributor to Jewish and other charities. He was a member of Isaiah and Anshai Maariv Congregations, a director of the United Hebrew Charities, and of the Standard, and Union League Clubs. At various times he had been president of the Western Association of Architects, the Board of Examining Architects of Illinois, and the Board of Architects of the World's Fair, and secretary of the American Institute of Architects. Throughout his career, he was a leader in all movements to advance the interests and elevate the standards of his profession.</p>
