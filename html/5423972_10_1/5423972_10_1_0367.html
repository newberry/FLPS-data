   <p>The Lithuanians in the city of Chicago, a quiet and law-abiding group of people, though more than one hundred thousand in number, are planning a demonstration to be held on Sunday, the eve of the election. The purpose of the demonstration is to protest against the Polish atrocities in Lithuania, and against the attempt of the Polish imperialists to grab Lithuanian territory and to annex Lithuanian provinces to a Greater Poland. The Lithuanians in Chicago, as well as the Lithuanians all over the country, are anxious to help their brethren abroad and free them from the Polish yoke and regain their national liberty. The Lithuanians are as entitled to national self-determination as the other peoples in Eastern Europe. The Lithuanians are the only people in Eastern Europe who have not abused their national independence for imperialistic purposes. The Lithuanians are the only people in Europe who grant the Jews full emancipation, and who treat the other minorities with fairness and justness.</p>

   <p>If the Poles have done everything in their power to make the life of the three million Jews in Poland unbearable, the Lithuanians have done everything to make the life of their Jewish citizens as pleasant as possible. The Lithuanians are as much patriotically inclined as the Poles, but in contradistinction to the Poles they--the Lithuanians--are not patrioteering and are not imbued with the feeling of chauvinism. They are a law-abiding, sensible, and peace-loving people, and they are certainly entitled to their national independence.</p>
   <p>We have already pointed out the importance of Lithuanian independence from a Jewish point of view, and we need not dwell on the subject any further. The fate of our people in Eastern Europe is indissolubly connected with the fate of the Lithuanians. If Lithuania is going to be obliterated and to disappear from among the nations of the earth, entire Eastern European Jewry is doomed, and if Lithuania is going to survive, Eastern European Jewry will survive [also]. Every intelligent Jew must understand the importance of an independent Lithuania for our people.</p>

   <p>However, the Jews in this country do not understand as yet that if the Lithuanians and the Jews have a common interest abroad, the American Jews are in duty bound to make common cause with the Lithuanians against the Polish robberies, and help the Lithuanians in every possible manner, with the view to arousing the American people against Polish imperialism and pogrom rule. If the Lithuanians organize a demonstration against the Polish robbers, the Jews should join such a demonstration. Besides, thousands of Lithuanian Jews in the city of Chicago are much concerned with the welfare and safety of their relatives in Lithuania. Their interests are identical with those of the Lithuanians. Both have to fight for a common cause--for the safety of their brethren abroad. It is, therefore, imperative that the Chicago Jews of Lithuanian origin make common cause with the Lithuanians in the city of Chicago, and in other places, and participate in the protest movement.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians are a respectable people, and though their friends may not be numerous, they have practically no enemies because they are an amiable and peace-loving people. The Poles may have a great many friends, but also a great <span class="page-break">\4</span>many enemies, especially among those who know Poland. As long as the Jews continued to protest against Polish pogroms, against Polish outrages, all anti-Semites, reactionaries, imperialists, and representatives of the White Terror, tried to belittle the significance of the Jewish protest, or they accused the Jews of being Bolsheviks and enemies of an independent Poland. A Lithuanian protest demonstration against Polish barbarity, must be impressive and must be effective, because while the number of our enemies everywhere is legion, the Lithuanians have no enemies; and a joint Lithuanian-Jewish protest, if properly arranged and properly organized, will go very far to impress the public and arouse its feeling of justice.</p>
   <p>The Poles cannot possibly argue that the Lithuanians are Bolsheviks for there aren't any in Lithuania, while there are a number of them in Poland. And the Poles cannot argue that the Lithuanians were eager to destroy the independence of Poland, for what the Lithuanians ask for is to be left alone and not be subjugated by the Poles. They do not lay any claims on Polish territory.</p>

   <p>Governor Cox, the Democratic nominee for president, said recently in an interview with the editor of this paper that if Poland is entitled to independence, Lithuania is entitled to it too, and made it clear that if elected president, he will certainly lose no time in recognizing Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Millions of American citizens, who are acquainted with the situation in Europe, share the view of Governor Cox.</p>
   <p>However, while the Poles are masters of propaganda and intrigue, the Lithuanians, being a quiet and peace-loving people, are not busy with propaganda, and people in America know little about Lithuania and its fight for freedom.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian demonstration, as planned in Chicago, will help very much to make the people of the United States acquainted with the cause of Lithuania, and will help to check and to make an end to the Polish policy of robbery and imperialism. We suggest that the Jews in Chicago participate in the Lithuanian demonstration because the Lithuanian cause is also the Jewish cause.</p>
