   <p>Rabbi A. R. Levy of Congregation B'nai Abraham left last Tuesday with a number of Jewish families for Georgia. These families are to locate as farmers on a tract of land secured for that purpose. The tract of land consists of more than 32,000 acres and is sufficiently large to give homes to many families. It is hoped that a large number of Jews who now live in the congested quarters of our city will avail themselves of the opportunity to settle on this land.</p>
   <p>This undertaking in Southern Georgia is by far the greatest ever attempted in the line of making Jewish farmers with one exception, that of the Baron De Hirsch in the Argentine. The work will require close attention and Rabbi Levy who has been most active in the cause will be absent from the city the greater part of the year.</p>
