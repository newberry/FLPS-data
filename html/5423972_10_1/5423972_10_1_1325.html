   <p>Emanuel Mandel, first vice-president of Mandel Bros., died Thursday, Sept. 3. In 1851 he came to Chicago with his mother and three brothers. His first employment was with the firm of John Parmelee, a manufacturer of silk hats. He left this place to become a bundle boy in the dry goods store of Ross and Foster, where he gained his first knowledge of the dry goods business.</p>
   <p>He soon became a clerk, and his ability and faithfulness were rewarded. He was taken into partnership by Simon Klein in the old Clark Street dry goods house. Later Mr. Mandel bought out Mr. Klein's interest and went into partnership with his brothers. This was the beginning of the firm of Mandel Bros. At the age of 16 Emanuel became manager of the store and held this position until the fire of 1871, which swept away the accumulation of years. Immediately after the fire, he opened a temporary store at Michigan Ave. and Twenty-second street. In 1874 the firm moved to State and Washington Streets, and then to the present location at State and Madison.</p>
