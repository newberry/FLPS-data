   <p>Mr. Sam Smolhoizen, 8459 Burley Avenue, received a letter from his brother in Krakoi, who tells him the sad news of the death of his father at the hands of pogrom makers. His mother, who witnessed it, died as a result of great grief.</p>
   <p>Polish pogrom-makers, the letter states, robbed their parents and other victims of everything they owned. This letter, written in Yiddish with German characters, is the best proof of the Polish persecutions.</p>
