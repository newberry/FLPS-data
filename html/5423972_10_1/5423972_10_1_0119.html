   <p>The Chicago rabbis, at their last meeting, determined to take a practical part in the colonization of Palestine. They organized the society Ga'uloth Ha'oretz for the purpose of buying land in Palestine, which shall enable Jewish colonists to settle there.</p>
   <p>The rabbis who are organized for this purpose are as follows: Ezriel Epstein, Ephraim Epstein, Levinson, Silber, Israelson, Cardon, Budzinsky, Shach, Marcus, Harrison, Fisher, Zeleznik, Rubinstein, Burnson, Mishkin and Rosenblum. A committee consisting of the Rabbis Ephraim Epstein, Levinson, Silber, Israelson and Cardon, was appointed to provide a constitution and bylaws as to how the society shall be governed.</p>
   <p>The local rabbis are cooperating with the rabbis of Palestine and the plan of the Ga'uloth Ha'oretz will be drawn up according to the proposition of Rabbi Isaac Cook, chief rabbi of Palestine.</p>
