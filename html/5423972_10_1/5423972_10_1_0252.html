   <p>One hundred and fifty delegates gathered for a conference at the Sherman Hotel. The five-year plan to purchase land in Palestine was suggested, at a conference held in Washington, D.C., by Mr. Aussishkin, Zionist leader of the National Fund in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Since then many cities in the United States have already adopted this plan.</p>
   <p>The city of Chicago also accepted this plan yesterday evening. A league was organized who pledged themselves to procure a huge sum of money, about one hundred thousand dollars, in a period of five years.</p>
   <p>That means that the league will be obligated to pay twenty-five thousand dollars yearly in order to purchase land. This land will be called Chicago Settlement.</p>
