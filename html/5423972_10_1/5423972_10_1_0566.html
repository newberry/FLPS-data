   <p>The parade of the Legionnaires of the Jewish Battalion yesterday in the neighborhood of Douglas Park was very beautiful and impressive. Almost a thousand persons took part in it, despite the fact that it ended in the pavilion of Douglas Park, and not in the Hebrew Institute as planned at first.</p>
   <p>The parade started at the corner of Twelfth and Albany, marched through the main streets of this Jewish neighborhood, then returned to the same spot. From there the glorious demonstration marched into Douglas Park. Throughout the line of march of the Legionnaires, hundreds of men and women joined the parade, cheering the heroes of the Jewish Battalion enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>In front, marched the Police....directly behind them were three Legionnaires bearing the Jewish, American and British Flags. Seventy Legionnaires followed in close ranks; then came the Jewish Daughters of the Red Shield of David, followed by great masses of Jews.</p>
   <p>The Marks Nathan Orphanage Band, the Bag Pipe Band of the British Army and the Boy Scout Band played the National Anthems.</p>
   <p>When the parade entered Douglas Park, pictures of the Legionnaires were taken especially for the Courier by the well known photographer, Mr. D. Bloom, of the De Haven Studio, 144 So. Wabash Avenue.</p>
   <p>From the steps of the pavilion in the Park, local Zionist leaders and representatives of "Poale Zion" addressed the Legionnaires.</p>
   <p>Mr. Max Shulman opened the open-air meeting with a few very appropriate words. Cordial speeches were made also by Dr. Marcus, Judge Hugo Pass, Lieutenant Grant of the British Canadian Recruiting Mission in Chicago and some Legionnaires.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Harry Weiner, thirty years old, of 1214 West 14th Street, in response to the inspiring speeches, enlisted at once in the Jewish Battalion, and was vociferously greeted for his splendid act.</p>
   <p>The audience sang "America" and "Hatikvah", then the Parade disbanded.</p>
   <p>The Legionnaires are leaving at 5 P. M. to-day for Canada on the Illinois Central Train. They will meet at the British Recruiting Mission on Adams Street, from which place they will march to the depot in a body.</p>
   <p>Mr. Max Shulman, president of the Federated Zionist Societies of the Middle West, who has done a lot of good work for the Legionnaires, also provided them with food.</p>
   <p>Every Legionnaire leaving for Canada today will receive a pretty box with tasty sandwiches and fruit. Mr. Sam Ginsburg and Mr. P. Rubin will distribute the lunch boxes to the heroes of Zion.</p>
   
   <p>The trip from here to Camp Windsor will last more than three days, and the government merely furnished the bare necessities. Therefore Mr. Shulman contacted the Messrs. Solomon Levin, Whitenberg, Goldenberg, Rofstein, Belson and the Levin Bros. and obtained from them meats, bread, fruit, napkins and boxes. All these articles were delivered to the home of Dr. Celia Davis, where the Red Shield of David girls prepared the sandwiches and packed them in boxes.</p>
