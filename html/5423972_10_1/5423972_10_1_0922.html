   <p>The last will of the Chicago attorney, Max Pam, who was called by death in New York on September 14, has just been submitted to the Probate Court. It disposes of a fortune totalling $2,405,000. About a tenth of this amount was designated for charitable purposes.</p>
   <p>Judge Hugo Pam of our Superior Court, Harry Boyd Hurd, and two brothers-in-law of the deceased, Walter Blumenthal and Josep A. Bear, were made trustees. They are enjoined in the will to pay twelve hundred dollars a month for the next five years to Judge Pam and to each of his three sisters. In addition, the latter four people will each immediately receive a bequest of fifty thousand dollars. In the course of five years, they will have distributed the entire fortune among themselves to an approximately even extent.</p>
