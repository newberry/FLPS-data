   <p>The brilliant career of Professor Heinrich Cohn, a member of the faculty of Northwestern University was ended by death yesterday. He was stricken two weeks ago, but to all appearances he made such rapid progress toward recovery that even his physician was optimistic about his regaining perfect health. But it was not to be. Northwestern University as well as the German-speaking people, have suffered a great loss, through the death of this illustrious pedagogue. Professor Cohn was born in Breslau in the year 1847. He came to the United States when still a child. He entered Columbia College (now Columbia University) in New York, from which he received his degree, Master of Arts, in 1870.</p>
   
   <p>Before leaving for Germany, to continue his studies there, he devoted one year to teaching at the School of Mines. In Germany, he entered Berlin University for the study of Germanics, history and philosophy. After returning to the United States three years later, he taught in New York and Boston. In 1876 he accepted the professorship of the summer school of Amherst College. He met with success in lecturing at the Chautauqua University summer term. How much the German department of the Chautauqua owes him, is so well known, that we refrain from repeating it here. He was also for a short period, principal of one of Chicago's schools for languages. While functioning in this capacity, he accepted in 1893 the offer of a position as assistant professor of the German department of Northwestern University in Evanston as such, and as an organizer of extraordinary talent, he proved invaluable to the university.</p>
   
   <p>He was the founder of the German Society and the inspiration of the German Literary Society, both of Evanston. It is to his credit, that these two organizations enjoy the highest esteem among all the German societies in regard to American universities.</p>
   <p>It is also to his credit, that the Germania and the Swiss male chorus, were occasionally invited by Northwestern University to participate in its music festivals. Of course, it would be almost needless to mention that, through his recommendation, only the very finest and best of German speakers were invited to render their services and participate in those "scientific evenings" arranged by student societies. He was also directly responsible for the enlargement of the German section of the university's library and, just before his fatal illness, he spoke of plans to erect a German clubhouse on the university's campus. Heinrich Cohn possessed a high grade of idealism and a deeply seated responsibility for anything he undertook. He disregarded the call of nature for necessary rest. His strength thus sapped, he fell and easy prey to disease. During Northwestern University's summer vacation, he taught at the Chautauqua University. In addition, he gave his services to the Sinai Congregation Sunday School.</p>
   <p>President Henry Wade Rogers of Northwestern University, gave out the following statement:</p>
   <p>"With the passing of Professor Cohn, this university has lost one of its most beloved and hardest working teachers. I, myself, was an ardent admirer of his wonderful enthusiasm and the energy he constantly displayed. Aside from these, he possessed many other splendid qualities. When coming in contact with strangers, he quickly won their love and admiration. Professor Cohn was of robust physique, and, could have lived for many years to come, if he had not devoted every minute of his life to work. Overwork has undermined his health."</p>
   <p>The funeral ceremonies will be held tomorrow in Fisk Hall. In tribute to Professor Cohn, Northwestern University will suspend all classes tomorrow.</p>
