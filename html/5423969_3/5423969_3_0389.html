   <p>The young peoples' society, Ulabrand, which this fall has started a series of free lectures, (a sort of university extension course), has begun activity in another field; it is now busy building up a library consisting mainly of Scandinavian literature.</p>
   <p>The members have donated a considerable number of books, and the library committee expects - within a not-too-long period - to have a library worthy of the society. Mr. Abrahamsen, the president of the National Association, is chairman of the committee, so there is every reason to believe that the work will be as successful as the members of Ulabrand expect.</p>
