   <p>In consolidating the Skandinaven with the Amerika, I take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the subscribers of Skandinaven for the liberal support they have given the paper. I am proud to state that in the short space of six years and eight months, the Skandinaven is the leading Norwegian-Danish paper in this country, which is owing to the increasing energy of both its editors and manager and the liberal support it has received from the public in general. At the time of the great fire in Chicago, I lost nearly all that I had worked for from childhood. But the credit and reputation that the paper had in Chicago enabled me to give the readers a Skandinaven the same week of the fire; and from that time it has increased far beyond my expectations. Now that I have decided that it is best and wisest to unite with the Amerika. I hope you will not be disappointed but on the contrary pleased with this application of the old truth that "in unity there is strength." With the sincere thanks for past favors and hoping for their continuation, I commend the Skandinaven and Amerika to a generous public.</p>
