   <p>The president's report delivered by the vice-president, Mr. Anton A. Mellum was as follows:</p>
   <p>"In the absence of our president who is away in the service of our country, it becomes the duty and privilege of your vice-president to make a brief report of the past year's work. The conditions do not seem to have been favorable for any great increase of membership, but the picnic and the bazaar were even more successful than in previous years. The annual report for 1916 was issued in a different form, and through the influence of our president and Mr. Satrang, together with the publicity committee, brought excellent financial results. It was proposed to issue the Protector as a quarterly periodical, but this plan was abandoned for the present.</p>
   <p>"In spite of the greatly increased cost of all the needs of the Home, our <span class="page-break">2</span>income has proved sufficient. This was due to the diligence of all our efficient and tireless workers in the branches, the Ladies Auxiliary, the Young Ladies' Aid, the matron of the home, the pastor, and the board of directors, but above all I see in our success a sign of diving guidance and favor. This year we have also had an efficient staff of specialists who have generously volunteered their inestinable valuable service to supplement our regular house physician, Dr. Bowes. Of these doctors, Messrs. Svenning Dahl [Dane], Gill, and Waugh were called upon repeatedly during the past year. I also wish to ackowledge the kind spirit in which the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital treated our patients and our Society.</p>
   <p>"Besides the president, Messrs. Osland and Jahnsen are away on government call. Mr. Hofstad has passed to the great beyond. This means that the remaining directors must work all the harder. But the old directors will not fail in this crisis, and the new directors, to be elected for the coming years, I feel sure are with us in this spirit for benevolent service."</p>
