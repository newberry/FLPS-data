   <p>p.2...............A new book, by Prof. Gran, is taking Chicago's Norwegian Colny by storm. The book is on the life of Bjornstjerne Bjornson, the grand old man of Norway, who is referred to as Norway's uncrowned king. Much hitherto unknown about this wonderful character is revealed in this publication and one cannot realize what a truly great man Bjornson really was until one reads this book. The intimate portrayal of the characteristics, ideas and accomplishments of Bjornson will stir the heart of every Norseman.</p>
   <p>The book is entitled "Hovdingen" (The Chief) and although it sells at such a low price (.25c) its educational value is many times that amount. Scandia heartily recommends the reading of this work by all who are interested in obtaining arithmetic knowledge of the world's truly great men.</p>
