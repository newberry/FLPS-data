   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club, through its treasurer, has received from the board of directors of Humboldt Park an offer of free boats on the lagoon next Thursday evening if, in return, the Club will sing while on the lagoon. The Club has decided to accept the offer and expects to be able to arrange for a really attractive program for the improvised concert from the boats. The concert will start at eight o'clock and continue until late in the evening.</p>
   <p>The Glee Club has become revived of late, as it were, after having been in a semicomatose condition for a while. The fact that the Club has been able to repay a considerable debt, contracted long ago, testifies to this revival. In addition,it has a considerable sum in its treasury. The present officers of the Club are: president, Mr. Axel Jensen; secretary, John Neergaard; treasurer, John Frogg.</p>
