   <p>Dr. Carl Sandberg has just published a new book, The Money Trust. The book is well written and interesting. On the title page of the book we read the following: "Not published for profit, but for use. Not copyrighted. No rights reserved. All or parts may be taken. Published by the author."</p>
   <p>This book is a definite contribution to "social literature". It should be read by everyone.</p>
