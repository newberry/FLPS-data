   <p>The "Norge" Ski Club celebrated their 7th anniversary on Saturday Nov. 9th with a banquet, for members and friends. Unlike other mortals, who dread the coming of winter with its snow, cold weather, short days and long nights, the ski boys look forward to a great time at the "Norge" hill at Cary. Good Norwegian food, plentiful and well served combined with enthusiastic reports and speeches served to make the evening one of the most pleasant ever spent by the club.</p>
