   <p>The committee on building plans, elected by the board of directors on orders from the Society, to investigate the advisability of adding another wing to the Hospital, reported that there can be no doubt but that the present building is too small; it ought at least to be doubled in size.</p>
   <p>The committee did not recommend raising the money by increasing the mortgage, but did express their belief, however, that much money could be raised through subscriptions, and that an appeal ought to be made to Norwegians in America to come to the assistance of the Hospital.</p>
   <p>It was reported that the annual bazaar of the Tabitha Hospital will be held at Wicker Park Hall starting Monday, October 29 and continuing till November 3. The committee intends to apply the surplus from the bazaar to payment of the Hospital's floating debt.</p>
