   <p>The Norwegian Singing Association had a dress rehearsal at Schoenhofen's Hall last Monday evening. Almost all the members were present, there being nearly one hundred singers at the rehearsal, and as a result, the instructor, Mr. Emil Bjorn, was very well satisfied. Not only the numbers to be sung during the midsummer festival at Elm Park Grove were studied but also several others of the best songs on the Association's repertoire were rehearsed.</p>
   <p>The president of the Association, Mr. T. Ebert, as well as Mr. Berger Osland and Mr. Emil Bjorn,spoke enthusiastically to the singers. Subsequently, the members marched in procession about the Hall, singing "Ja, vi elsker" (Yes, we love).</p>
   <p>The singers have acquired new white caps with white visors and chin straps, and all those who have the singers symbol--the lyre--were requested to attach this symbol to the front of their caps.</p>

   <p>The committee on arrangements announced that everything is in order for the festival, and expressed the hope that everybody would strive to make the intended festival known to as many as possible, so that Elm Tree Grove may become the gathering place for all Norwegians in Chicago on Sunday.</p>
