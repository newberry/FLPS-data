   <p>There are in Chicago many institutions and charity groups that do much good work in their different fields. One of these is an outstanding society that works nationally and is well known to Scandinavians throughout America. It is the Evangelical Lutheran Home-Finding Society, which is managed by the membership of the Norwegian Synod in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Synod has several Children's Homes. But the Home-Finding Society is different from the others. The Society not only rears children according to Christian standards, but usually places them in Christian homes as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The Society has, in its short existence, placed seventy children in private homes.</p>
   <p>In the home on Byron Street, there are, today, seventeen children.</p>
