   <p>The first bazaar of the sick benefit society of the Bethlehem Church was held in the basement of the church and exceeded every expectation in the success it achieved.</p>
   <p>Early in the morning the committee began its work to get the place in order and to arrange the many articles put on exhibition before the opening of the bazaar at 2 P. M. The place was decorated with flags and flowers, and when everything was fixed up, the impression made on the onlooker was very satisfactory.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon the attendance was fairly good....but in the evening there was a full house....and the sale of articles went with a rush....The bazaar added considerable funds to the treasury of the Society.</p>
