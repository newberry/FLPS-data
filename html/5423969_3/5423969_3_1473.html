   <p>On Thursday afternoon the ladies aid societies from Moreland Congregation and from the Tuesday Club called at our Childrens Home, bringing rich gifts both in form of food, and in cash.</p>
   <p>It is characteristic of these aid societies that they do their good work and keep at it year after year.</p>
