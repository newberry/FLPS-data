   <p>The White Star Burial Society has grown trememdously since its organization. It is a women's group, and we must give the ladies credit for their work in behalf of the Society. The returning president, Kate Mathison, presided at the first meeting of the new year, when the new executive board was installed. The new president is Amelia Borgstrom and the treasurer is Amelia Snartz.</p>
