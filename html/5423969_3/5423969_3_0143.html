   <p>The Dramatic Club of the Bjorgvin Singing Society recently produced a series of plays that are worthy of mention. "Paa Krigsstien" [On the Warpath] is one of the most humorous farces ever produced here in Chicago. "En Lille Datter" (Little Daughter) is an excellent farce by Erik Bogh. Both of these plays have a great number of songs, hence were appropriate plays for the Society.</p>
   <p>Next week the Society will produce "Om Forladelse" (Excuse Me). Everyone of these plays is rather difficult to perform, with their long lines and numerous songs. But the Bjorgvin group did a grand job.</p>
