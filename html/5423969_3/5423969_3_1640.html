   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Bethesda Home was organized January 13, 1907, with twenty-four members. They met at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Hans Baade, 218 N. May St., Chicago. The board of directors of five members were elected: Mr. J. Gunderson, president; Mr. A. Halton, vice-president; Miss Julie Dahle, secretary; Mr. Edward Hanson, financial secretary; Miss Hildur Baade, treasurer. Their motto was (Proverbs 19-17): "He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again." The plan was to erect and maintain a home for old and needy, free housing, light and heat, in this way to show Christian charity among the Norwegian people. On February 10, 1908, a group from Bethel Church joined the association under the name of Bethel Branch. They proved a blessing because they had a heart for the needy. On March 12, 1908, the association changed its name from Haabet <span class="page-break">2</span>Miss Hildur Baade, "Brief History of Bethesda," 30th Anniversary Souvenir ...., pp. 89.</p>
   <p>to Norwegian Lutheran Bethesda Home Association, and under that name the association was incorporated January 30, 1909. The committee in charge of this were Pastor Ellestad, Rygh and Tiller, Mr. B. D. Larsen and Mr. Holt. Shortly after this two lots near Deaconess Hospital were purchased. The association gave Miss Baade an official call as their Field Secretary, on August 17, 1908. On May 13, 1909, the two lots were sold to the Deaconess Hospital and the association bought three other lots in the same block. It is on that property that the old Bethesda Home is built. The cornerstone was laid November 6, 1910. The following July the home was ready and Miss Marie Rigstad, who had been called by the association, took up her work as matron. Nineteen aged and needy entered the Home. In a short while the Home became too small and an addition was built and dedicated in 1914, which could accommodate thirty-five men and women. Again our quarters became too small, so in 1919 the association began looking for a new site and the lots where the present home stands were bought.</p>

   <p>Before starting the building we had a campaign which brought in approximately $50,000 in cash and subscriptions, and shortly afterwards we had a legacy from William P. Tuttle of $50,000. The present building was started in the fall of 1924. The cornerstone was laid May 3, 1925, increasing our capacity to 70 residents. The cost of the building was $182,400. Up to 1933 none but the destitute could be admitted into the home, since then due to financial conditions we were obliged to take in some with means to help carry the burden, but we still consider the needy.</p>
   <p>We are thankful to God for the work accomplished through the years and give Him praise for it.</p>
