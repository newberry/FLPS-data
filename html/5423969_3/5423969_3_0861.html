   <p>The foot-racer tomorrow night at the West Side Turner Hall will without doubt satisfy the public expectations. The success of the earlier appearances show that our two countrymen, "Vikingen" and "Young America", were indeed masters of their trade.</p>
   <p>There will also be an unusual musical entertainment provided by the Exposition Band Orchestra and after the entertainment, there will be social dancing.</p>
