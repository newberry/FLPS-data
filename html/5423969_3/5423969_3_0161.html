   <p>The Norwegian Theater presented the excellent drama "Naar De Dode Vaagner" [When the Dead Awake] at Scandia Hall last week. Those who are capable of criticizing (this does not include Skandinaven) all agreed that certain things were lacking, especially in the leading roles. We know that the next performance will be improved, and that the actors can do better. The lines will be better remembered hereafter.</p>
