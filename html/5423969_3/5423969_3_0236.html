   <p>The Humboldt Park Parish House was the scene of the celebration of the sixth anniversary of Lodge No. 3 of the I.O.G.T., on February 17th. In spite of the fact that Captain Roald Amundsen was giving his final Chicago lecture at the same time, the I.O.G.T. festival was well-attended.</p>
   <p>A tasty banquet was served in the spacious dining-hall, and speeches, singing, and music contributed to the pleasure of the gala affair. Mr. and Mrs. Fr. Wermskjold entertained with readings and speeches that were well-received.</p>
