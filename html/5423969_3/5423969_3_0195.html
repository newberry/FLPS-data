   <p>Dear Sir: I have been asked so often and by so many different people to answer the criticism made in regard to the Norwegian booth at the Women's World's Fair that, although I feel that the whole matter is simply a "tempest in a teapot," and really not worth taking notice of, yet an explanation might correct some of the factors which seem to have been the cause of all this discussion.</p>
   <p>First of all, I wish to explain the Norwegian Women's Federation's part in the affair. About three months before the Fair opened, one of the business promoters called on me, asking that the Norwegian women take part. Knowing that it would cost our women at least $275 for a space measuring about ten feet square which would mean nothing as a display space, and also knowing from last year's Fair that it was mostly a commercialized enterprise, I told the representative <span class="page-break">\2</span>that the Norwegian women had nothing to sell and that we could not afford to pay that amount of money to exhibit. It would also entail a great deal of work. I thought that this would end the proposal made to us, but about three weeks before the Fair opened we were again invited to take part, this time without cost to our Federation. Some man had generously donated the booth.</p>
   <p>Even then I, personally, was not keen on taking a part, but it went to a vote of our members and the majority voted that we be represented. Mrs. Sandberg was put in charge of the work. We were told by the Fair committee that they wanted women's work of all kinds, ancient and modern. The members of the Norwegian Club exhibit committee were already in full swing, and no one deplored the fact that the two exhibits came at the same time more than they. In fact, I was called up and asked if it would in any way interfere with our exhibit at the Women's World's Fair, and I told them decidedly not, as our booth would be an exhibit of women's work only. Mrs. Carl Sandberg, in the short time at her disposal, did excellent work, and I still insist that the Norwegian booth <span class="page-break">\3</span>was one of the most interesting and instructive booths at the Fair. We never attempted to make it the most beautiful, for to make an eight by ten space--with white-washed half-walls shaped exactly like a horse stall--look beautiful is impossible. But we had on exhibit the most exquisite knitted and crocheted laces over fifty years old, colored embroideries in silks and woolens, and beaded work, some of it a hundred years old. We had beautiful carvings done by women, white needlework of every description which no store in Chicago can duplicate; wonderful hardanger work, and all kinds of genuine women Okle. We also had a hand loom with one of our members demonstrating its use and operation. We had hand-woven linens of a hundred years ago, and hand-women linens of recent fabrication. We had the most beautiful handmade lace in point and Valenciennes patterns made by the Salvation Army women in Norway, and we had embroidered linens made by the girls in the Land-sfengsel [federal prison] at Olso. We also had regulation handmade Norwegian sweaters and mittens that we could have sold by the dozens. We even had every description of homemade buckles, and best of all we had our typically splendid intelligent women in that booth-women who could tell the history of every piece <span class="page-break">\4</span>of work there, and who had audiences constantly admiring Norway's wonderful handwork, both of the past and the present.</p>
   <p>The artist, Emma Gordon, who received the sympathy of Miss Aslau Berger, is too broad-minded a woman to need sympathy; in fact, she hung her pictures her-self, certainly not to great advantage for herself, but she did the best that could be done under the circumstances. Surely the background of the beautiful Okle was better than if they had swung in the open spaces, for we had no walls; and I want to say right now that I wish we had more of the sweet, kind characters that Miss Gordon is. If so, then we would never have had this controversy, Unknown to most of us, she came and offered her services, and not only that, but she stayed with us and relieved the women when they were tired; not one day, but every day, and she deserves our gratitude.</p>
   <p>I cannot understand Miss Berger's assertion that jealousy stalks among the Norwegian people, or that it is typical that we in the Norwegian colony cannot work together. If such is the case, then I have been blind to these facts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>If the Norwegian people were not typically patriotic and self-sacrificing for all that is worth while, then we would never have had the old people's homes and the children's homes, the churches, the hundreds of different societies, the singers, and the athletes. It is work, real work hand in hand, and it is your heart in it that makes all thes things possible. We naturally have a few snobs among the Norwegians like all other nationalities, but we don't take them seriously. We only pity them for what they miss of the real work, real co-operation, and real harmony.</p>
   <p>How would such Seventeenth of May and Leif Ericson and Singing Festivals be possible if we were not working in harmony? Life throughout is a give and take proposition. If we give nothing, we generally receive nothing. Miss Berger also takes occasion to blame the Norwegians (I take it for granted she means the women) for the program. She says their part in it was poor because our numbers were too small. The fact is that we were only allowed eight girls to take part, and these we had; they really were, even if it is hard for <span class="page-break">\6</span>our critics to believe, given credit for being the best in the line.</p>
   <p>The Grieg Singing Society is next attacked. Let me say that first of all it was the American committee that arranged with Grieg to sing. I did not hear them, but I was told they sang well, and that fact seems substantiated since I have had several requests for their address. That the art of song was saved by Mrs. Hammer Moeller is farfetched when Miss Berger says that the lady is the only Norwegian soloist in the city. I could name several. It is true that the Norwegian women had nothing to do with the program, but it did not necessarily mean that the Americans discovered Mrs. Hammer Moeller, because I know they did not. I am not a competent critic, so I will say nothing of the singer except that I think she sang entirely too long.</p>
   <p>Then the Dansarring (Dance Ring) comes in for its share next. Miss Berger says that it was Bedaarende (beautiful, touching). Mrs. Hakstad says it was not. Considering the fact that the American Women's Committee had called our Vice-Consul Wendelboe at the last moment and asked for a dance exhibit, I think <span class="page-break">\7</span>they did splendidly. Their teacher, Mr. Harald Semb, has been away since before Christmas. I will agree that the Evanston dancers are fine, but we should not be blamed because they were not invited.</p>
   <p>If both these ladies will think back, they will remember that it was the Evanston Dansarring that entertained us so splendidly at the Federation Christmas party, but my feelings were not a bit hurt even though two of my own daughters belonged to the Norwegian Club Dansarring. And now to finish, I hope that I may be allowed to offer just a little criticism of my own.</p>
   <p>I feel that Miss Berger's criticism was very broad on all subjects, but I do not believe that anyone should take the opportunity to rush into the public press with an open criticism of something they did not hear or see. I am told that Miss Berger was not in the hall the evening the Norwegian Club Dansarring and Mrs. Hammer Moeller were on the program. If it is a fact that Miss Berger was in Evanston at the time they performed and so neither saw nor heard either one of them, not even over the radio, how is she competent to judge?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>I would not like to have Miss Berger criticize me if she only does it from hearsay, for some serious mistakes can be made that way. It is not leaders we need--those are easily obtained, and Miss Berger herself seems to have constituted herself as one of them--it is wide-awake, broad-minded people we need, people who are just and can think and speak for themselves. Abuse is the easiest thing in the world to give. Not leaders, but co-workers is what we need. When you have been in the work as long as we have, Miss Berger, then you will have learned to give and take and smile through it all. You say the Polish and Hungarians made a better impression on Americans than the Norwegians. I do not agree with you; you are young and have not been with us on all other occasions of foreign exhibits and endeavors.</p>
   <p>I might say for your enlightment that it was the Norwegian women who stood at the top of the list in the Red Cross work through the war period. It was the Norwegians who were ahead in the Liberty Loan drive. It was the Norwegians who stood at the top in the All-American Exposition, in exhibits and athletics, in cooking, and attendance. In the races with other nations we are not, as <span class="page-break">\9</span>you say, behind. There is not a race in America that is more honored and respected than the Norwegian. There is not a nation, barring none, who has given so much to American industry, American culture, American arts, crafts and handiwork, and America has told us so very often; and I assert and dare anyone to dispute it that we Norwegians can hold our heads as high as any race who helps to make America what she is today.</p>
   <p>A little more teamwork we may need once in a while, but I am glad I am among those who are willing to give of themselves all that they can, and to give credit to those who are doing the same. I am looking forward to having Miss Berger among our most active helpers.</p>
