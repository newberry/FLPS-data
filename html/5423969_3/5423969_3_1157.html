   <p>This last item covers several large payments on improvements under way, which will make the hospital an up to date one in every way.</p>
   <p>Lastly Dr. Olsen thanked everyone who had lent a helping hand, both of the hospital and in the society. These "good samaritans" have done a noble deed in helping to care for those less fortunate of our countrymen as well as helping to train and educate young women for the profession of nurses.</p>
