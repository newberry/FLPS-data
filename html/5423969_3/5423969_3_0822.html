   <p>The Norwegian Sharpshooters Society celebrated its tenth anniversary last Sunday with a most successful banquet at Finstad Hall. About fifty members of the Society participated in the celebration. Prizes won during the year were distributed at the banquet. Mr. Peder Olsen functioned as toastmaster and the speech in honor of the Society was delivered by Mr. Lars Johansen, who was introduced by the toastmaster after the latter had welcomed the guests.</p>
   <p>Mr. Johansen gave a survey of the history of the Society from its organization in 1891. He mentioned that a previous attempt had been made to form a Norwegian sharpshooters society in Chicago but the attempt had met with so many difficulties as to the location of a suitable course that it was given up. If the men who formed the Sharpshooters Society in 1891 had realized what difficulties they too would encounter, it is more than possible, the speaker said, that the Society would never have been organized. But organized it was, and after this step had been taken the leaders and the members in general devoted all possible energy to the task of making their plans succeed.</p>
   <p>There was at first an attempt to practice with the German Sharpshooters Society at the course in Kensington; this, however, was soon given up, and then began a long search for a piece of land suited to the purpose. Such a piece of land was finally found in Willow Springs, and a house was built and a course laid out.</p>
   <p>It was soon realized that the Society had been most fortunate in the selection of the shooting course, since the land is of such character that the shooting may be carried on with absolute safety. The house built at the start was destroyed by fire and a new one, constructed of iron, was erected in its place.</p>
   
   <p>In winter the members practiced with air guns on a course within the city. Much time was devoted to practice and the Society had the satisfaction of holding the highest rating at every shooting match in which it participated, each time outdistancing the second-place contestant by a wide margin.</p>
   <p>The speaker referred to the two bowls belonging to the Society; one donated by Alderman Mugler, and at present the prize put up for a shooting match. The other bowl was won by the Society in a shooting match with the Danish Sharpshooters Society in Chicago. The speaker concluded with a toast to the Norwegian Sharpshooters Society, after which an ode to the Society, written for the occasion, was sung.</p>
   <p>The toastmaster then introduced the president of the Society, Mr. Johnson, who explained the rules for practice shooting and for the shooting matches, and then distributed the medals and prizes won.</p>
   
   <p>After the distribution of prizes, Messrs. Helvig and C. Osmundsen sang, and afterwards Mr. Helvig spoke in honor of Norway. The speech in honor of America was given by Mr. Hans Nordahl. Later in the evening Mr. Lars Johansen toasted the Norwegian Sharpshooters Society of Minneapolis, addressing the toast to Mr. Bernhard Hage of that Society, who was present. Mr. Hage made a well worded reply, informing the younger members of the Society that he was one of the founders of the Norwegian Sharpshooters Society in Chicago and had been one of the most active members.</p>
   <p>Later a number of toasts were made...The banquet continued until late in the evening.</p>
