   <p>The following motion, made by H. A. Haugen, was killed by a vote of 380 to 349: "A majority of the board of directors shall be members of congregations belonging to the Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church of America."</p>
   <p>Several of those present at the meeting walked out in protest, claiming the proceeding to be unparliamentary. It was proposed that a meeting be held in Vor Frelsers Kirke [Our Saviors Church] on February 4, at 7:30 P. M.</p>
