   <p>The Tabitha case has been thrown out of Judge Tuley's court. The Judge gave the attorneys thirty days to appeal. The charge against the Sandberg group is "Diversion of Trust"; Judge Tuley declared that the charge, as stated, had not been proved, because he felt that the faction involved had acted in accordance with the purpose of the Tabitha Society as outlined in its constitution.</p>
   <p>The Judge also said that the constitution did not give the church (Synod) the right to make religion the issue at the Hospital. He then discontinued the case "for want of equity".</p>
   <p>The counsel for the Synod made a motion to take the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

   <p>Clarence Darrow voiced the opinion that an appeal was impractical because no decision would be reached in less time than a year.</p>
