   <p>p.1.."Nordlyset", (The Northern Light) Sick Benefit Society, believes in the old Norwegian manner of celebrating the Christmas holidays; starting early and lasting two weeks. They started this Christmas observance on Saturday, Dec. 16th, with a card party, and lunch. Attorney Lasse Grundeland was the speaker of the evening, and several of the members contributed vocal and instrumental numbers. The entire program was so patterned after the old Norse custom that all who attended almost felt that they had had a bit of the real Norway.</p>
