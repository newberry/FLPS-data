   <p>Dr. Holmboe states that his reason for wanting to give the Norwegian Lutheran Synod control of the Tabitha Hospital is that in this manner the Hospital could seek support from the rural residents....in both money contributions and patients.</p>
   <p>The Synod, however, already has two hospitals, one in St. Paul, with two prominent Norwegian doctors....and one in La Crosse, also with two outstanding Norwegian doctors. Is it probable, under these circumstances, that the farmers of the Northwest would be willing to support or send patients to a hospital in Chicago, many hundred miles away, simply to help the Norwegians in Chicago when the latter are unable to take care of themselves?....He who knows the practical and careful farmers in the Northwest does not easily <span class="page-break">2</span>believe that they would undertake such a task. Outside of Chicago the Synod has only one congregation in Illinois, and from that congregation there is not much support to be had.</p>
   <p>It seems to me, therefore, that it is very doubtful if added income is to be expected by ceding the Hospital to the Norwegian Synod. The Synod is also the most stringent Orthodox Norwegian church body in America. Women have no right to vote in its congregations. Women are to keep silent in the meetings, rules the St. Paul congregation, and the Synod holds sternly to this rule.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances, as far as I have been able to discover, the Synod has 175 members in Chicago with the right to vote....The Synod condemns life insurance; it condemns all secret societies and even refuses to bury anyone who was a member of a secret society....It will not accept money raised by....a charity ball. While the Norwegian Home for the Aged, <span class="page-break">3</span>under the Norwegian United Church, has held a fair with a raffle, etc., the Hospital could not have a fair under the Norwegian Synod, but would have to get its money through church concerts.</p>
   <p>Can we believe that the Norwegian Synod, if it attained full authority at the Hospital, would be tolerant toward those not of the Synod?......Knowing as we do that the Synod ministers would not place the cornerstone of the Hospital "in the name of God" because they could not pray together with those who belong to the Norwegian United Church, we somehow marvel at their sudden attack of tolerance.</p>
   <p>Let us keep aloof from all the Synod inventions, and in peace with the Synod members. Let us arrange for one great fair every year as is done by the other institutions and support the Hospital as well as we are able. In this manner we shall soon have our Hospital free from debt.</p>
