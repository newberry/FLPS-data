   <p>Rasmus B. Anderson writes a great deal about Knut Hamsun but tells little about this great writer that can be considered true. We all know that Hamsun lived in Chicago for quite a long time; it was here that he wrote his Novel Sult [Hunger].</p>
   <p>We wish to cite what little there is of value in Anderson's account of Hamsun. In part it is as follows:</p>
   <p>Knud Pedersen worked in a store in Gjovik [Norway], where he spent his spare time writing poetry. He became acquainted with Bjornson, who advised the peasant boy to go to America, believing that he could do better there than in Norway. Rasmus B. Anderson avers that he advised Knud Pedersen to change his name to Knut Hamsun.</p>
   
   <p>In 1883 Knut Hamsun became a sort of chaplain to Christoffer Janson in Minneapolis; he stayed with Janson until 1885, when he became ill and had to be taken to the Norwegian Lutheran Hospital. Kristian Baun, the Danish educator, filled Hamsun's place while Hamsun was ill. After his illness Hamsun returned to Norway.</p>
   <p>Two years later he returned to America and settled in Chicago. Here he drove a horse-car for several years. Hamsun nearly starved to death in Chicago.</p>
