   <p>At 3 P.M. the Scandinavian Singing Societies started their concert in the Festival Hall of the Fair. There were 5,000 people in the hall. The 1,000 singers sang very well. The soloists: Mrs. Sigfred Wolf, Mrs. Signe Hille and Wm. Herold took the public by storm. A fine piano solo was played by Miss Anna Wallins. It was too bad that all in the big hall were not able to hear.</p>
