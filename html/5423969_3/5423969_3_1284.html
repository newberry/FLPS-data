   <p>The bazaar of the Deaconess Society at Wicker Park Hall was conducted by the Bethel congregation on Wednesday evening, and a large crowd was present. Reverend Tiller gave an interesting speech during the evening, and Dr. Crum's vocal solo and Miss Dagmar Anderson's piano solo received much applause. The bazaar exhibits an unusually rich collection of articles, most of which would be especially appropriate for Christmas presents.</p>
   <p>The Deaconess Society has begun the construction of its large hospital at Haddon Avenue and Leavitt Street. It is therefore evident that the Society needs all possible support, and it is to be hoped that the bazaar will fulfill all the expectations of its sponsors....</p>
