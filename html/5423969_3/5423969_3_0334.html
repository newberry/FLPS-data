   <p>The Scandinavian Society at the University of Chicago held its quarterly meeting last Friday. The president, Mr. H. Lofberg, presided. Chief Justice Harry Olsen [Swede], Reverend Tyrrel of the Augustana Synod's Mission, and Mr. Carlton, librarian of the Newberry Library, were the main speakers.</p>
   <p>Justice Harry Olsen spoke at length on the hardships of the Scandinavian immigrant. Reverend Tyrrel spoke on the unity among the Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes. Mr. Carlton gave an analysis of Henrik Ibsen, and stressed the importance of reading his works, especially his dramas.</p>

   <p>"I was prompted to study the Scandinavian languages for one reason only, and that was to be able to read Ibsen and other Scandinavian authors in the original." Mr. Carlton is of the opinion that the literature of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Finland is the root of European culture. He states that Scandinavian literature is even greater than that of Spain, Germany, and France.</p>
