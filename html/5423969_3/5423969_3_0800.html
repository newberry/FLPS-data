   <p>During the years of its existence, the Sleipner sports club has performed valuable service for Norwegians. It is due to Sleipner's efforts that the Skating Sport is known across the country; and it is also largely due to Sleipner that the Norwegians are highly regarded as sportsmen on this side of the Atlantic. The club has never failed to represent the Norwegians in sports competitions, when prospects were fair for improving the standing of the Norwegians, provided the treasury had money for expenses.</p>
