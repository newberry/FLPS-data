   <p>The Norwegian Turn Forening (Athletic Club) won nearly every event at Riverview Park, receiving eight prizes out of ten. The great silver bowl of the meet also went to the Norwegians.</p>
   <p>The outcome of the great athletic meet in Riverview Park may be told in a few words. The Norwegian Turn Forening took practically everything, and what remained was distributed among the rest of the participants. All the leading athletic societies in Illinois and Wisconsin had sent representatives, so that the number of contestants was large, and competition was keen.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Turn Forening sent the only Norwegian delegation, a group of six boys, and one man for competition in the free-for-all, seven contestants all told; and these seven men returned home with eight out of ten prizes and in addition the great silver bowl of the meet. The seven victors are Leif Widness, Nicolay Beck, George Michaelson, Carl Gronberg, Conrad Christensen, Sverre Dietrich, and G. Thorsen.</p>

   <p>The competition was very keen, however. In spite of the fact that two of the Norwegian athletes broke the world record in the hop, skip, and jump and equalled, the world record in high jumping, the Norwegians were merely slightly more than one point in advance of their closest competitors, the Central Turnverein. The following table shows the comparative standing of the leading teams:</p>

   <p>Leif Widness was rated the best man at the meet, and the second best was Nicolay Beck. William Alles, the German who had been so much bragged about, was snowed under, and the prize competitor from the University of Illinois, Mr. Morris, <span class="page-break">\3</span>had to be content with one first prize, in pole vaulting. He jumped 11 feet; G. Thorsen jumped 10.7 feet.</p>
   <p>It was in the hop, skip, and jump that the Norwegians broke the world record, which was 43.1 feet. Leif Widness jumped 45.9 feet, thus breaking the record by 2 feet 8 inches. Nicolay Beck, who was second in this event, broke the record by 7 inches, jumping 43.8 feet.</p>
   <p>In high jumping both Beck and Widness equalled the world record, each jumping 5.9 feet. After casting lots Widness was declared the winner.</p>
   <p>About 170 athletes competed in the meet, and the audience numbered nearly 200,000. After the meet the Norwegians gathered for a little jubilee in their hall on California Avenue. It is hardly necessary to add that the enthusiasm was great. The prizes will be distributed at a banquet to be given at the Norwegian Turn Hall on Saturday, June 29.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian athletes have also won two baseball matches within the last week.</p>
