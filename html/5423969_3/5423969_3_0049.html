   <p>When Professor Colberg resigned from his position as director of the Norwegian Singing Society--after twenty-five years of service--Mr. Christian Nilsson was chosen his successor. Mr. Nilsson's career in the Society can be properly evaluated only by the future. The close co-operation between him and the singers evidenced at the rehearsals promises much, and today the Society will give the public a taste of what may be expected at the concert at Wicker Park Hall.</p>
   <p>One thing is certain: The Norwegian Singing Society, though old in years, is still young in spirit and full of vitality. Throughout its existence the Society has been working to further Norwegian customs, Norwegian singing, and Norwegian music. The Norwegians of Chicago might show their appreciation of this work by gathering in full numbers at the Society's concert, thereby making it clear that the Singing Society is still dear to the hearts of the Norwegians in Chicago.</p>
