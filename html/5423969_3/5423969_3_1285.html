   <p>The Fram Branch of the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital Society held a continuation discussion meeting, last Tuesday evening, concerning the proposals for changes in the Society's constitution. The meeting was held in the Sunday-school rooms of St. Paul's Norwegian Lutheran Church. More than 150 members of the various branches of the Society were present. The president of the Fram Branch, Mr. Thomas H. Kolderup,....was chairman of the meeting. He informed the gathering that Dr. Marie Olsen's proposal for changes in the Society's constitution was the first subject for discussion. [Translator's note: Dr. Olsen proposes that Article 3 of the constitution be changed so as to limit voting power to members from Cook County.]</p>
   <p>Dr. Olsen said that most of the members of the Society reside in Chicago. It is not to be expected that out-of-town people will come to the meetings of the Society in order to vote. There is no objection to support for the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Hospital from people outside of the city, but it did not seem advisable in times like the present, when there is partisan division in the Society, for people from the outside to have the right to vote in the matters at issue. The desire was, she said, to preserve the Hospital free for all church organizations. There is no objection to the organization of branches in the country districts, and it was nice of the ministers of the Norwegian Lutheran Synod to support the Society. The Hospital, however, is a Chicago institution, she said, and it ought to be supported by Chicago people. It might be well, she pointed out, to have support from one church group, but it would be better to have support from all the Norwegians in the city....An institution belonging to the Norwegians in Chicago should be governed by them.</p>
   <p>Reverend O. J. Heimdahl stated that the North Avenue Branch had many out-of-town members who regularly paid their dues, and it was unjust to deprive them of the right to vote....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Dr. Marie Olsen mentioned that....she had seen a Synod minister in Chicago at an annual meeting of the Hospital Society advise the members of his church how to vote; he had even marked the ballots of some of the members. If this could take place in Chicago, what might one expect in regard to members from the country?</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Holmboe regretted the bringing up of such matters [by Dr. M. Olsen]; he said that the discussion should be confined to relevant issues. Mrs. Halvorsen stated that she was a member of the nominations committee six years ago. At that time she was urged by Synod ministers to see to it that no minister became a member of the board of directors. She followed their urgings, and Reverend [H. B.]Kildahl, as a result, was not elected. But the subsequent result of this action was that four hundred members withdrew from the Society. One of the Synod ministers had said to her on the occasion in question: "We must be sly as snakes and simple-minded as doves to push this matter through." The speaker urged the members to consider the question carefully before voting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>As no one else claimed the floor, the proposal by Dr. Karl F. M. Sandberg for changes in the constitution of the Tabitha Hospital Society was declared the order of the day. His proposals are as follows: (1) That Paragraph 2 of Article II be eliminated; (2) that Article XIII be eliminated;</p>
   <p>These Articles at present read as follows:</p>
   <p>Article II</p>
   <p>Paragraph 1. The purpose of this Society is to construct, maintain, and conduct a hospital, a training school for nurses, and a home for worthy persons in need, for aged people, and for others who are willing to pay for a good Christian home.</p>
   <p>Paragraph 2. Religious instruction and public worship are not to be supervised by the Society as such, but by Lutheran ministers who belong to the Society and <span class="page-break">\5</span>serve congregations that subscribe to the Lutheran confession of faith.</p>
   <p>Article XIII</p>
   <p>Committee on Spiritual Matters: There is to be organized a committee on spiritual matters; it is to consist of the ministers referred to in Article II. The duties of this committee shall be to take care of public worship and serve the spiritual needs of the residents of the institution, and also to supply religious instruction and training to the nurses, and to determine the adequacy of the training thus provided.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sandberg made an introductory speech as follows:</p>
   <p>"The purpose of this proposal is not in any way to insult anybody; its purpose is not, as has been said by some, to drive ministers and religion out of the Hospital or to upbraid the present members of the committee for anything they <span class="page-break">\6</span>have done. The purpose is simply to make it easier for all of us to work together toward the goal we have set up; to make it easier for others to extend help to us; to make it easier for ministers to become members of the Society; to make it easier to get new patients; to make it easier for those who become patients at the Hospital to get the spiritual nurture they may desire. This combined goal can best be attained, I believe, by omitting from the Society's constitution a couple of paragraphs which (1) place greater demands on the Lutheran ministers of the Society than they are able to meet; (2) subject them to obligations which may be interpreted in a way to drive many people away from the Society and prevent the Hospital from receiving a large part of the aid which otherwise would come its way; (3) may leave the impression that the Hospital belongs to a specific religious denomination, and thereby tend to keep away members, ministers, and patients belonging to other denominations; (4) expose the patients to missionary efforts on the part of the members of the committee on spiritual matters, and thereby make it more difficult for these patients to get the spiritual nurture which they desire; and (5) place all this power and all these obligations in the hands <span class="page-break">\7</span>of a committee, the composition of which is a matter of chance, in regard to which the Society has no control. The Society has no power to compel the committee on spiritual matters to fulfill its duties; nor can it prevent the committee or its individual members from interpreting the laws of the Society in any manner desired by them; neither can the members of the committee be deterred from ministering to the spiritual needs of the patients and others connected with the Hospital in any way they consider best.</p>
   <p>"I quite agree with Reverend Johnson that if the present committee is to be upbraided, it must be on the grounds that the said committee has not done enough--under the Society's constitution--however good its intentions may have been. The constitution requires that the committee provide the necessary religious training, including tests, for the nurses. This, in spite of the unequivocal requirements under the constitution, the committee has omitted doing. The nurses have not received any religious instruction, and Reverend Johnson admits that the committee may justly be blamed for this. So far as I know, the nurses have not received any religious training, nor have they <span class="page-break">\8</span>been subjected to any examination. Whether some future committee might find time to undertake the tasks referred to, we do not know. The present committee, however, has not proved equal to the undertaking. It is clear that the Society should either omit the requirement from its constitution or else see to it that the law be complied with.</p>
   <p>"We are all acquainted with the fact that the present committee on spiritual matters has decided that as a part of its care for the spiritual life of the residents of the Hospital, it is the duty of the committee to censor the books and[the methods employed in raising]money donated to the institution. The books might contain matter which it would be bad for the residents to read, and the money might have been gained by improper methods.</p>
   <p>"Of course, some future committee might interpret the laws to mean that all doctors who are to treat patients at the Hospital must belong to the same <span class="page-break">\9</span>religious denomination as the members of the committee.....If anybody were to think this a preposterous supposition they need merely consider the fact that there are now religious hospitals at which requirements of the kind mentioned are imposed upon the physicians.</p>
   <p>"It is evident, of course, that if the Lutheran ministers are to fulfill all the duties imposed on them by the Society's constitution it will be necessary for them, as members of the committee on spiritual matters, to spend so much of their time at the Hospital as to create the impression that the institution belongs to them. This would tend to discourage visits by ministers of other denominations; it would discourage members of other denominations from entering the Hospital as patients; it would discourage patients of other denominations from calling in the ministers of their choice.</p>
   <p>"Many people have gained the impression that the Tabitha Hospital belongs to the ministers who compose the committee on spiritual matters, and this fact <span class="page-break">\10</span>has made it very difficult to get such Norwegians as do not belong to the same denomination to join the Tabitha Society as members. Frequently, it is next to impossible to persuade patients of other denominations to enter the Hospital for treatment. If the paragraphs concerning the committee on spiritual matters were omitted all these difficulties would disappear."</p>
   <p>Dr. B. Meyer did not believe that the purpose of the discussion meetings would be attained by adopting Dr. Sandberg's motion. He had had many patients at the Tabitha Hospital but had never heard that the committee on spiritual matters had made it difficult for doctors and nurses to fulfill their duties.....</p>
   <p>Dr. Marie Olsen spoke in support of Dr. Sandberg's proposal....Patients go to hospitals to get medical treatment, not to get spiritual help. Rules for a hospital ought to be drawn up by doctors, not by ministers, just as it is not the task of a physician to lay down rules for the services in a church. She also criticized the method of holding worship in the Hospital....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>Reverend Heimdahl was surprised at the statements of Dr. Olsen....The ministers did not try to press their religious opinions upon the patients; at least, the Synod ministers did not try to do so.</p>
   <p>Dr. T. Warloe had often been at the Hospital but had never heard complaints there against the ministers.....</p>
   <p>Reverend F. Ring said that in matters concerning the Hospital the aim ought to be to unite, not to divide. The patients are concerned about the ability of the doctors at a hospital, not about who the ministers may be. He considered it better, especially for the old people at the Hospital, if the worship was not held in the third story as at present....The doors at the Hospital ought to be open to ministers of all denominations.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Several other speakers took part in the discussion after Reverend Ring's remarks, but no new arguments or facts were presented.]</p>
