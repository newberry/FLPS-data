   <p>Among the many departments in the Skandinaven, there is one carrying the caption "For the Youth". It is not a department about the young people, but a department by the young people; a column in the paper where the young men and women who have something to say find open space for their letters and articles exactly as has been the case hitherto in regard to the subscriber of long standing--the traveling agent and the news reporter. Only one special rule has been applied in the youth column: it is requested that the young writers express themselves briefly; form their sentences clearly; use language that is easily understood.</p>
   <p>Someone may interpose the question here: How can the paper expect such excellency in style and language from the young, when it is often found that even learned writers of long experience with the pen are using expressions which are not clear or easily understood? The answer to this is: The rule referred to, is not to be considered an absolute law which must not be broken; rather an ideal toward which the young people should aim and strive, and it is set up just in order that everybody may be encouraged and find a chance to practice along the lines mentioned. It is for these reasons that the editors have decided to open this column for the young people; there was no such chance for the editor and his many fellow workers upon the paper when they were in the years between school and adult life.</p>
   <p>Many a time have I heard people speak of the youth column in Skandinaven, and the criticism leveled against the column has often been of the kind which finds little to praise, but lots to blame. But in spite of all criticism, I have not yet heard anybody suggest that the column be discontinued. On the other hand, many have had the impression, as I have, that the column may be compared to a brook; in spring it is full and overflowing; in midsummer its flow diminishes and the brook may go dry.</p>
   
   <p>This fact seems to me to indicate something wrong, something lacking in our young people, and I wish to appeal to those who have taken advantage of the column so far, as well as to the many thousand who have not taken the chance to give voice to their opinions, that a splendid chance is given you through the youth column. Take advantage of it; do not be so lazy or lacking in interest as to abstain from sending to the Skandinaven your contributions about matters that concern you, or about which you have made up your opinion. The paper has opened its columns for you. Now give to the paper such a flood of articles as the farmers have done, so that the paper may have something to choose from. For the long run this will benefit the young themselves. Do not forget that before long you who are now called youth will be among the groups of leaders in church and in state, and if you have gained practice in the field of matching your mental powers with those of others, then you will soon be able to speak and write concerning problems up for debate; you will be able to make motions, giving your reasons for the same. But if you have not gained practice as mentioned, then all you can expect is to be the tools, the servants of others, and this is not what is meant by being free men and women. It is what can only be considered a mental and social zero, a nothing, only of value when attached after an integer of value. One thing more: Take care to use decent words and expressions where you have to meet the persistent assurances of people who do not want to bow to logic. Do not follow the example here of us older ones who have left examples as if we were unable to draw the line between discussion and brawl.....Let it be seen in all your dealing that you have had a worthwhile up-bringing, and that you are living in a country where the law guarantees equality, liberty, justice. But the word of God requires that you love God above everything, and your neighbor as yourself.....</p>
