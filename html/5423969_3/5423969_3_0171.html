   <p>Surely it must be regarded as an extraordinary event to enjoy a cruise on Lake Michigan, even a brief one, on board a Norwegian square-rigged sailing ship. It was my good fortune to have that experience on board the Sorlandet the day before that attractive specimen of the shipbuilder's art weighed anchor and started on her return voyage to her home port in Norway.</p>
   <p>In preparation for the cruise no visitors were permitted on board after Tuesday evening, July 18. Early the next morning the ship was towed out from her mooring quay at the Exposition, and cast anchor a few cable lengths from where the many thousands had gone on board as visitors during her one month's stay at the Fair. There she rode in the bright sun and in rhythm with the gentle undulations of the blue water, her shining white, slender hull a delight even to the landsman's eye, with her sharp bow and challenging bowsprit pointing seaward, or lakeward, with her tall masts, her broad, perfectly balanced yards, and her impressive rigging with its bewildering maze of rope and tackle.</p>
   <p>To be sure, it was a real sailing ship from Norway, an honest-to-goodness square rigger, without auxiliary power, the first that has ever plowed the waters of Lake Michigan, and it may possibly be the last. The days of the sailing ship, so far as the merchant marine is concerned, are past. We are in the machine age, even on the high seas. On board the Sorlandet we are suddenly transported back to the romantic days of the white sails and the hand-driven capstan with its story-book tradition of "Sing sailor, ho."</p>
   <p>From the foretop, as international law prescribes, fluttered the Stars and Stripes, and from the gaff flew Norway's tricolor proudly in the hot southwest breeze. It was a perfect day for such a cruise. Although the wind was hot, it was nevertheless refreshing after the many days of blazing heat.</p>
   <p>Only a few invited guests, about eighteen or twenty I should say, exclusively men (including as a matter of course the omnipresent "gentlemen of the press"), had the rare privilege to be on board. On the trip out to the ship I had the pleasant company of my friends, Dr. Suerre Nannestad, Christian Olsen and Arne Williamson, of the Norwegian-American Line. At the Michigan Boulevard bridge we boarded a speedy "Dodge" motorboat of spacious size, with a man at the wheel who knew his business. Thus we had a fine boat trip over the waters of the harbor; on the way, we made a stop at the Aquarium to let off two women passengers who had occupied the seats farthest aft and who seemed glad to escape further wetting from the spray that dashed over the boat aft. We arrived alongside the ship in less than thirty minutes.</p>
   <p>Soon captain Brunvik arrived from the Exposition in the ship's launch, accompanied by Captain Masnus Anderson, Olaf Bernts, and the additional guests, including of course the two "big shots" of the reception committee, Captain Sinding, and Colonel Siqueland. They came from the Administration Building, where President Dawes and the Fair authorities had given the Sorlandet's master a farewell luncheon.</p>
   
   <p>On board, there was disciplined activity from stem to stern. The officers and cadets were all at their posts, awaiting orders. At about 3 p. m. anchor was a'weigh and a tug hauled us out to sea. From the bridge on the poop deck the captain called his orders through a megaphone. The orders came thick and fast; "Man fore tops'l sheets," "Heave away", "Belay," etc., in real windjammer style. What an experience!</p>
   <p>The orders that came in rapid succession were relayed to the second and third mates, who were in charge, one of the starboard watch, the other of the port watch. The bos'n's whistle sounded. Two cadets at the wheel. Every man jumping at the order. They certainly knew their jobs.</p>
   <p>To the landlubbers on board, it was a thrilling sight to see the more than a score of cadets sprint aloft with the agility of cats, as surefooted and strong-armed as experienced sailors before the mast. Inside of twenty minutes, the magnificent craft was under sail, with every inch of canvass bulging willingly to the force of the southwest wind. The tow-lines from the tug boat were cast off and the ship shot forward under her own canvas. She soon attained a speed of eight knots. The discipline, the maneuvering, and the seamenship displayed were what everyone expected of such sailors. Former seamen among the guests said the seamanship, even of the young cadets, was superb.</p>
   <p>The sharp bow cleaved the water like a huge knife, forming a fanlike spread of white-capped waves. Yes, the good ship now had a bone in her teeth. Over the aft rail we heard the swish and swirl of the ship's turbulent wake. Yes, she was going, that is sure, and she made every task quickly in response to her helm and the skillful maneuvering of her officers.</p>
   <p>Let us look around and see what's going on. Here is Consul Bernts, bareheaded, dignified, smiling with obvious enjoyment. He is dressed in fluffy summer attire and carries a cane. He praises the work of the crew. Well, he should. As consul of Norway he feels the responsibility of his position; it is through him that the ship's clearance papers are issued. I ask you, why shouldn't he be here on such an occasion?</p>
   <p>Most of us prefer the spaciousness of the poop deck. There are brass rails and other solid objects to cling to, as the ship heaves to the force of the sea. Well, there is Doctor Nannestad leaning lazily against the port rail. His look of supreme contentment bespeaks the state of his mind. His experienced weather eye scans the rigging and the full-bellied sails. Why not? He is the son of a Norwegian skipper, and the tradition of the sea is still strong in him.</p>
   <p>Over there against the starboard rail stand, like Damon and Pythias, George Thoresen and Irwin Larsen, the faces of both wreathed in smiles that never seem to wear off.</p>
   <p>"How about a drink of lemonade, George?"</p>
   <p>"All right," says George, "where will we go?"</p>
   
   <p>Down His Majesty's companionway we squeeze our none too slender bodies--one at a time, thank you--and find ourselves in the captain's delightful retreat. George and I refreshed ourselves with liquid refreshment in the form of a sun-kissed product.</p>
   <p>A sudden lurch to star-board quickly brings us back to the poop deck. Well, listen, if it isn't Reidar Rye Haugan! He can't be seen, but he can be heard. He prefers to be down on the main deck,. forward among the crew. Listen, there he is!</p>
   <p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, he, he, he, he-e-e-e-."</p>
   <p>There is Colonel Siqueland in earnest conversation with two strangers, evidently Americans of fabulous wealth. I think the colonel is telling them of his training ship days when, at the age of fourteen, he had charge of the "Royal". The topic suits the occasion. I made a bet with Dr. Nannestad that the Colonel will not introduce us to his friends. We gave the colonel plenty of rope, as the saying is on board ship. I won the bet.</p>
   <p>Here is the City News Bureau reporter. Joyfully, he tells me Sinding and Siqueland have given him "the dope". He showed me all the names he had thus easily garnered on his note tab. The names he had were all misspelled. Several were missing altogether. How was that? Some names are not important, you know, oh, well, what's the difference? I corrected the spelling for him and told him he had "dope" enough. Just then the American photographer butted in with a serious proposition:</p>
   <p>"I want a picture of Consul Bernts and Captain Anderson saying good-by to Captain Brunsuik."</p>
   <p>The group was arranged. Now see what happens. The photographer arranges that the three clasp hands simultaneously. That doesn't suit Captain Brunsuik. He is indignant and walks away.</p>
   
   <p>"You fellows do so many funny things," he says to the startled photographer.</p>
   <p>"Three men shaking hands at once is ridiculous", somebody says, in support of the captain.</p>
   <p>The problem is solved by having Consul Bernts and the captain shake hands. Later the whole company was "filmed", of course, some more and some less. Aboard ship the difference in rank, even among visitors, is easily determined by those who know.</p>
   <p>The ship is plowing through the water beautifully and at a good clip. I go down on the main deck where I find Captain Sinding giving orders to the News Bureau reporter, Captain Anderson is close behind me. At the companion-way to B deck I meet the cheerful Leif Buch, the vice-consul.</p>
   <p>"I have been below to see the boys eat ice cream", he says. "You ought to see them eat".</p>
   
   <p>"Ice cream?" asks Captain Anderson. In his voice there is a trace of disgust. "Is that anything to look at? No, we want something else. Come, let's go to the captain's cabin."</p>
   <p>Quickly the word is passed around, and soon the entire company is seated around the captain's festive table. Coffee, aquevit, cake, and cigars and cigarettes from Norway are consumed in vast quantities. Dr. Boreson, eagerly seconded by many others, gives high praise to Miss Borghild Reinskau's layer cake. But look, gentlemen, here comes the steward with "Pilsener" from Krisiansand's brewery. Captain Anderson (and others) give grunts of keen satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Suddenly the ship lurches heavily. Cups, filled glasses and bottles rattle over in perfect rhythm with the ships motion. Anderson and I get the worst of the mess: the captain lost the amber contents of his glass and bottle; my port leg was entirely awash. The steward and the sunshine on deck soon removed all traces of the squall.</p>
   
   <p>As usual for a man of distinguished appearance. Colonel Siqueland makes an impression. In words carefully selected for obviousness of meaning, he presents the ship with an artistically bound guest book (applause). Both he and Captain Anderson ask me to write an introduction. What shall I do? Well, reluctantly, by which I imply modesty, I accept the honor and retire to perform my duty as a "committee of one" molder of facile phrases. The job is done, and, to my surprise, approved without change. Now, everybody signs his name to the new book under the introduction which doubtless will "reverberate down the corridors of time".</p>
   <p>Not to be outdone, Dr. Nannestad now gets in, his fancy work.</p>
   <p>"Captain", he says, "here is a box full of toothpaste--about one hundred tubes. I hope its enough for everybody on the return trip. I got it for you from the Pepsodent Company."</p>
   
   <p>"Thanks," says the captain. "If we stayed here longer, I believe you people would give us everything".</p>
   <p>What more is there to relate? Yes, high up on the quarter-deck stands Captain Sinding, his round, jolly face smiling; he scans wistfully the blue waters of the lake and the city shore line. In my mind's eye I can see him standing thus on the bridge of his ship when he plowed the Pacific in the China trade for Fred Olsen. Sinding is still "the captain". He has never lost the brusque manner of a sailor.</p>
   <p>The historic cruise is at an end. The sails are furled and gently this proud full-rigger slips by the light on the breakwater and eases up to her moorings a few cable lengths from the U. S. Coast Guard station at the mouth of the river. It has been a wonderful cruise, a memorable day. We leave this beautiful ship and her gallant officers and charming cadets with a feeling of keen regret. They are Norwegians all.</p>
   
   <p>Between you and me, Captain Brunsuik has tears in his eyes as he bids us good-by. There were moist eyes among the guests also. The captain accompanied us ashore in the ship's launch. As the boat started off from the ladder we gave the ship's crew a rousing cheer. Along the port rail stand the officers and cadets waving a last farewell. They answer with a cheer equally lusty.</p>
   <p>From the gaff, in the mild evening breeze, waves in equally friendly fashion, the red, white and blue of Old Norway.</p>
   <p>We all became strangely quiet, standing on shore, there in the dusk. We dream of that home we left, long long ago, memories crowd our minds, we know that, though we are Americans, we are also Norwegians.</p>
