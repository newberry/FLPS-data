   <p>In all we have tried to do the last few years we have been handicapped by rather lukewarm interest, all of us have taken in most everything these trying times, but now when the silver lining seems to appear on every ones horizon, will you do something to help preserve the records of the work of Norwegian born engineers and architects in the United States?</p>
   <p>Though much and surely unnecessary hard work we have succeeded in gathering some interesting material and are happy to announce that about 250 copies of such records were sent to the Norwegian Engineers Society about two months ago and gratefully received. Surprisingly enough the response to our requests and questionaires has been least satisfactory from our own members. We can all agree that this is wrong. We urge our branches and members to take an active interest in this. The longer we wait the less important our material will be. Please send in your own story and see that your friends do the same.</p>
