Eight boats were put at the disposal of the singers. All the active singers met at the hall of the Club at 7:30 P. M. and went in procession to the Park. A large crowd was present. Mr. Young told a re-porter for the Skandinaven that at least six thousand people were present; most of them came to hear the singers. Conversation in the Norwegian and Danish languages could be heard in all sections of the Park.</p>
   <p>The Glee Club sang the following numbers: "Naar Fjordene Blaaner" (When the Fjord Reflects Blue), "To My Country", "Father Borg", "Singers Respect", "Rosebud Fair", "Ja, Vi Elsker" (Yes, We Love), "Nys Seiled Vi en Solblank Time" (Just Now We Ended an Hours' Sail in Sunlight), and "Skjon er Du Nat" (Fair You Are, Night). The first number was sung at the boat house, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>after that the singers rowed out upon the waters, now stopping to sing, now rowing again until they had reached the new pavillion; then they returned to the boat house.</p>
   <p>At 10 P. M. the singers went to their hall, corner of Wabansia and Washtenaw Avenues, where the ladies of the Club had gathered, bringing refreshments.
