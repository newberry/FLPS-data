   <p>We can report that the Viking edition of the Old Norse Speculum Regale, published by the University of Illinois, will be ready for delivery to subscribers this spring.</p>
   <p>The large manuscript of the Speculum Regale [Speculum, mirror, Regale, royal] is the chief treasure in Old Norse literature. The original is part of the Arnamagnean collection in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is a parchment codex of 136 pages, of large folio size, dating back to the thirteenth century. The Regal Mirror is written in a large, regular hand, which frequently employs highly ornamental initials, and is a beautiful example of old Norwegian manuscript. The purity of its language, the dignity of its style, and its cultural content give it an undisputed place among the important literary documents of the classical age of Old Norse <span class="page-break">2</span>literature.</p>
   <p>The editorial work has been done by Professor Georg T. Flom of the University of Illinois. The text of the document is similar in design to that of the Godex Regins of the Elder Edda. There is an introduction on the paleography and the early history of the manuscript, and there are also notes on the text. The book contains about 380 pages, including 136 gelatine-process photographic reproductions of the manuscript.</p>
   <p>The University desires to make this work available to as wide a public as possible and to insure its preservation in the libraries of many of the leading American colleges and universities. Only 75 copies of the edition of 150 copies are available. Applications will be filled in the order of their receipt. The price is fifteen dollars net.</p>
