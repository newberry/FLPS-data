   <p>The Norwegian Home Finding Society gave a Donation Party last Saturday, and it was a great success in every way. People started coming before 3 o'clock, with baskets filled with goods, big bundles of much-needed articles, and, even better,  with pockets heavy with gifts of money. At the exact time for starting the party, the representatives of this paper arrived. The lawn around the home was already occupied by people, children and adults, busy with coffee, cakes, and ice cream, and crowds were moving about in the spacious rooms of the Home. Everybody seemed especially pleased and surprised at the size and the fitness of the house for the task to be accomplished.</p>
   <p>An interesting program was presented, including music, singing, readings, and speeches. Most interesting was a speech by Judge Torrison, in which he drew a comparison between the crowded and in many ways stultifying life of the child in the poorer districts of the city, and the better life of the country child. Something needs to be done for the neglected city child; much is being done. The Home Finding Society will be able to help many who would otherwise remain neglected.</p>
