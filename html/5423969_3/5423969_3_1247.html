   <p>We, the undersigned, believe that part of the proposal made by you can be used in a settlement of the present conflict. But we feel we cannot agree to a special meeting because such a meeting would only increase the split within the Society.</p>
   <p>We wish to call your attention to the fact that the slate elected was elected on a democratic basis, and gives each branch the representation to which it is entitled. In the event that a special meeting be called, we know that the results would be the same, and practically the same officers elected.</p>
   <p>We can, of course, set up a counter proposal because we do agree on many of the points in your proposal. We cannot, of course, agree that any group or faction shall have control of the Society. As it stands now both factions are equally represented with an equal amount of neutral and nonpartisan members.</p>

   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>Marie A. Olsen</p>
   <p>Harry Rommen</p>
   <p>Johan Waage</p>
