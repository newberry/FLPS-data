   <p>John J. Sonsteby (Judge), spoke at the Seventeenth of May Festival. We feel that those who were so unfortunate as not to have heard the speech, would have liked to, and so here it is:</p>
   <p>Mr. President, Members of the League, and Friends:</p>
   <p>It is always a great privilege and honor to be a speaker at your Seventeenth of May Festival, but particularly so today, when you also celebrate the centennial of the coming of the Sloop Party in the sloop "Restaurationen" (Restauration) to the United States. I wish, therefore, to express my sincere appreciation for the invitation through which I am to address you today.</p>
   <p>As a former president of the League, I know your many activities on behalf of Norway and Norwegians.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>As one born under the Stars and Stripes, I join with you in commemorating the activities and deeds of our forefathers, and in celebrating their successes and achievements both in Norway and in the United States.</p>
   <p>The history of the United States would be incomplete without the story of Norwegian immigration and settlement.</p>
   <p>America has been known to the Norwegians for a thousand years. The discovery by Leif Ericson provided the knowledge by which later navigators were able, with some feelings of confidence, to strike out westward on what, to them, was an unknown sea.</p>
   <p>The records disclose a number of Norwegians in the American Colonies.</p>
   <p>The coming of the Sloop Party under the direction of Kleno Peerson marks the beginning of organized emigration to these shores.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>When the great Civil War threatened the life of the country thousands of Norwegians from Illinois (Chicago), Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota (Minneapolis), the Dakotas, and other states, entered the Northern armies and helped to save the Union.</p>
   <p>The story of the "Iron Brigade" from Wisconsin and Illinois, in which hundreds of units were composed entirely of Norwegians, officers and men, is part of the glorious epic of that time.</p>
   <p>After the war these war veterans became active in every walk of life and, with the many other thousands of Norwegians, helped to bind up the nation's wound.</p>
   <p>After the Civil War the stream of immigration from Norway increased by leaps and bounds until there was hardly a state but had its quota.</p>
   <p>Rarely, if ever, has such a steady stream of seemingly new blood been <span class="page-break">4</span>absorbed by any nation. It was not, however, the fusion of a melting pot but rather a blending.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians never contributed to the so-called melting pot or to the troubles of their adopted land.</p>
   <p>Being of the same race as those to whom is due the glory of establishing this nation, with the same ideas of government and of the relations of man to man, with the same ideals, and a common folklore, except for language, the absorption for the Norwegians was merely a transition from a land that was free to a land no less free, from a climate that was good, to a climate just as good, but to a land of greater material opportunities. To this land came our forefathers, and many of them brought great gifts of strength, health, brain, brawn, and culture. They became part of the life of this great nation, helping to make and keep it great.</p>
   <p>Fortunate, indeed, it was for America that the great Mississippi Valley, <span class="page-break">5</span>the granary of the world, and the great West and Northwest were settled by Norwegians and kindred of the blood. It was no less fortunate that many of our people settled in the cities--Chicago, New York, and Minneapolis--and on the Pacific Coast. As a result these great states and cities grew and prospered along the lines established by the fathers of the Republic. Law and order have prevailed. Accustomed for almost a thousand years to peaceful, lawful means of settling disputes, they brought with them the mental attitude necessary to become part of a body politic differing from them largely only in language.</p>
   <p>In the church, in the professions, in business, in agriculture, in politics, they and their descendants uphold their traditions.</p>
   <p>On the farm, in the church, in the hospitals, in the courts, in the legislative halls, and in executive positions, they hold high ranks, justifying to the full the inestimable privilege of American citizenship acquired by birth or conferred upon them by naturalization. In other words, we of <span class="page-break">6</span>Norwegian birth or descent are not to be differentiated from those around us whose ancestry dates back to the time of the Mayflower. If anything was needed absolutely to confirm this statement, the World War furnishes irrefutable proof. When the call came to step in and play the part, for which no doubt our nation was intended from the beginning, there was no halting or wavering on the part of those of Norwegian blood. From every state, city, hamlet, and farm came the young men of Norwegian birth or descent, and offered themselves upon the altar of freedom, in foreign lands, that the world might be saved; and they went forth with the blessing of their church and with the song of "Onward Christian Soldiers" in their hearts.</p>
   <p>On the Sunday before Armistice Day, I joined in solemn service in the Lutheran Church, commemorating the memory of, and commending to their God, the many young men of that Church who had gone forth as crusaders for their country, never to return.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>There, in that church, where only men and women of Norwegian birth or descent worship, hundreds of men and women gathered and prayed for those who had passed on and those who were still carrying on. It was a day never to be forgotten, and one that indelibly impressed itself upon my mind. I had seen many meetings during that war, but none that so impressed me. And here in Chicago, men went forth on the same mission, some never to return, others to return crippled and maimed in body and soul.</p>
   <p>When the German advance reached the Marne on those never to be forgotten days in May and June of 1918, driving all before them, and the fate of the world depended upon the ability of the American Marines to stop the advance and hold them, among the boys who held the lines were some of our own who are here today.</p>
   <p>And among those who sit here today, and among those who have gathered in similar festivals all over our land today, are the fathers and mothers, the <span class="page-break">8</span>Gold Star fathers and mothers, of other boys who went from us and passed on.</p>
   <p>The torch of freedom carried by these young crusaders has been handed to us--we must carry on--that their sacrifices may not have been in vain.</p>
   <p>We, with the glorious heritage of blood and civilization must carry on in this Great Republic--must be among those who will hold it to its moorings--to the Constitution, at once the simplest and the greatest document in the world.</p>
   <p>We who have always had freedom and its blessings must stand shoulder to shoulder with all others who enjoy the same privileges, to the end that the freedom purchased and held by such sacrifices shall not be lost.</p>
   <p>With citizenship in this Republic come duties, and these fathers and <span class="page-break">9</span>mothers, recognizing those duties, sent their sons across the seas to fight and die beneath the Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
   <p>By the sacrifices they made upon the altar of freedom, they became sealed as Americans as fully and as truly as though they and their ancestors had lived here for all time.</p>
   <p>The assimilation going on during the past hundred years is completed. We are Americans!</p>
   <p>We must continue to cherish the institutions that have made America great, and among them the great American public school. There every day is repeated by millions of children without regard to creed, color, or previous nationality, the pledge with which I fittingly close:</p>
   <p>"I pledge allegiance to the American flag, and to the republic for which <span class="page-break">10</span>it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."</p>
