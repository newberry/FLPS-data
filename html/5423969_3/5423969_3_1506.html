   <p>Children's Home, Old Peoples's Home: These two phrases have proved themselves to be Chicago's most powerful "open sesame" for many years. This was effectively demonstrated at the concert given by Club West on May 11th, at Bjorgvin Hall; the proceeds went to the Children's Home in Edison Park, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The program included such popular entertainers as Nora and Ethel Olsen; Mrs. (Dr.) Young; Mrs. Anna Meyer; Gunda Isaacsen, the popular violinist; Hortlen Thinn and the Scandinavian Socialist Singing Society popularly known as the 4 S's. With these entertainers performing, there was no lack of variety or quality of entertainment.</p>
   <p>The hall was filled to the doors, and many had been turned away due to lack of room. Club West does nothing by halves, and the public appreciates both Club West and the Children's Home.</p>
