   <p>Norwegian choruses and theatrical circles are familiar with the name O. Hermansen, and recently on the 40th birthday of Mr. Hermansen, the "Bjorgvin" Chorus and many members of the Norwegian Theatre Society gathered to do him honor. He is one of Chicago's best baritones and has made quite a name for himself in theatricals. Of the fourteen plays put on at the Norwegian Theatre, Hermansen has never missed a performance.</p>
   <p>Music - (vocal and instrumental) and dancing constituted the evening's enjoyment, plus the tasty Norwegian lunch and so passed another long to be remembered evening. Our Norwegian colony owes Mr. Hermansen a hearty vote of thanks for his contributions to its pleasure and entertainment and Scandia joins the colony in tendering him such a vote.</p>
