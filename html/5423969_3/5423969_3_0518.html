   <p>Our genial competitor (?) on Peoria Street seems to have one policy, and one policy only--to enrich the Norwegian and the English languages.</p>
   <p>In English, for an example we see such words as "fire machine" for our very ordinary fire department. City Mechanic indicates a machinist employed by the city. Now Sir John [John Anderson] begins an interesting editorial with the expression live cattle instead of livestock. This Peoria Street English and Norwegian, we are sure, will enrich the languages tremendously.</p>
   <p>Why, oh why, is it that Skandinaven thus gets away with murder? If Scandia or any other paper made the same mistakes--my God, what would happen?</p>
