   <p>Captain Roald Amundsen's visit to Chicago was a gala event for our Norwegian Colony and a success in every way. The great explorer was kept busy every minute with banquets, dinners, and receptions. One wonders how the vitality of one man could survive it all.</p>
   <p>Upon his arrival at the Polk Street station, he was greeted with the strains of Ja Vi Elsker, the Norwegian national anthem, sung by the Norwegian Singers' League of Chicago. Norwegian flags were displayed as never before in the history of Chicago; myriads of Norsemen shouted their "Hurrah's" at the station and along the route to the University Club, where he was to be the guest of the Chicago Geographical Society during his stay in Chicago. The Captain was visibly moved by the reception given him at the station; by the hearty singing under the baton of Professor Alfred Paulsen, the speech of welcome by Mr. Thorstenson, president of the Singers' League, and the shouted greetings of the host of Norsemen, all in the beloved tongue of that great little country, Norway.</p>
   <p>Captain Amundsen is an imposing figure, a typical descendant of the rugged Vikings, famous in saga and in song, and he speaks with a directness and power that leaves no doubt in the listener's mind that here is a man of knowledge, endurance, and character; a man who knows and speaks with authority.</p>
   <p>Had Captain Amundsen been able to accept even a small portion of invitations for entertainment by Chicagoans in general and the Norwegian colony in particular, he would have had to prolong his stay many weeks. We can state, with no fear of contradiction, that the doors and hearts of Chicago will always be wide open to this world hero, and we Norsemen are rightfully proud that we are of the same race as the intrepid Roald Amundsen.</p>
   
   <p>So voluminous have been the reports in our greater Chicago dailies of the engagements arranged by the Captain's "host," the Chicago Geographical Society, that it is unnecessary for us to repeat them in Scandia; we will therefore confine our remarks to the "crumbs" of time granted his countrymen.</p>
   <p>We had our hero for a very short time when the Norwegian Club gave a dinner in his honor, following a reception at the Blackstone Hotel, where he had been the guest of Mr. Haugan, the Norwegian Consul. The club gave their dinner at the Congress Hotel, and 150 guests saw and heard the captain. They enjoyed every minute of the allotted time (6:00 to 8:P.M.). Speakers at the dinner were Dr. Warloe, Mr. Giaver, and Mr. Hummeland. Captain Amundsen expressed his deep appreciation for the courtesy and good-will of his "own people," and regretted that his time was so short. He added that he hoped to be able to pay an exclusive visit to the Norsemen of Chicago later on. The Captain could not concieve of a heartier, more touching welcome than that which was accorded him upon his arrival in Chicago. It will always remain in his memory as an outstanding day in his eventful life.</p>
   <p>Orchestra Hall was filled to capacity long before the time set for the lecture. The Norwegian attendance exceeded by far the attendance of other nationalities; they were solidly packed into the sections for which Scandia and the Norwegian Club had handled the sale of tickets. Not one ticket remained unsold at either place.</p>
   <p>It seemed as though the applause would never end when Captain Amundsen, escorted by Professors Cowles and Cox, appeared on the platform. Quiet was finally restored, however, and Professor Cowles presented Captain Amundsen with the Chicago Geographical Society Gold Medal. This brought forth another salvo of applause that was stilled entirely only when Captain Amundsen stepped forward and raised his hand for quiet. The Captain spoke briefly of his many trips of exploration, and at length of his triumphal trip to the pole. Both the lecture and the accompanying pictures were absorbed by the most intensely interested audience we have ever seen, and no one in that vast audience doubted that they had Listened to one of the greatest men of the modern world.</p>
   <p>The difficulty experienced by those who had not obtained tickets in advance was exemplified by Mayor Harrison's experience. The Mayor decided at the last minute to attend, and no seat was available until Professor Patten gave the Mayor his own seat in the box he had reserved, the professor stating that he would attend the lecture at Evanston, the next evening, instead.</p>
