   <p>The Norwegian Home Finding Society held its annual convention last night. The meeting was opened by the president, Reverend M. E. Fretheim, who reported as follows:</p>
   <p>"Like Cornelia of old, we present our children as our jewels. Our three houses have been full all year. Generally speaking, our large family has been blessed with good health, and for this we thank the Lord. And we do not forget the watchfull care of the matron, Mrs. Bremner, her associates, and our faithful physician, Dr. M. A. Unseth. Just at present, however, we have a very sick boy, Clifford Hanson, at the Children's Memorial Hospital. We should remember him in our prayers. The discipline has been commendable, for which the Society compliments those in charge and the children.</p>
   <p>"The Society is to be congratulated on its present staff at the Home. All are members of our churches and are known as active Christian workers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Mrs. Bremner, our matron, took charge on March 1, 1918, and has filled her difficult position with credit. Mrs. Francis Cowan, who is in charge of the girls' cottage, has a long period of splendid service to her credit. Miss Mollie Johnson entered service of the Home on June last June 10, and has done great things for our smaller boys. Mrs. Ellert Knudson took up her work New Year's Day. Together with her departed husband, who for several years was our treasurer, she is known as one of the ardent friends of the Home.</p>
   <p>"At present there are 42 children in the Home: 16 boys between the ages of 8 and 13 in the main building in charge of Mrs. Bremner and Mrs. Knudson; 13 boys between 3 and 8 in the boys cottage in charge of Miss Johnson; 13 girls between 3 and 13 in the girls' cottage in charge of Mrs. Cowan; three children have been placed in private homes with good prospects for adoption.</p>
   <p>"A new era has dawned with the passing of the homewrecker and the orphan maker --the saloon. Not that our work will be minimized--no, never! Christ says: "The poor ye have always with you," so will we also have the poor and homeless <span class="page-break">3</span>children. But the work will be more encouraging as there will be more hope of doing it as it should be done. In the past, many a worthy widow applied in vain for a lift and has had to earn her bread with her child in her arms because drunken fathers and mothers have dumped their children in the homes so that they might be free to sin. As this truth becomes clear to all the friends of our children's homes, they will give more freely and gladly than ever, knowing that every dollar goes for real and constructive charity.</p>
   <p>"The great work for the Home done by the Erie Branch in Our Saviors Church is well known, and we are glad to state that during the past year several other branches have been started. The next to be organized was the Park View Branch, with Mrs. Kleefish as treasurer. Then the Lake View Branch was organized under the leadership of Mrs. O. N. Olsen. Mrs. S. Thompson has worked with great success to secure members in the new union of St. Paul's and St. John's congregations. May this development continue in our city and country congregations until the many strong branches shall give our Home Finding <span class="page-break">4</span>tree a body so full and strong that all the homeless little ones among our people may find shelter therein.</p>
   <p>"Anyone who has seen the list of donations to our Home for the holidays must feel the truth of the favorite song of our children: "My Father is rich in houses and lands; I am the child of a King." The same is evident throughout the year. During the last vacation season, Reverend Conrad Engelstad and his good people at Ottawa gave 15 of our children a vacation in the country. It is needless to say that the children were delighted. We trust that several congregations in the country will adopt their method of doing the King's business so that our children may go in groups for a summer vacation.</p>
   <p>"Besides the Home Finding Sewing Circle, Children's Welfare, and other societies that work for our Home, a new society with this program has been organized; it is known as the Martha Maria Society. A committee has recently sent out statements and last year's reports, and results are loading the treasurer's desk <span class="page-break">5</span>every day. The matron's and treasurer's reports will give enlightening surveys of their respective fields.</p>
   <p>"For the present we have but one advice to the Society--work with increased energy and devotion to establish and strengthen the Home in its present policy and program. With a full house, and more seeking admission, with a staff in charge at the Home that cannot be surpassed, with a host of loyal supporters all around, with God's help--we have no fears for the future.</p>
   <p>"M. E. Fretheim, President."</p>
   <p>Mrs, Ida Bremner's report follows:</p>
   <p>"Again we have reason to thank the Lord for his wonderful goodness, and with one accord say: Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His Holy Name for His goodness and mercy toward us in the year of 1919.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"At the beginning of the year, we had 35 children in the Home, and as the days went on, the number increased; at the end of January, 6 dear little children were added to our family; in February, 2 more knocked at our door and were admitted. The number reached 43. Think of it: 43 children in need of shelter in the cold winter days. Let us open our hearts to the dear unfortunate children and help them as they come to us. Our Heavenly Father said: 'What ye do unto the least of these, ye do unto me.' Later on another child entered our Home, making a total of 44. No more room! What shall we do? Institutions are filled; many more have applied for a home, but could not be admitted. Let us do all we can while the day is at hand to help the homeless children.</p>
   <p>"We had 61 children in our charge during 1919; of these, 26 were admitted, 16 released, 2 placed in private homes, and 1 placed for adoption. At present we have 42 children at the Home. One of our boys was taken ill with pneumonia and sent to the Children's Memorial Hospital on January 15; the other children <span class="page-break">7</span>are in good health.</p>
   <p>"Among the 42 children 14 of these are dependent upon us for their existence. How thankful we are that God gave us the ability and cheerful willingness to help them. I wish to extend my humble but grateful thanks to the president, Reverend M. E. Fretheim, Reverend Elias Rasmussen, and the board of directors for their assistance; to Dr. M. Unseth for his readiness to care for our children in times of sickness; to Dr. Warloe, Dr. DeWitz and the Deaconess Hospital for attending one of our boys who took seriously ill last summer; to Miss Connell, principal of the public school; to the doctor, nurse, and teachers of this school for their special attention given our children; to the barbers, Victor L. Hansen, G. Fisher, and W. Beck who cut the children's hair without charge; to Mr. Madsen for keeping our plumbing in repair.</p>
   <p>"I cannot mention the names of all our kind friends in Ottawa, Malta, and Lee, Illinois, and in various circles, and societies, nor can I name all of our individual friends who have sent generous gifts to us and who have shown their <span class="page-break">8</span>interest in our Home. I wish to thank our loyal workers who managed the tag day and collected the sum of $2,306.59. May we again look to all our friends for their kind assistance. I also wish to show my appreciation to our co-workers, Mrs. Frances Cowen, Miss Mollie Johnson, and Charlotte Knudson, for the excellent service they are rendering the Home and its children.</p>
   <p>"Again I wish to thank you one and all. May our Heavenly Father bless you as you do your part from day to day to make a bright tomorrow.</p>
   <p>"Sincerely yours in the work,</p>
   <p>"Mrs. Ida Bremner, Matron."</p>
