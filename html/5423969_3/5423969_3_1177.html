   <p>p.8................"Tabitha" hospital held its annual lawn party and auction in the spacious hospital grounds on Saturday June 29. Myriads of Japanese lanterns gave the grounds a truly festive appearance and the party itself proved to be a success financially and socially. Speakers during the evening included Senator Waage, Rev. Ring, Alderman Bielfus and others. Finn Simonsen composed an impromptu lyric that was highly appreciated and established him more strongly than ever as Chicago's, if not America's greatest Norwegian-American writer of lyrics.</p>
   <p>Vocal and instrumental music was anything but scarce and during the auction of aprons the tinkling of cash in the coffers added another note that was music to the ears of the sponsors of the hospital.</p>
