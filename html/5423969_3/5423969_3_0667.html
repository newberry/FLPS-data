   <p>Introduction</p>
   <p>Norway, "The Land of the Midnight Sun," the land of the conquering Vikings! Its scenic grandeur, infinite in variety, its beautiful lakes and silvery mountains, its cascades and its sunny verdant valleys, dotted with farms where a quaint rural life and a vigorous culture flourish, celebrated for a thousand years in song and story! Along the storm-swept coast of more than fifteen hundred miles are located the cities and towns with their commercial, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>manufacturing, seafaring, and fishing population busily engaged in "developing their country". While the valleys and the hillsides are draped in the gorgeous colors of summer, the eternal snow of the lofty mountains glitters enchantingly in the distance.</p>
