   <p>Kristianialaget (The Christiania Clan) celebrated the three hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city of Christiania with a festival at the Logan Square Masonic Temple, last Sunday.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The "Kristianialaget" is a society formed of people who were born in Christiania. There is also a "Bergenslag" (Norwegians from Bergen). Nearly every city and many counties have their "Lag". Nordman's Laget with the motto "Nordmaen Fra Norge" (Norwegians from Norway) is the national "Lag".]</p>
