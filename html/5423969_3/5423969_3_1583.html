   <p>The board of directors has held twelve regular meetings and four special meetings during the year. Four meetings of the Society have been held--the annual meeting and three quarterly meetings. Thirty-four new members have been received. According to the list of members given me at the beginning of the year the membership now should reach 391. This figure is not quite trustworthy, however. According to the rules of the constitution the financial secretary controls the status of membership.</p>
