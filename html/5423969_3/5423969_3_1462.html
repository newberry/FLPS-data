   <p>1. There were no deaths at the Home during the year. The general health has been excellent.</p>
   <p>2. The farm payed well in 1917, making possible a large saving on the food necessary for the Home.</p>
   <p>3. The Christian life of the children is a great improvement of the life they led before entering the Home.</p>
   <p>4. The children have done well in their classes, especially singing. Thank God, they have not yet had contact with the filthy "ragtime" that we hear so much about today.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>5. One of the problems at the Home is how to keep the immoral and bad parents from visiting their children. When they visit the Home they sow their sinful seed in the children's minds and hearts. They can, in a half hours visit, poison the children's minds to such an extent that it takes us days to purify them.</p>
   <p>6. The tag committee has done a wonderful job, they collected $3,236.36. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
   <p>7. The last bazaar was the best one ever held. All the societies gave us their full co-operation.</p>
   <p>8. The congregations outside of Chicago contributed more during the past year than ever before. The Chicago congregations have also done their job well. God bless them. The children have more friends than ever before.</p>
   <p>9. The future of the Children's Home seems to be assured. The Norwegian people <span class="page-break">3</span>have always donated a great deal to the Home. We also have the Home Finding Society here in Chicago; why can the two societies not be combined? We need each other.</p>
   <p>10. In closing we plead with the people who make their last will and testament. Remember the Children's Home. God bless you!</p>
