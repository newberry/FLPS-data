   <p>The building committee reported that construction work on the new Deaconess Home and Hospital was proceding rapidly and that in a few days the foundation would be finished. The contracts have been let for the brick work, hewn stone, and carpenter work, and the committee is busy at work to let the remaining contracts. Reverend Kildahl reported that he had been on a tour in Red River Valley, North Dakota, and in a month there he had collected about $900 for the building fund. He intends to return to the district to resume the collection. Mr. Larson reported having spent one week with the Holden congregation, Goodhue County, Minnesota, and there had collected $300 for the building fund.</p>
