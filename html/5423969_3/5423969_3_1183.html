   <p>p.2.................The nurses' organization of the Norwegian Hospital opened a bazaar, on April 22, to establish a fund for "free-days" and"free-meals" to the needy. A good program is in progress at all times and prominent Norsemen are giving the affair their unstinted support. Consul General Ravn and Jens Skougaard who have at all times shown great liberality toward and interest in this organization have again donated $500.00 to the bazaar committee.</p>
   <p>The cause for which this group is working is so well thought of that their bazaars and other arrangements for supplying funds have been given wholehearted support, not only by our Norwegian colony, but by an almost unbelievable number of Americans in every Scandinavian community. Indications are that the present bazaar will prove to be the greatest financial success this group has experienced. Scandia heartily recommends a good attendance for this good cause.</p>
