   <p>The board of directors of the Leif Ericson Monument Society at its latest meeting unanimously adopted the sketch by Mr. Sigvald Asbjornsen as a model for the Leif Ericson monument.</p>
   <p>As previously mentioned, the Society, in its agreement with Blake and Company stipulated prices for a statue of a height of nine or ten feet; consideration of the question as to which size to decide upon was postponed until a later meeting. This was done in order to give the Norwegians in Chicago a chance to discuss the matter prior to final decision.</p>
