   <p>At three o'clock P.M. the big Scandinavian singing societies started their "Meet" in the Festival Hall at the Fair grounds. The vast number of singers, all wearing white caps, presented an overwhelming sight. The big hall was nearly full. Five thousand people were seated. One thousand singers gave a masterly performance, to which the public responded warmily. It was too bad that the size of the hall prevented a great many from hearing the concert.</p>
