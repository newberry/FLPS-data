   <p>Mr. Sigvard Sorensen, who holds a prominent position at the Newberry Library, celebrated his thirty-sixth birthday last Thursday evening with some friends at his home, 738 North Leavitt Street. At the richly served supper, Mr. Henry Ibsen acted as toastmaster, and Dr. A. T. Boyesen made a speech in honor of Mr. Sorensen. Mr. Alexander Kielland, Jr. spoke in honor of Norway, and Dr. Lindos in honor of Mr. Sorensen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Henry Ibsen read a literary piece recently completed by Mr. Sorensen, but which is still in manuscript form. The title of the work is a secret, temporarily. Both the work and the reading of it evoked strong applause. Afterwards, the guests gathered about the punch bowl and the most genial sentiment prevailed.</p>
