   <p>In Chicago we have a great Scandinavian population, made up of four, or rather five, different nations, each of which in its own way contributes to the material and spiritual welfare of its own people. Each has its own clubs, churches, and musical organizations, and strives to maintain the beautiful and characteristic culture of the homeland in the land of its adoption. Wonderful things have been accomplished by each individual people within its own limited sphere. But never as yet have these people, who have so much in common, combined their abundant geniuses and talents so as to obtain still greater results, results which are possible only by the merging of common interests and thereby producing an effect and influence for good.</p>
   <p>We now have before us a celebration--the Leif Ericson Festival--which, if I am not mistaken, was proposed by the Norwegian National League. The celebration promises to grow into an event of tremendous importance to all the Scandinavian people alike, surpassing, perhaps all dreams of its own instigators. And this <span class="page-break">2</span>could be assured if we could but understand the significance of this event and properly direct it along the lines productive of the most beneficial results to all our people alike.</p>
   <p>If we reflect upon the ways and means whereby this can be obtained, it strikes me that one way would be to use this event as a demonstration--not only to our own people but also to the people of our adopted country--of the great creative and conquering spirit of an indomitable race that crossed the turbulent and inaccessible waters to discover the continent of America long before any other nation. We can thereby demonstrate conclusively to the world that here are a people that must be reasoned with, and who have within themselves a spirit destined for wonderful achievements.</p>
   <p>In what better way, if I may ask, could a historic event of this kind be celebrated than by merging our interests in a common desire to bring before our people and the people of our adopted country the great achievements we attain as a whole from year to year--achievements in science, inventions, literature, <span class="page-break">3</span>music, and the arts, and the advance we make, socially and politically? Think of the tremendous influence for good, and what incentive for action such a celebration would have! It should be a celebration of not only one day, but a whole week, in which lectures, art exhibits, symphony and choral concerts, national games, athletics, and sportmanship should follow one another; in fact, a celebration in which our people will revel in delight and enjoyment at the beauties of the conquering spirit of our race. That, to my mind, would be a celebration that would leave its mark upon the world; it would be an achievement worthy and commensurate with our people.</p>
   <p>To the attainment of this, it is to be hoped that the "grand old man" of the Norwegian colony, Mr. Christian Olsen, will devote the balance of his days to achieve. It would be a greater monument to his memory than that wrought in stone or gold. Let us carry on this idea to complete fulfillment.</p>
