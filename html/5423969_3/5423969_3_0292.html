   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club had a cozy trip to Fox Lake Saturday. The club members left Chicago at 4 o'clock P.M. and arrived at Fox Lake at 5.45. They were received at the Fox Lake station by the local committee, and with singing and music the trio was made to Olsen's hotel, about ten minutes walk from the station, where everything was arranged for a pleasant-evening. The trip into the country lasted till Sunday where a sailing trip on Fox Lake was arranged. Later there was dinner at the hotel where the host and owner of the hotel, Mr. Olsen, brought out champagne to crown a happy day.</p>
