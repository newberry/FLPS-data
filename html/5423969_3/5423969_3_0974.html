   <p>Eikundasund is a Norwegian-American lodge or society in Chicago, organized ten years ago and its motto is "Social and Beneficial." This motto harmonizes with the deeds of the society during its existence. At its last meeting the society bought a $100.00 Liberty Bond. Since this society is probably the first of the individual lodges to take such step, it sends herewith the exhortation to other lodges in the city to follow in its step.</p>
