   <p>The Tivoli-Festival of the Norwegian Singers' Association ended last night. During the afternoon there was a good sized audience, and in the evening all the halls were pecked.</p>
   <p>The Singers' Association, directed by Emil Bjorn, sang several numbers. Their singing was applauded and encores were demanded. The Glee Club also sang; Alfred Paulsen, directing.</p>
   <p>In the Vaudeville Theatre, several plays were given during the evening, all to audiences which crowded the place, and all receiving well-earned applause. Lund was the star par excellence.</p>

   <p>During the four evenings of the festival, success was written over the whole affair, and Mr. Julius Jaeger, the chairman of the committee, stated to a reporter for the Skandinaven that the financial returns exceeded expectations. The money will make it possible for the singers from Chicago to worthily represent the Norwegians of this city at the Singers' meet in Minneapolis next summer.</p>
   <p>The delegates of the National Association attended, in full on Sunday afternoon, when the Norwegian Glee Club was host.</p>
