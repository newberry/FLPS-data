   <p>It is interesting to note just what literature the Norwegians here read. We find that certain Scandinavian authors are preferred.</p>
   <p>We give below a list of the most popular authors: Bjornstjerne Bjornson, Knut Hamsun, Bernt Lie, Peter Egge, Jacob B. Bull, Thomas Krag, Johan Bojer, Olaf Benneche, Jacob Hilditch, Vilhelm Kras, Hans Aanrud, Alvilda Prydz, Hans Kinck, Johan Falkberset, Andreas Haukland, Gabrie Scott, Arne Garborg, Ragnhilo Jolsen, Mons Lie, Sigrid Unseth, Otto Valseth, Kristian Elster, Jr., Gunnar Heiberg, and Anders Hovden.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that such a writer as Arne Garborg is eighteenth on the list and that Anders Hovden is last. It is also interesting to see Knut Hamsun as number two, while Johan Bojer is seventh, and Sigrid Unseth is twenty-second.</p>
