   <p>With its presentation of "Erotic," last Wednesday, the Norwegian Theatre added another victory to its long list of artistic accomplishments.</p>
   <p>Wied's humorous, satirical play was perfectly presented, and we are unable to pick out any outstanding actor; they were all outstanding in their respective roles.</p>
   <p>There was unity and coordination all along the line, and the audience sat spellbound from beginning to end. It was the most refined and cultural performance that we have ever witnessed.</p>
   <p>The beautiful music between the acts added to the enjoyment.</p>

   <p>The performance will be repeated on Sunday October 12, in Bjorgvin Hall for the benefit of the personnel of the Norwegian Theatre, and we urge everybody to see it.</p>
