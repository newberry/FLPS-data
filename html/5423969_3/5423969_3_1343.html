   <p>It was proposed by Mr. Haugan that the members co-operate with the Norwegian Synod. This started quite a discussion. The following members spoke in favor of the proposal: H. A. Haugan, Dr. Holmboe, the Reverend Mr. Bleken, and John Olsen. Against the proposal were Dr. Karl Sandberg, Dr. Marie Olsen, Dr. Anders Doe, and Peder Olson Skaaden. Those opposed to the proposition stated that they did not believe that the Synod wanted to have anything to do with the Hospital.</p>
   <p>The directors chosen for the next three years are H. A. Haugan, John Oleson, Mrs. William Johnson, Dr. George A. Torrison, Reier Egeland, Christian Anderson, and Inga Johnson.</p>
