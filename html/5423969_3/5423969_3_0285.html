   <p>In spite of inclement weather, the attendance at the bazaar given at Our Savior's Church has been very large, and the income has been proportional.</p>
   <p>Tonight the public will have an opportunity to watch the young men of the church doing business and keeping house. The young men will have charge of everything, including the kitchen service. Only two more nights remain of the bazaar, tonight and tomorrow. It has been a great success.</p>
