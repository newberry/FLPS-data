   <p>On last Wednesday the trial of the case of Botker versus Antonsen was held in Judge Kersten's court. Christian Botker asserted that Carl Antonsen had waylaid him in the lobby of the building in which Revyen (The Review) has its offices. Antonsen said, according to witnesses, that Botker attacked him in every issue of Revyen. The elevator operator said on the witness stand that the litigants quarreled in Danish and in English, and that Antonsen said, "I'll shoot and kill you."</p>
   <p>Botker also claimed that Mrs. Antonsen and her mother had attacked him in the press room of the paper, beating him about the head and shoulders until he nearly fainted. Antonsen, as we know, is the Chicago editor of the Pioneer. Attorney Olaf Ray appeared for Botker, and Attorney Reese for Antonsen.</p>
