   <p>The basket picnic of the Norwegian Glee Club brought many people both members and friends, out to Forrest Glen, Jefferson, last Sunday. The long walk from the streetcar line to the picnic grove probably caused many to stay at home who otherwise would have been present.</p>
   <p>Those present had lots of fun in this beautiful grove; there was no lack of singing and other kinds of enjoyment. The guests returned to Jefferson early enough to escape the heavy rain which started about eight o'clock.</p>
