   <p>Lord of souls, I grant Thy power</p>
   <p>Over gifts bestowed on me.</p>
   <p>Show but mercy in the hour</p>
   <p>When my song shall cease to be!</p>
   <p>For my heart is trembling ever</p>
   <p>Untold thoughts are resting never,</p>
   <p>Pondering life's eternal riddle.</p>
   <p>Take away the singer's garland,</p>
   <p>Fling it to oblivion's shore;</p>
   <p>If but in that vernal far land</p>
   <p>Thou my voice improved restore;</p>
   <p>If but there Thy throne before us,</p>
   
   <p>I may join that lofty chorus</p>
   <p>Swelling to the harps of heaven.</p>
