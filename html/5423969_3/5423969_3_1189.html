   <p>A Short History of the Deaconess Home</p>
   <p>In 1885, in the Bethlehem Church, corner of Center Avenue and Huron Street, Reverend A. Mortensen, of Christiania, Norway, gave a lecture on the "Women's Draconia". This lecture started much discussion and activity.....A few months later a number of Norwegian Lutherans, mostly women, held a meeting and organized the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Society. At first the activities of the Society were rather restricted, consisting in the collection of money, food, and clothing for the sick and needy. The scope of the activities broadened gradually, and soon a fund was being collected for the building of a home and a hospital.....</p>
   <p>Later, factional strife developed, one faction wanting to work only for a hospital, the other faction wanting to build churches and homes [convents]. The latter group soon wanted to break away from the Society.</p>
   <p>The first group, after finally breaking away, organized a new society, known as the "Original Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Society", and made the following change in the constitution: "The Society's purpose shall be to establish a Deaconess Home and Hospital."</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1891 this group achieved considerable success, having at that time secured the services of three Deaconesses in the Norwegian Lutheran Institution of Minneapolis. These three sisters began to participate in the home mission work among the Norwegian Lutherans.</p>
   <p>On November 3, 1891, a house was purchased on Humboldt Boulevard, and was named the "Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess Home and Hospital". The first patient entered the Hospital on December 7, 1891. In 1893 the Home and Hospital was destroyed by fire.</p>
   <p>The calamity broke the organization, financially and morally, but a new society was immediately organized by a few members who would not be defeated. This new group called themselves the Norwegian Tabitha Society. A building fund was again started, and a short while later the Deaconess Home was erected on the corner of Francisco and Thomas Streets. A split caused by factional strife soon occurred, and in 1895 the Society dissolved.</p>
   <p>On February 17, 1896, a meeting was called in the old Bethel Church on Humboldt Street near Armitage Avenue, and the present organization was formed. The new name, the Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess Society, seemed to be more appropriate. The incorporators of the new Society were Dr. N. T. Quales, Reverend A. C. Andersen, and Adolph Larsen. In 1897 the Society rented an eighteen-room building located on the corner of Artesian Avenue and Le Moyne Street. Later, an adjoining building was rented. This made available a total of twenty-five rooms, and thus the first Deaconess Home and Hospital was started.</p>
   <p>The first sister superior came here from Christiania in July, 1897; she had charge of the Hospital until the middle of November. The Chicago climate was not agreeable to her, however, so that she returned to Norway. Sister Oberg from Minneapolis was then appointed sister superior.</p>
   
   <p>In 1890, six lots were purchased on the corner of Haddon Avenue and Leavitt Street where the present Hospital was erected. In 1901 the cornerstone was laid for the new building, and in 1902 the completed building was occupied. The building was dedicated on May 24, 1903 by Reverend T. H. Dahl, president of the United Lutheran Church in America. None of the pastors connected with the Lutheran Church would accept the post of rector at the Hospital. Finally, Reverend H. B. Kildahl, pastor of the Covenant Lutheran Church, accepted and became the institution's first rector. At the same time Sister Marie Larsen was appointed sister superior.</p>
   <p>In 1900, a committee elected by the United Church passed a resolution to the effect that the Church demand the control of the Hospital and the Home. The Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess Home then set up a committee to discuss this matter. The Church gave its committee instructions to take possession of the Hospital as soon as the new building was completed. This was done some time in June, 1903.</p>
   <p>In November, 1904, the United Church purchased the Hospital, and took up the work where the Deaconess Society left off. The Church also insisted that it have the authority to appoint both the rector and the sister superior.</p>
   <p>At the annual meeting of the United Church in 1905, Sister Ingeborg Sponland was appointed sister superior. Sister Ingeborg accepted and took up her duties on May 22, 1906. Since that time the United Church has owned and managed the Hospital.</p>
   <p>In 1909 the cornerstone was laid for an addition to the Hospital. The new addition is being dedicated today.</p>
