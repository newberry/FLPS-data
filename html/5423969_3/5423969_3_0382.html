   <p>The people must read more books. Without books cultural life becomes worthless; it is the book that broadens and develops the mind. I do not know a lot about literature, but I want to do my bit to keep up the discussion in these columns.</p>
   <p>Every young man and young woman should have a collection of books, and it must be a collection of good books. Today books can be had for little money and a well-equipped, library will not cost very much. And our friends who cannot afford to buy books should have the use of our library.</p>
   <p>In the choice of books, much care should be used, and such authors as Ibsen, Bjornson, Lie, Lagerlof, Bull, Dracktman, Holberg, Zola, Dumas Merimee, Tolstay, Shakespeare, Dickens, Twain, and many, many others should be found in every well-selected library. Pick the best, read the best, and you will profit by it.</p>
