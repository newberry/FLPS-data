   <p>The Norwegian National Association's sixth booklet for 1909 contains the annual report of the Association for 1908-1909, and also an account of the annual meeting on June 22.</p>
   <p>The booklet contains two special articles, one by J. B. Wist, the other by J. A. Jacobsen, of Duluth, Minnesota. The former describes the historical growth and development of "Norway in America", the purpose being mainly to give the Norwegians in Norway a better understanding of our people in this country. The latter, which advises the Norwegians to stay on their "Mothers' farms", treats of some of the difficulties connected with the change of homeland. Mr. Jacobsen has seen much which has awakened his ire, and is writing in ink colored somewhat with "heated blood". [Translator's note: There are also articles by Dr. Kohman, Messrs. Quam, H. Rued Holand, and W. Halvorsen.] The subscription price is $4 a year.</p>
