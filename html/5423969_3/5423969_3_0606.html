   <p>The Norwegian immigrants in the United States have in the last hundred years helped to build this country economically, socially, and last but not least, culturally. The Norwegian Church has done its work in such a way that it is sure to be of permanent value. The Norwegian immigrant has founded an excellent press, a press that he can be proud of. Norwegians have been prominent in politics, in banking, in manufacturing, in writing, in music, in poetry, and in art.
