   <p>The Concordia branch of the Old People's Home Society held its monthly meeting on Thursday evening, Sept. 5. The faithful John Pedersen presided over the meeting. Various committees reported. The report of the picnic committee was enthusiastically received, as it accounted for the great success of the Joint Annual Picnic at the Home in Norwood Park. Many contributions are already being made for the coming bazaar, an affair for which we have great hopes.</p>
