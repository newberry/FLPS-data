   <p>p.8........The Norwegian Old People's Home Society is making preparations for their annual spring concert to be held on Wednesday April 26, at Orchestra Hall. The committee has been fortunate in their selection of talent for this event and the evening's program should be a thoroughly pleasing one in every respect. Simultaneously with planning for financial success and a good profit, stress has been put on giving the customers their money's worth.</p>
   <p>A program of vocal and instrumental numbers has been arranged to suit the taste of every listner. Anton Peterson's thirty piece Orchestra will fill the hall with the best of music and the "Chicago Quartette" will contribute the vocal section. Vocal and Piano solos will also be rendered and a group of fifty well-trained children will present a pageant of the seasons.</p>
   <p>Every Norseman in the Chicago area should make a determined attempt to attend this concert both for personal pleasure and to support the work of this efficient institution.</p>
