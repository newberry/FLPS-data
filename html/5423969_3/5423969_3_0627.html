   <p>p.1...On Wednesday, Aug. 9th, Wicker Park Hall was the scene of an enjoyable banquet in honor of a real Norwegian American citizen, Mr. Nicolay Grevstad, editor of Skandinaven. The occasion was a farewell gesture to Mr. Grevstad on the eve of his departure for Paraguay and Uraguay, South America, as American Ambassador, to which he has been confirmed by Congress upon recommendation by President Wm. H. Taft. Special tables were laid for Skandinavens personnel, and for the Dovre lodge, of which Mr. Grevstad is an honored member.</p>
   <p>The speaker,for the occasion, was the prominent Dr. Daa, who spoke feelingly of Mr. Grevstad as a business man, writer and friend, having known him since their student days in Christiania, 1873. Mr. Grevstad came from a family of limited financial means, but his wonderful mind and indomitable courage, and ambition, carried him thru, always at the head of every class. Due to his youth, his appointment as editor of Dagbladet, immediately after his graduation, was viewed with scepticism by the older and more conservative people of the country; but this boy astounded them all with his ability along journalistic and political lines. He was a prized co-worker of Bjornson and Johan Sverdrup and since coming to America, Mr. Grevatad has had several letters from Sverdrup importuning him to return to Norway, to again take up his work there.</p>
   <p>Dr. Daa credited Mr. Grevstad with having done more to create and preserve the pleasant relationship between America and Norway than any one else in the world, a statement that brought forth a hearty three times three "Hurrah" from the assembled guests.</p>
   <p>Dr. Daa thanked Mr. Grevstad on behalf of all Norwegian-Americans in the U.S. A., for his constant friendship and work for their best interests.</p>
   <p>Gratitude for services rendered and for wonderful co-operation was expressed by representatives of the Singer's League, lodges, churches,clubs and various other organizations. Several representatives of Sons of Norway lodges were delegated to express the good wishes of their respective groups and, Nordmendenes, Bjorgvin, and the Glee Club, delivered their greetings via the song route.</p>
   <p>Chicago's Norwegian Consul, Oscar Haugan, gave a dinner in honor of Mr. Grevstad on Tuesday at the Union League Club. The tables were profusely decorated with large American Beauty roses, and the hall was artistically decorated throughout.</p>
   <p>Speakers were Consul Haugan, Dr. Quales, Mr. Beruts, Secretary to Consul Haugan, Mr. Henschen, Swedish Consul, and the seventy-five year old Knut Henderson, who spoke for the Norsemen of the West. Mr. Grevstad was visibly moved by the volume and warmth of praise accorded him and on both occasions found it difficult to control his emotions when he responded to the many tributes paid him.</p>
   
   <p>The two large banquets, together with several smaller affairs, are a fitting tribute to Mr. Grevstad, the U.S.Norsemen's editor, champion and friend. Scandia also wishes him "bon voyage."</p>
