   <p>The great Amateur Athletic Union had expelled about a score of the ablest Norwegian athletes in Chicago because they had participated in the sports events arranged by the Norwegian National League in Brands Park on May 17. The four largest Norwegian sports clubs in Chicago, the Norwegian Turnforening (Turner Society), the Indretsforeningen Sleipner (Sleipner Athletic Club), the Viking Athletic and Ski Club, and the Norge Athletic Club, had sent representatives to compete for the prizes put up by the Norwegian National League. The Norwegian athletic clubs considered the meet a closed one, since only members of the National League could participate. The Amateur Athletic Union's registration committee, however, declared the meet an open one, free for all. In such an "open meet", the Norwegians could have participated under the rules, only if they had received permission from the Amateur Athletic Union. Such permission had not been obtained; hence the expulsion.</p>
   
   <p>To start with, it was somewhat difficult to understand the reason for this attitude on the part of the Union. At the series of conferences later conducted by representatives of the contending parties, the impression gained strength that the intention of the Union was principally to put the fear of God into the Norwegian athletes; that in the opinion of the Union, the Norwegians had displayed signs of independence quite beyond the likings of the officials of the former. These officials, however, had miscalculated. The Norwegians did not behave according to schedule. Far from making a plea for reacceptance into the Athletic Union, the Norwegians put up conditions for their re-entrance into the union, and in the end, the Union submitted.</p>
   <p>The fact is that the Norwegians, together with the Germans, represent the best forces within the sports world of Chicago and the Middle West. And the German clubs on several occasions have shown a tendency to join hands with the Norwegians. So the Amateur Athletic Union had to bow to the inevitable and like it!</p>
   <p>The "expelled" athletes are now qualified to participate in the big meet in Riverview Park next Sunday. Several of them will probably take part.</p>
   <p>Last night the athletic directors of the four clubs in question held a meeting to discuss with other representatives of the clubs the organization of an interstate association for Norwegian athletes. It is rather more than probable that such an association will be formed.</p>
