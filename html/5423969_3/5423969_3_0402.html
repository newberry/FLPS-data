   <p>Dear fellow members: The whole world is today going through a period of reconstruction. Not only is the map of the world being reconstructed but new forms of government are being established and the standards of living and of thinking are also being lead into new channels. The watchword of today is "progress and unity." The engineers are and rightfully should be the leaders in any work involving reconstruction and development. In order to do justice to work of such importance, the engineers must realize the significance of the word unity.</p>
   <p>The aim of the Norwegian Technical Society is to form a nucleus of all Norwegian American architects, engineers and chemists, to raise the standard of their profession and thereby to further the economic and social interest of its members and of others belonging to the same professions. This work has now been going on for several years and will continue for many years to come.</p>
   
   <p>in order to reach our goal we must however increase our membership which naturally has suffered during the past years of depression. It is the duty of each and every member of the N.A.T.S. not only to advertise, but also to secure at least one new member for our organization. By doing this you are furthering your own interest and also the interest of the Norwegian American Technical Society and its branch organization.</p>
