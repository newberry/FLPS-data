   <p>Dr. Karl F.M. Sandberg, prominent Norwegian-American, is not only a man of medicine but an author as well, having recently written and published a book, The Money Trust,which is very interesting. This book will prove of special value during the present election campaign, as it throws light on many hitherto obscure conditions in our social setup, and it should be read by every individual having his own welfare and that of his fellow-men at heart. To quote the title page, the book is "Not published for profit but for use. Not copyrighted and no rights reserved. All or parts may be used at will. Published by the author."</p>
   <p>Scandia's editor has read the book and recommends it to all thinking citizens.</p>
