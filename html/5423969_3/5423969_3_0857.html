   <p>The picnic given by the Sleipner Athletic Club last Sunday, at Elm Tree Grove was well attended in spite of threatening clouds. From the looks of the sky, showers might have been expected any moment.</p>
   <p>In the morning, Sleipner had a procession through the streets of the Northwest Side, headed by the band of the Northern Light Lodge. At about eleven o'clock, the members of the Society traveled to Elm Tree Grove by streetcar. On arrival at the Park the members settled in groups around the many tables to enjoy the luncheon. The Northern Light Band entertained with music during the entire afternoon.</p>
   <p>The participants found entertainment in dancing, croquet, carrousel, etc. A boat race was held and prizes were distributed. [A list of the winners of race is given.] The picnic was a success in every respect.</p>
