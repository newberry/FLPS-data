   <p>Scandia has moved from 2818 North Avenue to 2218 North California Avenue. This is the third time that Scandia has moved. The paper tries to follow the westward movement of the Danish and Norwegian groups. This time Scandia occupies its own building. On the ground floor there will be a large wholesale and retail bookstore. The editors' and publisher's offices will also be on the ground floor. The new location is within walking distance of the Chicago Norwegian Club, the Bjornstjerne Bjornson Lodge, the Norsemen's Singing Society, and other organizations.</p>
