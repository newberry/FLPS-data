   <p>At the last meeting of the Humboldt Park Branch of the Norwegian Society for a Home for the Aged, nine new members were accepted. Each of the new members paid the annual dues of three dollars in advance. The Society is in the midst of a campaign to secure one thousand now members and an increased income of $3,000 per year. The competition between the various branches is as keen as ever existed in a hard-fought political campaign.</p>
   <p>Here's to success, and may the best branch win.</p>
