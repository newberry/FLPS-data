   <p>Report of Ladies' Board</p>
   <p>The Ladies' Board held three regular and two extra meetings during the <span class="page-break">2</span>quarter from April to June.</p>
   <p>During this time all applications received were taken care of to the best of our ability. The three pound parties, held April 5, May 4, and June 7, by different societies, have been a great help to us, and we thank all who helped make it successful. The annual May festival was held on May 30 in St. Paul's English Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>Eight children were confirmed on May 23 by Reverend Lars Harrisville. Through Mr. E. Wurst of the Board of Education, we have obtained a weaving loom, and we hope soon to obtain the services of a competent woman to teach the children to weave. We arranged for our annual picnic to be held on June 26 at the Home. We received liberal donations from all the societies working for the Home. We are indeed thankful to each and everyone for their help at the picnic and it was the best one we have ever had.</p>

   <p>The children at the Home look well and happy. We have a new matron, Miss Amanda Larsen, who has been such a help to the Ladies' Board. She has made confirmation dresses for five girls and has performed numerous other tasks. We are grateful to God for all his mercies toward us, and we know He loves the little ones who are entrusted to us.</p>
   <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
   <p>Mrs. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>Samuelson.</p>
   <p>Secretary of Ladies' Board.</p>
