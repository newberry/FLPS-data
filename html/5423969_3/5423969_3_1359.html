   <p>The Hospital has had many patients of late--as many as forty-five at one time, that is, more than the Hospital can accommodate comfortably. To overcome this lack of room, the board of directors has rented an apartment near by for the use of the nurses, and in this way room has been provided for eight more beds. Yet there is not enough room. One day five patients applying for admission to the Hospital had to be turned away on account of lack of space. The board of directors has frequently called these facts to the attention of the Society, but without results.</p>
