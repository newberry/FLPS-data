   <p>Hjalmar Rued Holand, History of the Norwegian Settlements (Chicago: John Anderson Publishing Company, 1909).</p>
   <p>We have long been waiting for a work such as this, and now that it has arrived, we welcome it warmly. Every Norwegian will need this book, and it will surely be read with great interest by many people in Norway.</p>
   <p>For the present-day Norwegians at home and abroad the narrative of the heroic struggle of the early Norwegian settlers in America, as they built their new homes in this strange country, will remain unique in our national history. Mr. Holand has successfully depicted these struggles in his book.</p>
   <p>Of course, from a man who arrived in America while a child, we can hardly expect a history such as those written by Keyser and Munch, but Mr. Holand's book is, unquestionably, the best work on Norwegian-American history that has appeared in America in the Norwegian language.</p>
