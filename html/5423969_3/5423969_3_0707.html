   <p>The Norwegian Women of Chicago have organized a new club called the Norwegian Women's Club. The purpose of the Club is to gather the Norwegian women of Chicago into one large club. Lectures will be given in both English and Norwegian, and there will be discussions on prose and poetry. The Club will give concerts, and after each concert the music will be discussed. The organization is affiliated with The Federation of Women's Clubs, and will send its delegates regularly to the Federation's meetings.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that the women who organized this Club are the most active women within the colony. [Names omitted in translation.]</p>
