   <p>A socially important and delightful dance was given last evening at the Humboldt Park refectory by the Delta Tau Sigma Sorority, a Greek letter organization of the younger set in the Chicago Norwegian colony. The hall in the refectory was beautifully decorated for the occasion, and a cotillion was given that was pronounced the prettiest and most successful ever witnessed by those present.</p>
   <p>It was a large and happy throng of dancers that filled the ballroom almost to overflowing. With the young men and women in festal attire, the multicolored lights, the dulcet strains of the waltz music, it made a brilliant scene, and a fete long to be remembered by the young folk.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Odd Meyer [Mr. Meyer is a son of Dr. Meyer] acted as chaperons for the following young women, who were in charge of arrangements:</p>
   <p>Margaret Arents, Birgit Giaver, Inger Jacobsen, Janet Jacobsen, Alice Krog, Alice Osland, Edna Pihlfeldt, Mary Sanford, Birgit Schulze, Dagmar Stibolt, and Katherine Stibolt.</p>
   <p>The young women deserve all the credit in the world for the splendid job they did in arranging the most successful affair held in years.</p>
   <p>At this time we have a great number of youngsters attending the University of Chicago.</p>
