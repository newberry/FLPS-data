   <p>p.8.......The "Sons of Norway" picnic at Linden Park, Evanston was a real homey affair, thoroughly enjoyed. During the early hours there seemed little probability of a crowd but before noon the pleasant picnic grounds were teeming with a happy and active throng. Coffee, ice cream and lemonade were in such demand that the committee serving them found no opportunity for even a short breathing spell and while the picnic was not planned for again the committee announces a substantial profit for the day.</p>
