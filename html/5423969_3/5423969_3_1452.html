   <p>Last Wednesday evening the Evangelical Lutheran Home Finding Society held its annual meeting at St. Paul's Church, North Avenue and Leavitt Street. Reverend M. C. Fretheim, the president, gave the following report:</p>
   <p>"To the members of the Home Finding Society:</p>
   <p>"Our first concern should be to thank God for the privilege of being entrusted to care for His little ones, and for His blessings that have enabled us to do this work successfully for another year. Our Home has been spared from serious sickness during the past year; the general health at the Home so far this year has been exceptionally good. One of the regrets of the past year was the resignation of our faithful president, Reverend Gullixon, at the July meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"The present matron, Miss Julia Gilbertson, took up her duties last July 2, Miss Talla Erdahl having resigned because of prolonged illness. Miss Gilbertson has performed her duties with ability and faithfulness, and proved herself to be a very successful matron. Mrs. Amundsen has remained at the Home all year, first as cook, and in the last half of the year to succeed Miss Francis Siegel. As cook Miss Evenson was employed from June 1 until October 15, when the present cook, Mrs. Thrine Backke, entered upon her duties.</p>
   <p>"At the beginning of the present year there were thirty-one children at the Home, fifteen girls and sixteen boys. During the year twenty-seven children have been received and twenty-two have been released. Thirty-six children are now in our charge, of which thirty are in the Home and six are living in private homes. Of the thirty resident children, twenty boys live in the main building and six girls and the four smallest boys live in the cottage, making twenty-four boys and six girls in the Home, <span class="page-break">3</span>and one boy and five girls in private homes. Two children have been placed for adoption. The probation period for one is completed, release secured from the parents, and an opinion has just been received from the Juvenile Court that the adoption proceedings may now be completed in the county where the adoption is to be made. The other adoption is proceeding satisfactorily with prospects that in due time it may be made permanent. Thanks of the Society are due to at least eight different homes that have given children in our charge the love and care of their firesides for periods of from two to six months.</p>
   <p>"We regret to announce that our faithful treasurer, Mr. Ellert Knudsen, is on the sick list. May God grant him a speedy recovery. Thanks are due to the many faithful members and friends for interest and support. A great number of donations were received for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our secretary has sent letters of thanks to the donors, and the president included the whole list in an article in Skandinaven soon after New Year's.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"Among our regular undertakings for the Home during the year that met with singular success, we mention the lawn social, tag day, and pound party. The respective committees and workers are deserving of our hearty thanks. The sewing circle has met regularly throughout the year on the third Wednesday of each month and accomplished much for the Home. The most important matter up for the meeting tonight is the proposed change of the constitution so as to open our membership to all members of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America as well as members of congregations formerly in the Norwegian Lutheran Synod. Four members of the board must be elected as will appear from the report of the nominating committee.</p>
   <p>"As pastor of the Home for eight years, I have enjoyed seeing the large and happy family from the Home in our church and Sunday school. Now a new church of the same denomination has been erected a block from the Home, so, after consulting the board in the matter, I have referred the children to the neighborhood church. I also present to the Society at this meeting my <span class="page-break">5</span>resignation as pastor of the Home. On applying for renewal of license, I found that we first have to clear with the Commissioner of Buildings. A number of exit signs, hand rails, changing of doors, etc., are minor matters and will be attended to at once. However, a more serious matter is the building of a steel stairway fire escape on the main building which will probably cost about $200. The president had a conversation with the Building Commissioner on this subject last week and will receive his ultimatum in a day or so.</p>
   <p>"A source of income and a powerful agency for working up interest for the Home, are the joint meetings of the Ladies Aid Societies of the various churches. Only two meetings were held last year, while four should have been held. The president and other friends made persistent efforts to call a meeting during the last quarter, but without success. We hope that four meetings may be called in 1918, and therefore urge that the invitation to be present at this meeting be accepted, and ask all friends to help make it a banner meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"Dr. Unseth and Attorney Harpel have rendered splendid service to the Home during the past year, and deserve our recognition and hearty thanks. A committee elected by the board recently sent out statements to members, and the results are very encouraging. Not long ago a friend called at the Home and offered a baby to be cared for. A little later someone called and offered a home to a baby. Our matron acted as a central, connected the two on the phone, and now there is one more happy home on the North Side. Recently a lady from the west coast, traveling through Chicago with two children, suddenly went insane. The Travelers' Aid took the case to the Norwegian Counsel, the Counsel to the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital, and the Hospital took the children to our Home. This is another instance of the blessing of having such a home in this great city of Chicago, and also makes clear that we mean what we promised Reverend Kildahl, that we are always willing to co-operate with the church in extending the home finding activity, even before any agreements are made. May God bless the Home Finding Society and make it a blessing in 1918.</p>
   <p>"M. E. Fretheim, President."</p>
