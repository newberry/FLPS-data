   <p>Lately the daily press has printed a number of vicious articles about the "Norwegian Diakonisse Hospital", and the "Diakonisse Home".</p>
   <p>The lies printed, especially in the Herald, were so vicious and slanderous, that we felt something should be done about it. So we asked the Department of Health to make an investigation. When the investigation was completed, a copy of the report was mailed to the Herald, but that honest (?) newspaper refused to print same, stating that they did not care "a damn" about any report--they knew the truth.</p>
   <p>In order to clear up the situation, we publish the report-which reads as follows:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>City of Chicago, Department of Health</p>
   <p>John D., Wace, M. D., Commissioner</p>
   <p>E. Garrott, M. D., Chief Medical Inspector</p>
   <p>July 28, 1892</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>As per your request, I visited the Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess Institute at 190 Humboldt Street, yesterday afternoon, and remained there about one hour,carefully inspecting this place, which is also called the Diakonisse Hospital, and all that appertains to its sanitary environs, and herewith respectfully submit the subjoined report for your perusal.</p>
   <p>"The building is a neat two-story and basement frame structure, erected (all aboveground) upon the rear portion of a lot 41x120 ft., and contains <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>eight rooms on two floors. Four rooms are on the main floor, with pantries, closets, etc., and four rooms with large closets comprise the second floor. Conveniently located in the basement is a water closet which is flushed thoroughly with water; also the laundry with the necessary conveniences, such as kitchen, drying rooms, etc. The plumbing throughout the building is excellent. The traps are good; above and under the sinks the area is dry, sweet and clean. The rooms are well-lighted and well-ventilated, and without describing everything in detail, such as beds, bedding, floors, facilities for caring for patients, etc., the interior appearance is pleasing and is kept scrupulously clean by the Christian Lutheran Sisters in charge.</p>
   <p>"Some of the rooms are of moderate size, one of the largest is the front room situated on the second floor, and may be named a men's ward. This ward contains four beds; each is occupied by an adult male patient; three of the patients have typhoid fever, two of whom are convalescents, while the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>other bed is occupied by a paralytic male adult. Adjoining this room is a smaller front room with one bed which is occupied by an adult male convalescent typhoid case.</p>
   <p>"To the rear of the large ward just described is a women's ward, occupied by two adult patients, one of whom is an aged woman who is a paralytic case, while the other woman occupant of this ward is Margrita Johnson, age 38, afflicted with uterine cancer. Adjoining this rear women's ward is a smaller women's ward, occupied by two patients, one of whom is a convalescent typhoid patient named Miss Sarah Gunderson, age 56.</p>
   <p>"The other patient occupying this ward is Miss Gertie Figwed, age 23; her malady is phthisis.</p>
   <p>"This concludes the number of patients who occupy the four wards of the second floor, summarized thus:</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Four men and one woman whose illness is of a typhoid character; four of these--three men and one woman--are convalescent; two aged cases, both of whom are paralytics, one male and one female; one case, uterine cancer; one case phthisis pulmonalis; this patient sits up most of the time. This is the young lady referred to above.</p>
   <p>"The front room of the first floor is large and airy, and is occupied by Sister Matie Langanet who is seriously ill with typhoid fever, her illness having already extended over a period of four weeks. Her constant companions or nurses are Sister Bertha Berg, Diakonisse, and Sister Amalia Kittelson, Diakonisse, who alternate night and day in tenderly administering to their afflicted sister; if her illness should prove fatal, it can truthfully be said of her that she gave up her life in devotion to the cause of nursing and relieving others.</p>
   <p>"In addition to the sisters named, there is Sister Esther Koldrup, Secretary <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of the Tabitha Deaconess Society; she, however, does not reside in the hospital as do the others.</p>
   <p>"Reverend N. C. Brun is the estimable president of the Society; his residence is No. 64 Humboldt Blvd.</p>
   <p>"You asked me to report upon the treatment, or rather the disposition of the body of Chas. J. Ellefsen. Mr. Ellefsen died of typhoid fever at the hospital a few days ago. To be exact, his death occurred last Saturday morning, the 23rd; his body was embalmed and placed in a casket, thence carefully removed at 10 A. M. from the second story of the hospital, via the outside stairway leading from the yard to the room where he died. This course was adopted because otherwise the undertaker and his two assistants would have been obliged to pass with the casket containing the body through the room where poor Sister Matie Langanet was ill, before reaching the small house in the rear of the adjacent lot where the remains of Ellefson were placed. This was done carefully and decently, and the casket remained there, carefully secured until <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>nine o'clock Sunday morning. There was nothing revolting in this procedure, on the other hand, the improvised death house or morgue has the appearance of cleanliness throughout its interior, and I took special pains to inquire into the condition of these premises also.</p>
   <p>"Pastor Brun preached a funeral sermon Sunday morning, the 24th, over the remains of Ellefson, at the church whence they had been taken for this purpose, and after this Christian service, the remains were borne to one of the cemeteries for interment.</p>
   <p>"While at the hospital I conversed with the pastor and the sisters above-named upon various matters, and also (unaccompanied by any of the attendants) with Carl Oulie, age 23, six weeks ill with typhoid fever; John Johnson, age 34, who had been there four weeks, suffering with this disease; P. S. Lee, age 42, who had been three months ill with typhoid, he having suffered a relapse a few weeks ago; Miss Gertie Figwed who had been there eight weeks, for previously mentioned reasons; Miss Sarah Gunderson, who had been there <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>two weeks; Mrs. Margrita Johnson, who had been confined for the past six weeks, and with others, and they all united in expressing the highest words of praise, regarding the universal kindness these sisters had extended to them while at the hospital.</p>
   <p>"The garbage refuse is cremated in the large range in the kitchen. The water used is first boiled, then filtered or strained through a linen cloth, placed in a fine sieve, and afterwards placed in a zinc receptacle in a large refrigerator containing an abundant supply of ice.</p>
   <p>"The alley to the rear of the building, extending north from Cortland Street, is in good condition, no decaying vegetable or organic matter was noticed.</p>
   <p>"The Society operated by these good Sisters charges $7.00, $5.00, and $3.50 per week for nursing, professional services, medicines, food, etc., and in indigent cases (the latter are probably the greater number admitted), no <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>charge is made. The hospital was first opened November 1st, 1891. One month later, December 1st, the first patient was admitted, and to date ninety-nine patients in all have been received, one patient having typhoid fever being admitted during the hour and a half that I was at the hospital yesterday. Of this number, six have died from the following diseases:</p>
   <p>"Two of consumption, one of old age (85 I was informed), one of brain disease, and two of typhoid fever. The last named was Ellefson who was brought to the hospital in a moribund condition, and was not expected to recover.</p>
   <p>"The Society admits sufferers from all types of disease except small pox, scarlet fever and diphtheria. Patients of all creeds and nationalities are admitted, although to date none but Scandinavians have applied for admission. I might state in addition to those I have named, that there are other women nurses, besides two scrub women, one washerwoman, one cook, and one night watchman.</p>
   <p>"So far as I am aware, this is the first hospital of the kind established by <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>this Society anywhere in the West, and I am pleased to add in conclusion that there are other points I could suggest in this report is necessary. The fact that this Society is performing a Christian and noble duty, their devotion to cause and principle, almost without hope of pecuniary reward, I may say, should merit success and the best wishes of a well-disposed and philanthropic public".</p>
   <p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Liston H. Montgomery,</p>
   <p>Medical Inspector.</p>
