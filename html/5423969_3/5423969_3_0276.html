   <p>Nordmaendenes Sangforening (Norwegian Singing Society) held its annual carnival on Saturday February 25. The occasion held a double feature in Addition to the date marked the 40th anniversary of this well known chorus.</p>
   <p>The carnivals given by the chorus an increasing in popularity due to the quality of entertainment offered on every occasion. This chorus, unlike most others, does not base its popularity upon a masquerade but gives greater consideration to its own vocal presentations. Last year's program featured "Sigurd Jossalfar" while this year was presented through Pirate chorus of Verdis Opera "Ernani." This presentation was very well done in spite of the seemingly thankless effort of singing such a high class composition to a carnival minded public. While the carnival spirit permeated the entire crowd, the hearty applause given the chorus for its offerings was very encouraging. Socially and financially the anniversary was a decided triumph and "Nordmaendenes" wants to thank all who contributed to the success of the occasion.</p>
