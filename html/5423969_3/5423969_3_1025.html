   <p>"Barnevennen" (The Children's Friend) has arranged a concert to be held at Bjorgvin's Hall, at 3 P.M. on March 10th. The "Friend" is now thirteen years old, and has done wonderful work for the children of our local orphanage and for many poor children outside the home; Scandia urges all, who possibly can, to attend the concert in support of this worthy cause.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the concert will be used to purchase an electric bread-making machine for the home.</p>
