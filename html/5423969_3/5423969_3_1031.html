   <p>p.8.col.3..."Anna Kolbjornsdatter," lodge of the "Daughters of Norway," held its first social evening on Saturday, Dec. 3. The affair was a success in every way and was fittingly rated a worthy supplement to the "Bjornstjerne-Bjornson" recent gathering. We are pleased to announce the commendable decision by both these lodges that liquors are to be barred from all social gatherings, and that such affairs are to be strictly for members and their families only. This decision is based upon the aim of making and keeping the sick benefit fund self-supporting. These two lodges are numerically the largest in their respective sections of the "Sons"and "Daughters", and the steadily increasing membership of both is evidence of the popularity of the organization.</p>
