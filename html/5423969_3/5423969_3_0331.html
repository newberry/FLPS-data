   <p>A few months ago Mr. and Mrs. Anton Nelson invited a group of friends to their home, 2514 Spaulding Avenue. All of the guests were interested in books. Miss Lucille Le Furgey, gave a talk on Ibsen's, The Lady of the Sea. The people present were so taken by this clear and interesting talk that they at once decided to organize a literary club, and meet once a month. It was also decided to read and discuss all the works of Ibsen, Bjornson, and other Scandinavian authors. The Club will also cover other European literature. The Club has fifty members and more men and women join at each meeting.</p>
