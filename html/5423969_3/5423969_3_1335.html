   <p>....Dr. Karl Sandberg has proposed certain changes in the constitution of the Tabitha Hospital Society. As presented in the October 16 issue of Skandinaven, his proposal is that the paragraphs in the constitution which refer to the committee on spiritual matters should be eliminated.</p>
   <p>If the paragraphs referred to are to be cut out, however, it would seem that the doctor ought to have proposed also that the term "Lutheran" be omitted from the name of the Hospital....There is, on the whole, considerable lack of understanding on the part of the doctor as to the relationship of the Tabitha Society and the Hospital to the Norwegian nationality and to the Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>According to its constitution the Tabitha Society is not a strictly Norwegian <span class="page-break">\2</span>organization; every person of Scandinavian birth or descent and who is of good repute may become a member of the Society. If the Society is to be characterized with regard to nationality, it would have to be called Scandinavian. As regards the relation of the Society to religion, it is well known that no requirements are made as to religious beliefs for membership in the Society, which, consequently, is nonconfessional. While the Society, according to its constitution, is nonconfessional, both the constitution of 1894 and that of the present day show, however, that the Society desires to maintain close relations with the Lutheran Church. Both the name of the Society and the part of the constitution which Dr. Sandberg wants eliminated testify to this desire. The Society did not consider itself competent to take care of the spiritual work at the institutions it intended to build; for this reason it placed that part of its labor in the hands of ministers who belong to the Society and at the same time serve congregations subscribing to the Lutheran faith.</p>
   <p>In addition to the hospital patients we must also consider the inmates of <span class="page-break">\3</span>the home for the aged maintained in conjunction with the Hospital. It is the care of the souls of these old people to which the ministers belonging to the Society are devoting themselves. The ministers visit the Hospital in accordance with the constitution of the Society, which Dr. Sandberg himself helped to revise. And in spite of this Dr. Sandberg ventures to say "that ministers hold public worship at the Hospital without authorization or invitation on the part of the Society or its board of directors."</p>
   <p>Dr. Sandberg's dislike for public worship at the Hospital must be of long standing, for this worship is not a novel scheme recently introduced by Lutheran ministers. Public worship has been in use at the Hospital since the very beginning. The patients value this worship; even those who do not understand Norwegian like it. It would be as improper for Dr. Sandberg to prescribe to the committee on spiritual matters how the care of souls is to be provided for as for this committee to prescribe to the doctor how he is to treat his patients. The spiritual care at the Hospital has been placed in our hands by the very constitution of the Hospital Society; it <span class="page-break">\4</span>is Dr. Sandberg's fault that he did not discover this sooner. Finally, Dr. Sandberg gets around to propose a move which he strongly condemns at the beginning of his article. "Ought it not be left to the Society, through its board of directors, to see to it that the patients receive proper spiritual care?"</p>
   <p>But if this be done, does it not mean that the Society has undertaken to maintain spiritual care at the Hospital? Does not the Society undertake the task of the churches in such a case? But if it does, then the Tabitha Society has become the very thing Dr. Sandberg so strongly opposes--a church society.</p>
   <p>It is evident that in the doctor's explanation the premises point in one direction and the conclusion in another. Consequently, the conclusion nullifies the premises.</p>
