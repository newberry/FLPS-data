   <p>Last Wednesday evening, Mr. Johannes Liabo gave a lecture at Zion's Norwegian Lutheran Church on the topic, "The Aztec Indians". The lecture was given for the benefit of the building fund of the Deaconess Society. A large audience was present, and the lecture was listened to with great interest.</p>
   <p>The speaker presented facts about the remarkable culture of the Aztecs, who were living in Mexico before Columbus discovered America. The ruins remaining after them have caused great wonderment and interest among scientists. One of the last emperors of this people believed in and worshiped an unknown god who had created the heavens and the earth, and erected an altar for him. This same emperor also built the first hospital in America.</p>
   <p>Before and after the lecture, the Covenant Male Quartet sang.....</p>
