   <p>Why is it that the Danes and the Norwegians do not read the new Scandinavian literature recently received at the public library? It is depressing to see the shelves full of good books, standing there day in and day out, and never read. We, the Scandinavians at the library, almost have to use force to get our people to read Scandinavian books. The library spends, annually, quite a big sum of money, both in Norway and Denmark, for new books. Last year, three thousand volumes of Danish and Norwegian books were bought--a broad selection to suit every reader, classical, historical, "dishwater stories" and detective fiction. Also a great number, of travel books, biographies and lyrical books. The library also has thousands of volumes of drama. We have, for example, Elster's "History of Scandinavian Literature," never read by anyone. "The History of Norway, in twenty volumes--no, one reads it.</p>
   <p>I feel that it is an illusion that our Scandinavian-Americans read a lot. Just an illusion, a beautiful illusion.</p>
