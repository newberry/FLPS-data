   <p>With all due respect for Norwegian pastors and in behalf of my countrymen, I object emphatically against having any pastor appointed as director for any library. Poor Mayor Medill, if you do appoint ministers for such jobs, I am afraid the church will excommunicate you. Don't send the minister in the fight for the free library.</p>
