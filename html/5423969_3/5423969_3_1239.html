   <p>The two boards of directors [the Sandberg and the Synod factions] of the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital Society held a joint meeting at Wicker Park Hall last Tuesday. Although few members were present, business was transacted as usual.</p>
   <p>The president, H. Stoltenberg, called the meeting to order, and the secretary, Mr. Rommen, read the minutes of the last quarterly meeting. The president pointed out that the affairs of the hospital had improved, even though the financial status was about the same.</p>
   <p>The credit of the hospital is sufficient to carry on, and with the income from bazaars and other affairs, and the legacy of $2,000 left by Mr. George F. Bessesen the board felt that many improvements could be accomplished.</p>
   
   <p>The secretary read the financial report as follows:</p>
