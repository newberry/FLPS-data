   <p>The Sleipner Athletic Society has just celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. It was a double festival, so to speak, because the Society at the same time welcomed home the dough boys and Jack Tars, who had just returned.</p>
   <p>Sleipner has more than three hundred members and a cash balance in five figures. This is a great change from the days when they met in a basement, and picked coal on the railroad tracks. Most of the members, in the early days, were new- comers, and jobless beside; so, naturally, dues were slow in coming in. It is very different today.</p>
