   <p>Nye Nordmanden (The New Norseman) was [recently] bought by the Danish ward heeler, C. A. Quist. Mr. Quist owned the paper for a couple of weeks and then sold it to Peer O. Stromme. The journal was for a long time socialist, atheist, and free-thinker.</p>
   <p>We feel sorry for Nye Nordmanden; its days are few. Whenever Peer tries to edit a paper, the paper suffers and slowly and painfully dies. Well, Peer can soon preach another funeral sermon.</p>
