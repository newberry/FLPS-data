   <p>In the last issue of Skandinaven we read a quarterly report from the Tabitha Hospital, submitted by Dr. Marie Olsen. The report is made up of beautiful words and a few figures. It certainly would take a Philadelphia lawyer to understand it. Why not give a statement in clear language, confined to an account of the status of the hospital, telling us what it owes, and what. its assets are? Instead of this Dr. Olsen raves about individuals who have merely done their duty.</p>
   <p>Some time ago Dr. Olsen reported that "she wanted to build a new hospital". Now, in her April report, she says that she has changed her mind, and at the meeting of the board of directors and the trustees the matter is to be taken up again. Lest we forget, Dr. Marie Olsen appointed, more than a year ago, the straw men called "trustees"; they were not elected.</p>
   <p>Senator Johan Waage resigned from the committee in a huff at the last meeting. Now we have Dr. Marie Olsen, president, Miss Olsen, head nurse, and Mr. Olsen, treasurer. This is the board of directors, and the board of trustees is the Olsen board.</p>
