   <p>The statement made at a recent meeting of the Allied Patriotic Societies that there are two thousand foreign language papers in the United States which attack our government, is an unwarranted charge against a section of our press which for the most part is thoroughly American in spirit, and which constitutes the most important force in encouraging the immigrant to learn English and to become a citizen. These papers serve the useful purpose of acquainting the foreign-speaking people of the country with our American institutions and of helping the newcomer to adjust himself to his new environment.</p>
   <p>As part of its work with the foreign language press, the Foreign Language Information Service is regularly reading eight hundred foreign language papers, more than six thousand issues every month. We do not accuse them of being un-American or disloyal. Quite the reverse is true. A careful analysis shows that <span class="page-break">2</span>they are, for the most part, concerned with American matters, and they divide on political issues in just about the same proportions as do our English language papers. A study of 8,500 editorials in our foreign language newspapers showed that they do not differ essentially in subject or emphasis of editorial comment from the vernacular press. Just as with English language newspapers there are a few radical papers, but they are in a very small minority. As a whole the foreign language press is loyal and conservative.</p>
   <p>The foreign language papers do not have to be urged to print material relative to America, her laws and institutions. They are only too glad to do so. They want facts, however, not propaganda. As one editor expressed [it] in a letter to the Service:</p>
   <p>"You seem to know exactly what is of importance and interest to the immigrant reader...and you never inject offensive propaganda of any sort. That is the best method of Americanizing--not by coercion, abuse, preaching, nagging, bragging..."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Hundreds of other editorials and letters have expressed similar appreciation of information about America.</p>
   <p>In its work, the Foreign Language Information Service has the hearty co-operation of the Federal Government which has long recognized the value of utilizing the great force represented by the foreign language newspapers. It has realized that many immigrants coming here as adults will never be able to learn to read English with sufficient facility to understand American history and government unless the information is made available in their mother tongue.</p>
   <p>In a letter dated November 7, the Secretary of State wrote to the Service as follows:</p>
   <p>"In helping the immigrant to become an asset to American industry and to American life as a whole, I am convinced that there is no more important task than to acquaint him with our standards, customs, laws, and institutions. This you are doing through your practical and helpful releases to the foreign language press."</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The United States Commissioner of Education has spoken in similar terms. In a recent letter to the Service he says:</p>
   <p>"The Foreign Language Information Service has the hearty approval and the cordial support of the United States Bureau of Education....By translating pertinent portions of our publications and supplying the substance of them to the foreign language publishers in their own language, you have greatly extended the circulation of the information which it is our duty to diffuse. You have thus helped us; you have aided the cause of public education, and you have been of material assistance in forwarding the Americanization of our foreign-born citizens.</p>
   <p>To believe that just because a newspaper is printed in a foreign language it must be radical, reflects a surprising provincialism. If those who worry about the loyalty of the immigrant would worry more about giving him a square deal, the country would have less reason for concern. Loyalty cannot be inculcated by command or threat. As an Italian editor said in a recent editorial: "In order to love a country, particularly a great, vast, and complex country like America, <span class="page-break">5</span>it is necessary, before everything else, to know her."</p>
   <p>If the newcomer is made to feel at home, if he believes that he has an equal opportunity, and that America cares about giving him a square deal, no question as to his affectionate loyalty for his adopted country will arise. A sympathetic understanding on the part of native-born Americans of their foreign-born neighbor and his special problems is a vital factor in furthering the immigrants' assimilation and in the matter of national unity.</p>
