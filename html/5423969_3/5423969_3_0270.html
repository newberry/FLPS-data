   <p>p.1....The Norwegian Singers' League, composed of Norwegian male choruses of Chicago, held their annual banquet at the Bjorgvin Hall last evening. There were 150 guests at the banquet table when they partook of a complete assortment of traditional Norwegian Christmas delicacies. Mr. Zimmerman, the retiring president, introduced the incoming officials headed by Mr. Lyder Birkedal (Normendenes) president, who thanked the 1911 officers for work well done and exhorted all singers to continue their faithful service, in their own choruses and in the league and predicted a good year for the league and its members. At the close of the banquet Dr. Doe announced that Julius Jaeger, Bjorgvin's president for many years, would celebrate his 50th birthday or Christmas Eve and on that occasion he is to be decorated by the Christian University Students Chorus. Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Birkedal were decorated with the jewel of the order and diplomas given both men. This knighthood is much coveted by Norwegians, especially those in foreign lands, and is bestowed for outstanding service in the realm of Norwegian song.</p>
