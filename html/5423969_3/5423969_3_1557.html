   <p>A large number of friends of the Norwegian Orphanage took advantage of the fine weather on Sunday afternoon to witness the breaking of ground for the new buildings which are to be erected this fall for the Norwegian Orphanage, in Edison Park.</p>
   <p>After the singing of a hymn, the president of the Orphanage society read from the Scripture and led in prayer. Then Reverend C. K. Solberg gave a brief address in Norwegian. Another hymn was sung, whereupon Reverend T. Sigmond spoke in English.....Reverend Ellestad then dedicated the lot.....thrusting the first spade into the ground where the new buildings are to be erected.</p>
   <p>The matron of the Orphanage, Sister Caroline, made the next spade cut, after <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which everyone was given an opportunity to join in the ground breaking. Many of those present took part.</p>
   <p>Everybody was enthusiastic about the place as an ideal site for a children's home. Here the children have ample room to play in; the air is pure; and there will also be opportunity for the children to do farm work, and thus to learn to love an active life.</p>
   <p>The place will also be quite an ideal location for future picnics to be held by friends of the children.</p>
