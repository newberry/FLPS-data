   <p>At a recent meeting of the Scandinavian World's Fair Committee, the decisions and resolutions were as follows:</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian Committee believes that Garfield Park rather than the Lake Front should be used as the site for the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>It suggests that the National groups which have elected committees meet at a general meeting in order to discuss the final plans, and thereafter meet with the City Committee.</p>
   <p>We are sure that the Fair will be held here in Chicago, and the final preparations should be made now...The newspapers are to give as wide publicity as possible.</p>
