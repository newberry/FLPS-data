   <p>The Norwegian Tabitha Hospital has existed for seven years. Even the most optimistic friend of the Hospital will hardly claim that we have made very noticeable progress during this period. On the contrary, our financial position is not good at all. How to correct this situation, how to escape stagnation while other hospitals move ahead--that is the problem which the true friends of the Hospital have to consider.....It seems to me that the natural step to take now is to study the methods of other hospitals so as to find how they manage to progress. In doing so we find that there is not a single benevolent hospital in Chicago which is not backed by some church organization. And why? Because the well-organized church bodies are permanent and therefore are able to insure financial security even for such an expensive institution as a hospital with modern equipment. No other organization possesses the absolutely necessary stability, I might say, changelessness.</p>

   <p>Since we do not know any better church body to turn to, it seemed quite natural to try to secure for the Hospital the support of the Norwegian Synod; and this is the reason for Mr. H. A. Haugan's proposal. To me the whole matter resolves itself simply into a....question of raising money.</p>
   <p>It is not quite clear to me how there could be raised any reasonable objections to the proposal. It has been said that the proposal aims to take the Hospital away from the Norwegians in Chicago in order to "give" it to the Norwegian Synod. By no means! The Synod cannot accept the Hospital as its property even though we might be willing to "give" it to the Synod. On the contrary, if Mr. Haugan's proposal is passed, it means extra expense, a burden to the Synod. Besides, I had the belief that the Norwegian Synod consists of Norwegian men and women, and that these represent the Norwegian people as well as do we who do not belong to the church.</p>
   <p>It has also been hinted that the change might, more or less, hold back and prevent the doctors' hospital work, since the ministers, "the naughty ministers", <span class="page-break">3</span>might interfere with the doctors' work. I do not believe such fear is well founded. During my years of daily work at the Tabitha Hospital I have never heard a single complaint about the work of the ministers there. A short while ago I had a conversation with Dr. Fenger, and he assured me that during his long hospital activity he had never found the church a hindrance, but rather a help, and the best hospitals, at which he works, all have the backing of some church body or other.</p>
   <p>Until the opposing side in this matter presents some practical proposal which at least presents a possibility for the advancement of the interests of the Tabitha Hospital in a safe and sane manner, I shall feel obliged, therefore, to speak and vote for Mr. Haugan's proposal.</p>
