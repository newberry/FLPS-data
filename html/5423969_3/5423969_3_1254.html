   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Society was organized in 1885 by eight women. It was resolved for the time being to meet every Tuesday. The Society was to sew clothing for the needy and charge dues of five cents per month. One third of the dues were set aside for the building of a home to care for poor and needy people who were sick. Mrs. Caroline Clement was elected president, Miss Maria Noroos, secretary, and Mrs. Louise Johnson, treasurer. The other organizers were Mrs. Maria Ursin, Mrs. Anna Johnson, Mrs. Kaia Thime, and Miss Christina Brown.</p>
   <p>The Society grew, and in 1888 the program was changed to include the building of a hospital and a Deaconess home, but in 1889 a majority decided to work only for the building of a hospital. It was also decided that the board would consist of eighteen men. Women were, therefore, taboo on the board. This caused a split, and many of the older members quit the Society and <span class="page-break">\2</span>organized the "Original Tabitha Society". In February, 1891, the "Original" called the Sisters Amalia, Martha, and Maria from the Deaconess Home in Minneapolis, and then bought a frame building at 190 [old number] Humboldt Street. On December 1, 1891 the Deaconess Home and Hospital was opened in this building. Sister Amalia was head Deaconess. In August, 1892, Sister Maria died, but the other two carried on. In August, 1893, the Home and Hospital burned to the ground. Before the fire that destroyed all the property of the Society, negotiations had been started to amalgamate the two Tabitha Societies, and on June 7, 1892, this was done at Our Savior's church.</p>
   <p>On June 3, 1892, the cornerstone of the new hospital was laid. On October 24, the new hospital was dedicated. The Society elected the following board in April, 1894: Oscar M. Torrison, A. P. Johnson, Captain John Anderson, P. O. Skarden, John Kalheim, and Dr. [Niles T.] Quales. Later there was another split, one group wanting trained nurses in the Hospital, another group insisting that practical nurses were good enough. On December <span class="page-break">\3</span>26, Miss Martha Ellingsen was appointed superintendent of nurses and Sisters Amalia and Martha refused to work under her.</p>
   <p>At the convention in 1895, the question of "Deaconess" or "Norwegian Hospital" was to be decided. This caused a lengthy discussion and nearly brought about another split.</p>
