   <p>One of the largest women's literary societies celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary last night. The Aurora Borealis Lodge has a membership of twenty women who are interested in literature, art, and music.</p>
   <p>The Lodge was organized in 1889 by Mrs. Erica Philfeldt. A large number of Scandinavian books were purchased, and all of them were read and discussed. These ladies were interested in prose and poetry alike, and many were the interesting discussions held during the long winter nights.</p>
   <p>Today, Aurora Borealis has over two thousand books. When new books are bought, a certain number of the old ones are raffled; in this way, the society is enabled to secure new books regularly.</p>
