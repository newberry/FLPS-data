   <p>The book brings a greeting from your own cradle; from the trees around which you played when a child; from the house in which you received your training; from the door through which you passed on the day of your emigration; from your father, mother, sister, and brother over in Norway.</p>

Norge I Billeder will be a welcome guest in the home of every Norwegian in America. During the long winter evenings the book will be a source of enjoyment for everyone who procures it. The book takes you by the hand, as it were, guiding you from the Naze to the North Cape, past wild mountain ranges, over ridges, up and down narrow valleys or dales, across glittering fjords and lakes, among thousands of islets and peninsulas; and after such a fairy tale journey you will gain a new and living conception of the glory which is our old homeland, Norway.</p>
