   <p>Mr. Hauman G. Haugan, Norwegian-American banker of Chicago, demonstrates the fact that bankers have hearts as well as heads. Mr. Haugan recently presented the Norwegian Bethesda Home for the Aged with twenty large, comfortable rockers, in which the oldsters can enjoy fresh air and sunshine on the spacious porches of the home. For such as are unable to walk, he has provided wheel chairs so that they can get out in the open air. The Bethesda Home is one of our largest Norwegian benevolent institutions and one of the best. Here the poorest oldster is admitted without entrance fee, and tenderly cared for during the remaining years of his life. The plight of these people is heart stirring. The contented look on their faces makes one feel that there are kind hearts in this hard old world, after all.</p>
