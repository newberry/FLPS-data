   <p>The Norse Discovery of America. By Andrew Fossum, Ph. D. Dr. Fossum has proved in his book that the Norse did discover America. He tells of the famous voyages to Iceland, Greenland, and the American Coast. He describes, in the words of the original chronicler and in the light of the latest researches and of a personal visit to every place mentioned in the sagas, the whole voyage in detail, and this he does in a manner that will command attention and produce conviction.</p>
   <p>This book should be read both by Norwegians and by Americans, so that they at least may feel the satisfaction of knowing positively that the discovery of America by the Norsemen is not a vain boast but a real fact and in the future must be accepted as a fact by every nationality.</p>
