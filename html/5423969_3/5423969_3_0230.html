   <p>The committee is now making preparations for the third annual meet at Riverview Park..........The endeavor to bring Scandinavian singers closer together is steadily progressing. Approaches have now been made to the American-Scandinavian Foundation, which has promised to give support to the movement, since it is considered a link in the cultural progress of the Scandinavian people in this country. It seems possible that the committee may receive financial support from the foundation not in the form of direct monetary contributions, but a guarantee to cover possible deficits. Such guarantee would give new impetus to the work of co-operation among the singing associations of the Scandinavian nationalities.</p>
   <p>The librarian of the University of Chicago, James C. M. Hanson has made the following movement and is of interest with reference to the song festival to be held: "Many American music societies have undertaken of late to take up the music <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of Grieg, Gade, and other Scandinavian composers. Although in command, as a rule, of excellent music material, the results have not been quite "of grade." The execution has seemed feeble and monotonous in comparison with the presentations of the Scandinavian singers. Where understanding and execution of genuine Nordic music is concerned, we shall probably, in the future as in the past, have to depend upon Americans of Scandinavian descent.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, our Scandinavian singing societies consist almost exclusively of men whose economic position does not make it possible for them to devote much of their time or means to music. For this reason it would be very desirable if some man of wealth could be prevailed upon to take the matter in hand. Through a legacy or fund for the purpose of promoting and preserving the best in Nordic music,"the giver could add greatly to cultural service."</p>
