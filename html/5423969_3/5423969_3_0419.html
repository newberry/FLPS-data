   <p>The Scandinavian Medical Society held its annual meeting in the quarters of the Swedish Club on Thursday, October 12.</p>
   <p>The retiring president, Doctor Klovstad, spoke of the significance of this society to Scandinavians and its influence and status in medical circles. The organization has created a strong feeling of fellowship and co-operation between the Scandinavians and Americans and has made valuable contributions in the line of medical and surgical research.</p>
   <p>Doctor Klovstad urged the society to affiliate with the medical societies of Norway, Sweden and Denmark, pointing out mutual advantages of such co-operation, and the resultant benefits to mankind. Doctor William J. Anderson was elected president, Doctor O. H. Berg, vice president, and Doctor Halvor O. Hansen, secretary for the coming year.</p>
   <p>Following the election, the meeting was addressed by Doctor B. Meyer, who <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>gave a humorous talk on the early days of the society; all of the anecdotes struck a responsive chord and jollity reigned supreme.
