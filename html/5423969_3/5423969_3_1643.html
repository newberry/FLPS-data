   <p>Following are the minutes of the meeting of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society, held at the First Lutheran Church, Fullerton Avenue and Ballou Streets, January 31, 1921:</p>
   <p>In the absence of the president and the vice-president, the secretary called the meeting to order and Reverend Louis Moe led in Scripture reading and prayer. Upon motion made and carried, Mr. Albert Petersen was elected chairman of the meeting and presided.</p>
   <p>The reports of the president, Mr. Lars Enger (at present in Florida), and the vice-president, Mr. J. A. Paasche, were read and accepted. Other reports were made by the secretary, treasurer, auditors, pastors, assistant secretary, and matrons. Reports were also given on the Endowment Fund (by Mr. Albert Petersen, secretary), the Ladies' Board, and the Young Ladies' Aid. The following <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>branches reported: Bethlehem, Concordia, Humboldt Park, Logan Square, Norwood Park, and Wicker Park.</p>
   <p>All candidates nominated by the branches were elected to office. Messrs. Kramer, Bauer, and Kolseth were elected to the auditing committee for 1921.</p>
   <p>Dr. Dammann asked permission to arrange for a lecture by Mr. J. W. Reber, of Alaska. Mr. Dammann felt that such a lecture would realize a considerable sum for the Home. Others spoke in favor of it, and the matter was finally referred to a joint board meeting.</p>
   <p>Reverend M. L. Nesvig introduced Reverend D. Kvasse as his successor as pastor of the Home. Reverend Kvaase in very befitting words thanked the Society for the opportunity to serve as pastor at the Home; he assured all that he loved the work and had begun to make friends fast the few times he had been out there.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>It was moved and carried that a vote of thanks be telegraphed to Mr. Lars Enger for his untiring and faithful work as president of the Society. It was also voted that a letter of thanks be sent to the First Lutheran Church for the use of the church parlor for our annual meeting. A letter of thanks was sent to Skandinaven for the liberal use of their paper in helping the Society's good work for the old people.</p>
   <p>A rising vote of thanks was given all outgoing officers, and a resolution was ordered sent to Mrs. Niles T. Quales who was unable to attend this meeting. As there was no further business at hand the meeting adjourned.</p>
   <p>President's Report</p>
   <p>The twenty-fifth year of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society's history seems worthy to stand out as one of its memorable years, for we have undergone changes and experiences which are rather unusual.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>In the month of January an epidemic of influenza struck our beloved city with tremendous force, resulting in an appalling death rate, and the Old People's Home had its full share of the scourge. From twenty-five to thirty of the residents were ill for nearly three months, and the Home was under quarantine for about that length of time, being visited by inspectors from the Health Department two or three times a week. Even the matron was stricken with the disease and extra nurses had to be engaged; they were not easy to secure for all kinds of help was very scarce.</p>
   <p>In about three weeks, during the latter part of January and the first part of February, seven of the residents died from the disease--an experience our Home never had before and, we hope, will never have again. In the spring the ordinary health conditions of the Home were restored, but the Matron, Miss Caroline Anderson, who had served faithfully in that capacity for about seven years, saw fit to resign for much needed rest. She left us on May 1, and we were fortunate in securing her successor, Mrs. Emma Anfang, who has been managing the Home with a great deal of fidelity ever since, even under the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>most trying circumstances of not being able to secure enough help to do the necessary work. Much credit is due her.</p>
   <p>The usual schemes for raising money for the Home were carried out. Advertising in our annual report was handled very successfully by the advertising manager, Mr. A. O. Satrang, and more money was raised from this source than ever before. Tag day, midsummer festival, picnic, and bazaar--these activities, conducted by our good ladies, were all very successful. This was especially true of the bazaar which resulted in receipts far beyond our best expectations, and all the active members of our Society have reason to be proud of the results.</p>
   <p>The movement to advance the Norwegian Old People's Home Society's Endowment Fund started during the latter part of 1919. While not quite satisfactory, because of lack of interest among the individual members, it resulted in about doubling the fund, and the effort was worth the time and energy put into it.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Financially the Home is in better shape than ever in spite of the fact that the running expenses amounted to nearly $26,000, the banner year as far as expenses are concerned. The present outlook indicates that the cost of operating the Home next year should decline at least twenty per cent.</p>
   <p>The charitable work of the Society in 1920 amounted to about seventy-five per cent, the same as last year. It cost the Society $250 for each resident in the Home during the past year. This means that the Society must raise $2,500 for each person admitted to the Home, for the residents live an average of ten years after admission.</p>
   <p>We face the new year with undaunted faith and courage, and put our trust in God who is able to bring all things about successfully.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>The Vice-President's Report</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Old People's Home Society is indeed most fortunate in having passed through one of the most critical years of its existence with more than usual gratifying results. For this we are foremost indebted to our courageous and ever-enthusiastic president, Mr. Lars Enger, who, throughout the years, has given much of his valuable time in order that the Society might be preserved and continued to advance along the lines of progressive institutions.</p>
   <p>One of the biggest tasks of last year was to increase our Endowment Fund which is so much needed for the future protection and safety of the Home. It is regrettable that this endeavor failed to bring the desired results because of the failure of the committees appointed and the membership at large to back the movement and carry it to a successful conclusion. Our honorable president, however, did not let this stand in his way, but with the assistance of Mr. Albert Peterson, our attorney, succeeded in increasing <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>the Endowment Fund by about $30,000. This, of course, our president does not think is very much, but let us all unite in assuring him that the Society is deeply indebted to him for his energetic, conscientious, and earnest efforts in connection with the raising of this Fund.</p>
   <p>The Society is also most fortunate in having at its command the valuable services of such thrifty and enthusiastic workers as Mr. Anton J. Berger, our treasurer. He can be seen busily engaged at all affairs of the Society, working far into the night in addition to giving his time every day of the year in order that the books and audits may be up to date and correct.</p>
   <p>Mr. Albert Peterson, our attorney, likewise gives his valuable time and services which represents hundreds of dollars saved to the Society for legal work performed without compensation.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. O. Satrang, our advertising and publicity manager, always makes it a point to raise at least several thousand dollars through the offices of our <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>honorary president, Mr. Oscar H. Haugan.</p>
   <p>Our secretary, Mr. J. M. Jacobsen, joyfully serves the Society at all its meetings, and devotes a great deal of his time evenings to the mass of clerical work necessary in connection with all records, announcements, etc., throughout the year.</p>
   <p>The rest of the directors always co-operate, giving their assistance as best they can. Is there any wonder, then, with such a combination that the Home is growing and getting along very well?</p>
   <p>The Ladies' Board reached the height of endeavor in equipping our bazaar with an abundance of the most useful and handsome articles ever displayed and assembled at the Norwegian Fair, resulting in the most gratifying returns far in excess of any previous year. May God bless them and give them power and energy to carry on the good work in the future.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Our Young Ladies' Aid also made a very fine showing for this year, and may they also be encouraged to give more abundantly of their valuable services to this grand and worthy cause.</p>
   <p>To our many friends and associates who so heartily and freely give their support, making it possible for us to show such a gratifying record, we are truly grateful in behalf of our "Dear Old Folks," for whom we all delight in doing all we can. They are the sole beneficiaries of whatever is contributed to the Home, for there are no salaries paid to any of the officers connected with the organization.</p>
   <p>May the new year enrich the fellowship and the good-will asset among our people to a broader, keener, and fuller appreciation of the good work to be done.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>Secretary's Report</p>
   <p>Again another year has passed and we can look back at work done, in the days that have gone by, with great pleasure and pride. And I can report to you as your secretary that the men you have selected as your board of directors have met regularly, and always in fine spirit and harmony have transacted the unusually many problems that have come up for consideration during these abnormal and difficult times. Your board of directors has met regularly every month, and has had good attendance at every meeting.</p>
   <p>For the executive committee I may also report that this committee has had their regular monthly meetings at the Home; every member on the committee has had plenty of work to do, and they have performed their tasks well. If you visit the Home you will see for yourself how well it looks inside and out, and through the efforts of your wide-awake committee the Home looks better than ever before.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>We have had many interesting events during the year, such as tag day, midsummer festival, annual picnic, Singing Society day, Blue Square Club concert, several outings for the old folks, and last but not least, our annual bazaar.</p>
   <p>During the year, twelve residents passed away at the Home. Ten new residents were admitted--seven women and three men. The past year saw more activity at the Home than ever before; there were more visitors than in any previous year, and more donations were received by the matron.</p>
   <p>All bills have been paid, as you will hear from the treasurer's report, and there is a fair surplus left with which to carry on the work.</p>
   <p>The reports from the various branches and organizations have been good. The Society can proudly face the Norwegian people of Chicago and say: "We have done well." The Society will go forward from year to year, and our assets will, no doubt keep increasing as we go along. All the residents of the <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>Home seem to be content; no grumbling is ever heard.</p>

   <p>Matron's Report</p>
   <p>At the present time we have one hundred residents in the Home, seventy women and thirty men. Ten new residents were admitted during the year.</p>
   <p>The Norwood Park Branch of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society is doing <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>good work. We now have two hundred and thirty-four members, and more are joining at every meeting.</p>
   <p>I sincerely thank Miss Camilla Andersen, the former matron, for the kindness and help she gave me when I first came to the Home. And I wish to thank the board of directors, the Ladies' Board, Reverend Nesvig, and Dr. L. M. Bower for their kind assistance during the time I have been here.</p>
   <p>To all the residents and the help, and to the ladies who helped at the bazaar, with Mrs. Gina Pedersen at the head, I wish to extend my heartiest thanks for their helpfulness and co-operation.</p>
