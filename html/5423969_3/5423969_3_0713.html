   <p>p.8....Prof. Chester N. Gould of the University of Chicago, delivered a lecture on Wednesday from a unique platform. The Viking Ship that was sailed from Norway to Chicago for the World's Fair in 1893 has occupied a prominent spot in Lincoln Park since it was presented to Chicago and this ship was the rostrum from which Pro. Gould spoke, his subject being "The Vinland Expeditions of the Vikings."</p>
   <p>A more fitting rostrum could not have been selected than this outstanding memorial to the intrepid discoverers of our country. The lecture was very good, and details of the facts surrounding the activities of Leif Eriksen and his followers were interesting and highly educational.</p>
   <p>Prof. Gould commended the "Norske Klub" for their interest in the "Viking Ship" and their efforts to have it properly cared for. This unique memorial should be given the best of care.</p>
