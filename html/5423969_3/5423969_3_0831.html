   <p>The Norwegian Turner Society held a banquet at Nora Hall last Saturday evening for members of the Society. About sixty people were present. Mr. Harold Larsen had arranged an attractive table setting with palms.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. C. Hannibal served as toastmaster in behalf of the committee on arrangements. He welcomed the guests, stating that the banquet was held in honor of the committee on arrangements at the turner festival.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was the president, Gus. Martin, who alluded to the dissatisfaction caused in some quarters by the distribution of prizes at the recent festival. Especially did he mention a writer in the Skandinaven, Hogbardt Hermansen of Minneapolis. The speaker deplored that Skandinaven had written critically of the work of the prize judges without first consulting the board of directors of the Norwegian Turner Society in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Mr. Rehn, the instructor of the Turner Society, expressed gratification at the showing by the members of the Society at the turner festival....In his opinion there was only one worthwhile turner system, the American. Those who were following foreign ways as turners had better depart for the countries where such systems were in vogue.....</p>
   <p>The representative of the Skandinaven was requested to speak, but since he did not wish to reply to attacks upon his paper he merely expressed his pleasure at having had the opportunity to be present.</p>
   <p>President Martin expressed the thanks of the Turner Society to Skandinaven for the many favors shown the Society by the paper....Then the punch bowl was put upon the table.</p>
