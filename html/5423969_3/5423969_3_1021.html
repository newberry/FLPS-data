   <p>The women's benevolent society, Scandia, celebrated its 15th anniversary on Saturday, May 11th, at Wabansia Hall. The society now numbers over 600 members, and has during its 15 years of existence, paid out a fairly large sum in funeral benefits, aid during illness, and accident benefits. They have also been outstanding in visitation of the needy.</p>
   <p>A tasty lunch of sandwiches, cake, and coffee was served, and dancing to Oscar C. Schmidt's orchestra was thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
