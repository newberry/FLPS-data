   <p>The new Lydia Children's Home was dedicated yesterday with the usual ceremonies. Several people of the congregation of Salem Church conceived the idea of opening another children's home, which was badly needed. A society was organized, the Lydia Children's Home Society, to raise funds for the new home.</p>
   <p>On July 8, 1917, a small house on Richmond Street was rented, and the home was opened with seven children as inmates. In October of the same year a larger house was rented on Kedvale Avenue near Irving Park Avenue; in this house there was room for sixteen children. Soon this also had become too small. In March, 1919, the Society rented another house, next door to the one on Kedvale Avenue, with room for nineteen more children. In less than a week this house was filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>On June 27, 1919, the Society bought a house at Irving Park Avenue and Kildare Avenue. Here it could accomodate sixty children, and room could be made for sixty more. In this house there is a large hall capable of seating seven hundred people.</p>
