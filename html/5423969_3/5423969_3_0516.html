   <p>"Skandinaven is planning to present a survey of the activities of Norwegian congregations and societies during the past year. May we therefore request that you kindly submit to us a brief account of the more important events within your organization during 1907?"</p>
   <p>The above quoted letter has been sent to all Norwegian churches and societies in Chicago. If any organization has been overlooked, please consider this paragraph a personal request.</p>
   <p>Please mail the report at your earliest convenience, and make it as brief and at the same time as comprehensive as possible. A brief outline of your organization's plans for the current year is also desirable.</p>
