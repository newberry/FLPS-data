   <p>Mrs. Antonie Meyer's concert held on Friday at Wicker Park Hall was fairly well attended. One-half of the income is going to the Norwegian Orphanage, and it would not have hurt if the attendance had been greater, so that a larger amount of money might have accrued to the Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Several of Mrs. Meyer's many pupils participated in the concert--some of them children of but nine years of age; also the Erato Glee Club, under the direction of Nels Holter, sang several numbers and had to give a number of encores.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thin played a couple of violin solos, accompanied by Mrs. Meyer and received well-deserved applause. Mrs. Meyer played Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" with great finesse and was presented with a large bouquet of flowers. The last number on the program was the "Saeterjentens Sondag" (Sunday of the Dairy Maid), sung by Miss Elise Young dressed in Norwegian national garb. She was called on for an encore and this was given under Bengal lights, a beautiful <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sight. At this concert, as on earlier occasions, Mrs. Meyer proved that she was capable not only of presenting her many students, but she also showed that they have learned to play quite difficult pieces on the piano.</p>
