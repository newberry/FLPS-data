   <p>The Deaconess Home has opened a new Kindergarten in a two-story building at Campbell Avenue and Bloomingdale Road. At the day nursery the little children may be brought in before the mothers go to work. The number of children who are left at the nursery every day testifies to the fact, that a large number of Norwegian mothers have to seek their living by working away from home.</p>
   <p>Many of the children and their mothers need both food and clothing. To help provide these, people are invited to a donation party to be held at the day nursery on Friday, Nov. 30.</p>
