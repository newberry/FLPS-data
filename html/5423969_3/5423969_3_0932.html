   <p>Soon a festival will be held commemorating the one thousandth anniversary of the first arrival of Norwegians in America. In connection with this, a memorial column in honor of the event ought to be erected. I would not favor the erection of a man of metal, but rather a memorial stone, an obelisk..... It ought to be at least one hundred feet tall, but preferably several hundred feet, the sides covered with inscriptions in runes, descriptive of the first arrival of the Norwegians. On the base the same description would appear in translation.</p>
   <p>Humboldt Park would seem to be a suitable location for an obelisk as mentioned.</p>
   <p>It would be interesting if any of the readers could supply information as to the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>cost of such a stone, not one of marble, but of granite or some similar type of stone.</p>
   <p>Every Norwegian, man or woman, young or old, ought to take an interest in this matter and get in touch with the Leif Ericson Society in Chicago for the purpose of having a memorial erected of that event of a thousand years ago. The summer is too far advanced this year for the immediate erection of a monument as mentioned, but let us have the pleasure of beholding something great next year when the Norwegians gather from all over the world to celebrate the [thousandth] anniversary of the earliest entrance of our countrymen into America.</p>
