   <p>THE GREAT FIRE</p>
   <p>Complete Destruction</p>
   <p>Eighty Thousand People Homeless; At Least Two Hundred Dead</p>
   <p>When we try to tell about the great catastrophe of last Monday, we begin to realize how impotent language is.</p>
   <p>The scene: Early morning, great clouds of smoke tumbling westward, a fire that it is impossible to combat. Yes, the wildest imagination could hardly conceive or portray in words the grandeur and the horror of the hellish fire <span class="page-break">2</span>that is swiftly consuming three thousand acres of houses. We can hardly describe it in words. After the excitement has passed, there follow the reaction--and the reality: we see the charred remains of what was once a great city. The entire South Side from 16th Street to the river, and the North Side from the river to Fullerton Avenue (city limits) is in ashes. In less than twenty-four hours more than two-thirds of the city has been laid waste. The great buildings are all destroyed--the "gold coast" along Michigan Avenue, Wabash Avenue, and State Street, the Post Office, the Customhouse, the Marine Hospital, the Courthouse and many hotels on the South Side. The city's banks, the Stock Exchange, and all the great business houses in the central business district [are in ruins]. The Norwegian Church on Erie Street is no more, the Swedish Church on Sedgewick Street is in ruins.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavians on the Northwest Side lost all they owned, but the new Scandinavian colony on the West Side suffered very little; here the homeless from the destroyed districts are being cared for.</p>

   <p>The latest report states that there are two hundred dead, but this cannot be correct because we believe that more than that died while trying to cross the river.....</p>
