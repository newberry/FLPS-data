   <p>p.8. The lecture by Editor Duckerts, on "Degeneration and Alcoholism" drew a capacity audience at I. O. G. T. Hall. The able editor is also an able speaker, and held his listeners spell bound throughout the clear and concise lecture; many adjudged him even better than the well-known Peder Svendsen, who has been for years the favorite and most foreceful speeaker of I.O.G.T. We will not attempt a report on the lecture as Duckerts is a man that should be heard personally, not quoted.</p>
