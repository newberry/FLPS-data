   <p>An exposition of Norwegian national dancing of unusual interest was given at the Municipal Pier Hall last Friday evening under the auspices of the Drama League.</p>
   <p>In spite of the chilly weather the large hall was filled, and the agile and able dancers in their picturesque Norwegian farmer costumes of a former day received vigorous applause. The leader of the exposition, Miss Clara Semb is a student of Hulda Garborg. Miss Semb afterward traveled all over Norway to increase her knowledge about these early dances.</p>
