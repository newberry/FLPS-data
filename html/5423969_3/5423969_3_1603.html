   <p>Rev. L. Harrisville, a Norwegian pastor, asks the public to help the Norwegian Children's Home which takes care of seventy children, but of these only four are paid for by their parents. Many parents can not pay for their children at this home, and some will not pay. The coal bill from last winter has not been paid and the grocery bill for the month of June is not paid yet. All children are treated alike whether their parents pay or not.</p>
