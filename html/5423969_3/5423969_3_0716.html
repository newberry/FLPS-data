   <p>Last Tuesday evening in Wabansia Hall, Mr. Arne Kildahl, of Washington, D. C., lectured on Henrik Ibsen. The lecture was given under the auspices of the Norwegian Club. Mr. Kildahl began by bringing a greeting from the Norwegian Society in Washington. He mentioned the president of that Society, Mr. R. N. Sartz, well known in Chicago, and informed the audience that all the Norwegian members of Congress, including Senator Knute Nelson, were members of the Society.</p>
   <p>The speaker expressed regret that his lecture had been written in English. If he had had the time, he said, he would have rewritten it in Norwegian. This was impossible, however, and he appealed to the audience to be not too critical of his English pronunciation.</p>
   <p>It is evident that no thorough discussion of the great author's works could <span class="page-break">\2</span>be presented in a brief evening's lecture. The lecturer spoke of Ibsen's childhood and youth; he referred to the meager circumstances under which the playwright lived; he also mentioned the many other obstacles that Ibsen had to contend with, not the least of these being the fact that his works were misunderstood and misjudged.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kildahl continued with a brief discussion of Ibsen's most important works, classifying them in the usual way. He also told some interesting anecdotes about the taciturn dramatist, and two of these were such as had not been told before.</p>
   <p>The audience regretted that only little was told about the life of Henrik Ibsen in Norway after his return from his long self-imposed exile. The banquet given in his honor on his eightieth birthday was not mentioned. An account of this banquet would have been of special interest to the ladies who were present since all of Ibsen's lady-types were represented at the banquet.</p>
