   <p>There have always been people who take a skeptical view of the patriotic functions of the foreign-language press in the matter of Americanization. The feeling is different among the foreign-language editors. They know that the foreign-language press is absolutly American in its ideals and views. Without getting at the facts it was assumed offhand that any continued use of a foreign language was in itself a hindrance to the inculcation of American ideals. The critics forgot that for the adult immigrants the language of their birthplace is the only medium by which any ideas relating to America can be communicated. It is not surprising, therefore, that Max Henrici made a strong appeal for the use of foreign-language newspapers as factors in that social amalgamation for which all true Americans are striving. He called attention to the fact that it was that apostle of common sense, as well as uncommon science, Benjamin Franklin, who was the first to recognize the value of using a foreign tongue for the purpose of Americanizing the newcomers. Franklin's Philadelphia Zeitung, which came out in 1732, was the first foreign-language newspaper published in America.</p>
   
   <p>Today more than 750 foreign-language newspapers in thirty different languages are printed in the United States and Canada, reaching eight million people and having a combined capital of twenty-seven million dollars. Those who would ignore these papers in spite of the numbers of their subscribers, and especially those advocating a simplified Americanism, are blind to the facts of the situation, since, for the most part, every foreign periodical printed in the United States has as its object a sort of confession of American faith as follows:</p>
   <p>"To help preserve the ideals and sacred traditions of this, our adopted country, the United States of America; to revere its laws and inspire others to respect and obey them; to strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty; and in all ways to aid in making this country greater and better than we found it."</p>
