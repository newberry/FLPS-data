   <p>Leif Erikson Lodge #9, R.H.K., held a very successful picnic at Kosciuszkos Park. Many people from the other four Chicago lodges were present with their families and friends. Music and sports furnished most of the entertainment. Everybody had a good time, and they got started on the way home early enough to escape the thunderstorm, which broke later in the evening.</p>
