   <p>The publisher of Skandinaven, Mr. John Anderson, has been made a Knight of the Norwegian Order of St. Olaf. This is a piece of news at which the Norwegians here rejoice.... No business undertaking among the Norwegians has more greatly served to aid mutual understanding, co-operation, and vigorous connection between the Norwegians here and in Norway than Skandinaven. The publisher will honor the group of outstanding Norwegians in America among whom he has been ranked through his having been made a Knight of St. Olaf.</p>
