   <p>Between you and me--in a manner speaking--I am impelled to say a word regarding Professor Hanson's pleasant reference to my English. He has given me a similar compliment on one or two other occasions. As a rule, journalists do not receive many compliments, and especially not for their language or style. Some do not deserve them. There are, however, exceptions. I am personally acquainted with half a dozen newspapermen in this country--three in New York and three in Chicago--whose names ought to be enshrined in a journalistic hall of fame for the purity and the beauty of their English. Those from Chicago are L. H. Lund, Nicolai Grevstad, and Kristian Baun.</p>
   <p>Whether I am deserving of the praise he [Hanson] so graciously bestows upon me is a matter for him and others of my readers to decide. I am glad to note that, in the article, he pays my friend, Chief Justice John J. Sonsteby, a similar compliment for his good English. With this I am in complete agreement. I have known the judge a great many <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>years, in fact since his Von Humboldt school days, where he developed the use of good English in the school debating society.</p>
   <p>When compliments come from a qualified source they possess value. Certainly it is a source of satisfaction to know that Professor Hanson's competency to pass judgment is beyond question.</p>
