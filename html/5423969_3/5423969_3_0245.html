   <p>Those who are familiar with Norwegian history know that the first step taken to obtain Norway's freedom and independence was taken at Eidsvold in 1814. Chicago has an energetic young people's society named "Eidsvold," which, true to its name, has begun the first public festivities in its campaign for funds for the memorial gift to Norway in 1914.</p>
   <p>The festival, with an excellent program, was held at Bjorgoin Hall on Saturday, Nov. 9. George (May 17th) Kramer was the main speaker and the Scandinavian Socialist Singing Society (4Ss) provided the musical part in a very pleasing selection of choral numbers. The festival ended with a dance.</p>
   <p>The aim of the society seems to have put a real celebration spirit into the gathering, as it became necessary to turn out the lights to stop the festival.</p>
