   <p>Some time ago I directed a question through the Skandinaven to Dr. Sandberg regarding the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital Society. The question was as to whether or not the Society is yet working in accordance with its old constitution, or whether a new constitution has been adopted by the Society. To this question no answer has been given so far.</p>
   <p>My reasons for directing this question to Dr. Sandberg, the president of the Society, was that sometime ago I read an article by him in the Skandinaven in which he states, among other things, that the nationals won in the struggle of 1894-1895. This victory is supposed to indicate that since the cow has been milked, it may as well be slaughtered.</p>
   <p>I cannot but admire the doctor for his frank expressions. If he and his adherents will continue to act and speak as frankly and straightforward <span class="page-break">2</span>in the future, in other words, if they would remove the two words "Tabitha" and "Lutheran" so that people may come to realize that the church affiliation does not exist any longer, then would I, for one, be grateful. As the situation is now, half-Lutheran, half-national, the thing is neither fowl nor fish.</p>
   <p>Did the nationals win? Very well, raise the national flag! To wear the cape on both shoulders is hypocrisy, and that sort of thing does not pay for honest men and women.</p>
   <p>The people of the Synod had objected most strenuously. They could not think of working together with the other Norwegian-Lutheran church people. No, on the other hand, they decided to enter into a partnership with the nationals. But when they had been placed in the shafts with the nationals they started to kick, and so the mad dance went on.</p>
   <p>Certainly, the struggle of the church people for a hospital has been uphill work. Great hopes had been attached to the Tabitha Hospital movement, but <span class="page-break">3</span>the movement foundered. The hair splitting question about the "salvation by grace" entered the movement as a ghost out of the past, and in its wake came the tornado that beached the ship.</p>
   <p>Oh, well, not much to make a lot of fuss about; just the loss of a building and a piece of land. Worse will happen when the day of reckoning arrives, and it may be found that immortal souls have foundered on account of all the strife and bitterness which the scribes have thrown in among the church people.</p>
   <p>The people of the Synod ought to have been farsighted enough to realize that the turnabout they undertook when they relinquished their co-operation with the Christian congregations and joined hands with the nationals, could not help bringing them the disappointment and sorrow which they are now experiencing. They have simply gotten what they deserved.</p>
   <p>The Deaconess Hospital, which was started three to four years ago and which has already progressed so well that it now seems feasible to build on the <span class="page-break">4</span>lots which have been bought and paid for, is a new example of the noble purpose of erecting a Christian hospital here in Chicago. Christian men and women have been imbued with this humane thought and this time a foundation has been laid to insure the continuation of the Christian connections, because the constitution of the Hospital contains a clause requiring three-fourths of the board of directors to consist of members of congregations under the United Lutheran Church in America. The question is whether this gives sufficient guarantee for such time, as may arrive, when the property of the Hospital shall be of great value, involving large amounts of money. There might be people, if conditions as mentioned were to arrive, who would desire control of the large sums involved, and it might be quite easy, then, to enroll a few hundred members just before an election; then change the paragraph about the "two-thirds". Then vote into the board of directors, people who would discard everything pertaining to the churches.</p>
   <p>The one who has suffered burns ought to avoid the fire. The United Lutheran Church is to hold its annual meeting in June. It would be well if the matter of the Deaconess Hospital were taken up for full and careful discussion. As <span class="page-break">5</span>long as the United Church is operating this institution (the Hospital), the Church ought to take good care that outsiders do not get a chance to destroy it.</p>
