   <p>The first volume begins the history of the Norwegians in the year 1319 [at the time of the first union with Sweden]. We reprint a paragraph found in the author's introduction:</p>
   <p>"The preservation of the people's personal freedom amidst general national decay, the germs of a new development distinctly traceable in social life, have been especially dwelt upon...because they constitute the basis of the Norwegian political and social development in modern times."</p>
   <p>In the second volume the immigration [into the United States] is discussed very clearly. The Norwegian pioneer and his exploits, not only on the prairie but also in the cities of the West, are discussed.</p>
   <p>The book contains about ninety half-tone plates.</p>
