   <p>The Chicago Times-Herald has rushed into the arena to explain why the Illinois Staats-Zeitung failed. Our hyphenated contemporary points to the decrease in German immigration since hard times set in in this country, and asserts that "the supply of readers of German newspapers is growing smaller year by year," because "the vast majority of the children of earlier German immigrants read newspapers printed in English only".</p>
   <p>The Times-Herald has permitted the wish to father the thought, and hence has drawn conclusions totally at variance with the facts. The Chicago Freie Presse, a German morning daily that has not gone into bankruptcy, shows that, so far from "dying out," the German press of Chicago has grown apace in recent years and enjoys a sturdy health that well may excite the envy of some English-speaking contemporaries. Says the Freie Presse in part:</p>
   <p>"German immigration has always fluctuated. Since 1893 times have not been at <span class="page-break">2</span>all prosperous here, while Germany had a boom. Consequently the immigration from our fatherland decreased considerably. Germany is densely settled and if the conditions change, so that we have prosperity here, while the old country is having a spell of hard times, German immigration will flow to our shores again.</p>
   <p>"Regarding the number and the circulation of the German dailies of Chicago, we will state a few facts. For some time Chicago had only two German dailies: the Illinois Staats-Zeitung as a morning and the Freie Presse as an evening paper. At present we have two German morning journals, the Freie Presse and the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, and four evening papers, the Abend Presse, the Abendblatt, the Abendpost, and the Arbeiter-Zeitung. The circulation of the Chicago German dailies is now over six times larger than it was some years ago. The German-American press of Chicago has therefore not lost, but greatly gained in circulation.</p>
   <p>"We do not wish to say unkind words about our contemporary during its agony, but when its bankruptcy is used by other journals for the purpose of 'proving' the declination of the German-American press, we are forced to point out one of the many mistakes of the management that has caused the financial distress of the once <span class="page-break">3</span>powerful paper. The fact that the Illinois Staats-Zeitung has failed with liabilities of $250,000 cannot be used as a'proof' that the German-American press is on the decline. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the failure of a paper printed in the German language proves the decline of the German-American press, then the English-American press is also on the wane. The Chicago Times and the Chicago Mail, as well as the Chicago Democrat, have failed and a number of other Chicago papers, printed in English, are financially embarrassed. The talk about the "dying out" of the German-American press should be left to weak-minded people who never investigate a question before they speak of it.</p>
   <p>"In closing this article we will point to an argument made against the German-American press by superficial observers. The fact that many German-Americans read English papers in the streetcars is offered as proof 'that the Germans read English dailies' and not German journals. But if one closely investigates the matter, he will find that the Germans read the German papers at home; that the men are reading English dailies on trains to improve their English; but that the ladies, who are purchasing goods for the families, are with rare exceptions reading only <span class="page-break">4</span>German dailies. While these ladies are mostly able to carry on a conversation in English, they prefer to read German for three reasons: they read German more easily, they find news from all parts of their fatherland in the German publications, and also reports of the Chicago German societies. Experienced businessmen are familiar with these facts."</p>
   <p>The facts presented by the Freie Presse are conclusive and furnish incontestible evidence of the utter absurdity of the position taken by the Times-Herald.</p>
   <p>And what is true of the German press is also true of the Scandinavian, the Polish, the Bohemian press, etc. The circulation of the Skandinaven is larger now than ever before, and is constantly increasing, and the same may be said of the Swedish newspapers of Chicago. These facts may be a puzzle to many who have come to understand that our adopted citizens are just as loyal, just as good patriots as those to the manor born, and in some respects even better, but who seem to be unable to understand that citizens may be good Americans even if they know and make use of some other language besides the English. But they are perfectly clear to anyone <span class="page-break">5</span>who will take the trouble to look into the matter. It is a well-established and well-known fact that the English-speaking press falls far short of supplying the wants of our adopted citizens. Whether they be rich or poor, whether they be businessmen, professional men, mechanics, or day laborers, they read one or more newspapers in their respective mother tongues because these journals minister to wants that cannot be supplied through any other channel. The native-born immigrant from New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, or any other section of the country, in perusing his daily paper, never misses an item from his native heath. Impelled by the best impulses of his nature, he turns in-stinctivly to every scrap of news of this kind. The foreign-born immigrant is precisely like the native-born immigrant in this respect. He cherishes the same love for the land where he was born, or where his father and mother were born, and for this reason a newspaper in his native tongue is indispensible to him, since the English-speaking press neither does nor can cover this field. Such attempts as may have been made in this direction have thus far been miserable failures. Most of the alleged "news" of this kind furnished by our English contemporaries is as old as the hills and ridiculously unreliable. The absurd and disgusting yarns about Norway and Sweden may be mentioned by way of illustration.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Another reason why good foreign newspapers are gaining in circulation may be found in the character of our English-speaking contemporaries. That the tone of our newspapers has undergone a great change for the worse in recent years is not to be denied. The control of many of our newspapers has been transferred from the editorial sanctum to the counting room, while conscientious caution has given way to sensationalism, and trustworthiness to unscrupulous recklessness. Many of our largest newspapers have entered upon a wild race for the favors of the worst elements among the people, while decent people have become suspicious of the honesty of the press and disgusted with its methods. The foreign press is free from these faults and vices. It does not deal in sensationalism or revel in scandal. It does not cater to the brutal instincts of the community. It does not feed its readers upon lies in order to get an opportunity to print, the next day, a correction that does not correct. Foreign newspapers are not scattered unread upon the streets or in public conveyances. They are clean, trustworthy, and wholesome family papers, and hence are taken to the homes and read by the whole family. And they enjoy the confidence of their readers in a measure that probably would appear increditable to a newspaper like the Times-Herald.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The day may come when there will be no need of foreign newspapers in this country. But that day is so far off that the Times-Herald will not live to see it.</p>
