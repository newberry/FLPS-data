   <p>The Scandinavian Medical Association held its regular meeting at the rooms of the Swedish Club on June 31. In addition to the regular routine, which was shortened for the occasion, members were favored with a lecture by the guest of honor, Dr. Rosving, from Denmark. Dr. Rosving is one of Denmark's outstanding medical authorities, and is at present visiting the United States, where he has delivered a number of lectures in various places. Following the lecture the assembled physicians partook of a banquet in honor of Dr. Rosving.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers were Dr. A. Doe, Dr. Ole Berg, Dr. N. Quales, and Dr. Nels Johnson. Several of them paid tribute to Dr. S. Jacobsen and Chr. Fenger (now deceased) and to Dr. Norman Hansen, who is now practicing in Copenhagen. Over one hundred doctors were present and all enjoyed the meeting very much.</p>
