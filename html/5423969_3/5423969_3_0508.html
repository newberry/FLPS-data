   <p>p.4.............We present herewith excerpts from "Tidens Tegn," (Signs of the Times) published in Christiania, Norway, regarding the mission of the press and its freedom.</p>
   <p>"When the press abuses its privelege by publishing harmful and slanderous attacks on a private citizen it is only just that the press be punished and its opportunities for such misuse limited. However, public officials and organizations of all kinds should at all times be willing objects of just criticism. The slightest reasonable doubt as to honesty of purpose or action on the part of an individual or group justifies a demand, by the press, for a complete and fair investigation for the good of all. The attempt to intimidate the press, in such cases, does not tend to build up or strengthen the faith of the public in the intimidating parties and the man or group of men whose cause and methods are upright have nothing to lose or fear by the publicity of a press investigation. The honest ones have but to "lay their cards on the table" and the investigation and its attendant publicity will strengthen their own position as well as the general faith in them. Only the guilty ones should need fear the press.</p>

   <p>As far as public officials and institutions are concerned the free, frank press is the community's best and almost only means of control. Should the day ever come when the press no longer would be permitted to call the attention of the public to irregularities or questionable acts of individuals or institutions supposedly serving the public, on that day vice, graft and crime will occupy our capitols and chaos would ensue." Scandia can only add - May our free press controlled by a free people live forever.</p>
