   <p>Nora No. 1. lodge of the Knights of the White Cross, oldest Norwegian lodge in America, celebrated its 50th anniversary on Thursday, January 30th, at Dania Hall. The elaborate banquet and hall were enjoyed by over 250 members and friends.</p>
   <p>The genial Dr. Doe was the speaker of the evening; being a member of not only Nora No. 1, but of a number of other Norwegian and American organizations, he was the one best-fitted for this part of the program. Dr. Doe gave a very interesting review of the history of the local during its 50 years of activity, and to many the work done by Nora was a surprising revelation.</p>
   <p>Other speakers during the evening included: Consul Haugan, Mr. H. C. Hansen, Mr. Svend Pedersen, L. Grundeland, and Dr. De Beschi of Milwaukee, Wis.</p>
