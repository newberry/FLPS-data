   <p>In ancient times all roads led to Rome. Last week they led to Fargo, North Dak., where the Norwegian National Singer's League held its convention and the Sons of Norway gathered for the unveiling of the "Ganger Rolf" (Wild Rollo) statue. About 700 singers gatherd for the big concert at which the choruses, individually jointly sang the old Norwegian masterpieces as well as selections in the English language.</p>
   <p>This year's solists were Mr. Borsum, conductor of several Chicago choruses and the famous Swedish Barytone, Gustov Holmquist. Fargo welcomed both singers and "Sons of Norway" with open arms, and Fargo papers spoke very highly of both the league concert and the unveiling ceremonies. Morehead, Minn., across the Red River from Fargo joined with the sister city in the celebration making the two cities one big city with a creek running through it.</p>
   <p>The parade preceding the unveiling ceremony caused much grumbling and criticism due to the fact that it lasted two hours and the marchers were thoroughly tired long before reaching the statue of Ganger Rolf. As a whole, however, the festivity was a grand success, and pleasant memories will linger a long time with all who attended.</p>
