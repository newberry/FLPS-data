   <p>I have deliberately and carefully refrained from entering the discussion which has been conducted in the Skandinaven relative to the Leif Ericson monument. It would be regrettable if the cause were to suffer at all from the discussion, for, like Mr. [Emil] Bjorn, I too am first of all patriotic in the matter.</p>
   <p>I agree with Mr. Bjorn that competition is desirable, and it would please me even now (after the work of making the statue has been allotted to me) if we could have competitive bidding open to any sculptor.</p>
   <p>The rumor that I had demanded an unreasonable price for the monument must have grown out of a misunderstanding.</p>
   <p>A few years ago the matter was lightly mentioned to me; at the time I made an offhand estimate as to probable cost. The amount then mentioned by me was considerably <span class="page-break">\2</span>below those paid for the monuments erected here by the Swedes and the Danes; it was also considerably less than the cost of the statue of Ole Bull, erected by the Norwegians in Minneapolis.</p>
