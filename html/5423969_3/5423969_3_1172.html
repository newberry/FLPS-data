   <p>The medical staff of the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital held a meeting on June 3rd. Twenty-four doctors attended the meeting, which was presided over by Dr. M. T. Qualis, president.</p>
   <p>After the business session the announcement was made that Pastor Kildahl, for many years rector of the hospital, had submitted his resignation accompanied by the statement that he contemplated accepting a call to the pastorate of a Milwaukee Lutheran Church. A resolution as promptly and unanimously passed, requesting the United Norwegian Lutheran Church to retain Pastor Kildahl as Rector of the Hospital, and that his resignation be turned down. Many of the attending staff members spoke highly of the excellent work Rev. Mr. Kildahl had done at the hospital, and it was decided to hold a Sexa (six o'clock supper) in his honor, and to present him with a fine loving-cup as a token of their esteem.</p>
