   <p>The Scandinavian Turner Brothers is the name of a new union which has lately started its work. Messrs. Smith and Wingood are the leaders and organizers of this new undertaking. Already it has fifty active members but there is a big chance that it will grow very rapidly. Their meeting place is in Aurora Turner Hall. Last Monday was the first time the members practiced.</p>
