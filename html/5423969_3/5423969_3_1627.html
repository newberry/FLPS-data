   <p>The Norwegian Orphanage Society met last Monday evening at Bethel Church on Humboldt Street. A considerable number of new members were received into the Society.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Mr. Haakon Thompson, informed the Society that at least $250 must be raised over and above the regular income to meet the expenses at the Home during the coming two or three months.....One of the ladies present suggested an ice-cream social as the means of raising the money. She suggested that the Society secure a hall to seat one thousand people; arrange an excellent program for which the participants will donate their services; sell 1,000 tickets at twenty-five cents each and let each member undertake to sell five tickets. The income of the social would then be $250.</p>
   <p>The plan seemed practical and the motion was adopted unanimously. A committee of seven was elected to see to the execution of the program. The time and place will be announced later.</p>
