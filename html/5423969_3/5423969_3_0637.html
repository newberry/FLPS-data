   <p>It seems that Skandinaven is having a hard time of it with its book, Prominent Norwegians of Illinois.</p>
   <p>First let us see how this book was born. It cost the "prominent" ten dollars [apiece] to have their names mentioned in the book. To put it a little more mildly,a donation was asked to help publish the book.</p>
   <p>The first proposal was that every one should write his own biography. Well, the result was that those who could write seemed to have biographies so lengthy that it would be impossible to publish them all in one volume, and those who could not write were going to be obliged to "come across" with another ten in order to have their biographies written.</p>
   <p>The publisher (John Anderson) [then] sent out a questionnaire; there were <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>questions such as, "Have you ever received a medal, or have you ever been knighted(Order of St. Olaf, Students' League Pig Medal, Quartet Club's Star Medal, etc.)?....What charity organizations do you support?"--well, here we quit. We did not read further in the questionnaire.</p>
   <p>And so when the thing was done, did every one get ten dollars' worth?</p>
