   <p>The Norwegian Club Dramatic Society gave a very good amateur play in Bj√∏rgvins Hall last Thursday evening. The program opened with music by the Ludwig Haugan Orchestra. A two act play "In the West" was given by Norwegian Students Association of Norway. Male characters portrayed all the roles.</p>

   <p>The play takes place in Stud-Jur Kork's room in Kristiania.</p>
   <p>The instructer, Mr. Oscar Anderson deserves great credit for the success of the play. The performance was a brilliant one, having been almost equal to a professional portrayal.</p>
   <p>Keep up your good work, boys, the club is a success.</p>
