   <p>p.2...............Members of "Dovre" Lodge No. 18, "R.H.K." (Knights of the White Cross) who attended the regular meeting on April 6, when a class of six novices had been initiated into the mysteries of knighthood, were pleasantly surprised by a visit from Carl Calvesen, arch-knight Albert Johnson and B. Pedersen, prominent officers of "Nordkap" No. 30, New York City. The refreshment committee was busy preparing a nice lunch when surprise number two appeared. An octette from the Norwegian Glee Club burst into full throated song that put every one into a real joyful mood after which all felt and thoroughly enjoyed the tasty sandwiches and coffee, generously and efficiently served. The visiting knights were then introduced by J.O.Tingstad, Supreme Knight of "Dovre" Lodge and included were Carl Salvesen, Albert Johnsen, Louis Nelson and B. Petersen. Alternating with the speeches were songs by the octette and solos rounding out an evening of pleasure and instruction that was thoroughly enjoyed by both members and visitors.</p>
