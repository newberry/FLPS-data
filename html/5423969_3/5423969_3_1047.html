   <p>The Knights of the White Cross held their convention this week in the Workers' Lyceum, Fairfield Avenue and Hirsch Street. One of the points of discussion was: "Shall the Lodge be called Scandinavian or Norwegian?" This caused quite a lively and lengthy debate, the general sentiment being that it should be Norwegian. As will be remembered, the Workers' Lyceum is the property of the old and militant Karl Marx Club. In this hall most of our progressive and revolutionary organizations were born.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Carl Salvesen, the Archduke, who welcomed the delegates from all over North America. The secretary had prepared a list of the lodges and proceeded with the roll call. The Chicago lodges were represented as follows:</p>
   <p>Nora Lodge No. 1: A. Hauen, Albert Johnson, and C. H. Hansen;</p>
   <p>Leif Ericson Lodge No. 9: Sam Larsen, John A. Pedersen, and L. C. Olsen; <span class="page-break">2</span>Tordenskjold Lodge No. 15: Louis Jensen and Nils Eriksen;</p>
   <p>Dovre Lodge No. 18: O. C. Wold, J. O. Thingstad, S. Troness, and Dr. N. A. Unseth;</p>
   <p>Wergeland Lodge No. 24: Carl Salvesen;</p>
   <p>Harald Haarfager Lodge No. 27: Olaf C. Torstensen;</p>
   <p>Columbia Lodge No. 24: William M. Nelson.</p>
   <p>The Archduke reported that the national membership was one thousand. But he pointed out that the increase was particularly due to the efforts of the last executive. Three new lodges have been organized, one in Milwaukee, and two in Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the first day of the convention, only organizational questions were raised.</p>
