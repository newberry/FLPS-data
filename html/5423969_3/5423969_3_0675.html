   <p>The newly built addition to the already large H. A. Haugan School, at Sunnyside and Hamlin Avenues, will be dedicated on Friday, January 10. Mr. A.F. Husander, well known in the Norwegian Colony was the designer and supervising architect. The new building,which has thirty class and work rooms, will house activities in handicraft and home making. The building and furnishings are strictly modern and the school kitchen equipment was donated by Consul Oscar Haugan. Miss Sullivan, assistant superintendent of the school, will be the speaker at the dedication ceremonies. There will be a very good program of music, singing, and Norwegian folk dancing. The exhibition of folk dancing alone is worth going far to see.</p>
