   <p>I hereby beg to inform you that I am resigning as part owner and publisher of Skandinaven and at the same time I am taking the opportunity to thank the readers, for all their consideration shown the paper during my time.</p>
   <p>About five years has passed since I started to work among the Scandinavians in the N.W. and I am glad to say that these five years have not been wasted. I will always think back with joy on these years.</p>
   <p>My former partner, Mr. John Anderson, will now be Skandinavens sole owner. The readers know him well. Thirteen years ago Anderson was one of the owners. Mr. Anderson has done a great deal for the progress of Norwegian and American papers. He made the Skandinaven a worthy representative for the Norwegians intelligence in America. Regarding Skandinavens future it looks bright; the paper is built on a solid foundation. The Skandinaven to day is far superior to any other Scandinavian paper in the U.S.A.</p>
