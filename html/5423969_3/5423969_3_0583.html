   <p>A new paper has been started here in Chicago, a paper which hides under the label "non-partisan," but which must be, to judge by its editorials, a mouthpiece of the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>According to its editor, a very, very, young man, the paper will not bother with anything old; it will only concern itself with what is new and modern.</p>
   <p>We are rather at a loss to know what to think about this new venture, because we do not believe there is room for a Democratic paper here. The Skandinaven fills the dual role of spokesman for both parties.</p>
