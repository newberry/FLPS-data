   <p>The following is a report from the annual meeting of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society:</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by the president, Dr. N. T. Quales, who gave a report on the work of the Society for the year 1909. A new committee was formed to collect funds for the rebuilding of the Home recently destroyed by fire. The most interesting part of the president's report follows:</p>
   <p>Twelve new inmates have arrived at the Home and some of them are very interesting old settlers. They have all contributed something to the community, either by their activity in the church or by their participation in the societies to which they have belonged. Some of them have been in Chicago since 1827, and one was born here when Chicago was a mere hamlet. The twelve new members are as follows: Mr. Ole Foss, born in 1838 in Lervig, Norway; Miss Martine Hulton, born in 1844 in Drammen; Mr. Peter Kjos, born in 1822 in Ringsaker; Mrs.Helle Hanson, born in 1827 in Trondhjem; Mrs. Anna Rolfson, born in 1833 in Christiania; Miss. Emma Matson, born in 1840 in Voss; Mr. Lewis Larson, born in 1846 in Guldbrandsdalen; Mr. Olaves Johansen, born in 1833 in Frederikshald; Mrs. Anna Johansen, born in 1828 in Voss; Mr. Hansine Bugges, born in 1837 in Trondhjem; and Mr. Martin Johnson, born in 1844 in Trondhjem.</p>
   <p>The average cost for each inmate for the last five years was $750. A number of inmates have lived in the Home for twelve years and have enjoyed free board and lodging for that period.</p>
