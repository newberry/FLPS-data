   <p>July 12th will prove to be a big date to all Norwegian-Americans. The occasion, which is of nation-wide interest, is the unveiling of the Rollo statue at Fargo, North Dakota. The statue will be a duplicate of the one unveiled in Rouen, France (when our own Olaf Ray represented our Norwegian-Americans), and will be cast in bronze.</p>
   <p>This statue is a gift of Rouen <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Norwegian-Americans, and in selecting Fargo as the site for the memorial, they have honored the Norsemen of the Northwest greatly. However, the honor is well-deserved, as the development of our great Northwest was largely the work of the Norse pioneers.</p>
   <p>Fargo is sparing no effort to make the affair a gala event, and Norsemen throughout the Middle West are co-operating in every way. One thousand singers of the National Norwegian Singers' League (male choruses from coast to coast) will entertain with patriotic, folk, and classical songs. This appearance of the massed choruses will constitute their first league concert. Prominent men, in all professions and from five countries, have promised to attend the ceremony. Among <span class="page-break">2</span> the honored guests will be: Sir Wilfred Laurier, former Premier of Canada, Theodore Roosevelt; French, Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish consuls; and a delegation of French officials, including the mayor of Rouen.</p>
   <p>In tracing genealogy we find that Ganger Rolf (Rollo), first Duke of Normandie, is the direct ancestor of no less than seventeen ruling monarchs of Europe today, and that a great number of people in the U.S.A. who have achieved prominence are descendents of the man whose memory is to be honored in the unveiling ceremonies on July 12th. With the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> chorus of one thousand voices singing for the occasion, this should be the greatest day ever witnessed in the Red River Valley.</p>
