   <p>The Norwegian National League called a special meeting yesterday to discuss the question of a Norwegian national park. The park committee had recommended the purchase of six acres of land at North and 64th Avenues, along the Desplaines River, with a frontage of 230 feet on the river and 1400 feet on North Avenue. This parcel of land is covered with large, beautiful old trees, and the buildings on the site are worth between $3,000 and $4,000. The owner is asking $10,000 for the tract. The committee believes that an annual net profit of $450 can be derived from the enterprise.</p>
   <p>The recommendation was rejected by a vote of eleven to six. Only seventeen of the sixty delegates voted.</p>
