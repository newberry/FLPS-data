   <p>Nota Bene, a new monthly, was born here in Chicago last week. When we saw the first issue we were thrilled. The cover was bright red, and well designed; "Ah!" we thought, "the boys editing, must be Bolsheviks, because the magazine is red as blood." But we were disappointed, Nota Bene is tame, very tame.</p>
   <p>On the title page we see that Gukild and Gythfeldt are the editors. Two editors, but not one little editorial. Why? Well, who knows? The first copy of "N.B." is sterile, vague and--well--it is easy enough to use a scissors, clip, clip, Daily News, clip, clip, Tribune, etc. The news section is not news, it is ancient history. But, let us have patience, Gythfeldt has style, and Gukild--well, he has done well in the past. Let us hope they will use "Begge 'Bena'" [both legs.] Well, we live in hope.</p>
