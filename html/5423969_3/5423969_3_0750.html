   <p>Yesterday was a veritable Fram day. Both the teams of the club were in the fire, and both came out victorious.</p>
   <p>The opposing teams were Sparta, which was beaten six two one, and Olympia defeated four to nothing.</p>
   <p>The Fram teams made excellent record. The boys appear to fall splendidly in line. It is necessary, however, that the boys stop scolding each other during the play. Avoid the bad impression!</p>
