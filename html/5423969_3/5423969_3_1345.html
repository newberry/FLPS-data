   <p>The lawn party held last fall yielded a net income of $111.80. Proceeds from the bazaar so far amount to about $700. Some tickets, etc. have not yet been paid for. Gifts sent directly to the committee have been received from Messrs. Eschbach, Christian Hansen, J. Bjerke, O. Hoitomt, and Mrs. Schenk.</p>
   <p>The board of directors wishes to extend its thanks to these donors as well as to all those who assisted at the various socials and at the bazaar. Thanks are also due to the public for the large attendance and financial support on the occasion referred to.</p>
   <p>A new set of rules, prepared and adopted in collaboration with the medical staff, has been presented for the guidance of patients.</p>

   <p>The ladies of the visiting committee will hold a "donation party" on New Year's Day, as they have done in former years.</p>
   <p>At the meeting the board of directors had the very interesting experience of receiving from Dr. Marie Olsen a list of twenty-five names of people applying for membership in the Hospital Society. These new members will form a new branch, the seventh of the Society.</p>
