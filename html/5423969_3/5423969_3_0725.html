   <p>The Rev. B. E. Bergesen will lecture on this masterpiece by Henrik Ibsen, under the auspices of the young people's society, Ulabrand. The lecture will be given at Wabansia Hall, corner of California and Wabansia Avenues.</p>
   <p>This is the second lecture sponsored by Ulabrand. A month ago, Dr. A. Klorstad spoke. Admission is free, and everybody is welcome.</p>
   <p>The Rev. B. E. Bergesen is well known among the Norwegians in America as an excellent speaker. There need be no doubt that his lecture on a theme such as Ibsen's "Brand" will be both interesting and of great value. All Norwegians ought to make an effort to be present.
