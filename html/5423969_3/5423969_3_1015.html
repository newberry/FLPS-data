   <p>The final session of the convention of the Norwegian Pioneer Society of America consisted of a banquet at Bjorgvin's Hall last Wednesday evening. The discouragement of the first day, when there had been talk of discontinuing the bi-annual conventions, had entirely disappeared; and the boyish enthusiasm of the old-timers left no doubt as to whether the meeting would be continued.....</p>
   <p>The speakers at the banquet were: Judge Torrison, toastmaster; Dr. A. Doe, Senator Thorpe, Mr. Malaas, Dr. Warloe, Knud Henderson, and Birger Osland.</p>
   <p>Our intimate acquaintance with these speakers and their ideals leaves no doubt in our mind that the injection of renewed interest administered by them will keep these people awake to the possibilities of the society, far beyond the two years ere the next convention.</p>
