   <p>Nicolay A. Grevstad, who, for the last four years has been the United States Minister to Uruguay and Paraguay, has returned to Chicago. Mr. Grevstad will remain here, and likely take up his duties with the Skandinaven. Mr. Grevstad gave a very interesting lecture, with picture slides. He told about his experiences in "paradise," about the people, the customs, the country, and the lazy, enjoyable life of the near tropics. He described the beautiful but vicious La Plata River, the highway of the country. Mr. Grevstad was introduced by Attorney A. Hummeland, the president of the Club.</p>
