   <p>The delegates chosen from the three turner societies [Translator's note: Two in Chicago and one in Minneapolis.] held a convention last Monday at Aurora Hall. All the members of the board of directors were present.</p>
   <p>The president opened the meeting, and it was decided that board members had the right to participate in the debate even though they had not been re-elected as delegates.</p>
   <p>Mr. G. G. Martin Moved that any member in good standing in any of the three turner societies be elegible as an officer even though the person in question had not been elected a delegate. An extended debate developed in regard to this, but a motion by Mr. S. J. Bokke, limiting the elegibility of officers <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to the delegates, was carried by two votes.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Jacobsen spoke of the desirability of organizing classes for boys within the Turner Association. He also expressed the wish that the boys be given a chance to compete at the Turner festivals.....The board of directors was instructed to prepare rules for the boys' classes, these proposed rules to be submitted to the various societies for adoption.</p>
   <p>An extended discussion developed as to whether the Norwegian-Swedish or the German system was to be employed in line gymnastics....</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Jacobsen moved that at future turner meets the Norwegian system of line gymnastics be used even though the teacher is not a Norwegian. This was adopted.</p>
