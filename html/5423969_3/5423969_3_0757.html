   <p>The ski tournament last Sunday at Norge Hill, Cary, Illinois, provided a day of thrills and spills. The hill is so steep and fast and the takeoff so high that it is a miracle that any of the jumpers could make perfect jumps. To shoot down the slide at a mile-a-minute pace and hurl oneself out into space, maintain one's balance in landing and complete the run, requires nerves of ice and muscles of spring steel and rawhide. One wonders how legs and skis can withstand the strain of landing from way up among the clouds.</p>
   <p>Professional and amateur alike took tumbles, and Ragnar Omtvedt, who recently set a new world record in Michigan, had to be satisfied with second place at Cary; he made jumps of 163 and 165 feet, which netted him 303 1/3 points, compared to 319 by Sigurd Hansen of Fergus Falls, Minnesota. The amateur champion was Arne Sletner of Chicago, with 289 points.</p>
