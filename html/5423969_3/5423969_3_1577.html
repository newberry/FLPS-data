   <p>The Norwegian Orphanage Society, in its annual meeting, elected a new board of directors, various committees, etc. [Names of newly elected officials omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Ten new members were received into the Society.</p>
   <p>A motion by the board of directors that the Society should refuse any money which might have been donated to the orphanage in the will of Mrs. Gunness was unanimously adopted. The retiring financial secretary.... gave the following interesting summary of the finances of the Orphanage since 1900:</p>
   <p>Payments to the matron for the care of children to be kept at the Orphanage <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>amounted to $15,603.75; contributions from rural districts totaled $4,618.96; Chicagoans contributed $42,143.33; a total income of $62,366.04.</p>
   <p>The board of directors was instructed to take under consideration the matter referred to in the report of the retiring president--to secure for the Orphanage a larger dependable annual income by inducing as many of the friends of the institution as possible to subscribe one dollar annually toward the maintenance of the Orphanage. The board of directors was requested to develop a workable plan for the attainment of this dependable income, and to report on the matter to the coming quarterly meeting.</p>
   <p>It was resolved that the president of the Society call an extra meeting as soon as the required ten thousand dollars has been collected for the building fund.</p>
