   <p>Mr. Christian Leder, prominent Norwegian ethnologist, is visiting Chicago. Mr. Leder, still a young man, had already made a name for himself through his extensive journeys and research. He will, in the near future, deliver a lecture on the Eskimos, describing their homes, home life, hunting and traditions. He will show a group of excellent pictures from the land of snow and ice and will present a decided novelty in the musical line: phonographic records of Eskimo music.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leder is a quiet, intense type, with nothing of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> or showman about him, but his personality makes itself felt both in private conversion and public appearance. His lecture will be very educational and will reveal facts about Eskimo life that were hitherto unknown. We sincerely trust that Cedric Hall will be filled to capacity on Wednesday evening, Jan. 3, 1912.</p>
