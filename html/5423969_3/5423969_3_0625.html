   <p>Jul i Norge (Christmas in Norway). The contents for this year are as follows: "A Norwegian Cultural Center"; "Paa Baelgen", a word picture of the City of Berger; and "Mellem Gul Orken og Sevillas Glade Nat" (From Desert to Happy Seville Nights). These are the outstanding stories, plus a dozen others.</p>
   <p>Among the pictures let us mention a few: "Bondehave" (Peasant Home), in colors, by Gerhard Munthe; and "Under Syrentraet" (Neath the Lilaes), in colors, by Olaf Isaacson.</p>
   <p>From the Old Parsonages, by Elise Aubert. This book brings us back to our childhood home; we see our country schoolteacher, our mountain tours of Fin Marken; we relive our youth again.</p>
