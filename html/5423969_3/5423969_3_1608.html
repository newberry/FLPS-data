   <p>The bazaar of the Norwegian Lutheran Orphanage Society opened yesterday at Harmony Hall. The attendance was very gratifying. As early as eight o'clock in the evening the crowd was so large that one had to move with caution, and an hour later it was difficult to make one's way from one end of the Hall to the other. The Hall is attractively decorated with bunting and plants.</p>
   <p>A mass of beautiful and useful articles are arranged in booths and upon tables in a manner to add elements both of good taste and of businesslike appearance.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adolph Larsen opened the program with a most appropriate speech and Miss Agnes Anderson gave a reading which evoked great applause.</p>

   <p>Lunch service was supplied by the Ladies' Aid Society of the Bethel Church, and the ladies did a great business. Tonight the Ladies' Aid Society of the Bethlehem Church will act as host both at the program and in the lunch department. This fact guarantees a good attendance.</p>
