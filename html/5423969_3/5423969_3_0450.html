   <p>In 1882, Illustrere Ugeblad [Illustrated Weekly] made its first appearance, with Christian Rasmussen [Dane] as publisher and Louis Pio [Dane] as editor. I worked on the staff for some time as typesetter, proofreader, errand boy, reporter, bill collector, ways and means committee, writer, and general all-around man. A year or so later, Professor Theodor Elbers, who had just arrived from Denmark, became editor. The well-known Norwegian Singing Society, organized by immigrants from Bergen, Norway, began its activities at that time; Elbers became its first director.</p>
   <p>The Illustrated Weekly had a building (or should we call it a shed), where the office and shop were located. Oil lamps would glow dimly here and there when there was work to be done at night.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven was, in the late '70's, considered the largest paper in Chicago, <span class="page-break">\2</span>with a three-story building on Peoria Street, and with fifteen to twenty typesetters and dozens of editors. At that time the Norwegian, Monrad Schuyen, was the editor. Among the assistant editors I remember especially the Norwegian, Professor Suein Nilsson and the Dane, Moses Salomonsen. Nilsson later became editor-in-chief. The offices and press rooms of Skandinaven were filthy. In those days, every one from editors down to the press boy had his own beer pail, and at noon one of the press boys would get the beer for the entire shop. Much of this beer was spilled on stairs and floor, and the entire place would sometimes smell like a brewery. The place was cleaned only once a year, so you can imagine what a lot of dirt was shoveled out.</p>
   <p>Norden [North Land] edited by Rellins, and later by Peer Stromme, kept its head above water for a while. Norden, was an elaborate sheet--four pages, ten columns to the page--it was a job to read it, one's arms were tired before the front page was half finished. A lady was asked, which one of the Scandinavian papers she liked best. Her answer was, "I like Norden, because when I finally get it read I can use it for dress patterns.</p>
