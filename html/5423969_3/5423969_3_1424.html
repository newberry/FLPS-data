   <p>We gave out six chickens for Thanksgiving and served supper at our mission to nineteen Nursery mothers, thirty-eight Nursery children, and fourteen visitors. Of our Christmas festivals the one most enjoyed was the entertaining of 140 poor at our Deaconess Home.</p>

   <p>Six of our children and one mother received free care at our hospital this year. We are thankful to the hospital for its generous cooperation in our work. We are also grateful for free medical service rendered to our Nursery children by our staff doctors and by Dr. Nils Remmen and for the many calls made by Dr. Penchina.</p>
