   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Orphanage Society held its annual meeting at Bethany Church last Wednesday evening. The meeting was well attended although many had sent excuses, since they were busy at the bazaar for the Home for the Aged.</p>
   <p>The meeting opened with the singing of a hymn, after which Reverend Espeseth read a portion of the twenty-fifth chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew. The president, Reverend G. T. Rygh, presided at the meeting. The secretary, Reverend Paulstud, read the minutes of the last meeting. The president presented the following annual report:</p>
   <p>"Once more a year has elapsed and God has held His shielding hand over our orphanage. With the exception of colds and children's diseases there has <span class="page-break">\2</span>been only one case of serious illness at the Home, and there have been no deaths among the children or the personnel. From day to day, through the acts of benevolent people, God has provided sufficient food and clothing and other temporal necessities. As for things of the spirit, there has been no lack of the presentation of the word of God for 'instruction, for conviction, for correction, and for chastising for righteousness'. The children are brought together morning and night for prayer under the leadership of the matron. During the school term most of the children attend the Dunning School, and during the summer a religious school and a Sunday School is conducted at the orphanage. It was found necessary to send two boys away from the orphanage, since they were unwilling to abide by the school discipline.</p>
   <p>"On the morning of August 6, a fire caused some damage, fully covered, however, by insurance. With thanks to God we are able to announce that neither children <span class="page-break">\3</span>nor personnel were hurt. At present there are fifty-four children at the orphanage, all of them healthy and strong.</p>
   <p>"When the president of the Society, Reverend John Hetland, resigned in June, as he was leaving for Kansas, Reverend Espeseth was elected president for the remainder of the term.</p>
   <p>"The following recommendations are submitted:</p>
   <p>"1. The committee appointed by the Society at its last annual meeting for the purpose of developing and presenting proposals for changes in the constitution of the Society is now ready to report. In particular, I recommend that the Society amend the constitution to the end that every member of the Society must also be a member of a Lutheran congregation. It would be desirable if the Society also adopted article nine, paragraph one of the committee report <span class="page-break">\4</span>requiring that at least two thirds of the board of directors be members of congregations connected with the United Lutheran Church in America. In order to safeguard against the possibility of the orphanage's passing into strange hands; to prevent possible bickerings and division in the board of directors as well as in the Society itself; to safeguard against the subversion of the Lutheran principles upon which the orphanage is founded; finally, to gain security as far as the maintenance of the orphanage in the future is concerned, I consider it absolutely necessary that the members of the Society also be members of Lutheran congregations.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Recommendation 2 is omitted in the paper.]</p>
   <p>"3. Next it is recommended that the Society at once begin the work of putting a concrete foundation underneath the orphanage building, with a cement floor in the basement, and that the best type of drainage and bathrooms be installed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Cleanliness and fresh air are the very first requirements for the health of the children.</p>
   <p>"4. A resident physician ought to be appointed. Preferably, he ought to be a member of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>"Thanking the many from far and near who have made gifts in money or in kind during the past year, but, above all, thanking our Heavenly Father for all good things, we conclude the present year. The great Friend of the Children, Our Lord Jesus Christ, will be with us in the new year, and by His mercy He will awaken desire in many to assist in the beautiful work of taking care of the little, neglected children, giving them what they need for body and soul. Let us not grow weary of doing good."</p>
   <p>The report was accepted, and it was resolved to take it up for detailed study and consideration later on. The secretary then read the following report:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"Once more the Orphanage Society has seen a year pass by. We have every reason to say that God has helped us up to this very day. At the beginning of the year it looked as if the Society had difficult times ahead, and there is no use denying that the board of directors had a difficult task on hand at the time. It would be most desirable that the Society and, especially, the board of directors be spared from such experiences in the future.</p>
   <p>"The orphanage has won many good friends of late, and we have good reason to believe that more will be added. The Society has held six meetings during the year; the board of directors, sixteen.</p>
   <p>"A number of repairs have been completed at the orphanage, and many more should be undertaken. We are hoping that generous hearts may open for this great cause so that the orphanage may thrive and solve its problems.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>"Forty-one new members have joined our Society this year; two members died during the year. At present there are fifty-four children at the orphanage."</p>
   <p>The secretary could not give a complete financial report since considerable amounts during the early part of the year went directly to the treasurer. According to the books of the secretary, the Society's finances are as follows:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Income</td>
     <td>$2,477.99</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Expenses</td>
     <td>$2,789.78</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The treasurer of the Society, Mr. Haakon Thompson, informed the annual meeting that his accounts had been sent to the revisions committee and that this committee had not yet finished its work with the books. Offhand he could <span class="page-break">\8</span>merely report that after all bills up to October 1 had been paid, there was sixty-four dollars in the treasury.</p>
   <p>The following is from the report of Miss Annie Abrahamsen, superintendent of the orphanage:</p>
   <p>On January 1, 1900, there were thirty-one children at the orphanage. During the year, thirty-eight have been accepted of ages from two and one-half years to fourteen years. Twenty of these children were "nonpaying"; two of the other children were being cared for at half the usual fee, while the full fee was being paid for the care of the rest.</p>
   <p>Thirty-eight of the children are going to the public school at Dunning. Eighteen children have been reclaimed by their parents. Seven children had been placed in the orphanage as temporary guests.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>There has been very little illness at the orphanage and no deaths during the past year.</p>
