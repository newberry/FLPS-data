   <p>The Norwegian Turner Society has decided to hold an extra meeting once a month, with competition for prizes. Medals will be given to the winners. Last Saturday evening a prize turner affair took place in the hall of the Society--Aurora Hall--and five medals were distributed among the best performers. Next month the competition will start all over again for these same medals; those who won them last Saturday will have to defend them against such as decide to enter the competition. An impartial jury of three men function as judges.</p>
