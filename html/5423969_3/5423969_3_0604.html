   <p>Scandia has just published Amandus Norman's latest book, Nordmaendene Amerika (The Norsemen in America). This book is not only well written, but it is an excellent historical document covering a widely discussed issue. It covers the Norse in America from the time of Eric The Red [The discoverer of Vineland] up to Colonel Hans Hegg and Knute Nelson.</p>
