   <p>Dr. A. Rommen and about one hundred members of the Tabitha Hospital Society has requested the States Attorney to start a "quo warranto" case and declare illegal the election of Dr. Valborg Sogn as director and Dr. Marie Olsen as president of the Hospital.</p>
   <p>The legal issue was that the constitution of the Society states that representation on the Hospital Board must be equally divided among the branches, and that the Norway Branch had more representation than was legal.</p>
   <p>It was requested that a committee be set up to write new bylaws; and this was accepted. Attorney John Waage suggested Henry A. Haugan and Nicolay Grevstad, but this caused a great storm of protest. Mr. Waage asked if Dr. Marie Olsen was willing to resign. Several members recommended that both Waage and Olsen resign.</p>
