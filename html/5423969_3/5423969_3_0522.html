   <p>Skandinaven has long been an old offender, and the worst, when it comes to "murdering" the Norwegian language. But Skandinaven has a competitor that is equally as bad, or should we say good, at the same literary "crime". This paper is the weekly Norden. A recent copy of Norden carried a news item telling of a man who fell into the hold of a ship, and was "Affort" (Affort: cathartic--evacuated--purged--etc.) to the hospital. We wonder what kind of a vehicle was used. Castor Oil?</p>
