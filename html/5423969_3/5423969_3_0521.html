   <p>"Our Big Brother" (Skandinaven) displays great editorial confusion, stupidity, etc. But, at the same time, the medal bearers, Knights of the Cross, crusaders, and "knights of this and that" from the editorial staff of "Our Big Brother", are improving as translators. Last week, in an article, the German name Mr. Joseph Sonenschein was translated to Mr. Joseph Sunshine.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the editorial staff on the improvements, such as they are, which are being made in translations from other languages. But Scandia respectfully calls the attention of Skandinaven to the fact that one does not translate given names or surnames. It may be that, in doing this, Skandinaven is attempting to be humorous. But, thank God, that's impossible.</p>
