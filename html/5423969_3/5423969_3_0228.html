   <p>The Third Annual Scandinavian Song Festival yesterday afternoon in Riverview Park was a great success. In spite of the heat, a large crowd had assembled - more than 8,000 - to listen to the tonal offerings. The united chorus consisted of four Norwegian singing societies, four Danish and seven Swedish. The result was a chorus of 500 voices.</p>
