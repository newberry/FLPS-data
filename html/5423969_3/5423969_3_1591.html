   <p>To date a total of $11,332.52 has been contributed to the building fund of the Norwegian Orphanage. This is not quite half of the money neccesary. The treasurer for the finance committee, Mr. Oscar H. Haugan, feels that the money should come in much faster. The building is to be erected this spring.</p>
