   <p>On Thursday the Ulabrand Society celebrated its seventh anniversary with a banquet at Wabansia Hall.</p>
   <p>The society's orchestra opened the evening's entertainment with a short, well-played concert. Miss Middleton sang several new Norwegian songs, with Miss Jenny Thoresen at the piano as accompanist; she was enthusiastically applauded. Miss Thea Olsen pleased the audience with her excellently played violin solos and her recitations of several of Per Sivle's popular compositions. Mr. Ericksen Frank, inevitable promoter of mirth, had the guests on the verge of hysterics with his comic stories and ballads.</p>
   <p>Mr. Abraham Abrahamsen, as toastmaster, presented Mr. Olof Bernts, of the Norwegian consulate, as the speaker of the evening. Mr. Bernts spoke for Norway and the Norwegian-American colony. Mr. Losse Grundeland spoke for <span class="page-break">\2</span>Ulabrand, reviewing shortly the history and work of the society. After this, several other members and guests were called on. All spoke of the pleasure and benefit they had derived from their membership in the society, and predicted a successful future for the organization.</p>
   <p>Ulabrand has done good work in our colony, though little publicity and no high-pressure advertising has announced its various gatherings. "Still waters run deep."</p>
