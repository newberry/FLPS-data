   <p>The book "Chicago", by Peder Daae had a bit of bad criticism by Dagsposten's [Daily Mail] editor. Of course we realize that two great men can not live in one "sock". And it is also natural that two ex-editors, from our fair land never would agree. Especially when Dagsposten's editor, Hoppedal believes himself to be an oracle of wisdom.</p>
