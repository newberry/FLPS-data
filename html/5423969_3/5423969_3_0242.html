   <p>Our Norwegian organizations will have little opportunity to see or fete Captain Roald Amundsen during his visit to Chicago. As he is the guest of the Chicago Geographical Society, his time will be almost entirely taken up with meetings the society has arranged.</p>
   <p>Captain Amundsen will arrive on Sunday afternoon, Feb. 2, and will be taken directly to the University Club, where he will be the guest of the Geographical Society during his stay in Chicago. On Sunday evening the Society is to give a monster banquet in his honor. However, on Monday, Feb. 6, at 6 P.M., Den Norske Klub (The Norwegian Club) is giving a dinner in honor of the explorer in the Florentine Room of the Congress Hotel. The dinner will necessarily be a rush affair, as the Captain is due at Orchestra Hall for his lecture at 8 P.M. Following the lecture, he will be tendered a reception and smoker. The Norwegian National League is discussing plans for a possible torch-light parade for Sunday evening, but this, at present, is somewhat indefinite.</p>
   
   <p>On Tuesday, the Captain goes to Evanston, where he is to lecture in the Congregational Church, under the auspices of the local lodge Suold (Shield) of the Sons of Norway. A detailed program of Captain Amundsen's engagements will be given in our next week's issue.</p>
