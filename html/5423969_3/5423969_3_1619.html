   <p>The Norwegian Society for the Orphanage held its quarterly meeting last Monday evening at Zion Norwegian Lutheran Church. The meeting was opened with prayer and scripture reading by Reverend George Rygh.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Michalsen of the visiting committee, reported that there are now fifty-two children at the Home; that all of these are healthy except a little girl who has had to stay in bed a few days.</p>
   <p>One woman applied for admittance to the Home for a child under two years of age. Since a baby of less than two years requires the full attention of one person, it was arranged to hire the child's mother as a cook at the Home, while she at the same time takes care of her child.</p>
   <p>Reverend Rygh supplemented the report by informing the members that two boys had been sent away from the Home for good and sufficient reasons.</p>
