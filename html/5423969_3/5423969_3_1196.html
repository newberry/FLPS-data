   <p>on a previous understanding with members of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>This being the annual meeting of the board of directors, the election of the medical staff of the hospital was a topic of discussion. In order to bind the doctors more closely to the institution, the rector recommended that they be authorized to organize. Further, in view of the fact that there was a prospect of enlarging the hospital in the near future, he recommended that the medical staff be increased in some way or other; he presented several plans for such a staff expansion.</p>
   <p>The rector further requested that he be again authorized to publish the annual report this year, and that Mother Ingeborg be granted a vacation of six weeks this year instead of the usual four weeks. The board of directors resolved to take up the rector's report for consideration.</p>
   <p>Reverend C. J. M. Gronlid, of Waterville, Illinois, was chosen as advisory member. It was resolved to elect the same physicians to the hospital staff</p>

   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>board of directors, because the board had not been authorized to make the purchase. When these lots have been paid for, they will be presented to the Society as a gift.</p>
   <p>Architect Richard E. Schmidt, of the firm Schmidt, Garden, &amp; Martin, had arrived by this time, and the plans for the new wing of the Deaconess Home were taken up for consideration. The plans were adopted unanimously, and the building committee was instructed to seek bids for the construction of the wing as soon as possible, and also to arrange for a suitable mortgage loan on the property.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to hold a special meeting of the board of directors when the contract for the erection of the new addition was to be let.</p>
