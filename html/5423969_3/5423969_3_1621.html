   <p>The Minde Ladies' Aid Society arranged for a concert at Wicker Park Hall last Saturday evening, the proceeds to go to the Norwegian Orphanage. In spite of the oppressive heat during the day, and the rain during the evening, more than five hundred people came to enjoy the concert, filing the hall to capacity.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of singing and instrumental music. Miss Lulu Lund sang two soprano solos most beautifully, and she was vigorously applauded. Mrs. Antonie Meyer accompanied her at the piano. Mr. W. Thur gave a violin solo, "Hieldreslaat" (Fairy Dance), by Thielmann, receiving well-deserved applause. There were several other musical numbers presented.</p>
   <p>The Reverend J. Z. Torgersen made a moving speech. He called attention to the heat of the past weeks with the many consequent deaths, mostly among <span class="page-break">2</span>children; then referring to the Minde Society, which has existed for nine years, the speaker pointed out that there has been, on the average, only one death per year. The speaker further dwelt on the good work accomplished by the Norwegian Orphanage and the happy way in which the superintendent, Miss Abrahamsen, has conducted the work. The educational work was considered especially praiseworthy by the speaker. The earliest instruction--the education the child receives before his tenth birthday--has proven, according to the speaker, to be fundamental to the child's development.</p>
   <p>The speaker concluded by wishing the Orphanage every possible success in the future. He thanked the Kinde Society for its sacrifices in favor of the cause, and especially for the work that had produced the evening's concert.</p>
   <p>After the concert, refreshments were served to all those present.</p>
