   <p>Most of the Scandinavian organizations have libraries with many volumes of books of an excellent quality. Some of the societies publish papers, and all sponsor lectures which have proved beneficial.</p>
   <p>There is at this time an idea being discussed which should be interesting if it materializes; namely, the organization of a radical political club. The proposed name is "The Karl Marx Club." Of course, those joining this club for the most part will be the social Democrats who had to leave Denmark, Norway, and Sweden suddenly. A club of this kind should find many supporters among the Democratic element here, but we feel that the Republicans would fight any organization of this type, so we may or may not live to see this club organized.</p>
