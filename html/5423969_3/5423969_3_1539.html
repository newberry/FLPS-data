   <p>Today there are seventy children living permanently at the Norwegian Orphanage. It was brought out at the last meeting of the Orphanage Society that even though an offer of five thousand dollars had been made for the old building, seven thousand dollars more would be needed to complete the new building.</p>
   <p>The following organizations have promised their assistance: Club West has undertaken to furnish a reception hall; Busy Bee, to furnish several girls' rooms; Friday Club, to furnish the dining room; True Friendship Circle, to furnish one sick ward; Bornevennen (Children's Friend), to furnish one sick ward; Embla, to furnish one girls' room; Alpha, to furnish one schoolroom; Trefoldigheds Women's Society, to furnish one teachers' room. Several more contributions have been received and will be reported next week.</p>
   <p>The report of the financial secretary for the period of January 1 to March 31, follows:</p>
