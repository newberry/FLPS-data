   <p>p.4......On Saturday evening, last week, one-hundred friends gathered at the home of Mr. and Mrs. William Gerner on Wilson Avenue to celebrate their 20th anniversary. The hearty congratulations of the assembled friends were augmented by telegrams from various clubs and absent friends. Mr. Gerner was one of the founders of the Norske Kvartet Klub (The Norwegian Quartet Club) and this club together with other singing societies attended the celebration and contributed several songs for the evening's program. Dr.Warloe spoke on behalf of the singers in general, expressing heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Gerner for his long and faithful service in several singing societies and, on the singers behalf, presented the guests of honor with a beautiful gift. The many gifts and flowers that were brought or sent were a real testimonial to the esteem in which this worthy couple is held both in and outside of the Norwegian colony.</p>
