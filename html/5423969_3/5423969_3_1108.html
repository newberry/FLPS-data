   <p>Leif Ericson Lodge No. 9, R. H. K., celebrated Christmas with a social at Nora Hall last Saturday evening.</p>
   <p>The attendance was somewhat smaller than had been expected, but this fact did not prevent the participants from enjoying themselves. A number of speeches were made and Mr. John Pedersen's orchestra rendered music.</p>
