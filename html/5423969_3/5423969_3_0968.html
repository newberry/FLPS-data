   <p>Nora Lodge is the oldest Norwegian Insurance and Sick Benefit Society in the United States. It was organized in 1860. Nora Lodge has always kept up Norwegian traditions. As an example, at the last meeting the Lodge decided to pay the dues of every member who volunteered for service, for the duration of the war. They have also purchased $1,000 worth of Liberty Bonds. The Lodge passed a similar resolution during the Civil War.</p>
