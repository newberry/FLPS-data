   <p>Viking Cycle Club received a great surprise last Saturday night. The club was called for a regular meeting and while the meeting was in full swing, the door was suddenly thrown open and a flock of young ladies marched in. In a few minutes the meeting was at end and the dance had started which lasted until 5:00 A. M.</p>
