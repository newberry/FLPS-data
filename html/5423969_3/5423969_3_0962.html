   <p>The Anna Kolbjornsdatter Lodge celebrated its eighth anniversary last night. Twenty-six new stars were added to its service flag which now has a total of seventy-seven stars. The Oselio Ladies' Singing Society opened the celebration by singing "The Star-Spangled Banner". The first gold star was then placed upon the flag. The festival ended by the Oselio Society singing Alfred Paulsen's beautiful "Naar Fjordene Blaaner".</p>
