   <p>On Tuesday, February 9, the board of directors of the Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess Home held its regular quarterly meeting at the Home. The usual reports were read and accepted. It was resolved that the superintendent start the publishing of a paper for the institution. A message of thanks was forwarded to King Haakon VII of Norway for the gift he had sent the Home. A committee was appointed to receive bids for the erection of the new building.</p>
   <p>From the report of the superintendent it appeared that the Home had made good progress along all lines. Three ladies' societies in various parts of the city are working for the Deaconess Society. Seven new sisters have been accepted since the last meeting of the board of directors. A probationary sister was compelled to withdraw on account of illness in her family. Sister Hannah Hermandson has taken up the work as Sister Superior at the Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess Home in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
