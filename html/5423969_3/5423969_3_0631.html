   <p>Dr. Anders Doe has just published a new book, "Short Stories of Hunting and Fishing".</p>
   <p>Dr. Doe, is an inveterate angler, and as a hunter he is "tops". He can tell you about the angler's and hunter's "tricks of trade", and yet, at the same time, he weaves into his book much practical advice, and tells of the life of the denizens of forest and stream. The critics do not "criticise" this book.</p>
