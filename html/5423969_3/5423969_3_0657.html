   <p>Rollo, The Murder of a King in Bergen (Chicago: John Anderson Publishing Co., no date of publication given). A historical novel.</p>
   <p>This historical novel is based on the saga of the death of Haakon Sverreson.... and the book is most entertaining and dramatic. It is rich in historic and romantic episodes and gives an excellent insight into conditions in Norway during the age when various pretenders were fighting for power. The tale of the little prince, the famous King Haakon Haakonsson of later years, of his travel across the mountains to Nidaros, and of the many dangers to which he was exposed during this trip, is highly interesting and holds the reader's attention. The whole book is so well written that there is not a dull moment from beginning to end. Once having begun to read, one hates to lay the book aside. The book contains several excellent illustrations.</p>
