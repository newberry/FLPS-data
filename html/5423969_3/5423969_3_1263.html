   <p>The Tabitha Hospital Society accomplished a great deal in the late 90's. They organized a Children's Home where thay had about sixty children at the end of 1899. It seemed that in every other line of activity the Society had "smooth sailing," but in the Hospital and Deaconess Home enterprises there always seemed to be factional strife. We lay much of the discontent to Skandinaven. This excuse of a paper has always stretched the facts in its editorials, and in April, 1900, it stated that "people believed the Hospital to be of Synod constitution". Statements such as these are not exactly true, and cause a great deal of misunderstanding.</p>
   <p>The Hospital started with a debt of $7,000, of which $2,000 was later paid, leaving $5,000 and a recent debt of $2,700 still outstanding. But the assets today are quite satisfactory: the grounds are worth $7,400; buildings, $25,487; inventory, $3,600. In 1900 there was a profit of $68.10.</p>
   
   <p>The pastors of the Synod have been bitter and have blocked much of the progress. They maintain that the Synod should have full control of the Hospital. Reverend Preus stated at the anniversary of the "Original" that it was impossible to work together, just as impossible as to raise priests in pants together with priestesses in skirts. Dr. Carl Sandberg recommends the dissolving of the "spiritual" committee. He suggested a broad committee of both laymen and pastors.</p>
