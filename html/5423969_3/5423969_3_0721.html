   <p>The second lecture in the Ulabrand series was given last night in Ulabrand Hall. It was a great success. About 400 people had met to hear Rev. Bergesen lecture on Ibsen's "Brand," and they followed the lecture with intense interest.</p>
   <p>Rev. Bergesen is a student of Ibsen literature, and clearly showed in his lecture that he has a keen insight into this mighty drama by Ibsen. A second lecture on the same subject by the same lecturer will be given in about one month.</p>
