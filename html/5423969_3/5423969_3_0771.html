   <p>p.8....The great and growing Norwegian-American sport (skiing) is now in full swing, though not in Chicago. Today and tomorrow all eyes will be turned toward Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, where the annual competition of the National Skii Association is being held. Chicago, however, is well represented. "Norge" Ski Club sent a delegation of its best jumpers, who will undoubtedly give a good account of themselves and "Nor" Ski Club is represented by sixteen who left last night traveling in a private coach via the C.&amp; N.W.Rr. The meet will draw a crowd of between twenty or thirty thousand.</p>
