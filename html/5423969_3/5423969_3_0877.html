   <p>A representative group of Norwegians met last night at the Norwegian Club to discuss the question of the Viking ship and to hear the Viking committee's report. The chairman of the committee, Mrs. John C. Thye, presided, and gave the report. She stated that the committee had tried to find a permanent place for the ship. The credit of arranging for a place in Lincoln Park belongs to the Norwegian Women's Federation whose permanent chairman is Mrs. J. J. Bennet. The Lincoln Park Commission promised to keep the Viking ship in good repair in the future. All but one of the committee members agreed to this arrangement. The single dissenter claimed that Humboldt Park was a better place for the ship. It will take a considerable sum of money to move the ship from Jackson to Lincoln Park, and this money is to be raised at once.</p>
