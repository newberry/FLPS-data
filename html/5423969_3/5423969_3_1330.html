   <p>The proposal by Mr. H. A. Haugan and others to change the constitution of the Tabitha Hospital Society [so as to make it obligatory that the majority of the members of the board of directors belong to the Norwegian Lutheran Synod]... is purely a business move. Mr. Haugan realizes that the Hospital needs greater assistance than it has received so far. Being a businessman, he wishes to gain support for the Hospital from the Synod congregations in Illinois, Wisconsin, etc. Such support could not be had unless these congregations are certain that the right kind of spirit prevails in the Society. The congregations in question will give no support to a society that sponsors lotteries, dances, and other affairs which the congregations consider sinful....The real purpose <span class="page-break">2</span>of Mr. Haugan's proposal was to secure the right for the Hospital Society to go to the congregations of the Synod to collect money for the Hospital.... This, it seems to me, is easily understood, if people really want to understand.</p>
