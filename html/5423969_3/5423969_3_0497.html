   <p>Scandia is the paper for the Norwegian businessman, for the doctor, the lawyer, the engineer, the teacher, for the minister, and last but not least, for the worker and the farmer. Scandia prints the best Norwegian news, and the best of local news. Scandia has always printed the correct news from Norway.</p>
   <p>Scandia is your paper, because it speaks the truth; it is critical, but it is also fair. Scandia is no church paper. Scandia is not conservative or reactionary; it is liberal, probably even radical.</p>
   <p>Scandia is the paper of the intellectual. It is your paper.</p>
