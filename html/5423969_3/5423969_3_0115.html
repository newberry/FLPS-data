   <p>The Singing Society Bjorgvin held a social last Saturday at Schoenhofen's Hall, in honor of the ladies who assisted at the last concert of the Society. About one hundred people were present. Four long tables, bulging with food, had been arranged by Mr. Anton Nass.</p>
   <p>After an hour of dancing in the smaller hall, Professors J. W. Colberg and Alfred Paulsen played Norwegian folk melodies, while the chairman of the committee on arrangements, Mr. Ingolf Erdahl, led the march to the tables. The chairman welcomed those present, after which the president of the Society, Mr. Alexander Anderson, spoke in praise of the ladies, thanking them for their assistance in the past and expressing the hope that, when needed in the future, they would prove as willing to help as they had been in the past.....</p>
