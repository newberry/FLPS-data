   <p>The proposed memorial to Christiania University from the alumnae in America is now an assured fact. The former students of this institution put on a campaign to raise $10,000 for a memorial. This goal was passed, and donations have reached the very satisfactory amount of $15,144.70, which has been turned over to the university to be used in any manner it deems best. Needless to say, the memorial will be one to which every graduate will be proud to have contributed.</p>
