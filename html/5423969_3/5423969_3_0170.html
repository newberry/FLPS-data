   <p>The Scandinavian Singers recently held one of the largest picnics they have given in many years.</p>
   <p>The picnic was, as usual, held in Riverview Park. The picnic grounds were jammed with festive-spirited Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>The American Union of Swedish Singers orchestra played in the bandstand. The Scandinavian Singers is fast becoming the leading chorus here.</p>
