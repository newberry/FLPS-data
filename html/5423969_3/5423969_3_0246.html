   <p>The R. H. K. (Knights of the White Cross) is now one of Chicago's strong fraternal orders. There are a number of local lodges throughout the city, and they are all co-operating to put on a big picnic tomorrow at Riverview Park. Nora Leif Erikson, Tordenskjold, Dovre, Wergeland and Columbia lodges will all take part in the outing. The Norsemen's Male Chorus will sing, and the Norwegian Turners will put on a gymnastic show. The Turners' band will play, and there will be a tug of war between the lodges.</p>
   <p>The knights recently moved into their new building, and the picnic tommorow is in the nature of a celebration of this event. Every effort has been put forth to make tomorrow's outing a success and we predict a record attendance. All Norsemen are welcome.</p>
