   <p>Norge i Billeder (Norway in Pictures) contains an introduction and brief descriptions. It is published by John Anderson's Publishing House, Chicago.</p>
   <p>This is a magnificent and most interesting work. It presents to us the most beautiful districts of Norway in pictures that are very well executed. Now the picture leads us up the green hillsides to the steep mountain tops; now to the romantic, quiet valleys; now to the bubbling brooks, the glittering fjords and mountain lakes; now among the multitudinous islets which constitute the "Skjargarden", until we face the mighty ocean.</p>
   <p>The most magnificent phases of Norwegian nature have been copied in this great <span class="page-break">2</span>picture book from the paintings of the greatest artists. The text is very interesting and presents an excellent explanation of each picture.</p>
   <p>The last part of the book contains pictures from the Saga of the vikings in Norway with their great deeds.</p>
   <p>On the cover is the picture of a boy and a girl as bridegroom and bride in Norwegian national garb....In the background is a Norwegian fjord district executed in colors, with the Norwegian flag above and the Norwegian emblem below. This magnificent work ought to find its way to every Norwegian Home.</p>
