   <p>The Good Will Circle visited the Bethesda Old People's Home on Sunday, December 2.</p>
   <p>This girls' club was organized this year, and its purpose is to work exclusively for Bethesda Old People's Home. On December 2, the girls made their first visit at the home in order to cheer the inmates. They presented a beautiful entertainment of music, singing and readings. Through their cheerful ways and their tact they succeeded in lending a sense of festivity and glamour to the affair. As they departed, they left at the home a neat little sum of money which they had gathered.</p>
