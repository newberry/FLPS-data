   <p>The Synod's organ defends John Anderson's publication of Snorre. We charge that the worst thing that John Anderson ever did in his long and sinful life was to publish this piece of literary loot.</p>
   <p>Rasmus B. Anderson, who co-operated with John Anderson in the publication of Snorre, has become the agent for the distribution of the bona fide edition of the book. This changes the picture, so far as Rasmus is concerned; now, as he points out, Skandinaven's edition has suddenly become full of typographical errors, and Rasmus accuses John of being unfair to the buyers of the book; he also alleges John has "plagiarized in the worst way" by stealing editions of Snorre of which the text and the illustrations are of inferior quality.</p>
