   <p>A bronze tablet will be placed by the ship, reading as follows:</p>
   <p>Norwegian Viking Ship</p>
   <p>This ship came direct from Norway to Chicago under its own sails, manned by a crew of Norwegian sailors commanded by Captain Magnus Anderson and carrying a message of good will from the people of Norway to the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago, in the year 1893.</p>
   <p>It is an exact reproduction of the famous ship, about 1000 years old, evacuated from King's Mound at Gokstad, County of Jarlsberg, Norway.</p>
   <p>In such ships the ancient Norwegian Vikings roamed the seas and founded Norse domains in Normandy, Ireland, and Sicily.</p>
   <p>About the year 1000 A. D. the Norwegian Viking chieftain Leif Erikson, sailing in such a ship without aid of compass, discovered the American continent.</p>
