   <p>p.1. The National Ski Tournament, held at the "Norge" Ski Club's hill at Cary, Illinois, drew a crowd of 12,000 fans of the national sport of Norway. There would undoubtedly have been many more spectators had the affair been given proper publicity, especially had the publicity been started earlier. Neither the American nor the Norwegian papers were given any detailed information regarding arrangements and program, and so were hampered in giving a willing publicity to the affair.</p>
   <p>The weather was ideal, and the snow on the rebuilt slide in very good condition, and the contest in jumping created many new or rejuvenated enthusiasts for this great sport. Three special trains on Saturday and seven on Sunday carried a good portion of the crowd to Cary, while hundreds of autos and trucks also brought their share.</p>
   <p>Many of the contestants criticized the hill as being too steep and the take off too high. The take off was lowered and the jumps became longer, much to the satisfaction of both contestants and spectators. Tumbles were frequent, <span class="page-break">2</span>proving the difficulty of the hill.</p>
   <p>The American amateur championship went to C. Solberg, St. Paul Minnesota, with 257 1/3 points, T. Jensen, Chicago, second with 243 2/3 points and Ragnar Omtvedt, Norway, third with 243 points. T. Jensen was the "Norge" Ski Club entry and has, for several years been one of the best skiers in the country.</p>
   <p>Sunday contests brought out Lars Haugan, Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, as champion of the professional class with Sigurd Hansen, Fergus Falls, Minnesota, second and Erling Landvik, Stoughton, Wisconsin, third. There are twelve entries in this class. The longest perfect jump, (i.e.without falling) was made by Sigurd Hansen and measured 119 feet. Anders Haugen jumped 121 feet but was disqualified, falling after landing. Carl Solberg made the longest jump, 121 feet, in the amateur class.</p>
