   <p>The Norwegian Tabitha Hospital groups are busy this week with their bazaar at the Humboldt Park Parish House, Lemoyne Street and California Avenue. The proceeds of this bazaar go to the fund being raised for the proposed new addition to the hospital. The attendance so far has been very good and prospects are that the last two days will bring out the largest crowd ever assembled at such an affair. May success crown their every effort.</p>
