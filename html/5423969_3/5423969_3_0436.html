   <p>Editor Scandia:</p>
   <p>Of queer journalistic absurdities there seems to be no end. Scandia has its full share. The continuous intolerant writings by Mr. Sundy-Hansen are an attempt to impose his will upon its readers. The issue, of course, is the old, old story, the infallibility of material science and the impossibility of religion.</p>
   <p>To such fanatics the idea of freedom of thought and opinion means freedom to impose their peculiar views upon others, by persuasion if possible, and even by fiat of law or force (which amounts to the same thing) if all other means fail. A mental attitude of this type allows no room for tolerance. It is against this attitude that thousands had to offer their lives.</p>

   <p>What hasn't the world fostered in the way of absurd opinions, labeled as science? To enumerate them all would require a catalog of considerable size. It is enough to remind you readers of a few of the most outstanding examples selected at random. Consider, for example, Mr. Olaf Ray discussing the question of heat and light in the Journal of Science, telling us about one of the commonest facts in nature--the heat of the sun. He says: "The question of the temperature of the sun has been the subject of investigation with many scientists: Newton, one of the first investigators of this problem, tried to determine it, and after him all the scientists who have been occupied with colorimetry have followed his example. All have believed themselves successful and have formulated their results with great confidence. The following, in the chronological order of the publication of results, are the temperatures (in centigrade) found by each of them: Newton, 102,200; Seccli, 5,344,840; Ericsson, 2,720,700; Fitzeau, 7,500; Waterstone, 9,000,000; Spoere, 27,000; Deville, 27,000; Deville, 9,500; Soret, 5,801,840; Vicaire, 1,500; Roselli, 20,000; the difference is as 1,400 against 9,000,000, or no less than 8,998,600 degrees!! There probably does not exist in science a more <span class="page-break">3</span>astonishing contradiction.</p>
   <p>I have been reading numerous articles by Mr. Sundy-Hansen which prove him to be a fanatic regarding material science. I am reluctant to complain about the length of his articles at times because I realize that sometimes its piecemeal presentation in Scandia may possibly be accounted for by the exigencies of space. I shall be more than delighted when this eminent penman stops his intolerant criticism of those who permit themselves to consider abstract ideas.</p>
   <p>What church or sect our pen champion will bulldoze next I do not know, and it does not matter. We know now that he is not a man of liberal ideas. Neither is he a true scientist, as the latter is far in advance of this pope of prejudice and bigotry. He is an ultramaterialist and interprets fairly accurately the ideas of this branch, but like all materialists of this type he makes at least one fatal error.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>He is deeply concerned about what he conceives to be science. He is anxious to salvage the wreckage of the old, hence he hitches his scientific wagon to materialism and writes learnedly about religion and religious thought of today without even having investigated it. In foolish terms he describes such scientists as Einstein and Sir Jeans. There is where our learned and smart friend makes his fatal error. Neither scientists nor anyone else with common sense recognizes such fantastic vagaries as those enunciated by Mr. Sundy - Hansen against eminent thinkers of our time. They are forerunners of the new direction science has taken. Science might be submitted to the law of evolution, like all else in nature.</p>
   <p>As has previously been pointed out by other writers in Scandia, when fanatical materialists dabble in religious thought, they go outside of their narrow field and their speculations have no more value than those of any others who have never taken the trouble to investigate the subjects they permit themselves to criticize.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>This journalistic juggler knows something that the uninformed and gullible thousands, to whom materialism still is like any other fanatical cult, are quite unaware of. Authority is still a potent force among the ignorant. Mr. Sundy-Hansen believes himself to be an exalted exponent of materialism. When he, therefore (unquestionably urged by an inner pressure) puts his pen on paper and speaks of a "cosmic religion" virtually in terms of an ignoramus, the uninformed readers of Scandia assume that there must be something in it. And those who profit by the perpetuation of this materialistic babble are fanatics who believe in swinging a terroristic whip whenever occasion lends itself. Mr. Sundy-Hansen's writings are a sample of what we may expect to see much of in the future, in case free thought should be abolished. We shall then be served with only a hodgepodge of meaningless nonsense, embroidered with so-called scientific materialistic foundation. As a plausible excuse for it, the superficially educated and uncritical masses will be led to believe that the god of materialism is the only god to worship.</p>
   <p>Do not let us forget, however, that the fanatic of materialism is the selfsame <span class="page-break">6</span>old tyrant of mankind, the bitter enemy of freedom of thought, the relentless warrior against real knowledge, real scientific advancement and thought as any other fanatic.</p>
   <p>May I, before leaving the subject, express my sincere wish that our worthy scientific friend stick to his pet hobbies: Socialism, bolshevism, and materialism. There is where his heart lies, and there his talent will find its greatest use. Whenever he feels the craving to swing a fierce journalistic club against his archenemy, religion, let him remember the saying of the American: "Mind your own business," and the German: "Leben und Leben Lassen" [Live and let live] and the Norwegian: "Fei for Din Egen Dor, Forend Du Feier for Andres" [Sweep before your own door, etc.]. There is plenty of cleaning to be done within his own domain; so let him leave the religionist alone, and take care of himself.</p>
