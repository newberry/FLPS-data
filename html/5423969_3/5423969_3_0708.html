   <p>Captain Roald Amundsen delivered his last Chicago lecture Sunday, at 2:00 P.M., at the Grand Opera House. This lecture was the fifth in Chicago and the only one given in the Norwegian language in the U.S. A. The total attendance at his Chicago lectures was nearly 10,000. In New York, 5,600 turned out for the two lectures given there. The largest attendance at Captain Amundsen's lectures was at Toledo, Ohio, where the Coliseum was filled to its capacity - 10,000.</p>
   <p>It was Captain Amundsen's desire to deliver this particular lecture in a hall located on the Northwest Side, but neither Wicker Park Hall nor the Logan Square Auditorium was considered large enough. Locating the Norwegian lecture downtown proved unwise however, as repeated attempts to draw our people to the downtown district have never proved successful. However, an average of about 2000 for five lectures speaks well for Chicago.</p>
