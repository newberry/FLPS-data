   <p>The Norwegian-American Hospital [formerly the Tabitha Hospital] will soon celebrate its twenty-fifth anniversary. The Hospital, as we all know, is located at the corner of Cortez Street and Francisco Avenue. The total value of the building is $105,000. The last buildings erected were the nurses' home and the students' home. Sixty additional private rooms have been added to the Hospital. The Hospital board intends to build larger surgical and medical wards in the near future.</p>
