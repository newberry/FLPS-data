   <p>p.8...The spirit of "never give up" in the Norse make-up is being demonstrated by a little group of men of our Chicago Norwegian Colony. During a severe storm, this summer, the slide on the "Norge Ski Klub" hill at Cary, Ill., blew down, and was completely wrecked. The ski boys are busy clearing away the wreckage preparatory to building a bigger and better slide for the coming activities, including the great "International Ski Tournament"with the world's best jumpers competing. This meet will draw a record crowd to the "Norge" hill, as the champions of Norway, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, etc. in competition will provide thrills that will make skiing one of America's most popular winter sports.</p>
   <p>Subscription lists for funds to finance the rebuilding of the slide will be out on Tuesday, and we urge all friends of "Norge" and skiing to cheerfully do their part.</p>
