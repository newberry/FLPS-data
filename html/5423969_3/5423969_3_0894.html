   <p>At a meeting of the board of directors of the Leif Ericson Monument Society, last Thursday, it was resolved to disband the Society and return its charter to Springfield since the task for which the Society was formed has been completed. The Leif Ericson monument has been unveiled, and all bills connected with the monument's creation have been paid.</p>
   <p>The board of directors were of the opinion, however, that inasmuch as the members of the Society had been co-operating so well during the years of working for the Leif Ericson monument, it would be desirable to continue their work together for some other worthy objective, forming a branch of some society working for an orphanage or some other charitable undertaking. A motion to this effect was made and carried unanimously. Mr. L. E. Olson was elected temporary president; Mr. C. Nergard, temporary secretary.</p>
