   <p>Humboldt Park was crowded all day Sunday by the thousands of people who came to see the Leif Ericson Monument. The general opinion was that much praise was due both to the sculptor, Mr. Asbjornsen, and to the members of Leif Ericson Monument Society.</p>
   <p>Superintendent Ernest F. Wahl and the gardener-foreman, Mr. G. Armstrong, are still busy arranging for the beautification of the plot surrounding the monument.</p>
   <p>Mr. Armstrong deserves credit for the interest he has shown in connection with the placing of the foundation for the monument. The time at his disposal was limited, yet the job was well done.</p>
