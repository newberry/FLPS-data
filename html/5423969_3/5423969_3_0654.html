   <p>Norge i Billeder (Norway in Pictures) is now appearing in a new and enlarged luxury edition published by the John Anderson Publishing Company (Skandinaven's publisher). The book consists of one hundred and ninety-six pages and contains ninety-three of the most excellent pictures, including scenes of Norway's natural splendors, from Norwegian history and from Norwegian life of today.</p>
   <p>The preparation of this magnificent work has required much time and has cost much money. In starting the work the publishers were fully aware that nothing but a most complete presentation of the phases of Norwegian life referred to would meet the requirements.</p>
   <p>The book is bound in a manner quite exceptionally elegant; the text has been chosen with the greatest care, and the pictures are as exquisite as the paper <span class="page-break">\2</span>on which they are printed--all of this makes the book one of the most valuable works about Norway so far brought before the public.</p>
   <p>We who came to America as mature men and women and who have adopted this great and rich country as our second homeland will not forget the land of our cradle. We will remember the house, however cramped the quarters might have been; we remember the lawn, nowhere greener and more enchanting than at home; we remember the broad fertile fields; the narrow, somber valleys; the hillsides, made bewitching by carpets of flowers and groves of birches.</p>
   <p>And then the church in the valley. When we behold all this glory as presented in the beautiful pictures of this book, we feel as if we were living our life all over again. We recognize the old homesteads; we say with Gunnar of Lidarende, "Never did the land seem as beautiful as now".</p>
   <p>When our children ask about the land of their fathers--the land which they never saw but which they love because their father and mother love it--can <span class="page-break">\3</span>we give them a better answer than in showing them the fine pictures from Norwegian life, nature, and history presented in this book?</p>
   <p>Can there be a finer Christmas gift than Norge i Billeder with its magnificent binding, its beautiful pictures from shore and from countryside, from snow-capped mountains, from dreaming lakes and fjords.</p>
   <p>The book is nine inches wide and twelve inches tall. It is printed on the very finest of paper and is elegant in every way. The price....is surprisingly low.....An advertisement elsewhere in the paper will give details about the work.</p>
