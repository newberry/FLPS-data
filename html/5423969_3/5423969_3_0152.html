   <p>Rolf Hammer and Mrs. Borgny Hammer, heads of the Norwegian Theater, produced, this past week, Wilhelm Krag's well-known play "Solned Gang" (Sundown) and the jolly operetta "Fritz and Elise" by Offenbach.</p>
   <p>It is not generally known that Mr. Hammer, while in Kristiania [Oslo], played the titled role in "Sundown" under the instruction of the author, Wilhelm Krag. Mr. Hammer played the part this time as usual. He portrayed Adjutant Mork in the most lively fashion--exactly as the old Norwegian army officers would be.</p>
   <p>The two plays are short but full of action, and it takes excellent routine to finish the plays inside two hours.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hammer ended the evening with several recitations. Applause was loud <span class="page-break">2</span>and stormy when she recited "Hilsen fra Norge" (Regards from Norway) and "Over the Hoje Fjelde" (Over the Mountains High). She also sang the beautiful "May Song" by Niels Collet Vogt.</p>
