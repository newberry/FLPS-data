   <p>The American-Scandinavian Foundation announces that an Advisory Committee has been formed in Chicago to co-operate with the Foundation in its work promoting Scandinavian interests in Illinois and the Middle West. The committee is made up of ten well-known citizens of Scandinavian descent. Mr. Charles H. Peterson has been appointed chairman. The members representing the Swedish interests, in addition to Mr. Peterson, are Mr. Axel Lanquist, and Mr. Henry Henschen; the Norwegian members are Consul Herman F. Gade, Mr. Oscar H. Haugan, and Mr. Birger Osland; the Danish members are Dr. Max Henius, Mr. Henry L. Hertz and Mr. Carl Antonsen. There is also an Icelandic representative in the person of Mr. C.H. Thordarson. Friends of the Foundation are greatly encouraged by the enthusiasm which these men have shown in volunteering to extend the influence of the organization into the fields which it otherwise could scarcely hope to reach. It is expected that, through this committee, the work of the Foundation will be greatly strengthened in erecting a general knowledge of Scandinavian life, thought, art, and literature in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>middle West, and in increasing the effectiveness in the community of American citizens of Northern descent.</p>
