   <p>Mr. Christian Botker, editor (?) of the Danish weekly Revyen, is very much offended because a Norwegian paper in New York and a Norwegian paper in Chicago have taken issue with him because he pretends to be both Norwegian and Danish. In his capacity as editor of the Danish-Norwegian (?) paper he executes the most sensational literary acrobatics. He also loves to copy news items from Scandia, and then accuse us of plagiarism.</p>
   <p>Now he pins roses on himself, asserting that he was one of the judges at the skating tournament held by the Sleipner Society in Humboldt Park. Just think of it! Botker the Dane--pardon us, the "Norwegian-Dane"--a judge! Well, Mr. Botker explains that it was a typographical error. How? Well, let him tell you:</p>
   <p>"The name of Judge Number Five, Charles Rodker, was accidentally (?) <span class="page-break">\2</span>misspelled Botker."</p>
   <p>That may be, but Revyen had the name as number one on the list.</p>
