   <p>At its last meeting, the First Scandinavian Women's Burial Society installed its new board of directors. The new board was not "new", however, for all of the incumbent officers were re-elected. Mrs. Marie Halvorsen, assisted by Mrs. Berg, officiated at the installation because the senior president of the Society, Mrs. Christine Christoffersen, was unable to attend. This was the first time during the thirty-one and a half years of the Society's existence that Mrs. Christoffersen had been absent from an installation ceremony of the Society.</p>
   <p>After the installation ceremony, musical entertainment was provided by the Helve sisters, who played violin and piano selections. Miss Madsen and Miss Bensen sang; there was also singing by twenty of the children from the Norwegian Orphanage. Ice Cream, coffee and sandwiches were sold, the proceeds going to the Norwegian Orphanage Society.</p>
