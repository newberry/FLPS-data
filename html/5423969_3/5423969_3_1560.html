   <p>On April 27 a special meeting of the Society for a Norwegian Orphanage was held. A committee of fifteen was appointed to determine whether or not the Society should build on its twenty acres in Edison Park, or whether it should sell this land and build inside the city limits. Knowing the Society as I do I think that it will unanimously adopt the report of this committee.</p>
   <p>This committee held several meetings at which it discussed the factors investigated, such as food and shelter, education, and the standard of living. Finally the committee concluded that to build in Edison Park would be better in every respect than to build in the city. In view of the fact that construction of the building should be finished in time for school this fall, the committee considered how a very up-to-date building might be erected at a minimum cost. The committee thought that the Society should not attempt at present to arrange for more than seventy or eighty children. So far the maximum number of children has been seventy, and experience shows that the Society at present is hardly able to care for more, especially with a deficit of $700.....The committee thought that there ought to be no mortgage on the buildings. A mortgage on a building of any charitable institution is dangerous. Especially is this true with regard to an orphanage that has no definite or permanent income with which to meet its regular expenses. Therefore, the committee dared not to recommend a building that would cost more than the money in the treasury of the Society plus the rental from the Society's property in Irving Park, and plus such amounts as we may reason-ably expect to collect this fall. We hoped that the Society would authorize the board of directors to appoint a suitable person to begin collecting funds.</p>
   <p>Finally, the committee recommended that the blueprint be made according to the needs of an orphanage. First, boys and girls should have separate living quarters and they should meet only at school and during meals. This is the cottage system, which is characterized by a main office building, school rooms, dining room, and kitchen. One house should be built for the boys and another for the girls. This plan is now being adopted. It is a good one, and it has been recommended by influential men in Washington. These men have even suggested that the state legislatures adopt laws making the cottage plan compulsory wherever orphanages are to be built. This plan also permits easy extension of the orphanages. New cottages may be added without change in the old buildings.</p>
   <p>After studying and discussing the various plans presented at several meetings, and after securing the advice and an estimate of costs from Architect Sigvard Sorensen, the committee decided to recommend to the Society the building of one main structure for the orphanage and two cottages, one for boys and one for girls. Architect Sorensen promised to be present and explain the plan in detail. The cost of buildings that would accommodate eighty children and their supervisors and servants should not, according to Architect Sorensen, greatly exceed $16,000.</p>
   <p>On the basis of this data the committee recommends to the quarterly meeting of the Society: First, that new buildings be erected in Edison Park as soon as possible. Second, that the earlier building plans be discarded. Third, that the proposed buildings be one main building and two cottages, in accordance with the plan presented by Architect Sorensen.</p>
   <p>If the Society adopts these proposals, the building committee, the architect, and the matron, Sister Caroline Williams, should meet, in order to agree on the details of the plan. Then the committee should be authorized to accept the modified plan, if the cost involved does not exceed $16,000.</p>
   <p>If, however, this amount is found to be insufficient to provide adquate buildings, then the board of directors should be given authority to appropriate additional funds.</p>
   <p>It is also recommended that Architect Sorensen and the building committee or some other authorized committee go to Edison Park to determine the site for the new buildings.</p>
   <p>The building committee should be directed to begin the work of construction as soon as possible. Speed is required if the buildings are to be ready for occupation before winter.....</p>
   <p>On receipt of the President's report the quarterly meeting of the Society resolved unanimously: First, that the new buildings for the orphanage be erected in Edison Park as proposed in the Report. Second, that plans to build according to resolutions adopted at a previous meeting be rescinded. (This earlier plan specified a building to cost $30,000 and to be large enough to house 150 children.) Third, that the new orphanage buildings be constructed in accordance with the cottage plan. Fourth, that the building committee, the board of directors, the matron of the Orphanage, and Architect Sorensen have full authority to modify or change the details of the plan and to start the work of construction as early as possible. After the plan has been finally adopted it is to be described fully in the Skandinaven.</p>
   
   <p>It was decided that the buildings be made of brick. The architect's plans were for frame buildings. At the meeting frame buildings were thought to be more costly in the end.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anton Pedersen was elected new member of the building committee. Then the board of directors was authorized to appoint a man to collect funds next fall, during the construction of the buildings. Thus the possibility of having the new buildings erected and paid for before winter, is very great. Thirty new members were received into the Society. The meeting was one of the most important in the history of the Society. The attitude of the members was excellent. There was not a sign of discord. All the resolutions or decisions were unanimously made. Everybody seemed animated by the great idea and noble purpose of providing, for the children of the Society's orphanage, an up-to-date home in Edison Park, and of having this task accomplished as soon as possible.....</p>
   <p>"The Lord our God will stand by and make our efforts succeed," said President C. F. Ellestad.</p>
