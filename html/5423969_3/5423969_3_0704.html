   <p>p.7....The Norwegian National League has for some time been planning a program, according to which a lecture on a certain theme would be presented to its members once a month.</p>
   <p>The new program had its inception yesterday with Judge Oscar M. Torrison giving a lecture on the Constitution of the United States.</p>
   <p>The meeting was poorly attended, but those present had an unusually pleasant and instructive evening.</p>
   <p>The lecturer went back to the first immigrants in this country; also touching the first Scandinavian settlers here, who refused to use or own slaves.</p>
   <p>In very concise and effective language, Judge Torrison handled the main points in the Constitution, and drew up several comparisons with the Constitution of Norway, these comparisons, the speaker said, favored Norway as the people there had a more direct election, hence more influence in the government, than here. The lecturer handled separately the three parts of the "Constitution"; the executive, the legislative and the judicial. Under the last part he mentioned the first case handled by the Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>The lecture lasted forty-five minutes and received a hearty applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Kramer, president of the Norwegian National League, announced, that these lectures would be continued as he considered it of grave importance, that the Norwegians should acquaint themselves with the Constitution of their adopted country. He asked those present to tell their friends.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kramer in behalf of the"League," thanked Judge Torrison for the fine lecture. He also thanked Norsemen's Singing Society for the three songs rendered.</p>
