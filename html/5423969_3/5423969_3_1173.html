   <p>The Deaconess Home began its activities on May 1, 1897, in a two-story building of twenty-five rooms, on the corner of Artesian Avenue and Le Moyne Street. The work carried on by the sisters grew to such an extent that it became necessary to rent rooms in adjoining buildings. The United Church realized that if the work was to become permanent, it was necessary to erect a special building. Six lots, at Haddon Avenue and Leavitt Street, were purchased, and a building was constructed. The new Home was completed on November 1, 1902.</p>
   <p>The United Norwegian Church of America took over the management of the Home in 1904. From this time on, more and more women joined, and the present quarters became too small. A three-story building was then leased, but soon this building was also filled. The Church then decided to enlarge the present Hospital and Home. Construction was begun in 1909, and finished in 1910. The new building was dedicated on November 20, 1910.</p>

   <p>In 1898 only six sisters were connected with the institution. Today there are seventy-five sisters, who, in addition to their work in the Hospital, are active in nineteen stations and eight different fields--six hospitals, three stations in Madagascar, three stations in China, one children's home, one kindergarten, one home for the aged, four congregations, and one Jewish Mission. In 1897, 102 patients were admitted to the Deaconess Hospital. In 1911, there were 1,540 patients: A total of 7,863 patients have been admitted since the opening of the institution. In 1897, the income was $3,237.82; for the past year, ending May 1, 1912, the total income was $53,688.80</p>
