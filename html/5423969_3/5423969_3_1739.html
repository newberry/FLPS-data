   <p>The Concordia branch of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society met on Thursday evening, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Otto C. Ericson, Evanston. The meeting was exceptionally well-attended in spite of the long distance most of the members had to travel, and all who came enjoyed the meeting very much. Vocal solos by Mrs. Wm, Ingraham, piano solos by Miss Lilly Andersen, and readings by Mrs. J.L. Barchard combined to make the evening a real treat for all.</p>
