   <p>The second quarterly meeting of the Norwegian Orphanage Society was held in the Trinity Church last Tuesday. Reverend Lars Harrisville, the chairman, called the meeting to order. It was resolved to send the former chairman, Reverend Ellestad, a vote of thanks for excellent work in the past.</p>
   <p>It was reported that the Society has a deficit of over $400.</p>
   <p>Reverend N. J. Ellestad submitted the following report:</p>
   <p>"I received the last certificate from Architect Sorensen on July 3, 1911. It is a certificate for $200 made out to the Humboldt Heating Plant. We owe Mr. A. Harvey $180 for plumbing. There is also an unpaid bill for building <span class="page-break">2</span>repairs amounting to $380....I was informed by Mr. Saetrang that there is a balance of $117.81 in the treasury.....The architect, Mr. Sorensen, sent me the following notice:</p>
   <p>" 'All the work had been completed prior to the issuing of the various certificates, but I shall make a call at the Orphanage in the near future to ascertain whether everything pertaining to the buildings is in proper shape; and if I find anything wrong, I shall have same adjusted at once.'</p>
   <p>"Much of the labor has been donated and we have saved large sums of money in many cases.</p>
   <p>"It is hoped that Revev end Andresen will, at an early date, start the financial drive, so that we can secure funds for our work. Mr. Thorbjorn Hansen <span class="page-break">3</span>has proved very reliable and efficient in his capacity of temporary superintendent."</p>
