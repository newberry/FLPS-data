   <p>The Norwegian colony of Chicago is pleased over a piece of good fortune in the line of music. A recent arrival in Chicago is a young tenor, Thorwald Woll, who is a son of Rev. Hans Woll of Lillihammer, Norway, and a nephew of Professor Woll of Madison, Wisconsin. This young man has an excellent musical education and has won a name for himself in the old land, where he was the soloist for the Norwegian Student Singers' Federation for several years.</p>
   <p>During the "Wild Rollo" festivities in Rouen, France, last summer, Mr. Woll was the soloist of the great Norwegian chorus that took part in that affair.</p>
   <p>We are all waiting to see with which of our Chicago choruses he will affiliate, and we are looking forward to his first appearance in a Chicago concert.</p>
