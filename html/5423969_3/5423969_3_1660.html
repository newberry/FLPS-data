   <p>We give here the report of the last annual meeting of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society. The main interest lies in the fact that this Society has grown and strengthened more than any other society over a period of five years. The report reads as follows:</p>
   <p>The twenty-fourth annual meeting of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society was held Friday evening at the Wicker Park Church, corner of Hoyne Avenue and LeMoyne Street, Chicago, Illinois. The meeting was opened with prayer by Reverend M. L. Nesvis. Mr. Lars Enger presided. Reports of the various officials and branches of the Society were read, approved, and ordered placed on file. The following nominations were presented to serve on the board of directors and ladies' auxiliary board.</p>

   <p>The secretary was requested to take one ballot, and the above were unanimously <span class="page-break">\3</span>elected. It was moved and carried that a vote of thanks be given to Skandinaven, Scandia, the Northwest News, and all retired officers. A vote of thanks is also to be extended to the pastor of the congregation for the use of the church for our annual meeting. Our president, Mr. Lars Enger, was honored by a rising vote of thanks in recognition of his self-sacrificing and untiring efforts in behalf of the Home.</p>
   <p>President's Report</p>
   <p>The year 1919 has in some respects been a notable year in the annals of the Norwegian Old People's Home, for we have gone through the first period of reconstruction, as it were, and while we expressed the hope a year ago that the high-water mark of the cost of living had been reached, we have actually experienced an increase in expenses of about twenty per cent over last year in running the Home with the same number of inmates. At this writing we are not in position to state whether we have mounted as high in expenses as we <span class="page-break">\4</span>will, for the prospects before us are not as good as we would wish them to be. However, we are not looking at the future in a spirit of defeat, fear, or discouragement. The Society has fully measured up to the mark every year even though expenses have gradually increased, and we are confident the same will be done in the future.</p>
   <p>Through the diligent efforts of our advertising manager, Mr. O. A. Satrang, and two or three others, more than eleven hundred dollars was received from advertising in our annual; the cost of publishing and distributing totaled about three hundred dollars, thus netting the Home about eight hundred dollars. The receipts from the tag day were somewhat less than last year because at just about that time the city of Chicago witnessed a tag day every two or three days, and the people had grown somewhat tired of being tagged. Our ladies worked just as hard and with the same intelligent effort as before, and deserve great credit even though the conditions were not favorable.</p>
   <p>The Midsummer Festival was more successful than ever, both in attendance and <span class="page-break">\5</span>in money receipts. About fourteen hundred people attended the picnic last August, not quite as many as the year before, but those who were there spent their money more freely and the proceeds were higher than for any previous year. The bazaar, held during the first week in December, was the greatest of all bazaars the Society has conducted, and resulted in about $5,700 in gross receipts, nearly two thousand dollars more than the year before, and we estimate that fully four thousand people were in attendance.</p>
   <p>Through the harmonious efforts of all the active workers of the Society, the money to pay all bills as they came due has been furnished, and not only that, but the assets of the Home have increased by about $6,000. The average length of residence at the Home is about ten years, and at the present cost of running the Home of about $220 per person per year, the Society must furnish $2,200 for every resident admitted as a life member.</p>
   <p>The charitable work done by the Norwegian Old People's Home Society during <span class="page-break">\6</span>1919 took care of about seventy-five per cent of the expenses; the remaining twenty-five per cent came from admission fees.</p>
   <p>Preparations for the greatest effort ever made to raise money for the endowment fund of the Norwegian Old people's Home was started this fall, and a good beginning was made on December 15 when over $15,000 was subscribed at a gathering held at the Norske Klub [Norwegian Club]. The canvass is now going on, and as the workers of the Society will surely do their best, there is no doubt but that our goal of $100,000 will be reached. The ladies' board has rendered wonderful service during the year, and without them we are absolutely sure the Home could not exist. They will no doubt receive their reward in due season.</p>
   <p>While we are thankful to God Almighty for the past, we look forward with faith and trust in Him who holds our destinies in the hollow of His hand.</p>

   <p>Secretary's Reports</p>
   <p>This is the first time I have had the pleasure of reporting to you as your secretary. I am happy to say my experience as such has been most pleasant; it is a pleasure to work together with such men as constitute the board of directors of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society. My report will only be short and incomplete.</p>
   <p>The board of directors have met regularly once every month with a good attendance at every meeting. Every member of the board has lost no opportunity at these meetings to show that our Home and its interests are deep-rooted in their hearts. The unusually large sum of money required to keep the Home going during the past year has been met by the hard and efficient work of every member of the Society.</p>
   <p>The executive committee has held its regular monthly meetings at the Home with <span class="page-break">\8</span>good attendance; the work before the committee has always been done in harmony and for the very best interests of the Home. Two directors, being called away from the city, resigned from the board; they were Mr. H. C. Jenson and Captain J. Jacobsen. In their places were elected Mr. O. C. Ostrom, Logan Square Branch, and Mr. Anton Hausan, Concordia Branch. On two occasions the residents of the Home were given pleasant automobile rides by friends of our Home. The first trip was on June 1, when by special invitation they were taken to Reverend S. P. Lang's church to attend morning service and were later served with refreshments, and a collection was taken up for the Home. The second trip was on September 7, when they were taken to Reverend H. C. Hansen's church where, after attending morning service, refreshments and flowers were donated. Needless to say the residents were overcome with joy at the kindness and sympathy accorded them at these churches.</p>
   <p>Nordmaendenes Sangforening (Norsemen's Singing Society) gave a very fine concert at the Home on September 21, which was enjoyed by the resident and a <span class="page-break">\9</span>full house of friends. A collection was taken up at this time. During the past year, eleven residents of the Home passed away; of these, one had lived at the Home for 3 years, one for 5 years, one for 6 years, one for 8 years, two for 10 years, one for 11 years, one for 20 years, and one for 24 years. The average period of residence at the Home is 10 years, and the average age of the deceased was 70 years. During the year seven have been admitted to the Home and three others have been accepted and will arrive soon. It is my duty to report on the different branches, boards, committees, or other activities within our Society; the different officers and the secretary will report of the splendid work accomplished by the Society in the past year.</p>
   <p>As we are about to take up the work that lies ahead of us, for the coming year, may the Lord give us love and strength to do still greater work than in the past, and may that work be enlarged to benefit the many people who need our help in days to come, remembering the Master's saying: "What ye have done for me."</p>

   <p>Ladies' Board Report</p>
   <p>The ladies auxiliary board of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society, in looking forward to the year 1920, has the same aims and aspirations as in the past. In a survey of the year 1919, we believe we have done our best. The work that has come under our supervision has been much the same as in former years, but each year gives us a broader vision and a keener sense of responsibility; only through the co-operation of each board member have we <span class="page-break">\15</span>been able to measure up to these larger demands, but the outcome of our work has been most gratifying and we feel it has been a year full of attainment, and our ample reward is just the joy of doing it. In tabulating the events of the past year, they follow closely the same as in other years, only broader in purpose and results. In February the reception of the new board members was a very delightful affair.</p>
   <p>The men's board, the young ladies' aid, and the women's auxiliary board represent a corps of enthusiastic workers, and this getting together at the first of the year is an inspiration to each one of us. Dr. Lang gave a wonderful address which was enjoyed by the board members and the old people. At this meeting, Dr. Lang extended an invitation to the old people to attend his church on the first Sunday in June. In May we had our annual tag day. While the proceeds were not equal to former tag days, the response of our workers and the interest shown by our chairman was greatly appreciated, and we wish to extend to them our sincere thanks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\16</span>
   <p>In June the Midsummer Festival, which has become an annual event, was given at the Home. The Norwegian Singing Society [Norsemen's] again furnished a delightful musical program. A splendid address was given and refreshments were served.</p>
   <p>In August our annual picnic was given. The event has become our banner get-together day of the year. Again the weather man reserved one of his perfect days for the occassion. In November a pound party was given at the Home, and as in former years, the party was under the supervision of the alumni of the ladies' board. The generous contributions received from friends of the Home prove that we are all thankful for the blessings received and for the opportunity of contributing to the happiness of others.</p>
   <p>In December the bazaar was the crowning event of the year, both in attendance and financial results. The combined efforts of each branch in doing their best resulted in our going over the top. Never before have we had such <span class="page-break">\17</span>beautiful articles on sale, and never before have our friends shown such a spirit of wanting to help by buying so liberally.</p>
   <p>During the Christmas season our matron, Miss Camilla Anderson, gave a chicken dinner and party. This was a delightful affair and we might almost say that the spirit of youth was present when all of us gathered around the Christmas tree. This report would not be complete without tribute to our young ladie's aid. It has been all that its name signifies: a splendid aid and help in all affairs and at all times. To them and to each board member and our friends, I wish to extend my sincere appreciation and thanks for your co-operation in all the work done this past year, and my best wishes in anticipation of the work that is before us.</p>
   <p>Mrs. H. G. Holtan,</p>
   <p>President of the ladies' board.</p>
