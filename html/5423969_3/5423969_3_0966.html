   <p>The Evening Star Lodge, R. H. K. dedicated its service flag last Thursday evening. Mrs. Lina Larsen, the president, presided. The service flag was carried through the hall by a member of the Lodge, flanked on both sides by representatives of the United States Army and Navy, and followed by a flag guard of Red Cross nurses in uniform. "The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung, followed by a roll call of those who were serving under the colors. A little girl pinned the blue stars on the service flag. Each time a name was called a woman stood up, either a mother, a sister, or a close relative of the one who was "over there."</p>
   <p>The Grieg Singing Society sang several numbers. Dr. Ingeborg Rasmussen spoke for the flag, the mothers, and sisters. George Kramer spoke for the Norwegian National League. The celebration closed with the singing of "America".</p>
