   <p>The Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study held its eighth annual meeting at the University of Chicago last Friday. The Society wishes to incorporate the study of Scandinavian in grade and high schools throughout the country, just as has been done here in Chicago. Lectures on this subject were given by Professor Julius Olsen and Professor Flom. Later in the evening Professor Olsen opened a discussion on methods by which the Society could aid in promoting a better understanding between Scandinavians and Americans. Among the speakers of the evening were Judge Oscar Torrison and Professor Mauritzon.</p>
   <p>A review of Ibsen's "Peer Gynt" was given by Professor Hollander. He also discussed Oehlenschlaeger's "Aladdin". A lengthy discussion followed. Professor Alexis opened a discussion on the relation between Americanism and the study of Scandinavian in America. Professor Olsen was assigned to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>write a paper about August Strindberg; Professor Schofield was asked to write on Jonas Lie, [Alexander] Kjelland, [Arne] Garborg, and Bjornson. Senator Nelson will write on the Norwegian merchant marine.</p>
