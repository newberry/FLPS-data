   <p>The Minde (Remembrance) Ladies Society celebrated its eighteenth anniversary last Tuesday at Wicker Park Hall. 150 members and their friends were present. After a brief business session, the president made a speech of welcome and then introduced Mrs. Rund who delivered a speech about women, their conditions in Norway and in America, women's suffrage and their position compared with that of men.</p>
   <p>Miss Rund has just returned from a long visit to Norway. While in Norway she lectured in a number of places. She is a good speaker and reaped thunderous applause. After her speech, Mrs. Theiser, the marshal of the Society presented her with a bouquet of flowers. She also presented bouquets to the president and the vice-president.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Society read her report as follows:</p>

   <p>The Minde Ladies Society was organized in March 5, 1891, eighteen years ago today, by four ladies, Mrs. Anna Jorgensen being the leader; she was also President of the Society for a while. Afterwards one of the other ladies, Mrs. Back,was elected president. Both of these ladies have since died. Mrs. Rasmussen has been the president of Minde for a while.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Lund, our present president, has served the Society faithfully for the past seven years; she was elected president on January 2, 1902. She can rejoice in watching the steady progress of the Society; since she became the leader the increase in membership has been great. She has been laboring faithfully, and we hope to retain her long as our president.</p>
   <p>Besides Mrs. Lund, the Society has also had other women workers of note. Of these, I believe Mrs. Sophie Olsen has been longest in the harness....but Mrs. Gina Iiseng and Mrs. Linda Nilsen are probably the hardest workers besides those mentioned before.</p>

   <p>Mrs. Linda Nilsen is now our oldest member; in May she will have been a member for eighteen years. There are also a few others who have been in the work since the early years of the Society....</p>
   <p>During the eighteen years of its existence, Minde has had nineteen deaths; in 1895 there were four deaths, in connection with each of which the Society paid seventy-five dollars. In 1897 there was one death. In that case, too, the payment was seventy-five dollars. In 1900 there again was one death. This time the payment made was $100, and on March 5, 1909, that is,when the Society was ten years old, it was decided to raise the amount of death payments to $125. At that time Minde had 130 members and $1,175.56 in its treasury. Since that time the amount of the death payments have been raised again and again until now the amount paid on the death of a member is $200.</p>
   <p>At present Minde, eighteen years old, has 232 members, and at the last accounting had $2,665.32 in the treasury, $1,600 of which is placed in mortgages.</p>

   <p>The monthly fee of the Society is, as always, fifteen cents per month, with the exception that every fourth month the fee is twenty cents. There are now no extra assessments. The regular assessment on the death of a member is, as from the beginning, fifty cents.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Linda Nilsen, the oldest member of the Society, was decorated with the "star" of the Society, a golden pin. After this, to the tunes of a march, the members and their friends proceeded to the dining hall where the tables were loaded with delectable dishes which were duly attacked and enjoyed. There was general agreement that the social had been most successful.</p>
