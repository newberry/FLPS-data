   <p>The festival held in Lincoln Park on the occasion of the presentation of the Viking ship to the State of Illinois was a great success. Thousands of people of every nationality were present. The president of the Viking committee, Mrs. Johanna Thye, presided.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Bertha E. Petersen told those present the history of the Viking ship, linking it up with Leif's voyage across the Atlantic. Mrs. Ingrid Holmboe, dressed in the Norwegian national costume, handed a letter to the president of the Park Board. The envelope was a miniature American flag. The president of the Norwegian National League, Attorney Alfred O. Erikson, told how Leif and his crew steered over the turbulent waters of the North Atlantic, without compass, guided only by sun, moon, and stars. He named Norway's great international figures, Sverdrup, Nansen, and Amundsen, the explorers, and many Norwegian scientists and writers.</p>
