   <p>The Norwegian Singers' League (Chicago division), held a private carnival at Bjorgvin Hall, on Saturday, March 30.</p>
   <p>The word carnival is of Italian origin, and means "farewell meats;" it is used in connection with the final pre-lenten festival, after which, thru the lenten season, meat is not eaten. The general public takes part in the carnival, all in costumes and masks.</p>
   <p>In Norwegian, a "Karneval" means a masked ball, and describes last Saturday's affair literally, as no one was admitted who was not masked. The newly organized "Norske Klub," (Norwegian Club) including their male chorus - attended in a body. Not one member was missing.</p>
   <p>Aside from the dancing, a program of music and song was enjoyed by all. A special number, which drew hearty applause, was the prologue, composed especially for the occasion by Finn Rein Simonsen, the Colony Lyric.</p>
