   <p>On behalf of the Leif Ericson Monument Society, Mr. O. A. Thorp has sent a communication to the West Park Board requesting that a conference be arranged between representatives of the Society and the commissioners. The West Park Board has resolved to invite the members of the Monument Society to the next meeting of the Board in order that negotiations may be undertaken for a suitable location for the monument when the latter is finished.
