   <p>The following song has been written by O. K. Rice and set to music; it is now one of the most frequently sung of local songs.</p>
   <p>NORWAY</p>
   <p>Tell me, tell me, if you can,</p>
   <p>Why my heart is ever longing</p>
   <p>For the rough and rocky land</p>
   <p>And the cold and stormy strand,</p>
   <p>For the coast of Norway.</p>
   <p>Give me wings, that I may fly</p>
   <p>Over mountain, vale, and ocean,</p>
   <p>Till I see where Norway lies,</p>
   <p>Round its coast the sea in motion,</p>
   <p>All around the coast of Norway.</p>
   
   <p>Here I sit of Norway dreaming,</p>
   <p>Visions through my memory streaming</p>
   <p>Of my youthful happy days.</p>
   <p>Comrades all around me play</p>
   <p>In my thoughts of Norway.</p>
   <p>Half a century is past</p>
   <p>Since I saw the tow'ring rocks,</p>
   <p>And the time is flying fast,</p>
   <p>Like the rapid mountain brooks</p>
   <p>Flowing in the land of Norway.</p>
   <p>When at last my days are ended,</p>
   <p>And my soul, of matter free,</p>
   <p>To the welkin has ascended,</p>
   <p>Will its longing then be ended</p>
   <p>For the rocky coast of Norway?</p>
