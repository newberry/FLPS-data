   <p>Sons and Daughters of Norway announce their annual spring festival to be held on May 4th, at the Danish Brotherhood Hall, Fairfield Avenue and Hirsch Street. Except for the Good Templars, this is the only group that holds festivals without the sale of liquors, as it is forbidden by the laws of the Order. This organization does not need "booze" as a bait; all its gatherings draw capacity crowds. Tickets on sale by numbers, so buy early.
