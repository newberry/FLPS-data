   <p>Gymnasts and other athletes ought to study the athletic ability of the ancient Norwegians. The best athletes were usually the men who had reached the highest attainments of culture in their day. The men of sports were the men whose names went down in the history of Norway.</p>
   <p>To have control of one's movements so that one's body is always supple and elastic, while care is taken, of course, that one's everyday requirements of an intellectual or financial nature are not overlooked, [has always been considered the summum bonum]. The individual who has learned to control his body, can be depended upon to gain control of his mind.</p>
   <p>The history of Norway shows that many prominent men, during the days of Norwegian ascendancy, were among the leaders in the realm of sports or <span class="page-break">\2</span>athletics.</p>
   <p>When modern man first began to study Norwegian history, he tended to neglect the advantages won through athletics, and for this reason the Norwegians did not sufficiently prize the attainments of the ancients. Now, however, all of this is beginning to change. The old sagas are being published and read by the thousands, and little by little the Norwegians will come to understand the value of a people's having able and vigorous athletes.</p>
