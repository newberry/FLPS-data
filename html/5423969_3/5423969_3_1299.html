   <p>The board of directors of the Tabitha Hospital Society held its regular monthly meeting at the Hospital. The reports for October show that seventy-three patients were treated during that month; of these, forty-eight paid in full, twenty-three paid in part, and two were given free treatment. At the close of the month there were thirty-four patients in the hospital. The total number of hospitalization days was nine hundred and three, an increase over previous months.</p>
   <p>The treasurer's report reveals the following:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Total income for the month</td>
     <td>$1,451.45</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Total expenses for the month</td>
     <td>1,186.94</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Balance, October 31, 1901</td>
     <td>$ 264.51</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>.....The personnel of the Hospital includes the following: superintendent, assistant superintendent, housekeeper, cook, three housemaids and waitresses, two laundry girls, one engineer, one janitor, eleven nurses, and two house doctors. There <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>are thus twenty-four employees.</p>
   <p>Mr. Arnet reported that he had received donations totaling $130, which will be paid to the treasurer. Mrs. [William] Johnson reported donations of $20, and Dr. Torrison also had received donations for the Hospital. Reverend Bleken's motion that no bazaar be held this year was adopted. It was then resolved to take up a collection to cover the loss incurred by not holding a bazaar. Those wishing to contribute are asked to present their gifts to Mr. Arnet or other members of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>Reverend Bleken moved that the secretary be ordered to leave the Hospital membership lists in the waiting room of the Hospital for public inspection.....The secretary said that all membership lists except one had been received from the branches; that the lists are open for inspection by the members of the board of directors, but that under the constitution he had no right to leave these lists in the Hospital waiting room where anybody might take them away.... The constitution requires that "the secretary shall keep the membership lists of the Hospital Society, its seal, and all documents and reports which do not belong <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>under the treasurer". Reverend Bleken's attention was called to the fact that his motion was unconstitutional and, in the form presented, was insulting. A second and modified motion by Reverend Bleken was not voted upon either; the secretary declared that he was aware of his responsibilities under the constitution and could not surrender the membership lists. He asked the board members who were present not to attempt to force him to accommodate Reverend Bleken. The board members upheld the secretary.</p>
