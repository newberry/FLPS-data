   <p>The Times publishes an alleged version of an editorial in the Skandinaven on "The Work of the Washburn Ring" and says: "The Times reproduces the article so as to exhibit the workings of Governor Clough's new literary bureau. This article was published in the Norwegian language, although Mr. [Nicolay A.] Grevstad is known to be a finished writer of English and the Skandinaven publishes a few able editorials in English. No one knows better than Mr. Grevstad that there are very few of his countrymen who do not read English, and the supposition naturally follows that the article was printed in a foreign tongue to conceal it from American readers, while impressing its grossly untrue and slanderous statements upon the Norwegian citizens."</p>
   <p>The insinuation contained in this paragraph is ridiculous and undignified, <span class="page-break">\2</span>to say the least. The Skandinaven is published for the benefit of Norwegian and Danish readers, and its business is primarily to speak to them in their native tongue, not [to] express opinions in English. The English language is sometimes used, but to a very limited extent, in editorials of a political nature, partly in response to a demand that exists, or ought to exist, among its [Skandinaven's] readers, and partly for the purpose of correcting current misrepresentations concerning Scandinavian men or affairs. But if Norwegian is the language of its editorial page, its columns are open to public inspection, as are those of the Times. It is illogical and absurd to assert that the purpose of the paper in publishing editorial opinions in Norwegian is to conceal what it says from American readers.</p>
   <p>It is alleged by our contemporary that the article reproduced by it contains "grossly untrue and slanderous statements". The Skandinaven does not desire to make any statements of that description and is willing to <span class="page-break">\3</span>stand corrected if it be shown to its satisfaction that it has said anything which is not true. Now if the Times will furnish a bill of particulars, fortified with convincing proofs, the people will be in a position to ascertain for themselves whether it is the Skandinaven or the Times that is guilty of "grossly untrue and slanderous statements".</p>
   <p>While the Skandinaven, in common with all other newspapers, appreciates reproduction of its articles by contemporaries it desires to enter a most emphatic protest against such versions as the alleged translation appearing in the columns of the Times. A wooden Indian, fresh from the shop, could have made a better job of it.</p>
   <p>A brief visit recently made to the Twin Cities by the editor of this paper has received an altogether disproportionate attention at the hands of the Times. Unfortunately, our contemporary has neglected to state "where it is at" [i.e., where it stands]. Here is what it says (in the March 6, 1896 issue):</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Nicolay Grevstad was at the capital yesterday, seeking an interview with the Governor's private secretary. Mr. Grevstad is the editor of the Skandinaven, published in Chicago, and learned that the fact has been brought out that the Republican State Central Committee two years ago dispensed money to certain Scandinavian papers in Chicago. His errand to Mr. Bixby was to use his best endeavors to have given to the world the names of the Scandinavian newspapers which were so fortunate (or unfortunate) as to secure a position on the Republican party payroll of 1894. The Skandinaven is the pioneer Norwegian paper of the Northwest, having been published for the past thirty years (since 1866). No one who is acquainted with Mr. Grevstad or with the history of that newspaper would believe that either he or it could be listed in the category of purchasable commodities. But it would be curious to see just what Scandinavian newspapers are covered by Mr. Bixby's policy of insurance; and then it would further be exceedingly instructive <span class="page-break">\5</span>to learn whether the newspapers listed were actually the recipients of the 'bounty' charged against them."</p>
   <p>A second article, March 8, reads as follows: "Mr. Grevstad visited Minneapolis and St. Paul during the week just closed. On Thursday, he held a long private interview with James Bixby, Governor Clough's private secretary. He informed a Times reporter that he made the visit to induce Mr. Bixby to publish to the world the names of the Scandinavian newspapers in Chicago and Minneapolis which secured a share of the Republican corruption fund from the State Central Committee in 1894.</p>
   <p>"Really, it would seem that Mr. Grevstad and the Chicago Skandinaven should be extremely chary of requesting the publication of the names of newspapers receiving pay for literary service in 1894. The precedent might be followed next year, and Mr. Grevstad would probably enjoy the printing of a detailed statement of the contract under which the Skandinaven is now serving Mr. Bixby and Governor Clough in the existing campaign.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"Mr. Grevstad is in no danger of exposure, however, as it is one of the cardinal virtues of Mr. Bixby that he never gives up to the public the names of his hired men, or the sums he pays for their services."</p>
   <p>While leaving it to our contemporary to explain which is which, the Skandinaven will state that the reporter of the Times received no such information as alleged. The visit alluded to was of a purely private nature, and the reporter was so informed. As he turned out to be an old friend of the visitor, a few informal private remarks were exchanged. The much-mooted article in the Times of January 9 was also mentioned. The Times man confessed very grave doubts as to the reliability of the author of that article, while the visitor expressed a desire to learn the facts in the premises.</p>
   <p>"The long private interview with James Bixby" probably took place in the <span class="page-break">\7</span>reporter's imagination; for it certainly occurred nowhere else. The assertion that the Skandinaven is serving Mr. Bixby and Governor Clough under a contract to aid their campaign is a "grossly untrue and slanderous statement", or, to use still plainer English, it is a lie, and the Times knows it. The Skandinaven submits that promiscuous lying is a rather unprofitable and undignified business for a newspaper with a reputation to protect and [new] fields to conquer. There was no apparent necessity for printing the falsehood, and our contemporary will admit that of all forms of newspaper prevarication, lying to fill space is the least respectable.</p>
   <p>As the position of this paper on the question of the gubernatorial nomination seems to be a matter of some concern to our contemporary, it may be stated for its benefit that the Skandinaven has not expressed any opinion as to whether the Governor ought, or ought not, to receive the nomination. It has called attention to a prevailing custom in such instances and to the fact <span class="page-break">\8</span>that his administration has invited no serious criticism; it has registered a protest against the unfair treatment which has been meted out to him in such abundant measure by a certain clique. The Skandinaven believes in a free and fair field for all candidates, the present Governor not excepted. It does not regard him as an ideal candidate by any means, but he is probably as good as any of the others, which, by the way, is saying a great deal, considering that every other Republican seems to be running for governor this year. There are better men than Governor Clough, but it does not appear that any of them have entered the lists against him or are taking an active part in the anti-Clough campaign. An "ideal candidate" may give the people a poor administration if elected, while a less satisfactory candidate may fill the executive chair to general satisfaction. The "ideal" is rarely attained in politics anyway--so seldom, in fact, that practical politics may be defined as the science of the next best. If the clique opposed to Clough could work off some of their self-conceit, drop their ridiculous arrogance and sham pretensions to superior public virtues, and put themselves on a level with <span class="page-break">\9</span>the man they combat, nobody would have any fault to find with the gentlemen and their coterie. This would not prevent them from indulging in private holiness meetings, where they would be at liberty to worship themselves and one another to their hearts' content. But they would better not let the cruel world know how much they think of themselves lest they may learn what the plain everyday people think of them. The Skandinaven will write in any language it pleases, even if it causes criticism from our contemporaries.</p>
