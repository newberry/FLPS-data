   <p>The Jonas Lie Lodge No. 99, Sons of Norway, celebrated the centennial of Norwegian independence with music and song. The Lodge has a very good chorus, Liegutterne (The Lie Boys), a chorus that certainly was excellent at the celebration. Brother Evanson is their director. They opened the program with "Gud Signe Norigs Land" (God Bless Norway's Land). The violinist, J. M. Dybdahl, and the pianist, Miss Gunda Isaachsen, played several old melodies. The actor, Mr. Koht, read several scenes from "Peer Gynt," and the program ended with the Norwegian national anthem, "Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet," sung by the audience.</p>
