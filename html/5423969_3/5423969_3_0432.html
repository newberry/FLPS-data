   <p>After Dr. Warloe left for Europe, Dr. Unseth functioned as secretary. Dr. Unseth read the minutes from the last meeting and also gave a brief survey of the activities of the Association during the past year.

   <p>The many valuable lectures during the year have contributed more than anything else to the greater interest displayed.</p>
