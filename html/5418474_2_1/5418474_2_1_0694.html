   <p>In conformance to the request of the Wirthsverein (Tavern Keepers Association), we publish herewith the complete annual report of their president, which may be of special interest to our readers because of the impending city election.</p>
   <p>"To the officials and members of the Wirthsverein of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen: It is customary for officials of associations to submit a report of their own as well as of their members' activity at the end of the elective term. Therefore, I herewith present the second semi-annual report given since our Association was founded.....</p>
   <p>"Although our Wirthsverein has not achieved as much as some of the members wished, never the less, it cannot be denied that our Association has proved a constant obstacle to the Prohibitionists. This, in itself, is proof enough of how we would have fared if the temperance forces had been given free reign.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Our resources were and are very limited, while those of our adversaries, comparatively speaking, have been inexhaustible. What our antagonists cannot attain by one method they accomplish by another. And thus we may be grateful to the Association that our fight has left its Mark on the opposition.</p>
   <p>"Thus far nothing has been accomplished by the lawmakers in Springfield to further our principles, in accord with the wishes of the German element in Chicago and of similar elements of other nationalities. On the contrary, our representatives seem quite willing to listen to our enemies. So I make the urgent recommendation that representatives of the German, as well as other elements in the State of Illinois, be asked to show greater consideration for us. The various tavern keepers, particularly those in the country, undoubtedly will appeal to us, in case some unpleasantness develops, in order that a calamity may be averted through our intervention. However, it will then be too late. Therefore I appeal to you personally, likewise to out-of-town colleagues in sympathy with us, to heed the old proverb: "Prudence is the mother of wisdom."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"It is a disagreeable task for me constantly to repeat the remark, that we might have progressed more rapidly if the brewers and distillers had supported us from the beginning. These gentlemen became aware of our criticism eventually, and, conscious of their negligence, condescended finally, from necessity, to confer with us.</p>
   <p>"Much more could have been accomplished if the brewers and distillers had given us strong co-operation at the very inception of our organization. It is undeniable, since their interests and ours are so strongly interwoven, that we can justifiably reproach them for not co-operating with us sooner. It is an unalterable fact that these gentlemen 'skimmed the cream,' leaving us only the milk, which often enough was sour.</p>
   <p>"I also desire to express here in the Association's thanks to Harry Rubens, our attorney. Although our Association was not as successful as some of us wished, I, nevertheless, feel fully confident that Mr. Rubens did everything within his power to aid us. He was honorable, conscientious, and faithful to our cause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"The ramifications of our adversaries are of a very extensive nature. I refer to my communication of February 7, wherein I informed you that I considered it absolutely necessary to provide additional assistance for our attorney, Mr. Rubens, and I now recommend that another capable lawyer be obtained to collaborate with him. Mr. Rubens, I suggest, shoud continue to represent us in Chicago, while the counselor to be selected should take care of our interests in Springfield.</p>
   <p>"This is imperative, because the fury and hatred of the fanatics ["drys"] are boundless; and, with respect to their assertion that they are concerned only with disreputable saloons, I would like to state emphatically that this fanatical brood, has constantly harassed respectable tavern keepers. These hypocrites intend to ruin the reputable beer vendors, leaving the obnoxious ones to the police force. I would like to declare publicly that, to the credit of respectable saloon keepers, the snooping of fanatical, secretly imbibing temperance advocates invariably commenced in the taverns of iniquity which they now leave to the police.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"I am pleased to report the financial condition of our Association. We feel indebted in general to the various officials for their activity and conscientious performance of duty.</p>
   <p>"I regret (and I have mentioned it often enough) that attendance at our meetings is poor; I always see only the same faces, but they are dear to me, and I respect them. It would be very helpful if our meetings were better attended. As they are held successively in different parts of the city I consider it a weak excuse whenever I hear the remark that our hall is inconveniently located. We have members in every quarter of Chicago, and there could be present many more people than actually do attend regularly and punctually. I therefore hope that this gentle admonition will be heeded. It is impossible for those who attend regularly to carry the load unaided, which is a sizeable one indeed. I hope our second year's attendance will be greatly improved.</p>
   <p>"I feel particularly gratified that our first year ends this month. The several gentlemen present will interpret my meaning in various ways; it may be <span class="page-break">\6</span>permissible, therefore, to explain that it is a source of satisfaction to me to call your attention to an event which is of interest to our Association as well as to all liberally inclined citizens. We are facing again a municipal election. We do not subscribe to a political platform, in as far as our Association is concerned. But we are confronted with either a fortunate or disastrous future, depending on the results of the impending spring election; and so it may be permissible to give a few hints, my personal recommendations.</p>
   <p>"As you know from last year's experience, it is impossible to trust every candidate. We have had too many examples, unfortunately, of politicans who promised us Heaven on earth before election, and gave us Hell afterward.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, as a matter of self-preservation, I offer the following recommendations: that a committee be appointed to investigate the various candidates; that the Association shall espouse its own ticket, after having secured the information with respect to prospective office holders; that members of our organization distribute these tickets [sample ballots] in the precincts of every ward on election day; that the members show more active participation; that every <span class="page-break">\7</span>member promise to keep his place of business closed on the day of the election, and lose a day's income rather than face the peril of empowering our enemies to curtail everything, even our personal liberty, in the future.</p>
   <p>"I am fully convinced that in following this recommendation we shall reach our goal: an administration which harbors no hostility toward our interests. And such a victory will create a panic among the temperance forces; and, incidentally, Chicago will attain the glory of being the first city to call a halt on the fanatics. It would be the greatest victory for the Association to have helped in electing free men, of a free people, in a free land; officials who never contest the privilege of others to seek happiness in their own fashion; leaders who do not wear a strait jacket for the purpose of reaching the heavenly portals, and who disregard the exhortations of a deluded fanatical temperance society....(sic)</p>
   <p>"At our meetings we have often considered the advisability of excluding reporters from our deliberations, and this consideration has been based on the example given <span class="page-break">\8</span>by the temperance forces, who have secret sessions and who submit only such information for publicity as they deem advisable. Although it is not within my province to go into a detailed discussion concerning this matter, I believe, nevertheless, that my opinion coincides with that of the majority of our members: Men who consider only the welfare of their fellow citizens and have not transgressed against the community; who pursue an honest business recognized by the city and state--yet have to endure persecution from a demented horde--need not shun the press. In that connection, I regard it my duty to declare that the German papers, particularly, have supported us in every respect, and I hereby express my gratitude publicly in appreciation of their faithful defense of our principles.</p>
   <p>"We do nothing clandestinely, and the world may view our activities. Our concern is the mere defense of rights, and, let it be said to the everlasting discredit of the Prohibitionists, their meetings are mole-like affairs; furtive, and, possibly, subterranean conclaves, resorted to for the obvious purpose of preventing any information from filtering through to the light of day; including even the surreptitious guzzling of whisky.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>"It is, therefore, very desirable that we do everything openly, because every righteous man abhors secrecy. So I hope our meetings will be of a public character in the future.</p>
   <p>"Finally, I ardently wish that the Association officials to be elected, as well as the latter's committees, will be enabled to fashion a magnificent structure upon our present foundation; and I hope that, at the coming election, only the interest of the Association will be considered, irrespective of personalities.</p>
   <p>"I also desire to express my thanks to the members who twice conferred upon me the chairmanship, an honor indeed; and while this office has by no means been a bed of roses, but rather one of many thorns and thistles. I admit candidly that I have tackled the problem gladly, since I have been interested only in the success of our Association; and I am proud to have witnessed our development to a point where we have become a successful support of a free people and a bane to the "drys".</p>
   <p>"Let me add, however, that other officials have shared largely in this attainment, <span class="page-break">\10</span>and their help as well as congeniality enabled me to perform my difficult duties to the satisfaction of our members. I tender my sincere thanks for this staunch assistance.</p>
   <p>"While it is not proper to mention any particular person in an official report, I cannot refrain from expressing my personal gratitude, and, I may say, the official regard of the Association, for Michael Wassermann's consistent and devoted efforts while acting as our financial secretary; and I regret exceedingly that he resigned of his own accord, after having fulfilled his task in such a faithful manner.</p>
   <p>"Hoping for the continued prosperity of the Association, and that our just demands will be upheld by liberal-minded citizens, I remain</p>
   <p>"Respectfully,</p>
   <p>"John Feldcamp, President."</p>
