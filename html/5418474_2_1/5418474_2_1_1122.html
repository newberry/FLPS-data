   <p>Do the Police Commissioners want to create at any cost the impression that only German Scrapegoats are to be made responsible for the worthlessness of the Fire Department? Nobody can read the testimony of witnesses before the Commission without arriving at the conviction that Williams is at least as much responsible for the debauched condition of the Fire Department as Schank.</p>
   <p>However, Schank is forced to resign, while Williams remains unharmed. Messrs. Jacob Rehm and Mancel Talcott are responsible for the result of the investigation. If they want to cover the main culprits by spanking some German whipping boys, than they may be assured that the German voters will look through their maneuvers.</p>
