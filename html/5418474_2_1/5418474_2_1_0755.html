   <p>In yesterday's Evening Journal the legislator, Wilhelm Massenberg, of Freeport, presents himself as candidate for the office of Secretary of State, recommending himself as a friend of the Temperance Law and scolding severely the Germans for their opposition to it. According to the Journal, Mr. Massenberg made on January 16, in Springfield, the statement that in view of the fire limit agitation in Chicago, he was almost ashamed to be a German. The State Convention, if it does not consist of utter blockheads, will put on the ticket a German who is not "almost ashamed" of being one. A German advocate of the Temperance Law on the state ticket - surely that would be adding insult to injury!</p>
