   <p>Several weeks ago it was said that the State Public Utilities Commission intended to reject the proposal of the streetcar company to raise the fare from five to seven cents, and that this action was to be made known during the past week. The past week was the last one preceding election, and the political "wire pullers" undoubtedly surmised that such glad tidings would have some influence upon the result of the election. Upon hearing the above-mentioned "news," which emanated from the office of the State Commission, some people who are familiar with the way in which election campaigns are conducted expressed some doubt concerning the veracity of the "news". As matters turned out, they had reason to be skeptical, for the designated week has passed and nothing has been heard from the Commission. Do its members need so much time to decide for or against the increase in fare, or are they hesitating to inform the public about their decision because of political expediency? The latter assumption is probably correct. Perhaps the politicians believe that the excitement occasioned <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by the conduct of the streetcar company and other public utility companies will rapidly subside after election, so that one may again cuff and thump the public without fear of committing political suicide.</p>
   <p>The rumors about the rejection of the streetcar company's application for an increase in fare, which were permitted to dangle before the eyes of the voters during the campaign, were nothing but a piece of the political bait with which candidates and their henchmen and bushwhackers endeavor to trap unsuspecting voters. For every single one of the candidates for the mayoralty promised under sacred oath that the "grab" of the public utility companies would cease during his adminstration, and that he would see to it that the citizens would not only get their rights, but that they would also be treated courteously by the corporations and by the employees of the corporations. Heretofore these promises have been like a bundle of hay attached to a stick and tied to the end of the wagon pole to urge the balky mule on. The mule has never succeeded in reaching the bundle of hay; for when it had travelled the required distance the alluring delicacy was <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>removed and the mule could whistle for it. Are the voters in a similar situation? Will they be told, sooner or later, and with much consideration, that henceforth they will have to pay six, or perhaps seven, cents for enduring the impolite behavior of the streetcar company's employees, waiting eternally for a car at unprotected street corners, and finally riding in sardine cans?</p>
   <p>It is true that the municipal officers and authorities have very little voice in this matter which concerns only Chicago, and that the decision lies with the State Commission. But, as a rule, where there is a will there is a way. Unfortunately, the public entertains the unauthoritative opinion that the City Administration has been too lenient with the streetcar company and has not exercised sufficient influence in the State legislature to abolish the Commission. The great majority of Chicago's citizens agree that the Commission has given little or no consideration to their vital interests, and that no one in the city will shed a tear at its grave. At all events it should be deprived of its authority over purely local matters. There is no <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>reason why a non-Chicagoan should decide what a Chicagoan should pay for gas or for a ride on a streetcar. In the meantime the city anxiously awaits the long-awaited ukase of the Commission.</p>
