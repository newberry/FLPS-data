   <p>At the massmeeting of German carpenters and joiners held March 1 in Wendells Hall 1504 Milwaukee Avenue it had been stated that the Germans had won their fight for a union of the brotherhood of the North and Northwest side and have obtained a charter from the highest source and the use of the German language notwithstanding all the opposition of their enemies. They still try to bring our Union in discredit by undermining our reputation and misrepresenting our financial position. Section 7 of the constitution and By-Laws of the Brotherhood states, that Union members who transfer from one local to another are still entitled for three months to all sick benefits given the old local. New members are entitled to the sickness fund in six months. The financial position after three months of our local, has become so excellent through dues and contributions, that we can compare favorably with the finances of any Union. Our membership is more than several hundreds.</p>
   <p>The principles of this German local Union are an honest German administration, rigid economy, low salaries to the officers, no approvals of issues contrary to the laws of the Brotherhood, but great liberality to all members. German carpenters and joiners! Unity makes us strong. Everybody Unionist or Non-Unionist has now the opportunity to develop his ideas about his trade in his own mother tongue. It is left to us to procure an esteemed position in our trade and not to remain the neglected Dutchmen as before, but be treated with respect by our brothers of other nationalities. All Germans, who have their interests at heart, the welfare of their families, love for freedom and equality of all people, are invited to visit our regular meetings each Sunday afternoon at 4 P.M. in Wendels Hall 1504 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>By order of the German Union,</p>
   <p>Ferd. Schnaeckel</p>
   <p>Chairman.</p>
