   <p>Secretary Hugo Miller submitted to the German-American Typographia his report for the year 1896-97. The Union of German Typesetters had, according to its record at the end of June this year a membership of 1083, 32 less than last year. This decline is explained by the discontinuation of several newspapers and by the progressive installation of typesetting machines. Twenty members were lost on account of death. The net income of the Typographia amounted to $26,514.72; the expenses to $25,262.74.</p>
   <p>The reserve fund amounted to $9,748.06 at the end of the year. The Union paid during the year $18,401.36 for aid purposes: $8,485.00 to members out of work and $4,681.25 for sick benefits; death benefits and compensations amounted to $4,572.65, aid to strikers was $364.96 and as travel aids $279.50. The number of unemployed members was 104 on the average during the year.</p>
