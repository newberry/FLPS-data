   <p>The competition of automobiles, motorbusses, and airplanes seems to be making a slow but genuine impression on the railroads. The railroads considered the competition of the new means of communication a dreadful injustice to which they were subjected. During the course of the years they became so used to the idea that they had a monopoly in transportation facilities that, when competition did arise, they automatically cried "Police!" and demanded laws to prevent this allegedly unfair competition. But nothing of the kind happened; the public overruled their protests and passed on to the order of the day, and made increasing use of the new means of transportation. Then, at last, even among the railroads, a few leaders emerged who departed from the old comfortable rut and urged the adoption of reforms. The conservative railroaders held back at first and thus slowed down the change, but gradually they must capitulate, one after the other, partly because they have become convinced of the necessity for renovating <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the old transportation system; partly because the stockholders, who were hit by the reduction of dividends, made it hot for them.</p>
   <p>The first attempts to accept the challenge of the troublesome competition lead to a reduction of passenger fares. The conservative element insisted that the reduction should be called merely a temporary one. But they can hardly delude themselves into thinking that the high fares which the railroads have charged travellers for the last twenty years will soon return. By the reduction in fares the public will be encouraged to travel extensively. Overcharges inevitably drive the masses into competition. The reduction of fares alone, however, will not be sufficient to draw the traveling public; for this other things are also needed. The American railroads are, as far as comfort is concerned, behind those in foreign countries. A large number of their passenger cars are antiquated and unsuitable. The public of today demands greater comfort and greater speed. Both must come if the railroads want to secure first place in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>passenger traffic for the greater distances.</p>
   <p>A considerable number of European express trains travel faster than the average American express train. Our railroads have only a few celebrated trains which a European would consider real express trains. The others, though called express, are in reality far from it. Express trains, which during their run show a scheduled stop of an hour or more, cannot be considered real express trains, even if they pass a station now and then without stopping. Within the last few months the movement to reform the railroads seems to have increased its tempo somewhat. They talk about faster schedules, and they have put into service a few trains which actually show modern accommodations. But as long as it is a matter of only a few trains, the mass of the traveling public does not have service. Only a thorough reform of timetables as well as of rolling stock and the very necessary improvement of the roadbeds, will assure the railroads a steady increase in passenger traffic.</p>
