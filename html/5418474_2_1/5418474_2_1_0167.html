   <p>Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the wife of the next president, in a recent radio broadcast let the prohibitionists know a few things which must have been quite painful to them, because a number of temperance ladies launched vigorous protests, in the name of their organizations, against the assertions of Mrs. Roosevelt. But it is not quite clear from their protests to what they are objecting.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Roosevelt stated: "In my youth we all had wine on the table at home, and many of us were present when the bottle went around. But only a few girls, whether they were in high school or in a private school, drank more than an occasional glass of wine at home, and it would have never occurred to a young man to bring his own bottle of whiskey when he was going out....(sic)</p>
   
   <p>and when, for some reason or other, a girl would not take part in the drinking, she was never looked upon as unsociable or exclusive....(sic) Among other things, we expected of prohibition protection for the weak, but, I am sorry to say, in my opinion the social conditions brought to life by prohibition require greater strength of character than was the case when I was young."</p>
   <p>These are the particular parts of the speech which caused most offense. But even prohibitionists cannot deny that Mrs. Roosevelt told the actual truth. Do the noble ladies fly into a rage because the next first lady of the land had the courage to tell an unwelcome truth, or are they trying to deceive themselves into believing that Mrs. Roosevelt was just making up a yarn or had greatly exaggerated? If the former is the case, then the ladies remained true merely to themselves, for the spirit of modern Puritanism is given to keeping up a good appearance, no matter what a stinking mess may exist behind the curtain. In the event that the defenders of prohibition should have no inkling of the corrupted morals among just that portion of our youth which is still in the second decade of life, it might be suggested that they seek to gain the confidence of growing adolescents, especially those in large cities, and the prohibitionists would, from what they would hear or perhaps even see, learn to blush, however old they may be.</p>
   <p>Everyone in the know realizes that in her speech, Mrs. Roosevelt merely hinted what should have long ago filled American parents with the most serious worry concerning the future of the American people, had they not been so idiotic as to permit their children to get out of hand until they [the parents] no longer dared to forbid them anything. The evil took its start with the whiskey bottle; since then it has developed into a situation which is not mentioned at all in decent society of the old order. And the sole responsibility for dragging the whiskey bottle into the social life of adolescents rests with prohibition; before it there was no justification for smuggling such bottles. Not until drinking was forbidden did the owner of a bottle become a hero among his immature fellows. And from the excessive use of its contents, other unholy events followed. How deeply this cancer is rooted among American youth may readily be seen from isolated instances which here and there are taken before the judge or come to the notice of the public in some other way. One is less surprised at the dirty details of the case than at the cavalier way with which the peculiar circumstances attending the case are dealt with by those concerned. The attitudes toward life as revealed there compel everyone who gives them a thought to arrive at unavoidable conclusions: That all that has come to pass is, as was so well emphasized by Mrs. Roosevelt, largely to be blamed on prohibition. The protests made by the temperance ladies cannot alter that.</p>
