   <p>Friday, September 2nd a great Popular mass demonstration will take place in the Vorwearts Gymnastic Hall to protest against closing the World's fair on Sundays . Excellent German and English speakers will be present. The people are not satisfied with the capricious and damnable resolution to close the great fair on Sundays. The justified principle for open entertaiments on Sunday finds more favor every dry and it is a pleasure to hear how the Democrats of Cook County have expressed themselves against the closing World's fair on Sunday, It will be a hard fight but not without prospects. Everybody will have to do his duty. It is a fight for liberty and freedom against the chaims of a gang, which only want to reign and enslave us and which under the cover of the liberty of the country carries out their sinister and selfish plans.</p>
   <p>Forward citizens! Come all of you without exception, Saturday evening, September 2nd to the Vorwearts Gymnastic Hall.</p>
