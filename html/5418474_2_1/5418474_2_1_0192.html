   <p>F. C. Billard, commander of the Coast Guard, declares in his annual report: "There is no alternative; the rumrunner must be eradicated. It can be done, and the Coast Guard can accomplish it if sufficient funds are available."</p>
   <p>These and similar assertions are standard phrases, and have been for years. The head of the Coast Guard service uses them regularly in his statements. Similar statements are also issued by the Prohibition Department.</p>
   <p>Everywhere one perceives the same, constantly recurring, monotonous phrases. It was claimed that the rumrunners had disappeared, had been driven away or had been sent to Davy Jones's locker; were gone without a trace. Then one hears a variant to this tune: "The rumrunners will disappear, will be driven away and will be sent to Davy Jones's locker without leaving a <span class="page-break">2</span>trace"--if the necessary funds are forthcoming. When National Prohibition was established, rumrunners were sighted near New York, New Jersey, and other points on the Atlantic Coast. Of course the Southern part of Florida, opposite the Bahama Islands, developed a lively illicit rum trade. The main interest however, centered on the Central Atlantic coastal regions.</p>
   <p>And in this connection it should be said that Charles E. Hughes, Secretary of State under President Harding, believed in international agreements--he saw in then a successful method to combat the rumrunning evil. And so a treaty was entered into by several nations. It culminated in a triumphant pronunciamento that the profession of rumrunning is obsolete and has been definitely eliminated by diplomacy.</p>
   <p>Soon, however, it became apparest that peaceful negotiations had no effect upon the virile fellows.</p>
   <p>An ever-increasing number of ships and employees were now delegated and <span class="page-break">3</span>dedicated to the Prohibition force; larger, faster vessels were pressed into service until today the Coast Guard represents the "sixth largest fleet in the world".</p>
   <p>It was futile. In spite of the smug assurances of the Dry Administration, which shouts of victory, rumrunning is increasing and is now a thriving, highly prosperous institution on both shores.</p>
