   <p>The Chicago Tribune gives an interesting brief history of our Sunday laws and other strange statutes in Illinois. We quote as follows: [Translator's note: As the text is available in English only parts of it are given here] During the years 1800 to 1809 a part of Illinois belonged to the territory of Indiana....In 1807 Indiana's lawmakers passed a rigid law against blasphemy....fifty cents to a dollar fine....or two days hard labor, if nothing of value can be found to confiscate.... Among other items no E. O. Tables were permitted in any home; possession involved a fifty dollar fine and confiscation. What an " E. O. table" is or was, the Tribune does not know....</p>
   <p>To the Tribune's account let us add that, due to the outstanding victory during the 1873 election, Chicago's Germans once and for all called a halt to this tryranny and an ordinance was passed which protects Chicago from any Sunday restrictions.</p>
