   <p>The citizens League started suit against the saloons in the limits of Hyde Park which are licensed by the county commission.</p>
   <p>The Hyde Park villiage board resolved to close all inns and saloons on Sundays after August 1st.</p>
   <p>This resolution is an infamous dishonesty against the saloonkeepers who shortly before had to pay an excessive extra tax to that village treasury for dispensary licenses.</p>
   <p>Everybody knows that these inns in outlying communities do their business only on Sundays or holidays and can pay their taxes only through that particular Sunday business.</p>
   <p>It would have been better to declare Hyde Park a part of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In that case Chicagoans would not be subjected to the whims of a village burgomaster when visiting the parks for which they pay taxes.</p>
