   <p>Inspired by the immense success achieved by the National Historical Society at a protest meeting against the "National Origins" clause at Orchestra Hall last night, the society has already begun plans for a similar meeting to be held at the Coliseum immediately after the Easter holidays.</p>
   <p>Approximately, two thousand persons of German, Irish, and Scandinavian origin gathered there in order to voice their disapproval against the new measure, and also to send an appropriate protest to our representatives in Congress, denouncing the law as "unjust, unfeasible, and un-American in the highest degree," therefore, demanding the prompt abolition of the proposed legislation. President Hoover's viewpoint in this matter is well known, however, he was compelled to officially proclaim the new law. Nevertheless, he expects that the interested citizens will supplement <span class="page-break">\2</span>his efforts, and thus increase his chances for a satisfactory solution of this controversy. At the meeting, an emphatic resolution was passed showing that their fight is not directed against immigration restrictions, but against the precedence of one nation as compared with another.</p>
   <p>Mr. William McKinley, once speaker in the lower house of the State Legislature, said that he regards the present drastic restriction of the immigration quota, whereby Germany, Ireland, and the Scandinavian countries are heavily hit, as being a result of the anti-prohibition inclinations, manifested by our citizens originally from those countries. Evidence has been brought forth by the fact that the Turkish quota has been increased one hundred per cent. The Koran, as is well known, prohibits his followers to indulge in the use of alcohol, and the Turks have, therefore, become a "desirable people."</p>

   <p>Charles S. Peterson, city treasurer, and Christian Paschen, building commissioner, then referred to men of German and Scandinavian extraction, whose names are incorporated in the history of our Nation. Both speakers denounced the proposed immigration quota. However, Judge John McGoorty, representing the Irish people, was unquestionably the sharpest critic of the new law. . . . . "It is furthest from our thoughts," said Judge McGoorty, "to suffer even the slightest suggestion of inferiority in comparison with other nations." Mrs. Bertha Bauer also was urged to contact our senators and representatives, thus making the prevailing sentiment known.</p>
   <p>Superior Judge Harry Olson then read the resolution which would be submitted to the President and to the Congress. This resolution defends the people's stand toward the law, and expresses the attitude of the speakers. The reading of the resolution was followed by loud applause, after which numerous prominent Chicagoans affixed their signatures to the artistic <span class="page-break">\4</span>appearing document, the work of Mr. William Miller, archivist of the National Historical Society.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the meeting, Mrs. Schaedler expressed her deep appreciation to the enthusiastic gathering.</p>
