   <p>The new regulations are, by their nature, quite complicated, and the chairman of the National Code Committee admitted that it would be possible even for an honest businessman to go afoul of one or the other of the regulations. Only where the defects are intended and serious will the case have to be brought before the control office of the National Code Committee, which has the right to fine the guilty $500 on each count. Should the party fined refuse to pay, then the case will be referred to the N R A, which can change the fine into a prison term.</p>
   <p>Even if the execution of the new regulations and the procedure they involve are sufficiently complicated and, especially in the beginning, be less smooth, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>one must, nonetheless, agree with the purpose of the movement. One must not expect too much, at least in the beginning, and believe that everything from now on that is offered as an investment must be absolutely secure.

One must always bear in mind that low interest rates go hand in hand, as a rule, with greater security of the capital invested. Who is out for a greater and quicker gain should keep in mind that not all dreams come true, and that the thing may have an undesired end.</p>
