   <p>Let us hope that the Kaiser's German invasion of Chicago will not get as close to the city hall as the first German attack on that stronghold of civic virtue and republican institutions. The first German assault was in 1855, and cannon frowned down the Clark and LaSalle Streets of that day. But an Irish bridge-tender, not the cannon saved the city stronghold.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Germans of 1855, who were later to play so stalwart a part in the Civil War, rose in rebellion following the enactment of the first saloon Sunday closing law, but to the purpose for which it was enacted; Levy D. Boone had just been elected mayor. His saloon restrictions were not intended so much to promote prohibition as to further the interests of good old American whiskey as opposed to Teutonic beer.</p>
   <p>The first brewery of lager beer had been opened only a few years only before, in 1841 to be exact, and its product had found so little favor among American drinkers that its proprietor, Mathias Best had been obliged to convert it into a vinegar plant. Hence it was only in the North Side German Saloons that beer was to be found.</p>
   <p>Mayor Boone was a partisan of whisky, as a patriotic American drink, and</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>opposed to the foreign brew. Hence he enforced the Sunday closing law to the letter, as against the German saloon keepers, but allowed all the Irish and American bars to keep open. The Germans had obeyed the closing law to the letter until they discovered this partiality of administration. Then civil war broke out between beer and whiskey. The assault upon the city hall is described by Eugene <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in "Chicago, the Wonder City," in these words:</p>
   <p>"On Sundays then the Americans could wet their parched gullets, but the drink of the fatherland was denied the sons of Germany. Up to this point the Germans had fullied complied with the law, but at last some of them resolved to defy it, and run their saloons with the necessary license. But Mayor Boone was not to be trifled with; he had the offending saloon keepers summoned before him, and, as they refused to pay for their license, caused them to be imprisoned.</p>
   <p>As a consequence, the Germans of the North Side organized a relief party, armed themselves with guns, revolvers, and pitchforks, and one Saturday marched over the Clark Street bridge, up to the courthouse and demanded the release of their countrymen, the martyr saloon keepers. A crowd of several <span class="page-break">3</span>thousand Americans, Germans, and Irishmen, at once collected and stood eagerly awaiting further developments.</p>
   <p>"The entrance to the courthouse yard, which was surrounded by a tolerably high iron fence, was guarded by the police and the great door of the courthouse itself was closed. Down in the basement of this building were the prisoners, and those on the outside believed they could hear a confused murmur of voices coming from the various cells.</p>
   <p>"The Germans on the outside stood there for some moments, undetermined as to how to proceed, as no one appeared willing to lead the attack, when suddenly the courthouse doors were flung wide open, and out rushed fifty special policemen. All were armed with clubs and every man made good use of his weapon. A few shots were fired. At the attack of the police one of the rioters threw away his weapon and started to flee, but was over hauled and shot down. A German cigar maker shot a policeman in the arm.</p>
   <p>"The mayor and his council seemed firmly convinced that the chief struggle in this war between whiskey and beer would come in the afternoon. Two old cannon, which rumor said had in 1812 been abandoned as worthless by the <span class="page-break">4</span>British in Detroit, were lugged out from the city arsenal and placed, one on Clark Street and one on LaSalle, both pointing toward the North Side. In fact, a second and a well planned attack had been arranged, for the shameful defeat of the forenoon was keenly felt.</p>
   <p>"Men gathered in all the principal streets prepared for a bitter struggle. One rioter ran to the North Market Hall and rang the alarm bell. Fortunately, however, the threatened butchery was prevented by the ready wit of an Irish bridgetender, who as the valiant attacking column approached the river on Clark Street, swung his bridge wide and kept the doughty warriors off the South Side.</p>
   <p>"As a consequence of this simple artifice, the force of the "beerocrats" stood helpless and irresolute. The end of this rather grotesque campaign was that every one began to laugh and within half an hour not a trace of the rebel army was to be seen."</p>
   <p>It was war that gave Chicago its German population, most of the Germans here, of the early immigration at least, were from south Germany. Prussia had but a very small representation. The revolution of 1848 forced the liberty loving people of south Germany to flee before the anger of Prussian power.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The first Germans to come to Chicago, as far as record goes, were Daniel and Christopher Stanger who arrived from Pennsylvania in 1835. They wrote home of the opportunities here, and in 1836 Jacob Esher arrived with a party from Pennsylvania. In 1837 Jacob Boaz rode 300 miles on horseback to become the minister here of the German Evangelical Association. In 1843 a $500 Evangelical church was built at Wabash Avenue and Monroe Street.</p>
   <p>The early comers were Alsatians and Bavarians. After the revolution of 1848 immigrants began to arrive from Wurttemberg, Hesse, Baden and other parts of southern Germany. As a result the German-American population of Chicago now owns as its ancestral home the southern kingdoms. The war Prussia waged upon Denmark also brought an influx from Schleswig-Holstein, so that the present Teutonic strain in our population comes predominantly from Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg, and Wurttemberg.</p>
   <p>Whatever part Chicagoans of German birth of German parentage feel they can take in the present war, they took a very active part in the war of secession. In the Chicago Turngemeinde Hall is an interesting tablet. On this are inscribed the names of members of the society who were killed in the Union Army. This tablet, which is of marble, and its walnut frame, were the only things saved at the time of the Chicago fire when the first Turner Hall was <span class="page-break">6</span>destroyed.</p>
   <p>The first soldiers to leave Chicago in response to Lincoln's call included Germans, the Turner Union Cadets. The Twenty-fourth Illinois Infantry, the Hecker-Jaeger regiment, was exclusively German, in large part men who had seen service in the German and the Austrian armies.</p>
   <p>The Germans in Chicago and elsewhere, were strong abolitionists. They were among the first to demand the freeing of the slaves. Chicago was a strong supporter of President Lincoln, and for this the Germans should be given credit.</p>
   <p>The Germans, by the way, feel that they are not credited in some of the most recent histories with their share in the war. They point to a list of German generals including Sigel, Willich, Osterhaus, Hecker, Weber, Lieb, Winkler, Gerhard, Hassendenbel and others, and ask why these do not figure in accounts of certain battles.</p>
   <p>Chicago is the German metropolis of North America. The census credits us with a Germanic element amounting to 501,832 persons. But it is possible to advance this total to 800,000 by adding in certain other elements. The census does <span class="page-break">7</span>not count the third generation as German, but it should be considered in any computations of the German contribution to our citizenship. Nor does the census count in the German-speaking Austrians, nor the German-Hungarians nor German-Russians.</p>
   <p>The first of these three merge with the other German groups as soon as they reach this country, and maintain as solid a community of interest as if born under the German flag. The Hungarians are the descendants of German settling in Hungary decades ago, but they have always remained German, few of them acquiring the Magyar tongue. The German-Russians are of the same type. Their ancestors settled among a people of inferior development, so there was no assimilation, but a mere up building of little German oases. All these elements may safely be classed as German after they come to the United States to live. They are drawn together by the common language here in the same way that Americans and Englishmen are drawn together abroad.</p>
   <p>The Chicago German population has always lacked a spirit of German nationalism, however, for the immigrants largely came here before the up building of the empire, and their traditions are those of the separate states and kingdoms. The anti-German sentiment in the present war has brought them together more than they ever were in the past.</p>
