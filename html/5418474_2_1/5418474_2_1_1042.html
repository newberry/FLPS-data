   <p>The Americans adopt a peculiar attitude towards their German fellow-citizens.</p>
   <p>They consider them as idealists who should take part in politics for the sake of prestige. They should work gratis for a party and surrender all the political jobs to the natives and the Irish.</p>
   <p>We are not concerned about the distribution of spoils, but as Germans we cannot but call the attention to this political practice.</p>
   
   <p>According to them,the German should take the stump for the politicians, but as soon as he applies for a job, they are through with him.</p>
   <p>In their eyes he is henceforth just a low-class bum whose scalp they have to get at once.</p>
