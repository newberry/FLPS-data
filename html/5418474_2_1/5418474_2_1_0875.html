   <p>In America, the Christians of all confessions, and even some Jews celebrate Christmas in a real German fashion.</p>
   <p>For the great majority of celebrators it is a Christian affair. The tolerant Jew is of the opinion that he can not afford to deny his children the many merry and joyous moments of which others partake, for the sake of religious differences. The German Gentile, who does not recognize the Christian religion, considers Christmas the Yuletide season, or the festival of the old gentile germanic tribes, who celebrated the solstice.</p>
