   <p>The Chicago Tribune carried yesterday a most infamous article - a mixture of fear and malice. The Tribune uses the temperance question in order to heap simultaneously the most brutal abuse on the Germans of the North Side who defended themselves and their wooden houses. It states that the whole movement against the money bags is a drunkards' movement that aimed only to get permission - by way of rioting and brick-throwing - to erect as many saloons as possible on the North Side.</p>
   <p>"Lager-beer and Sweitzer-Kase", - these old knownothing shouts against the Germans -re-echo in the Tribune article. The adversaries of the temperance law are baptized "the bummer element".</p>
   <p>All this in the Chicago organ of the Liberals of Missouri: the paper which the German paper of Ledermann in St. Louis uses to derive most of its wisdom.</p>
