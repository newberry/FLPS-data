   <p>Joseph F. Schroeder, formerly of 3046 Drake Avenue, has no respect for God and the Christian religion, according to information given by his wife. On one occasion, when he came home and found his wife kneeling in prayer near the door, he slammed the door against her with such force that the plaintiff fell over and badly injured herself. Soon afterwards, sometime in November of last year, he took abrupt leave and was seen no more.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, Mrs. Schroeder appeared before Judge Sabath and asked for a divorce from her vanished husband, whom she also accuses of brutality and habitual drunkenness. Judge Sabath reserved final decision, but let it be known that he will very likely comply with the request of the wife. The marriage of the couple took place only last June, when Schroeder was employed in Chicago as a streetcar conductor.</p>
