   <p>Saturday night a meeting was held of French-speaking Germans, Canadians, Swiss, Frenchmen and others, in order to send delegates to Cincinnati. The attendance was as numerous as could be expected in view of the doubtful extent of the so-called "liberal" movement and in view of the likewise doubtful strength of the French element (though stated by Professor Demars to number 32,000). We refrain from giving the exact number of those present, in order to escape the suspicion of wanting in any way to belittle the meeting, and we will only say that the intended nomination of ten delegates at the close for very pertinent reasons, yes, for absolutely irrefutable reasons, was restricted to the nomination of seven.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rofinot was elected chairman. Prof. Demars regretted that the descendants, members, and mixtures, of the grand nation carried so little weight in Chicago. The Germans here had a powerful organ, the Illinois Staats Zeitung, furthermore, the Union, widely circulated weeklies, and three great Turn halls. The French had neither a paper nor a meeting place.</p>

   <p>That should be changed. The French should found Turn halls in order to bestow French civilization in the Northwest. For this reason the present meeting had been called, because when the Reunion and Reform Party came to the helm all that would come automatically.</p>
   <p>The great reformer and Swiss, Cen. Lieb, was likewise present and was introduced as a Frenchman born in the canton of Thurgau. This, however, was a little too much for him and he declared very decidedly, that he regarded himself as a German Swiss, and that he had during the Franco-German War strongly embraced the just German cause. This, however, had nothing to do with his politics, and as Providence seemed to have chosen him, for the reformation of the administration of the United States, for the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago, so he had come to this meeting. He then elaborated on the origin of the "Reunion and Reform Society" and its war cry: "Things must become different! (es muss anerscht werdin!)." Those chosen as delegates were Messrs. Guerott, Parent, Schlernizauer, Demars, Bengley, Dupont and Rofinot. Gen. Lieb excused himself, because he has been already several times delegated.</p>
