   <p>Among the Irishmen the desire becomes evident to join ranks with the Germans at the next local election.</p>
   <p>The next election is not connected with national politics, and even if the majority of Germans should differ radically from the Irishmen in matters of national politics this is no reason why both nationalities should not stand together in local politics when they have the same views and interests.</p>
   <p>The Germans of Chicago want to be victorious on November fourth. They want, through ballots to put an end to the insupportable tyranny of puritanism. To this end many votes are required. He who thinks that the Irish votes can be spared is wrong. There are fine free minded Americans, who will help us at the next election, but without the Irish vote we cannot win even with the help of these Americans.</p>
