   <p>The delegates of the "Chicago Association for Protection of Rights" met yesterday in Sharp Shooters Hall (Sahutznesaal). Mr. Vocke presided and Mr. Sievers functioned as secretary. The first point on the program was the report of the Constitutional Committee of the Association. However, before the program of the meeting was started, Mr. Haussner caused great indignation by some remarks made about the Chicago Workers' Association. Mr. Vocke called him to order because he was speaking about a topic outside the competence of this Association. The meeting reinforced the call to order of the chairman, when Mr. Haussner did not seem willing to comply.</p>
   <p>Several delegates moved to exclude Mr. Haussner from the assembly. Mr. Vocke did not wish to have this motion voted upon, but remarked that the behavior and procedure of Mr. Haussner were calculated to disturb the peace and to nip the Anti-Temperance Movement in the bud.</p>
   <p>After the Constitution had been accepted with only unimportant changes, Mr. Vocke made a speech in which he said: "The present aims of the Association are only material; it may not hold the enthusiasm of the Germans permanently; with the realization of those aims it will cease to exist. One should give <span class="page-break">2</span>the Association a direction toward a general promotion of German-American interests." Mr. Vocke then read the Constitution of the "German Association of the City of New York." He pointed out how beneficent the influence on American politics of the Germans could be if it was used to combat corruption.</p>
   <p>Finally he moved for the founding of a big German library. The motion was referred to the Committee.</p>
