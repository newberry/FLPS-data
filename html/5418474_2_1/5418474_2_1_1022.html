   <p>How easily yesterday being St. Patricks Day could one observe the children and grand-children of Irish immigrants are attached to the homeland and nationality of their parents and ancestors! Even sons and daughters and their sons and daughters of parents who originally came from Ireland were anxious to wear the green ribbons and to confess their affiliation with the nationality of their ancestors. This faithful adherence to their nationality can be readily observed by all children of the different Irish-American classes of the poor, as well as of the rich, and of the uneducated as well as the educated.</p>
   <p>In the social clubs and societies of the Irish people, the American born descendants of Irish immigrants are just as numerously represented and often more so, than their parents. This is remarkably true in a special sense in all such organizations which aim to improve conditions in old Ireland. This admirable attachment of Americans of Irish descent is obviously a conciliatory factor even with the illfamed order of the Clan-na-Gael.</p>
   <p>Indeed, this indestructable devotion on the part of the children and children's children of Irish immigrants towards the poor little isle of Ireland speaks volumes for the Irish. The educated Irishman in the United States, who is above the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>brutality of the masses - the result of former British tyranny - is usually a very agreeable and pleasant person.</p>
   <p>This remarkable devotion of the Irish to the nationality of their ancestors is one of the chief factors in the political power they enjoy in the United States. That their attitude is also conducive toward real American patriotism, the Irish-Americans have demonstrated in every American war.</p>
   <p>The tribute of praise which we have paid to the descendants of the Irish is not generally merited by the generations of German descents, although they have many more reasons to be attached to the nationality of their ancestors, because what is Ireland in comparison with Germany, the powerful nation of culture from which even the English and the American liberty originated.</p>
