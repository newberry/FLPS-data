   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung. Please extend premission to a man, who has read your paper for three years, to make a few remarks about the communication you received from "Mr. B. C." It is evident, I am no greenhorn, considering the long period, during which I have read your paper. Whoever asserts that the Illinois Staats Zeitung has anti-Jewish tendencies, appears to be anti-Semitic himself, even if the man is a Jew. After all, the Illinois Staats Zeitung gave a very lucid reply to the local Times and Daily News, in response to their articles "A Good Jew" and "City Slave Girl". During many instances the Staats Zeitung always came to the rescue of the attacked Jewry and if the immigration of Russian-Polish Jews does not appear desirable, from the newspaper's standpoint, it nevertheless coincides with the opinions of many Jews.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung, however, is mistaken if it claims that "Mr. B. C." inherited his sensitiveness in Hungary, Bohemia, or Russia. In regard to this sentence, a correction should appear: "You must consider that your paper does not circulate in Berlin, Hungary, Bohemia, or Russia". To Berlin, the German capital, must be given the credit for its tolerance of anti-Semitic propaganda. It was quietly accepted by the authorities and so gave security to the movement; <span class="page-break">\2</span>feeling encouraged by the success of their brethern, some Hungarians indulged in it.</p>
   <p>The anti-Semitic agitation in Hungary has died a natural death, it is practically extinct, but the Royal Chaplain "Stoeker" continues his subterranean labors. Neither Hungary, Bohemia, or Russia, have been the cause for "Mr. B. C.'s" thin skin; he acouired it in Germany, Prussia, and it stamps him as a true anti-Semite.</p>
   <p>Respectfully, Adolph Schlesinger.</p>
