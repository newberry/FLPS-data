That Goethe's last words, were never more to the point than today, is proved by threats to tear his bronze monument in Lincoln Park from its pedestal, and to throw it into the lake. The Lincoln Park Board was notified, yesterday, that certain people who live near the entrance on Diversey Boulevard where his monument stands, in their deluded hatred have made these declarations. At tomorrow's row's meeting of the Park Commission, there will be preventive measures taken against such vandalism. It is not impossible that a proposition will be made, to remove the statue temporarily and to put it in a safe place during the war. The Park commission will, as several parties have declared, scarcely be willing to take such action, because the testimony of spiritual poverty, which it entails for the people of Chicago, would naturally be too large.</p>

   <p>Professor E. A. Steiner of Grinnell College, Iowa, made a speech yesterday before the "Union of Congregational Ministers", in which he gave warning against war issues such as the above. He declared: "Hatred in war, destroys those things at which we aim. In case I condemned everything that is German, in order to appear patriotic, in that case I am not patriotic. But I know that I am patriotic because I try to follow President Wilson's doctrine and his noble aims which are threatened by blind hatred.</p>
