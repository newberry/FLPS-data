   <p>Paxton, enemy of anything that is German and "above board,"--Paxton, who makes his living by snooping--accused the saloonkeeper D. Bougaloupe, on Cottage Grove Avenue of having sold intoxicants to minors. The case was tried in Judge Summerfield's court.</p>
   <p>Lawyer Rubens, at yesterday's hearing, showed during his well conducted cross examination of Paxton and some of the instructed hirelings, that Paxton had sent these crooks to Bougaloupe's saloon to buy beer, and when the tavernkeeper refused to sell, Paxton again sent the fellows, who then claimed that the beer was for their parents. The saloonkeeper sold beer to the fellows.</p>
   <p>Judge Summerfield discharged Bougaloupe but did not refrain from giving Paxton a piece of his mind: "The law to prevent the sale of intoxicants, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>particularly whiskey, to minors, was passed in the general interest of the public, but not to provide a living for crooks who want to obtain an income from snooping. Through the abuse of the law, Paxton's system of inducing young fellows to lie, more harm will be done than by ignoring the law."</p>
   <p>Towards the end of the hearing, the judge declared that he will not give an adverse verdict in the future to any saloonkeeper, if Paxton gives the evidence. There must be better proof.</p>
