   <p>It is not yet a year since Wilburt F. Storey solemnly called Mr. Horace White of the Tribune a "dirty dog" and a "lying scoundrel." We then thought the expression too strong, but we think so no longer... We will leave quite aside those infamous lies about the events of January 15th, once more are repeated in their entire maliciousness... But that also speeches that most unequivocally condemned noisy demonstrations are represented as invitations for revolutionary excesses, that is to say, are converted into their exact opposite; that surpasses even the measure of bare-faced mendacity that one is justified to expect from the Tribune. The speech of the Chairman of the German workers meeting clearly reproved such disorder as is almost inevitable in the course of such demonstrations as that of January 15th, and expressly warned against the continuance of agitation in this form. The Tribune, however, represents him as a ringleader who had tried to organize a new uprising!</p>
   <p>The same infernal malevolence that actuates the native American murder hoodlums in their atrocious crimes against the Chinese - the same blood thirstiness that moved the reprobate Roumanian rabble to fall over the Jews, the "lying scoundrel" of the Chicago Tribune harbors against the Germans... He hopes to get things to the point where (as formerly the cry of "Hepp, hepp" was sufficient in Europe to start a Jew hunt) here in Chicago the shout "Dutch, Dutch" will become the signal for arousing the natives against the Germans.</p>
   <p>Well, can he succeed? Not as long as the Germans form a closely knit front, and don't let themselves be split into mutually antagonistic cliques... The hints made in the Tribune and the Journal that soon a German paper is to be published which will represent the "decent" Germans (i. e., the flunkies of Horace White and W. F. Storey) betrays a plot clearly enough. In what way the Tribune and its ilk reward the services of German Moors who undertake to split the German vote could be revealed by Citizen Jensch and Hermann Lieb. They are, after they have served their purpose - thrown away like squeezed out lemons.</p>
   <p>It is questionable if even ten aldermen could be found who would vote for the fire ordinance as Medill demands it (extension of the limit over the whole city). And if Mr. Medill should commit the boundless stupidity of vetoing the fire ordinance that makes Chicago Avenue and Wells Street as fire limits on the North Side, then the old fire limits will remain.</p>
