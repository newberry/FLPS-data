   <p>Under the slogan, "Down with the Jews!" several dozen young rowdies bombarded Frank Saltzmann's tailor shop, 694 W. 14th Street, last Thursday evening. Saltzmann and a number of his employees repulsed the horde at first, but soon were forced to flee and seek shelter in a nearby drug store, where the men notified the police. Detectives Root and Kilgallen came to the rescue. They arrested Jacob White of 678 W. 13th Street; the others escaped.</p>
   <p>White appeared before Judge Dooley yesterday, but denied his guilt and was discharged after giving a peace bond.</p>
   <p>Saltzmann told the judge that he had been persecuted by his neighbors for months, because he is a Jew.</p>
   <p>Judge Dooley assured him that the police will protect him.</p>
