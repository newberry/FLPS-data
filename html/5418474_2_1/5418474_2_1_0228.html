    The chief of the detective bureau, Captain John Stege, gave official orders to his men to arrest or drive from the city or to shoot down all persons whom they know to be gansters, gunmen, or bootleggers. Apparently, Mr. Stege wants to rid Chicago of these persons without resorting to the competent courts. He bestows upon his detectives the right to kill these persons the moment they are spotted. There is no other interpretation possible of the captain's orders: "Remember that gunmen sent to the morgue can never be pardoned and can never escape again."

    It need scarcely be mentioned that the captain's order is not compatible with the most essential provisions of our Constitution and of our laws. For, according to our laws and our Constitution, persons suspected by the police on any grounds whatever must be arrested and tried in the competent courts.

   <p>Captain Stege may perhaps justify his attitude by pointing out that it is futile to arrest these persons, as they are soon after released on bail. He also can point to the fact that the courts have frequently failed in their purpose, that they no longer constitute an effective means for combating crime.</p>
   <p>All this is well and good; however, it does not suffice to extenuate the procedure of the police. If this order were literally to be complied with, the police would have limitless powers over the lives and the property of the entire citizenry. There would be in Chicago something like a perpetual state of siege; the administration of justice as practiced in all civilized countries would be done away with, and policemen and criminals would shoot it out on each and every opportunity. It goes without saying that, occasionally, peaceful citizens, who are neither policemen nor criminals, will also be fired upon. But trifling occurrences of this nature cannot be avoided.</p>
   <p>A few days ago, Judge Joseph David of the Superior Court declared that no <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>officer has the right to enter a private house without a warrant. Judge David calls upon all citizens to dispatch with clubs and kicks any officer entering a house without a warrant--or, if necessary, to shoot him. Judge David's advice is not in contradiction to our law and Constition. But that it will ever have any practical effect is hardly to be expected. It is primarily to be regarded as a sharp protest against the hight-handed procedure on the part of the Prohibition agents.</p>

    These two declarations--the police captain's order and Judge David's invocation--furnish an excellent illustration of the truly shameful and thoroughly untenable situation which has been created by Prohibition in Chicago. The entire alcohol industry, involving millions of dollars, has in this manner been turned over to the criminal element. Comminals have become rich and powerful, and, with the aid of shrewd lawyers, they are able to run the risk of evading the law. To put an end to this horrible situation, one of the leading police captains orders his men likewise to disregard the law and order and embark upon a campaign of annihilation directed against the crimminal

    element. nd a respected judge advises the citizens to shoot down every officer who enters their home without authorization. In this wise, we have happily returned to club-law. Order, law, and sense of justice are all drwoned in the muddy swamp of Prohibition. Her who is best able to wield a shooting iron is lord and master in Chicago today.
