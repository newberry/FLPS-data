   <p>Numerous members of the Church Union and a large crowd of Temperance fanatics, held a meeting last night at the Arcade-Hall, 64th and Wentworth Avenue.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. C. Staver, the noted waterdrinking enthusiast, predicted that in the near future the whole district between 55th Street and 79th Street would be infested by saloons, if not some last hour desperate efforts are saving the situation. The only way would be, he explained, to vote against any amendments or any change of the prohibition-regulations, now in existence.</p>
