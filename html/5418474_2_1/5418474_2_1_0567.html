   <p>Here and there in this great country English-American protestant preachers are starting a furious outcry against the World's Fair in Chicago, because it is being romanized and catholicized. The primary reason for this accusation is the fact that Pope Leo XIII has taken a friendly attitude towards this undertaking, which he manifested not only verbally and in writing, but also in deed.</p>
   <p>One of thes clerical maniacs, a certain Fulton in New York scolded Mrs. Potter-Palmer of Chicago in very vulgar language, because she had succeeded in her request to have the Pope send to the World's Fair certain historical and unique relics of Columbus' discovery of America. Mrs. Potter-Palmer is a liberal protestant, well educated and intelligent, and therefore tolerant. She knows and appreciates the relations of the immortal discoverer to the Catholic Church and respect the present pope not as the head of his church, but as a highly cultured, well-educated, and benevolent gentleman. The pope's sympathetic compliance with her request proved that she was right in her estimation of him. <span class="page-break">2</span>English-American protestant ministers of various denominations still agitate and rage against keeping the World's Fair partially open on Sunday.</p>
   <p>These blind fanatics and vulgar hypocrites do not realize how detrimental their conduct is, particularly for the protestantism who they are suppose to represent and what a magnificent service they render to the Catholic Church, which is so hateful to them.</p>
   <p>The majority of the American people are inclined to lean more and more towards the more enlightened European viewpoint about the sabbath. They are absolutely not in favor of closing institutions of art, and instructive and elevating collections on Sunday. What an impression upon these people the contrast between the conduct of so many ministers of protestant sects toward the World's Fair, and the attitude of the catholic clergy toward the same must make.</p>
   <p>Every Catholic priest who has been asked for his opinion in this matter has expressed himself invariably in favor of keeping the Fair open on Sunday, at least part of the time. Not only is this true of German-American catholic priests, but also of such of other nationalities. Even the most thorough American of all <span class="page-break">3</span>catholic prelates of this country, the Archbishop Elder of Cincinnati, has expressed himself definitely in favor of keeping the Fair open on Sunday.</p>
   <p>The honor of protestantism is saved in this affair chiefly by the attitude of the German protestant churches of this country. They, as well as the catholic church, consider this matter a purely secular one, subject to police regulations and as such has nothing to do with the church. Most leaders and members of such churches have the same opinion as previously states, and these are in agreement with the viewpoints presented by the German reformers in regard to the sabbath.</p>
   <p>If one happens to hear of a German-American protestant church which is in favor of closing the World's Fair on Sunday, it is undoubtedly one which does not belong to the large German synods, but is rather an appendage of one of the essentially English-American churches. If it is reported that a certain German Lutheran church is for the closing of the World's Fair on Sunday then we may rest assured that it is one that does not belong to the large Missouri Synod, much less to the Illinois district of this synod, whose members are now carrying on a manly fight for their schools.</p>
   <p>Some of the English-American protestant churches in Chicago in this matter are <span class="page-break">4</span>now following in the steps of the overwhelming majority of the German churches, and more than one of them has refused to comply with the request to take a stand in favor of Sunday-closing.</p>
