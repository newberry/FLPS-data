   <p>The firm Palmer, Fuller and Company of this city, which employs a good number of Germans as carpenters, seems to be much aggrieved by the victory of the people and vents its feelings in a most despicable manner. Thus they have dismissed favorable Germans working men because, last Tuesday, they were absent a few hours in order to vote.</p>
   <p>Boyd and Buffton, 146 State Street, have not only dismissed John <span class="gap">[gap]</span>rsdorfer, 73<span class="gap">[gap]</span> Cottage Grove Avenue because he voted for the People's Party, but they have literally thrown him out and kept his working tools.</p>
   <p><span class="gap">[gap]</span>oode and Church, at the corner of 22nd and Fisk Streets have for the same reason dismissed forty Bohemian workers, who helped the People's Party to victory in the 7th Ward.</p>
   <p>We remind these people that they are playing with a double edged sword. If they continue on their course of petty revenge, the Staats Zeitung will recommend its readers not to buy any longer from any one who voted for the fanatics.</p>
