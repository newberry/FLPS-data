   <p>Lawyer Jussen is back from Washington, where he went in an attempt to induce the National Congress to name a committee to conduct an investigation of the German National Bank. The lawyer asserts that he made this direct appeal for the reason that Comptroller Knox, in whose hands rest the reports of the experts Weber and Washburn, refuses for some reason to take proper steps in the matter of the German National Bank and thus bring to justice the leaders of this irregularly conducted institution.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jussen denies that large sums of money of this institution have been used for the Republican election fund.</p>
