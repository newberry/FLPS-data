   <p>The saloons were not more nor less closed yesterday than on past Sundays. As all the doors were closed on account of the cold, it seemed to be still quieter than otherwise. Indeed it was a quiet Sunday. Under the present conditions of disorder in the police department, this is a pleasant fact. There is no doubt that the least distrubance now, would be ascribed to Rebellion and revolt by the fanatic haters of foreigners.</p>
