   <p>The Italian was captured, and gave the name of Vincent Cardoroni. The stilletto with which Cardoroni did the stabbing is sharp as a razor and over fourteen inches long. His brother, Emil Schiessle, had also sustained a wound from a stilletto in the left side of the head, but it was not dangerous.</p>
   <p>During the fight one of the Italians drew a revolver and fired two shots into the crowd of struggling men. One man was shot. Just where he was shot is not known. He was seen running away, holding his side, with the blood gushing from between his fingers. No trace of him has been found. The officers are diligently searching for the unknown wounded man.</p>
