   <p>For some time Mayor Medill has justified his actions concernin the Sunday law by claiming that he had the support of prominent Germans. Although Medill is at times very indiscreet, it has always been impossible to make him give the name of only one of those prominent Germans.</p>
   <p>As we hear, a German scoundrel has been attempting lately to give body to Medill's dreams. He tries to secure pronouncements from the German Roman Catholic and Protestant clergy to uphold the Puritan Sunday law. But so far he has been unsuccessful. To disseminate dissension among the Germans is now the main purpose of the knownothings.</p>
