   <p>About fifteen months ago the Rothschild and Company employees founded a social club, which has grown steadily in membership since then. Its growth has been so rapid that hundreds are now enrolled in the organization. From time to time the club has been arranging social affairs, and it did so successfully that now a more ambitious program, in the form of a ball, is offered. This is the reason why yesterday's ball, given in the large assembly hall of the Masonic Temple Building, brought more than 500 guests.</p>
   <p>Miss Runkle headed the Entertainment Committee, being ably supported by Max Schmidt, Miss Flora Smith, and others.</p>
