   <p>On the 4th of July all kinds of speeches were made, not only regarding the birthday of the American Republic, but also concerning the presence and future of this now so great and powerful free state. Andm of course, some of the orators painted everything pink, and the others black. Some wanted to show that we are just beginning with our career, the others maintained that we have gone over the hill top, and are on our way down already. To the latter belonged the Federal Judge Brewster whose opinions seem not always to cover up his decisions. Then as a member of the highest Court, he never has shown particular enthusiasm for individual liberty, while he, as a holiday orator stood up for the "Ideal State of Thomas-Jefferson" and thought he had to feel sorry for the Republic, because it has driven away too far from this ideal.</p>
   <p>Disregarding an unjust sally against Governor Altgeld, whom, he thinks guilty of the intention to lead the anarchist and socialist cohorts, the oration of Brewster can really be called witty and clever. He sees the main danger to political liberty in the economic lack of Liberty. What good would it be, to protect <span class="page-break">\2</span>the single citizen against the interference of the state, if he falls finally anyhow into tyranny of certain organizations? "The Business Men Become The Slaves Of The Trusts, The Laborers The Slaves Of The Unions." The capitalistic Union while trying to abolish competition, smashes and eats up the individual business man and fights him like an outlaw. On the other side the laborer must go on strike against his own desire and will, as soon as his Union bosses give the order. "Where is the individual laborer, who can dare to stand up for his liberty and can use his own judgment regarding his labor? Where is the business man who can manage his business the way he thinks is best? In the days before the Civil War, slavery was defended for the reason that it comprises a benefit to the slave. But is the submission under one individual man regarded less as slavery, than the submission to an organization?"</p>
   <p>With this last question the Hon. Judge enters without noticing it- a very dangerous territory because he touches the teachings of the Anarchists. Is submission to the will of a majority- so he might go on to say not just as much a slavery, as submission under an absolute ruler? When 49 citizens must take orders from 51 citizens as to what they should do, they are just as un-free as the minority within a labor <span class="page-break">\3</span>union, which, is compelled to accept a strike call of the majority. This proves, that economic association can just as little be condemned as political organization which is called the State. Without any organization whatever, humanity can fulfil nothing, and each organization demands the subordination of the individual beneath the mass. The scientific anarchists want the State to be vanquished entirely, because in any form it shortens more or less individual liberty. Judge Brewster is putting up the same "radical" demand regarding the capitalistic associations and the labor unions. He also spills the baby with the bath.</p>
   <p>Evidently organization is never a personal aim. When men unite, they want to reach a definite goal, and this determination is usually the improvement of their condition of life. Yet as long as an organization fulfills the desired aims, it has vital power, otherwise it needs reforms or is unable to live at all. Thoughts alone cannot fight against it. The economic unions of the business men and of the laborers suffer for every mistake, they have made, just as well as the communition orstates.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>If they do more harm to their members than they do good, they have to be changed or must cease. Reversed, they keep on growing when the benefit they produce for their members outweighs the disadvantages. A Union that orders without necessity one strike after another, and brings more loss to the laborers than they can or will stand, cannot keep up very long. The same happens with the trusts. Consideration of self-preservation forces therefore any organization sooner or later to mitigate.</p>
   <p>The State can show its superiority over economic unions only, when they rebel against its own laws and regulations and try to destroy by force the liberty guaranteed. But the State cannot prohibit a voluntary subordination of the individual to an organization, such as the spontaneous subordination under the laws of a church. If it oversteps its authority, its interference becomes intolerable. Should therefore, as Judge Brewster seems to indicate an attempt be made by the Courts to break up the economic unions by force, then just those who should protect them will be the ones who rises against them. Nobody can be in doubt about this, if he really knows history.</p>
