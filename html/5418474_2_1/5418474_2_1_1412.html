   <p>The National Congress made its decision in the matter of the bankrupt German National Bank and ordered an investigation against the negligent business management of Mr. Greenebaum. Buckner, chairman of the Bank Committee, prepared this resolution for the Congress. Not only the administration of the public revenue of the bank, but also the stand of the trusty of the bankruptcy and one in this matter implicating government officials shall be investigated. The expenses of this investigation shall be covered by the National Congress. The difference of comptroller Knox in this case brought a hot debate from the representatives of the people. The Republican members of the House resenting the proposed investigation, suspecting that a member of their party would be found involved, voted against such a procedure.</p>
   <p>The committee on investigation, which will meet in Chicago about the middle of September and begin the investigation, consists of the chairman, Buckner Lewis (Alabama, Democrat), and Price (Iowa, Republican).</p>
