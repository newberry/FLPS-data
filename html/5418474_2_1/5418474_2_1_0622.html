   <p>The suburb district held a meeting yesterday, at which all the Turn Societies of the suburbs were represented. The meeting was called to protest against the pernicious propaganda of bigotry and temperance. Members of the Chicago Turn Societies attended the meeting in large numbers, and the Turn Societies from Blue Island, Moline, LaSalle, Joliet, and Rock Island, sent their delegates. Mr. Plum, the first speaker, explained in short the reason for this meeting. The appointment of Mr. Spies as chairman and Mr. Hand as secretary followed, then Mr. Goldzier stepped on the speaker's platform and said: "The time for action is here, it is the Turners' duty to join all the other liberal-minded elements and thus engage in a battle with temperance fanatics. As to the course to take, those present here shall decide."</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann's opinion was, that it was necessary to join some party, either the Republican or Democrat, whichever condemns prohibition. This proposal did not meet with much enthusiasm. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Stern suggested that political activities were the best means to fight temperance. Messrs. Krause, Legner, and Kanneberg disagreed saying that such action would interfere with the personal rights of the citizens, as they would be obliged to vote for <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> either party if they agreed otherwise with it or not. They suggested an animated agitation among the English people by arranging mass meetings and distributing pamphlets, and expressed their conviction, that through speeches and printed matter the public, indifferent to personal liberty, could be reached and won for the cause. This proposition was much acclaimed. Mr. Rubens was the next speaker. He explained that the temperance question is political dynamite, disliked by politicians of both parties. But the question can be solved in a political way only. We cannot wait for the time to come, when the public will be convinced of the pernicious activities of teh temperance fanatics. Swift proceedings are necessary, and political action alone is capable of defeating the Puritan Protestants. There are three parties in existence: the Social-Democratic, the Democratic, and the Republican. The Socialist Party is the only one in which one could trust.</p>
   <p>Mr. August Spies followed as speaker. He disagreed with the previous speaker, that the temperance question was essentially a political one; it is rooted in the American Puritans, and the church is its mightiest supporter - therefore it cannot be treated as a political question. The majority has no right to annihilate the constitutional rights of the citizen of a state, therefore, it must not be voted on. He is in favor of officially protesting against the voting on this question.</p>

   <p>Mr. Rubens in his statement said that at the Springfield Convention, the Democrats were decidedly against the temperance law, and then proposed that a committee for the arrangement of a mass-meeting of all liberal elements should be appointed, at which meeting the most successful ways of blocking the temperance law, should come to discussion, and also, that this committee announces the Turners' stand on this question. This proposal was accepted and a committee entrusted with the execution of this resolution. Members of the committee: Turngemeinde: Stern, Gotz, and Hochster; Vorwarts: Goldzier, Simmens, and Gloy; Aurora: Spies, Kanneberg, and Legner. The out-of-town societies were instructed to appoint similar agitation committees, each of five men.</p>
