   <p>There is much talk about the so-called American "sober second thought" which is supposed to come to the fore after the passions have subsided and everyone has begun to think rationally once more. Maybe that is so, but sober thinking seems regularly to miss the bus these days; it invariably arrives after everything is over but the shouting.</p>
   <p>For decades the prohibitionists have preached that the consumption of alcoholic beverages shortens the span of life, and the medical profession has steadfastly supported this assertion. At first, physicians differed on this subject. Many physicians were anti-prohibitionist, but one after another they have relented and have given their approval to the prohibitionist doctrine. The life insurance companies followed suit by either refusing to underwrite policies for people who admitted to "drinking," by subjecting <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> them to the most rigid physical tests, or by restricting the terms of the policy. Thus it was accepted as an established fact that the use of alcoholic beverages and mixtures shortens the life span; and it goes without saying that the realization of this "truth" has done much to help the cause of prohibtion. For to prolong his life as long as possible, rather than to shorten it, is the desire and aim of every normal human being.</p>
   <p>Now prohibition is with us and we will probably have it for a long time to come. And now the convention of life insurance statisticians here in Chicago has has issued a statement saying that prohibition will probably have no influence whatsoever on the life span of man. It further announces that those who drink moderately live just as long as abstainers, and that even heavy drinkers often enjoy a long life. This statement, though no doubt true, merely corroborates the personal observations almost everyone has made. The statement is based on fact, and its publication might be regarded as a victory of the "sober second thought"--only it is too late now. Prohibition is here and the damage has been done. This post-mortem statement <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is worthless, and equally worthless is the "sober second thought," if it does not arrive in time to forestall injustice, stupidity, and error.</p>
   <p>In many parts of the country movements have been started to take the power of amending the Constitution out of the hands of the state legislatures and to give this power directly to the voters. These various movements differ in detail, but they are alike in their demand that only the majority of the original voters should have the power to effect amendments to the Constitution. And why? Because conscience, the "sober second thought," has brought about a realization that the Prohibition Amendment to the Constitution and the ways and means of its adoption are a travesty of our world-fames American democracy.</p>
   <p>Now that rights and liberties guaranteed the citizens by the Constitution have already by been raped by the adoption of the Prohibition amendment, attempts are being made to take many to right of the state legislatures to decide on Constitutional amendments.</p>

   <p>After the horse has been stolen, someone locks the barn door. Too late? Yes and no. Too late in this case, but timely for similar cases in the future. So long as this misfortune is kept fresh in everyone's memory, it will be easy to forestall a repetition.</p>
   <p>Now is the time to take steps to prevent further curtailments of citizens' constitutional rights, and to make plans to retrieve what has already been lost. Either one party or the other should make the preservation of Constitutional rights and liberties the main plank in their platform. And even if this enterprising party were not victorious next year, it certainly would be the party of the Future.</p>
