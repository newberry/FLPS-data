   <p>Under the auspices of the HydePark Protective Association, there was a meeting at the Hydepark Hotel for the purpose of agitating towards the carrying out of the old Hydepark Prohibition law-regulation. Successively Messrs. Professor Galvin, Alderman, Kiney and T. H. Banning, made speeches about prohibition and the necessity of drinking water exclusively.</p>
   <p>Professor Galvin pointed out, that particularly Woodlawn is in danger, to lose its prohibition, as land speculators and tavern keepers are trying hard to get concessions there, towards the opening of the Chicago World's Fair. Furthermore, Professor Galvin is of the opinion, that the administration of the coming Fair has not even the right, to let anybody sell liquor at Jackson Park for the duration of the Exposition. The other speakers agreed with the Professor, where-upon the meeting was adjourned with the resolution, to carry the agitation for more waterdrinking to the Mayor's office.</p>
