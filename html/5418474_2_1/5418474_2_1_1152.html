   <p>"It is not saying too much that the position of the Jews has hardly improved as much in the public life of Europe in two centuries as the position of the Negroes has improved in two decades in the public life of America...It is hardly more than four years, since the proposal to enfranchise the Negroes, almost led to a revolution with which the highest official of the Republic, himself, was threatened. But, today, after a mulatto has sat for two years, in the Federal Senate, it hardly attracts any attention that five members of the despised and outlawed race, take their seats among the representatives of the nation!</p>
   <p>With that the Negro question has ceased to be a question. That white and black families will have frequent social intercourse, as long as the difference in education and interests are considerable, is neither probable or necessary. Between Germans and the Irish, Germans, and American, there exists also, on the whole, little social intercourse, and yet they are all "Whites." Equality of pigment (the same skin), is not enough to create close understanding. But neither will its inequality in the long run prevent it. In the Twentieth Century, there will remain of the prejudice against "Niggers", approximately as much, as there remains today against people with red hair or freckles.</p>
