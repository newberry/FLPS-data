   <p>One hundred delegates from the forty lodges of the patriotic order Sons of America in Cook County, and from lodges of Joliet, Ottawa, Elgin, and other cities met last evening at the Grand pacific to devise means of creating a public sentiment favoring the suppression of German in the public schools. The meeting was enthusiastic and unanimous in the matter. It was decided that a petition be circulated throughout the State, bringing the question before the legislature and the school boards of the State.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to prepare appropriate resolutions. At an early date a public mass-meeting will be held at the Auditorium under the auspices of numerous patriotic organizations. At that time the question will be thoroughly discussed by prominent speakers.</p>
