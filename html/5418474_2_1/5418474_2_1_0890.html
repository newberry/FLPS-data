The visitors inspected the different departments. the start was made with the editorial offices, where they were welcomed by the publisher, Paul H. Mueller, and the editors, P. Kaemmerling, and P. H. Ortmann. The latter gave the desired information in regard to the purpose and work of a newspaper which is not printed in the language of the Country, but which has set as its high purpose to make good American citizens of the immigrants, with the understanding, however, that they shall not forget their old homeland, and that they are keepers of cultural achievements which they have brought along with them from Germany.
