   <p>The Saloonkeepers Association held a well attended meeting in the Gymnastic Hall, "Vorwarts" yesterday. Mr. J. Feldkamp was chairman. After the signing of seven new members it was suggested to nominate a committee of three persons to visit the Republican and Democratic candidates for sheriff, States Attorney, also city counsellers, to ask them their opinion of the temperance question. The committee was composed of Philip Mass, B. Baum and M. Wassermann.</p>
   <p>The object seems to be a very silly on as each of the candidates naturally will assure the Committee that he detests nothing more than water, that he takes every morning a half dozen cocktails or "whisky sours" at breakfast and during the day at least fifty to a hundred glasses of beer so as to secure himself the votes of the saloonkeepers. Harry Rubens, the Association's lawyer, explained in a long speech the plans and the motives of the state organization founded at the convention of tavernkeepers. The organization is put together by district and local associations. Cook County forms a district by itself and the meeting has been called for the purpose to form an organization. To his regret only two districts, Arlington Heights and Harlem were represented<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>so that the formation of the Assiciation must be delayed. The states organization is a defensive alliance for the saloonkeepers in the entire state, against the attacks of temperance organizations. The speaker also proposed the nomination of a committee of two persons to visit the different places in the county to agitate for the Organization. After some arguments, Wassermann amended this proposal and suggested the nomination of two members each for the above purpose, and so the proposal has been accepted. The Committee has been asked to elect the members, so consequently, seven Committees have been nomninated. Mr. George proposed that the Committee of justice should be asked to form an Association for the English speaking saloonkeepers, he has also been asked to attend to-day's session of the Municipal License Committee to represent the saloonkeepers and their interests against the attacks of the temperance advocate, Ballard. The saloonkeepers Association adjourned and the Provisional District Convention went into session.</p>
   <p>The lawyer of the Association was asked to work out a complete plan of action.</p>
   <p><a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>It has been planned that the district Convention should be held next Friday at 10 A. M. in the North Side Gymnastic Hall and Mr. Rubens has been asked to draw up the Constitution and bylaws for the Association.</p>
