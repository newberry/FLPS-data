   <p>On page eight of this newspaper there is a list of members of the County and the ward Committees which are to manage the coming campaign. It is evident that only experienced Republicans have been chosen, and they may be relied upon to put forth their best efforts in attaining favorable results for the party. The County Campaign Committee will meet every morning to receive reports and announcements from the Ward Committees.</p>
   <p>The outcome of the October elections in Ohio and Pennsylvania has given this year's County election an importance that it would not normally have. Chicago is the citadel of the Liberty party in the Northwest. Our opponents will do everything they possibly can to gain a victory here, so that they may noise it abroad to prove their statement that "the attitude of the <span class="page-break">2</span>people has undergone a change. Even a considerable decrease in the Republican majority, or the defeat of one of the Republican candidates would greatly encourage the Democrats and exercise a depressive influence upon the Liberty party in our own state and in the other states of the Northwest."</p>
   <p>We may be confident that the German Republicans of Chicago do not want to see the Republican majority in Cook County diminished by a lukewarm attitude. For unlike their brothers in other states, they have no just reason to be dissatisfied with their English-speaking companions. Not one of the prominent local Republicans of American birth who stand high in the councils of the party is in favor of temperance or the Sunday laws advocated by a few party adherents who will have no influence whatever if the party itself does not split. There is no party strife in regard to the so-called blue laws in Chicago as there is in New York. Moreover, there is complete harmony on all principal issues. And as far as participation by Germans in the <span class="page-break">3</span>administration of public offices is concerned, it is probably greater today than at any previous time; it is greater in Chicago than in any other large city of the United States, as is apparent from the many German names that appear on the County, Ward, and Township tickets. It was pointed out recently that with the exception of one person, every German who was nominated at this year's convention was elected.</p>
   <p>It will depend principally upon the efforts and the zeal of the Germans whether or not Chicago, in contrast to other cities, will prove to be an impregnable fortress against the onslaughts of the reactionaries in the November election.</p>
