   <p>The modes of living and habits of life of the American family are aimed at emancipation of the woman from the house or home. The kitchen barely exists for the American woman, while it is a source of continual worry for the German woman, and makes it impossible for her to spend the forenoon elsewhere. The American woman prepares the meal when husband takes off his hat and coat. The menu of the American housewife, consisting of beefsteak and salad, is prepared in five minutes. A servant takes care of the house, keeping it clean, etc., therefore much time is left for leisure. This is being utilized for attending temperance meetings, for debating in clubs, for aesthetic discussion in literary societies, etc; in short, it has become a habit for her to find her amusements independently of her husband. She may remain innocent in doing so but her husband will become demoralized because he is losing the moral influence of his wife. Husband and wife are not one body and soul, but two different individuals, whose inclinations and desires drift apart very definitely, and the consequence is estrangement, divorce, or a sensational scandal. If the American husband, who is attached to his home, senses the loss of his wife's social intercourse, he is willing to take big sacrifices intellectually, in order to enjoy her companionship. If she is a suffragist, or a prohibitionist, or a spiritualist, the husband, most likely, joins the same organization. The rather cool temperature of the American family life can be readily seen in their external attitude. The American wife does not say "my husband", but merely, "Mr. Jones" and Mr. Jones speaks of his wife as "Mrs. Jones". In every nook and corner is a lack of that mutual spiritual support, which makes a truly married life possible. All civil service reforms, tariff reforms, political reforms will not save Americanism from decay, unless the American family life is reformed, because it is the source and origin of all political life.</p>
