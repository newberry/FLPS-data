   <p>In view of the conduct of the German population, pending the war between Prussia and France, is the allegiance of the German element worthy of reliance, could it be depended on in case the Emperor of Germany declared war against these states tomorrow? To a close observer of passing events in Europe for the past four months, the emphatic answer would be, "It could not". Again the actions of the Germans, whether on this day in Commemorating the capitulation of Paris with their flags displayed, their martial music and lager beer, would necessarily induce one to ask,"Is Chicago a part of Germany or the United States? To this add the recent protest at Washington signed by 20,000 "Citizens" against the sale of arms to France. Their public demonstrations in several cities of the Union in tones of defiance to our government, and it needs no prophetic vision to see that we have an element in our midst unworthy of reliance in the hour of danger. Sir, with the exception of the Times, the press of this city has maintained a silence unworthy of that great instructor, the lofty mission of the free press in the United States. Shall we get up an address signed by millions of citizens praying <span class="page-break">2</span>for the disfranchisement of the dangerous element, or ostracise them to a more congenial latitude, where they may spend the balance of their lives in that slavery they so anxiously quitted?</p>
   <p>Citizen.</p>
