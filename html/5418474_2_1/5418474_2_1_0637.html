   <p>The temperance battle will soon be fought in the capital of our state. This prompted our reporter to discuss this question with several of our Senators whose view-point may be more than of ordinary interest to all the participants. This is what Senator White of the First District said: "It is folly to expect that we can beat the Temperance advocates. Lot us suppose that the majority of counties are anti-temperance, the law will still go through with a majority of votes because we can not fail to realize that the advocates of temperance are predominant in many districts, and therefore the representatives of these districts have to disregard <span class="page-break">\2</span>their own convictions, and declare themselves in favor of that measure. On the other hand, we are hopeful that it will not go through in the Senate. This can be accomplished by only 26 senators,if they vote unanimously for the cause. It appears that the public and the Senate can expect great results, no matter how hopeless it may seem in the House."</p>
