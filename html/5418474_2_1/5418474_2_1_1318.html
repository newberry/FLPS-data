   <p>Many people while reading their daily newspaper, pay close attention only to sporting news, market reports, sensational accounts of crime, salacious divorce proceedings, and other interesting scandal stories; they read only the headlines of the other articles and from these they from their opinions. These people received no slight shock this morning. For, while they scanned the "Wonder Of The World," [Translator's note: The reference is probably to the Chicago Tribune.] at the breakfast table, or on the way to work, seeking interesting news, they came upon an article on page five. They beheld the heading, written in bold type: "Cancel Orders For Ships Aggregating 1,250,000 Tons". And then they read the sub-heading: "Officials Of The Emergency Fleet Stop Further Work". Naturally, the readers concluded, that hopes for a great American merchant marine had been abandoned; that the vision of a return of the glorious past, when many large and stately American commercial vessels sailed all the seas and proudly displayed the flag of our country in all <span class="page-break">2</span>important ports of the world was merely a vision, and not a prospective reality; and that the Great Republic had modestly decided to withdraw from competition and concede control of the seas during times of peace to Great Britain. And this thought must be extremely repugnant to everyone who claims the name American.</p>
   <p>However, if one reads the body of the article as well as the headline, all fear is soon dispelled, and it will be seen that the resolution deserves everyone's indorsement. For Mr. Charles <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, the General Director of the Emergency Fleet, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the reason for the resolution, and then assures the public that the building of a large merchant marine will not be abandoned, but that it has merely been postponed in order that the result will be better than would have been obtained through the hasty execution of the present shipbuilding plans. Work will not be stopped on the ships which are in process of construction, but there is no steel at hand to start work on new ships and all such work was ordered suspended. Laying of keels for additional ships and awarding of contracts for others were discontinued, not because it was decided <span class="page-break">3</span>to forego the construction of a great American merchant marine, but because experience has proved that the types of ships which were built in the haste of war for military purposes are not adaptable to conditions which obtain during times of peace, and that it is necessary to produce a better and more efficient product than that which was anticipated by the persons who devised the Emergency Program.</p>
   <p>This is a satisfactory explanation, and the resolution will be indorsed by the public; for progress is the watchword, and not the greatest quantity but the best quality will win the trophy! others, especially the Queen of The Seas, have long strived to improve all products used in the shipbuilding industry and are bent on devising new methods to that end. They would be only too glad if good old Uncle Sam would adhere to his war program and continue to build only third-or fourth-class ships.</p>
   <p>It is reported from Paris that Mr. Edward P. Hurley, chairman of the United States Shipping Board, announced yesterday that he will soon depart for the <span class="page-break">4</span>United States, since he has concluded his investigation of shipping conditions in France. Mr. Hurley, it is said, voiced his conviction that the American people have resolved to construct and maintain a merchant marine which will make America absolutely independent of the shipping of other nations. He is said to have added the remark that a number of nations that are interested in shipping--perhaps it would not be very difficult to guess- the name of at least one of them--had deemed it their duty to point out, through "official and unofficial agencies," that the United States would find it extremely difficult to provide and maintain suitable and adequate shipping facilities. Mr. Murley declared that these hints merely served to convince him that the difficulties mentioned are by no means unsurmountable, and that the United States of America has all the men, material, and oqaipment necessary to solve without difficulty all problems that may present themselves.</p>
   <p>That's the way to talk! That's the correct answer to the doubts and warnings which were maliciously spread through envy jealousy, and fear of American competition, and were intended to scare good old Uncle Sam. Cur people--the good, <span class="page-break">5</span>average Americans--would have expressed themselves somewhat more clearly and emphatically, but since they know that it is necessary for all officials to be diplomatic, they are content and happy. They are content because the resolution to provide our country with shipping facilities which will be sufficient to make us independent of all other nations, is to be carried out. And they are happy because "Pulau F" (sic) is not to be followed, but that the lesson which was learned from Europe's experience is to be applied in planning and constructing our commercial fleet. This, in the final analysis, is the entire substance of the report that contracts for ships aggregating 1,230,000 tons have been cancelled.</p>
