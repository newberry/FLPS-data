   <p>People of German origin who have settled in this country, whether immigrants or natives can only play an important part in the future of America, by adopting American ways and standards. Their main task is to combine German with American culture. Not unjustly do the natives decline to accept the German-Americans, the Americans with a hyphen, as full-fledged citizens. The word "German-American" indicates an intermediate state, which is not quite German anymore, and not yet American; therefore, of a somewhat hybrid character, which has not yet developed into a living unity, and cannot achieve any real cultural performance. In this sense we can only have American newspapers and American literature in the German language, but not German-American newspapers or German-American literature.</p>
   <p>Many consider it impossible to secure in this country a greater influence for German culture and the German language. I believe, however, that something can be done provided the right methods are used. First of all, a movement should be initiated to obtain for the German language its legitimate position in the national life.</p>
   <p>The German language, Gothic, is the mother of the English language, and possesses a birthright, wherever the English language is spoken. It should be taught to every American child. Right now, the German language is treated like any other foreign language, and the Americans of German descent apparently are quite satisfied with it. Therefore, they should do everything within their power to see that it is honored and respected.</p>
   <p>True, America is ruled largely by the Anglo-Saxon spirit, but not altogether; friendly cultural reconquest by the Germans is possible. It is important to remind the many prominent Americans, who have almost forgotten their German extraction, to help them comprehend what the German spirit, German endeavors, and the German language means to America and to the world. Of course, a person of German extraction can become an American, but not an Anglo-Saxon, even if he should be influenced externally by Anglo-Saxonism. Nobody can escape from himself or his race.</p>
   <p>America is the melting pot of all the races and they all should have one single aim: The welfare and the development of America. This fact should induce the Americans of German descent to work so as to gain their rightful share in the common life of the nation, and so the influence of the Germans may be noticed in this combination of many nations. By doing this, Anglo-Saxonism is not belittled, but only enriched, and the culture of America as a unit, is but deepened.</p>
