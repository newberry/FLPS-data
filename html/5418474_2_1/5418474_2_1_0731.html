   <p>This fight has been left so far to the saloon keepers, while the public, in spite of all the admonitions of the press, has been only an interested spectator.</p>
   <p>The procedure of the saloon keepers has done more harm than good. It has gone so far that the Mayor has taken away the concession from a most respectable amusement restaurant owner, and the Mayor has done so, upon the complaints of German saloon keepers. Matters have gone so far that the mayor and his faction can boast, that Chicago is the only city with a largo immigration in which the Sunday laws are strictly observed.</p>
   <p>We have indicated previously, that due to the feelings of the majority of the people of the state, it will not be possible to repeal the state Sunday law within the next few year; that the best that can be secured, now, is a city administration which will simply ignore this state law. So it has been before, and so it must be once more.</p>
   <p>The fight of the saloon keepers, who are denouncing each other, is pleasing to the temperance fanatics. An entirely different impression would be created by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a general organization of citizens. Such an organization would make a moral impression, and would be powerful enough to bring victory at the elections next fall.</p>
