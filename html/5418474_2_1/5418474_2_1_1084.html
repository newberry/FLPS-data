   <p>Charles Proebsting finished the statistical compilations of Chicago births yesterday, based on the records of the county clerk.</p>
   <p>The figures show a total of 11,152 births, 5,738 boys and 5,345 girls; in 19 instances the sex was omitted. [Translator's note: The computation, including the 19 sexless infants, gives only 11,102, and I cannot tell you what happened to the other fifty.]</p>
   <p>Only 80 children had colored parents. According to the figures every mother in Chicago has an average of 3 3/4 children.</p>
   <p>The separate wards show an increase as follows.....[Omitted; not German.]</p>
   <p>Nationalities</p>
   <p>The Germans had 4518 children, the Americans 1878, the Irish 1625, the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Scandinavians 899, the Bohemians 635, the English 401, the Canadians 223, the Poles 234, the Scotch 116, the French 54, the Swiss 40, the Dutch 50, the Italians 50, the Belgians 21, and those of other nationalities 37.</p>
   <p>No triplets were reported up to January 1, 1879. However, there were 123 pairs of twins and 266 stillbirths.</p>
   <p>Among these young cosmopolitan citizens 146 will be sure of their identity only so far as the mother is concerned; their paternity is doubtful.</p>
