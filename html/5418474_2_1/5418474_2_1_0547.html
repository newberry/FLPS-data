   <p>Regardless of Party lines and religion, this newspaper always has represented the standpoint of the German elements in this city concerning all community-affairs.</p>
   <p>After 6 days of work and toiling, the Germans want to enjoy life freely on Sunday, As they see the Sabbath, some people will go to the Church in the morning. Many more people will go in the afternoon to theaters and afterwards to cafes and Restaurants. Some other people will stay at home or flock to saloons to meet old friends and make new acquaintances. Sunday nights should be reserved for family affairs, dances and other entertainments. That is the way we Germans want to enjoy life on a carefree Sunday.</p>
   <p>The latest adopted Sabbath city ordinance is reflecting the German standpoint and must be rightfully called an achievement of German cultural thought in bitter opposition to the Puritan standpoint, as voiced by the Anglo-American Press, which wants to give to the American people a dead Sunday, with the silence of a graveyard and bare of any joys of life, to which we are all entitled.</p>
