   <p>Today at 11 o'clock the Greenebaum jury was still locked up after Judge Blodgett had given the jury instructions which were very favorable for Greenebaum, Attorney Swett made his final speech yesterday; he seems to think that Greenebaum's action was perfectly legal, and it is laughable to think that a clever business man like Mr. Greenebaum would swindle a bank for such a small sum as $20,000 or $50,000. Prosecutor Leake made a very short speech complaining that Greenebaum's relatives were all working in the bank in some capacity, etc. The whole trial was rather one-sided. Wait and you will see.</p>
