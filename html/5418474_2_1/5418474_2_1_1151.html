   <p>"France has done more for civilization than a dozen Germans", says Wendell Phillips, in his most recent Germaneating lecture. His opinions in all essential points are being shared by Charles Sumner. It creates, therefore, a peculiar impression to see German newspapers, (democratic ones, of all things,) tearing their hair because he will no longer preside over the commission upon which the relations between the U. S. and Germany are primarily to depend. As we would not question the German-patriotic feelings of those papers, we can no longer doubt, that the tears they shed about Sumner's misfortune are crocodil's tears.</p>
