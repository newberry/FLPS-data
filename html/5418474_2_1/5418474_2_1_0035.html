   <p>The speech of Mayor Harrison held at the convention of the Saloon-keepers caused a great disturbance and dissatisfaction amongst the temperance believers. The Parson Noble preached last night in the Congregational Church in Union Park on the subject: "Our Mayor and Rum", and the pious congregation made a general resolution condemning the action of the Mayor severely. This caused the anger of these rascals and secret drunkards which should not do much harm to the mayor.</p>
