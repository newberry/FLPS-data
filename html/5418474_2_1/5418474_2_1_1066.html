   <p>At a festival arranged by the Chicago Danes at Battery Hall "D", last Saturday night, in honor of their countrymen serving in the King's army, J. W. Borchsenius, M.A., said in discourse at the table, "If the majority of the Scandinavian people of this country could be present and hear me, they would all approve and join me in saying: 'Among the great nations whose people immigrated to this country, the distinction of being the most industrious, honest, unselfish and good natured people goes to the Germans of this country'. We Danes (or Scandinavians) are regarded by the Germans throughout America as their brothers, and indeed, we do feel that all the things we have in common, justify us in saying that we belong to the same race. No matter what the political conditions in Europe may be, I am convinced that the Germans and the Scandinavians of this country will continue their present friendly social relationship".</p>
