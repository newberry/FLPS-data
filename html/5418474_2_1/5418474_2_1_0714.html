   <p>Among the Presbyterian clergy who attended the general convention in Chicago were men who knew well enough that even the most pious of the German Protestants will not tolerate that a monotonous and an unpleasantly spent Sunday should be forced on them. There is Pastor Poor who condemned his colleagues for their favoritism of the Sunday temperance laws. He defended us poor German sinners saying: While on a visit to Germany he had the honor to be invited by highly respected and pious clergymen to participate in their Sunday enjoyments. Not accustomed to the idea that a minister of the gospel could indulge in worldly pleasures on Sunday he was given to understand that they do not believe in spending Sundays in the puritanical manner. In Germany he saw even the best of the Evangelical Christians enjoying their glass of beer on the Sabbath day, not omitting their smoke either; and what is more, their pastors joined them and shared the happy spirit of the Sunday with them.</p>

   <p>Through his observations in Germany he came to the conclusion that the German Christians on both sides of the ocean send a part of the Sunday - and this without feeling that they commit an indiscretion against the church - in healthy, worldly entertainment. Rev. Poor warned his brother clerics against too much Sunday fanaticism. He proposed that the "American Sabbath" be made more adaptable to the Germans, also announcing that the sanctity of the German freer Sabbath is indisputable but, that a Sabbath without any constraint would be a dangerous thing in America.</p>
   <p>This last remark which Pastor Poor made is quite a compliment to the Anglo-Americans. His logic points out, that the foundation upon which the American church and religion rests is not powerful enough, therefore it needs the support which they seek in the Sunday restraints. The other possibility is, that the Americans are unable to govern themselves, therefore establishing a free Sunday like that in Germany is considered dangerous. Chicago, and many other cities which enjoy unconstrained Sundays, are evidence that Pastor <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Poor is on the wrong path.</p>
