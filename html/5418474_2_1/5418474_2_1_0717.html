   <p>Among Chicago's clerics who in the year 1873 used all their energy on the weak Mayor Medill and his right hand man Washburn to suppress the Sunday entertainments of the German people was A. E. Kittredge of the Third Presbyterian Church one of the worst intrigues and owing to his superior influence one of the most dangerous also.</p>
   <p>After bigotry received a blow, Kittredge's activities were reduced very much; now since he and his friends are part of the city council's majority he began again with his pernicious activities.</p>
   <p>His last Sunday's sermon was unadulterated poison... This is a warning to the German people as well as to friends of personal freedom and of a rational and sensible Sunday, to beware of Kittredge and his co-fanatics!</p>
