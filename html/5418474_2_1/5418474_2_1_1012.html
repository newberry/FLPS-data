   <p>"To the Editor of Skandinaven</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"Although I am a German, I am endeavoring to master the Norwegian language, and among other Norwegian publications, I am a regular reader of the Skandinaven. I was somewhat disappointed to learn, through the columns of the Youth's Department, that there was a growing tendency among the rising generation of Norwegian-Americans, more and more to neglect and even to discard their noble language. I used to think better of the young Norwegians in this country. I used to believe that only we Germans were open to the charge of becoming untrue to our mother tongue. You know, it has become proverbial that a German, whenever he goes to a foreign land, will discard his own language within a year and adopt the language of the country to which he has come. I should regret to see you Norwegians follow suit. I do not feel that even your English-speaking neighbors will think any better of you for preferring their language to your own Norwegian. By all means, give Norwegian as large a place in your heart's affections as English. In a country like ours, where many nationalities are so largely represented, you cannot know too many languages. There are fifty reasons why you should not give up Norwegian and fifty more why you should learn German in addition."</p>
