   <p>According to the opinion of German Finance Leaders, the increase of Gold in American, British and German Banks is caused by the foolish silver-laws in the United States. As long as our government is continuously buying 4 1/2 million ounces of silver every month, to hoard it in treasury vaults, the Gold will flow to Europe. As a fact, gold is getting more and more out of circulation. Not only the gold coins but also the gold certificates and Federal Bank notes are crowded out by silver certificates, treasury notes and inferior metal dollars.</p>
   <p>The Sherman-Law is leading us slowly but surely towards a domineering silver standard.</p>
