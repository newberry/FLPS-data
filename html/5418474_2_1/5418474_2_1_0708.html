   <p>Germans and those of German descent showed great resentment at the bill adopted by the City Council yesterday, which empowers the Mayor to appoint twenty snoopers from the Citizens' League and to give them police powers and full authority to act. We have reason to believe that Mayor Heath, also, dislikes the ordinance, and that he will veto it today. If he does not, the public expects its representatives in the City Council to reconsider the bill and to do everything in their power to repeal it.</p>
   <p>A reconsideration can, of course, be demanded, but the bill should certainly not be signed by Mayor Heath.</p>
