   <p>The Taxpapers' Association of Cook County had a meeting yesterday and expressed their intention to assure the Water-Apostles at Hyde Park and Englewood of their moral support. The Association is pretending, of course, not to have any sympathy for Temperance, but wants to fight the sale of whisky as an interference with the local business standard at Hyde Park and Englewood. This standpoint is naturally only a mark to hide their lack of conviction concerning the real issue.</p>
   <p>A certain Mr. F. A. Winkleman, whose name should be Winkelmann, brought in a resolution which condemned the sale of whisky and is promising legal help to the two suburb towns against the danger of alcohol.</p>
