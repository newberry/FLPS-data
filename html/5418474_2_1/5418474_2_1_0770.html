   <p>The opinion has gotten abroad that with the acceptance of Alderman Schintz' motion in the City Council on Monday, the Sunday Law question is closed. This impression is erroneous, because the motion of Mr. Schintz has only been ordered to be copied, prior to being taken up again and before it can be confirmed by the Mayor. We regard the continuance of the agitation under these circumstances as necessary and therefore ask the Committee members who have been elected in the wards to meet tonight at Quincy No. 9, corner of Wells and Randolph Streets.</p>
