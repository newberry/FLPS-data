   <p>One of the main reasons why the economic situation of the land has not risen to the level desired and hoped for (in spite of all the efforts of the government and the wishes of the people) is doubtless the universal feeling of uncertainty resulting from government interference with industry.</p>
   <p>The great industrial enterprises and the large business houses are operating to only a small fraction of their capacity; the business world is holding back orders because of the uncertainty as to what lies ahead. If the businessman knew what to expect in the near future or in the coming winter, he could make appropriate plans. In that case, wholesale merchants and industrialists could figure out intelligent production and selling programs. As things stand, retail merchants are buying only "from hand to mouth". They can make no long-term commitments in the face of the economic unrest and the fluctuating <span class="page-break">\2</span>value of the dollar. Should the dollar drop between the time of buying and selling of merchandise, it would mean a loss which the businessman cannot afford, in addition to all his other risks.</p>
   <p>The N R A is intended to reduce unemployment, and is going to do it, too! But if it does not fulfill its objective in the measure expected, the failure may be laid at the door of economic uncertainty. This uncertainty has its origin, in part, in the government's secrecy as to its financial plans. No one knows what value the dollar is going to have eight days, or four weeks, or a few months, from now. The government cannot be blamed for this. Should the financial measures planned in the interest of our economic life be prematurely announced, their aims would be largely frustrated. The government could, just the same, do something to pacify public fear if it would take a decisive stand against the baseless rumors that are from time to time spread about. Every time persons connected with the government impart to the public immature products of their own brains, with which they disquiet the people, it is the duty of the government to protest energetically.</p>

   <p>One such irresponsible "plan," the unauthorized broadcasting of which may give rise to general unrest, is that of Dr. Arthur Dahlberg. It is not at all new, and its author need not boast of any creative gift. Dahlberg proposes to issue new money every month, and to continue devaluating the old from month to month until, after a certain period, the old money would be altogether valueless. The purpose would be to force people with money to keep it circulating. Nor, according to the Dahlberg plan, could money be saved. All bank deposits would be taxed each month, so that their value would decrease from month to month. Dahlberg would, therefore, compel all inhabitants of the country to spend, each month, all the money earned in that month; what is more, he would compel all persons with savings to spend these savings, no matter what they might buy. Dahlberg himself is of the opinion that many would spend their money for things which they do not need, but he considers this needless squandering advisable, because, in this way, money would return to circulation, and industry and commerce would flourish. That might be the case, but such an economic state would be but a hothouse plant, doomed to die a speedy death.</p>

   <p>The plan is so scatterbrained for other reasons (which are as clear as day) that there is no reason to discuss it seriously. A brain capable of hatching such a plan must have some remarkably devious passageways and ought to be under careful observation. However, its owner should not be permitted to submit his "brain children" to the public, so long as they can somehow to brought to the notice of the economic and industrial advisers of the President. The last great run upon the banks was only a few months back. Is there anyone who desires a repetition? Is it the desire of the government to see a flight of American capital to foreign countries? If not, a muzzle should be put on persons of Dahlberg's type. For they cause a high degree of disquiet among the people who,--judging from past experience--do not know what to believe and what not to believe.</p>
