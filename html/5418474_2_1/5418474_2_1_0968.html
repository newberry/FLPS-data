   <p>The Irish of Chicago are strongly protesting against the attempts of the English and Irish press, to force the American Irish to fight against the Germans with the British army in the European War. At a meeting held in the Hotel La Salle by the United Irish Societies the following resolution was passed. "Resolved that we energetically condemn the attempts of the English and Irish press to force the American Irish to fight against Germany in the European War. We also declare that the libels and abuses brought against Germany do not represent the real sentiment of the Irish people. We cannot understand why any Irishman should take side with the British Empire which always has been their greatest enemy, while the Germans in this country and on the other side have always proved to be their friends. England is now not more worthy of the sympathy of the Irish than in the last 700 years and we protest against the attempt to give a wrong impression to the world of the real sentiments of the Irish, and to induce our countrymen to fight for a Government, which has never observed its faith and only retains home rule to get our support in the European War.</p>
