   <p>A reporter of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung interviewed Mayor Harrison late yesterday afternoon at the latter's private office, and found the gentleman in a good mood. A better chance to question the mayor on important issues could hardly be found.</p>
   <p>The proponents of moderation, under the cloak of the Citizens' League, passed various resolutions several days ago calculated to encourage the mayor in continuing the revocation of saloon licenses. As the saloon question, that is, the midnight closing ordinance and the proposed plan to keep saloons open all night, has again become a daily topic of conversation, the reporter asked the mayor to express his opinion.</p>
   <p>As to whether the mayor would follow the resolutions adopted by the Citizens' <span class="page-break">2</span>League at Farwell Hall, Mr. Harrison said:</p>
   <p>"These resolutions exceed my authority. It is demanded that I limit the number of licenses [to saloonkeepers], and that I issue them only to saloon-keepers who have good reputations. If I were to follow these resolutions to the letter, it would keep me busy for a year just to find out what kind of man the applicant is. I would have to make personal observations and investigations to obtain details concerning an individual's character. If I did not care to do this work myself, I would have to entrust someone else with it. However, I do not intend to pass judgment in such delicate matters on the mere testimony of strangers, and I certainly would not delegate authority to anyone to ascertain the character of a person for the purpose of granting or denying a license.</p>
   <p>"The refusal or a license to a business which is legally recognized involves almost judicial powers, and therefore I am not willing to give judgment on <span class="page-break">3</span>information provided by the opposition. People who complain ere often prejudiced--or even bribed. The granting of a concession is just as much of a judicial act as the refusal to give one. I can revoke licenses only if I have definite evidence from reliable sources. It has been claimed that I revoked licenses at the request of the Prohibitionists. That is not true. In all cases of revocation, I either made a personal investigation or had one conducted by a reliable party who assured me that it would be in the interests of our morals to close the place. About six or eight weeks before the temperance people saw me, I had decided to close certain taverns. I gave timely warning to the proprietors, and told them to conduct their places in a respectable manner. They ignored my admonitions, and relied on my good nature and their pull. Of course, I cancelled their licenses.</p>
   <p>"The saloon question in itself was not considered at the time the temperance people saw me. In the consultation at the time, the closing of houses of ill fame was involved and, likewise, the closing of certain saloons where alcholic <span class="page-break">4</span>drinks were sold to minors. I was prompted by the police in rigidly enforcing the midnight closing ordinance, because they claimed that hotbeds of crime were to be found in those places which keep open during all hours of the night. Plotting of crimes still persists in many a saloon where the front entrance is closed while the rear door remains open. I have often questioned the police about it, from the assistant chief of police, O'Donnell, down through the ranks to the ordinary officer. The officers on the beat see suspicious characters sneaking into saloons by way of the rear entrance. If the police demand admission, the door is closed in their faces. Officers cannot gain admission to saloons after midnight, unless they have warrants. I would prefer that all saloons remain open all night, rather than to have one fourth of then close their front doors, just for bluff, while patrons are permitted to use the rear door. If saloons were licensed to stay open all night, then the police could enter, and ascertain who is present and what is being done.</p>
   <p>"When I ordered observance of the midnight closing ordinance, I regretted very <span class="page-break">5</span>much that some taverns, which stayed open all night to accommodate the night shifts of some establishments, were affected thereby. I would have preferred to let them continue the practice, if I had had the power. After long contemplation, I conceived the idea of issuing special licenses enabling the holder to keep his tavern open all night, and I submitted the proposed measure to the city council. If that body accepts the proposal, probably fifty out of hundred tavernkeepers will apply for the license in order to serve customers after twelve o'clock. The police would know then which places may remain open; violators could be more easily apprehended, and better protection could be given the city.</p>
   <p>"I was asked to give permission to several saloonkeepers to keep their places open beyond midnight without a special license. I cannot show favoritism. Aside from that, I found that even the most disreputable saloonkeeper can obtain character witnesses to vouch for him. It is nothing unusual. I have <span class="page-break">6</span>discharged policemen because they were corrupt, but lo and behold, the next day, respectable citizens appeared at my office to put in a good word for the men I had dismissed. After I revoked the licenses of certain saloonkeepers and beer garden owners on State Street, I was besieged, the following morning, by good citizens, including aldermen, who wanted me to rescind my order. How can I show preference under such circumstances?</p>
   <p>"I do not like to interfere in a man's business. Therefore I take action only when I have indisputable, reliable proof. I do not consider the reports of the police as sufficient evidence to designate this or that saloon as a disreputable place. My decisions are based on personal investigations, or observations made by my private secretary. I wish to emphasize that I am convinced that most of our crimes are 'hatched out' in saloons after midnight, and I therefore appeal to all Germans to help me in solving the tavern question, and I ask their aid in particular, since the Germans have always supported fair laws. People urge me, hundreds and hundreds of them, to close theaters and <span class="page-break">7</span>saloons on Sundays. My invariable reply is that Chicago is a cosmopolitan city, and people who come from other countries have a right to indulge in harmless pleasures on Sunday; these people have a right to seek amusement in theaters, or to go to a tavern, and I am not willing to favor a particular contingent of our inhabitants. Chicago is composed of people of many different nationalities, and therefore only one sensible policy can be pursued--friendly arbitration. I believe that if I permit the Germans to celebrate their Sunday in their accustomed manner, they, in turn, will co-operate with me in my attempt to prevent disturbances during the night."</p>
