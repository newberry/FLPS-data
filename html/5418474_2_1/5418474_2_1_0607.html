   <p>For several years a tendency to hate foreigners has been noticeable in the United States. The fanatical clergy of the majority of American sects, in particularly the Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and Baptists, have taken advantage of these conditions not only to enforce the antiquated blue-laws, but, also to render them more severe.</p>
   <p>This anti-foreign tendency has been strong enough to influence many Americans, who otherwise, might have been liberal and progressive. The enforcement of antiquated Sunday-laws is first of all an attack against the German element, because of its custom of going out on Sundays with families to enjoy the out-doors, to listen to good music while drinking beer in a beer-garden...</p>
   <p>Of late the fanatical clergymen have succeeded with their almost limitless influence over women, to brand as unfashionable the visit to "devilish" places, such as beer-gardens, etc. The question is, why should foreigners <span class="page-break">\2</span>be permitted to celebrate Sunday in a different manner than has been customary for Americans for generations? In the country-towns and villages the clergy have likewise used their influence over woman, and have organized them as their most effective allies. In some places every girl and woman must join this organization, if they wish to be considered decent.</p>
   <p>The agitations for the blue-laws and for prohibition, are not the only result of this anti-foreign tendency, prevalent for several years. Many things point to the fact that a crusade is being prepared against all foreigners similar to the movement in 1854. That particular crusade was the result of the large number of immigrants from Ireland during the previous decade and of the influence of corrupt politicians who had gained control over elections and the ballot-box. It was also pointed against Germans of the revolutionary period (1848), whose viewpoints were misunderstood <span class="page-break">\3</span>by most Americans. A petition of that storm in all probability will be occasioned by the continuous intermingling of the Irish-English problem in the political life of the United States. This is being done by the Irish politicians with increasing effrontery. The Americans are tired of listening to the Irish publicly asserting that they vote only for those men who take a most definite stand against England in Irish affairs, and not for those who might be the best men for American affairs. The Americans are tired of having their relationship to England continuously interfered with by demagogues, who speculate for Irish votes. One can not blame the Americans from being really disgusted with the demands of the Irish to appoint such judges to the Supreme Court only, as are favorable toward the Irish question.</p>
   <p>Another cause of this anti-foreign tendency is to be found in the activity of recently immigrated anarchists and socialists. The American considers the red flag, the banner of the Anarchists as well as socialists and shows a continuous trend against his institutions.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the importation of half-civilized workers from Italy, Poland and other countries by the American industries contributed its share in <span class="page-break">\4</span>These half-slaves were imported for the purpose of squeezing wages to a lower lever. It is not strange that the American workers bitterly resented it. This attitude is spreading more and more. Almost daily appear in newspapers, demands by workers to restrict immigration from Europe, similar to that from China. This restriction would not only effect the half-civilized masses of Europe, but all nations. If the liberal New York Times remarks that it is still an open question, whether restriction of immigration is an advantage to this country or not, but that naturalization could and should be restricted and that this is a matter for congress, then the danger is very imminent.</p>
   <p>However, this storm may blow over like many others, without doing much damage.</p>
