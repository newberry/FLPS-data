   <p>Chicago and Milwaukee will be very soon the only cities of this country, in which there is no puritanical Sunday law existing.</p>
   <p>All cities in the East are under this tyrannical Sunday law, Not even a decent public theater performance can take place in New York City. In all the cities the places of amusements are closed on Sunday, including the German theaters.</p>
   <p>The City of Chicago has safeguarded her freedom on Sunday by a special local law. The same was the result of an extraordinary victory at the ballot-box, which the German-Americans in Chicago obtained at the November election in 1873, over the Sunday-tyrants and ignoramuses.</p>
   
   <p>We do not mention the above with the intention of blaming Cincinnati and St. Louis for the loss of their Sunday freedom because they are, indeed, not guilty of desiring compulsory Sunday regulations, but they were forced upon them. Nor do we desire to lull people to sleep in regard to the safety of their Sunday freedom.</p>
   <p>Friends of the blue-laws are here, also tirelessly active, Their mouths and hands have to be carefully watched. We also have to see to it that the few reasonable restrictions of our city's Sunday rules are observed by the liberal-minded majority of our population. We must consider the feelings of others in this respect, so that no reproach shall be upon us for breaking our word in regard to this matter. Such an attitude only can safeguard Chicago's freedom in a puritanical desert.</p>
