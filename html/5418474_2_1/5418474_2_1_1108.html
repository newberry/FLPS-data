   <p>The Tribune tells the committee of seventy, that it cannot expect success with its uncompromising fanatical program. Unless it is liberalized, the government of the city will fall into the hands of the Hesing O'Hara rabble. Yes, German citizens! You who come last Saturday from all parts of the city to manifest your political opinions in a decent and dignified manner are called a rabble. The 10,000 citizens, who assembled this evening, were drunkards and saloon bummers. Thus speaks the Tribune and appeals to prominent Germans against the rabble. The prominent Germans according to the Tribune are: George Schneider, Ernst Prussing, Julius Rosenthal, Franz Lackner, Louis Wahl, Friedrich <span class="gap">[gap]</span>nn, Dr. Ernst Schmidt, Edmund Jussen, and many others of the same character, who have no desire to associate with saloon bummers. With those prominent men the committee of seventy should go hand in hand. It would get their support if it drops its oppostion against beer, not otherwise. How far the Tribune is justified in its last statement we will not discuss just now. We do not believe that Mr. Rosenthal and Mr. Wahl would give their support to the committee of seventy under this condition. E. Jussen has so frequently betrayed the motive of his opinions, that his name is without any influence. George Schneider has been riding, for a long time, his hobby-horse which is the union of the Germans with the liberal Americans. Such a principle has been advocated by many Germans for a long time. The trouble is, that the Americans have never cared for it. The liberal American who is recommended to the Germans as an ally is a will o' the wisp, a mirage. We have known quite a few of them. They will shake hands with a German and only after having looked about, whisper to him, "You know, I have always sympathised with you. D--n the Puritans." But when it comes to showing their colors openly they cannot be found. Medill was a model of such a liberal American.</p>
