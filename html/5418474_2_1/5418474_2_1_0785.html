   <p>The attempts that are being made for some time to create dissension in the ranks of the Republican Party in Chicago,-- to drive a wedge between the German Republicans and the American Republicans- are in themain nothing but a Democratic manoeuvre, a preparation of the arena for the electoral battle next fall in the Democratic interest.</p>
   <p>That the question of the Sunday Ordinance has been brought in the City Council in the form of definite motions by adherents and opponents is just what Sheridan &amp; Company wanted. (Chief of Police Sheridan, a leading temperance advocate and a Democrat, came into office in 1869 thanks to a s plit in the Republican party in Chicago.) Sheridan expects that when it comes to a vote, some of the Republican Alderman will vote for, some against the application of the Sunday Prohibition, and that in this way a rift will arise in the Republican ranks which will give the victory in November to the Democrats.</p>

   <p>The Democracy will present itself to the Germans during the campaign as the liberal party, Sheridan will be kept hidden (like the monster in the snuff-box) and all the innkeepers will be attracted to the Democratic banners with the most wonderful promises. That these promises are not kept- to that Sheridan himself will look after the election.</p>
   <p>The interest of the Republican Party in Chicago demands that this question is not given an artificial urgency. At the moment when under the impress of the German parade, the Republican N. Y. Times writes; The Republican party of New York should break entirely with the radical temperance faction and should reorganize under the program of forming a strong German wing.' in that moment it would be the heights of foolishness on the side of Chicago Republicans to push the question into the front of the stage and so possibly to endanger the success of the Republican ticket. We dont see why, for no other reason than to do the Democrats a favor, the Republicans should suddenly start pulling each other's hair and about this Sunday question that is only artificially made into a question and immediately ceases to be one when one stops to pay in any attention and instead leaves it all to the police commissioners among whom Sheridan is in the minority.</p>
