   <p>Yesterday the Associated Societies for local self-Government requested the Governor to veto the new "snoop" law, which legalizes the search of private homes and the seizure of spirituous liquors. The Societies declare that this law is imprudent, that it goes too far. They appeal to the Governor in the interest of personal liberty, peace and quietude. The appeal bears the signatures of President [John] Roehling, Secretary [Anton] Cermak, and A. D. Weiner, Chairman of the Board on Political activity.</p>
   <p>The Society also forwarded to the members of the City Council a protest against the plan of the Health Commissioner to prohibit smoking on street cars and elevated trains.</p>
