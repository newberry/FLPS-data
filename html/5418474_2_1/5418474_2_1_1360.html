   <p>Accidents on the Railroads, particularly collisions are not always caused by the carelessness of the employees, the bad quality of material or the raging elements of nature.</p>
   <p>It is no secret, that train conductors are forced to excessive speed by unforeseen loss of time, in order to make up on their time schedule. The ever louder cry"Faster, still faster" of the Public and Railroad Management combined,is tempting the train employees to disregard the safety of passengers by ignoring any precautionary measures.</p>
   <p>Man's ambition of course, always has been to increase the speed of any vehicle of transportation, no matter, whether it was meant for oxencarts, horsebuggies of steam engines. But the human mind must be trained towards a better understanding of material capacity and subsequent logical speed of motion. If this cannot be done, accidents and catastrophes will be the natural consequences.</p>
