   <p>Elmer Washburn reported to comtroller Knox in Washington on the Adminstration of Public Revenues of the German National Bank. The report is extensive and contains the exact history of the bank. For the greater part, the report is similar to that prepared by the late Mr. Weber and reads: "The management of the Greenebaum Bank was not correct or trustworthy; therefore it is expected that the Federal Government will start criminal proceedings against Henry Greenebaum. If this should not take place, the Congress will be asked to conduct an investigation of the management of the bank, and the persons responsible for criminal neglect of duty should be brought to court."</p>
