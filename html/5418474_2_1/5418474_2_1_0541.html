   <p>The Executive Committee of the German Citizens League and some gentlemen who interest themselves in the same goals, held a meeting yesterday under the chairmanship of Mr. Wm. Rapp, in which the following motion by Mr. John Koelling was adopted to arrange a mass demonstration against the restrictions that were imposed on Club festivities by the City Administration, and to invite to it all German organizations. A Committee was entrusted with the selection of a large hall, like the Auditorium. Tomorrow afternoon there will be held another meeting in Mr. Rapp's office for the purpose of arranging a program and calling upon German citizens.</p>
   <p>In an understanding with the West side Liquor Men's Association, Mr. Julius Frank of the firm of Frank Brothers, Madison and Halsted, requested Judge Holsom to issue an injunction which the municipal authorities shall be prevented from forcing the closing hours as menacing the existence of many business people. The motion questions the constitutional right of the decree. Members of that Restaurant Owners Organization protest against being classed with the owners of Dance Hall Saloons.</p>
