   <p>The following contribution for the next number of the Temperance-Monthly reached Manager Kelly yesterday and appears, today, written in English translation in the Times.</p>
   <p>One of the worst manifestations of German journalism, in our city, is the position the German press takes in regard to the new temperance law; its siding with the tavern keeper, as in the case of Mr. Heim on the North Side, who made him-self guilty of the most elementary transgressions and was sentenced accordingly is made a martyr of liberty. The accuser and his witnesses are attacked editorially on their private and their business character. Judge, jury and prosecuting attorney are attacked. Even a deadlock in the jury is considered a victory.</p>
