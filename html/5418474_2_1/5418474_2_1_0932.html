   <p>Otto Mayer and his family were given permission today by Judge Kickham Scanlon to abandon their respected name, the name of Otto's good parents, and to call themselves Mayor from now on. Emma E. Gutman, probably Gutmann originally, will henceforth call herself Goodman.</p>
   <p>Berta Griesheimer and her son Edwin are going to change over to Gresham. The woman was born in Princeton, Illinois, her 34-year-old son, in Chicago. Joseph G. Schuman, son of the old Wisconsin settler, Schumann, also has been given permission to mutilate his name to Shuman.</p>
