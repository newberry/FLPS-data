   <p>The following report comes from Washington: "Thirty-six states, the required three fourths, have notified the Department of State that they have ratified the Prohibition Amendment to the National Constitution. It has therefore been ordered that a proclamation be drawn up by which the public may be informed of the acceptance of the Amendment.</p>
   <p>"It is expected that the proclamation will be issued within a few days. The officials concerned expect to date it as of January 16, since they interpret the law to mean that the Amendment is to be effective one year after its ratification by the thirty-sixth state (Nebraska)."</p>
   <p>Apparently it has been done. It seems as though prohibition has gained a complete victory. Apparently the Constitution of the United States has been changed from a stronghold of liberty and a protection for minorities against tyrannical violence on the part of majorities to a flexible instrument for suppressing the liberties and rights of citizens and for oppressing even the majorities, the mass of the people, by well-organized, domineering, and unscrupulous minorities.</p>
   <p>So it seems that the entire foundation of our government has been demolished, that an altogether new, intolerant, unjust, and undemocratic spirit has taken hold of the reins of authority; in short, that our democratic republic has been abandoned to the terrorism of some self-centered cliques that have united in order to satisfy their lust for power.</p>
   <p>so it appears to us. If one speaks about this matter to the average American--the "native" American, who would consider it an insult if any one should express the least doubt concerning his democratic attitude and his deep reverence for the Constitution and the form of government of our country--he would make a laughing remark about "seeing ghosts" and ask how in the world anybody could entertain such crazy notions. He would say that prohibition perhaps would not produce the expected results; that it might not be possible strictly to enforce it, that it might be productive of more evil than good; that it would then be in order to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment, and the experience gained from the attempt to enforce the law could be used as a basis for rules under which the future manufacture and sale of alcoholic liquors (or certain alcoholic liquors) would be made legal, and thus a return of the old evils which caused the clamor for prohibition could be prevented. That is the answer nine out of ten would give when questioned on the subject, for the mass of our people does not yet know what an amendment to the Constitution is; does not know that it will be impossible not only for the present, but also for future generations, to bring about a repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment after it has been written into the Constitution; and the greet mass of our citizens does not know--has not the least idea of--the violence to which it has been exposed through the Prohibition Amendment and the manner in which the resolution to amend the Constitution was passed in Congress, and the way by which the Amendment was ratified by the various states.</p>
   <p>Why not? Because the average American has hardly read the Constitution, and if he has read it, he has given it little or no serious thought; because the average American does not know the Constitution. And he does not know it, has not read it, much less given it serious consideration, because he has always had the liberty which the Constitution guarantees, and because there was no enemy visible who would dare to attack this liberty or broadcast his intention to attack the liberty of the American people. In this respect the Prohibitionists are the antipodes of the Imperial German Government. While the latter aroused the American people through the famous Zimmermann letter, in which it threatened to do things which it never could have done, and very likely did not want to do, the Prohibitionists were very careful not to reveal their plans until it was time to execute them. They pretended to be friends and protectors of the people, whereas they were bent upon curtailing the people's freedom and depriving the Constitution of its spirit and value.</p>
   <p>Americans had no idea of what was happening to them, and even today they are still ignorant of the grave consequences which may result from the Eighteenth Amendment. And even if they were aware of the consequences, they could do nothing. Now we have but one hope--that the United States Supreme Court will declare the Eighteenth Amendment unconstitutional. If it does not--well, in that case there is hope in the fact that the masses in our country had no inkling of the importance of what has happened, and that the masses will remedy the matter when they "see the light," for "where there is a will, there is a way". That is an American proverb, and there can be no doubt that Americans have always shown a will to preserve their liberty.</p>
   <p>Prohibition will not ruin the country, but it will be very difficult to ward off its evil effects. Constant vigilance must be exercised so that further damage may be averted. The policies to be pursued henceforth will challenge the best in our best citizens.</p>
