   <p>The City Council declined yesterday, with 37 against 27 votes, to close saloons and stores on Sundays. The Council furthermore decided not to leave the toleration of any saloon to the neighborhood-vote.</p>
   <p>Herewith, the liberal elements of our city's administration was a victory, which will be a blow to the backward efforts of small-minded temperance-fanatics.</p>
