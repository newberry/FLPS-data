   <p>The German-American press, which according to a general rule excludes mingling in ecclesiastical affairs, can scarcely be expected to adhere to its policy, since the battle waged by the German-American church members, defending their German rights within the church, is of utmost importance. The fight of the German Catholics of this country is especially significant, which fact prompted us on previous occasions to discuss the squabbles in Oklahoma.</p>
   <p>Observations have been made for sometime past that Oklahoma's Catholic Bishop Meerschaert has developed an enmity towards his German co-religionists despite the fact that he is by birth and by blood closely related to them. In a letter addressed to German Catholic communities in his diocese, the bishop warns the people against further agitation directed against his person by threats of denial of the sacrament to one and to all. However, agitation against his person--according to the circular--is really a protest by the majority of Oklahoma's German Catholic population against the suppression of the German language as well as German customs. The German Catholic communities are denied the privilege of a German priest, or at any rate, a German speaking spiritual adviser. The German instruction in parochial schools in Catholic communities has also been seriously impaired.</p>
   <p>The German Catholics of Oklahoma well deserve the plaudits of their German co-religionists, in which the German-American public heartily joins, for showing their determined stand against this perfidious suppression. They, who have thrived for an important role in the splendid development of Oklahoma's territory, are encountering the opposition of their own Catholic bishop, himself an immigrant from Pomerania, making serious threats. To discourage the Oklahomans, in our opinion is not very likely.....</p>
   <p>We hope that the threatened German Catholics of that state will find, through their spokesmen in Rome, the necessary protection against the brutal bishop, the outspoken enemy of Germanism.</p>
