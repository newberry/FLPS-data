   <p>The last edition of the "Forum" is bringing an interesting editorial concerning the punishment of crimes and the destruction of dangerous enemies of human society.</p>
   <p>The said editorial is leaving out deliberately the main argument on crime-its causes and reasons.</p>
   <p>Crime always have been, since man existed, and crime probably never will be wiped out entirely. But crime can be decreased to an endurable minimum if the root of crime is eliminated thoroughly.</p>
   <p>As a rule, all children of this world, going through schools and with the same advices of parents, are getting the same chance to forge ahead and become useful members of the community. There is no doubt, that every child, often leaving school, will enter the danger period of life. It is then, when strict supervision from parents should guide the younster along.</p>

   <p>Then also, the community, should add a generous share of free instruction and plenty of working opportunities. All this combined, will make our young generation and keep the dangers of crime down, regardless of surroundings, inheritance haunt and temptation.</p>
