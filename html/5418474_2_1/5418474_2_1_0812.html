   <p>The campaign for uniform divorce laws for all states, which has been in progress for some time, is now being conducted with greater energy, and a large number of local reform organizations have, within the last few weeks, decided that this movement should be furthered and supported.</p>

   <p>Cook County, Illinois has in Judge Joseph Sabath of the local Superior Court a cadi [this word is used in the original text] who, during his term in office, has granted more divorces than any other judge in the entire country. He can also claim the more or less beautiful glory (schoener Ruhm) that on the average more divorces are sought and granted in his jurisdiction than in any other county of the nation.</p>
   <p>It is revealed by the figures compiled by the organizations mentioned that, with one exception, twice as many divorces are granted in Cook County than in any other county of any other state. The exception is Wayne County, Michigan, to which the city of Detroit belongs.....</p>
