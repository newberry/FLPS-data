   <p>Judge Joseph B. David, addressing the Bar Association, spurred on to renewed efforts the movement for the abatement of the evils of Prohibition. In emphatic tones, he declared: "If we stop and analyse the injustice of Prohibition, and the subsequent abrogation of our rights, it must be clear that absolute monarchs seem to be the personification of tolerance and liberty when compared to the officials enforcing the Eighteenth Amendment."</p>
   <p>He then cited the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution which provides protection against unjust search and seizure. The speaker added that Prohibition agents are especially guilty of disregarding this amendment, although their actions lead all too frequently to actual fist fights, destruction of private property, and even cold-blooded murder.</p>
   <p>Judge David also informed the legal profession of the practice of transferring <span class="page-break">2</span>suits against Prohibition agents to Federal courts, where acquittal is in most cases certain. He continued: "In such instances the instruction received by the jury does not permit of an alternative. The prosecuted prohibition official is rarely--if ever--convicted by Federal courts. This state of affairs calls for speedy progress toward the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment."</p>
