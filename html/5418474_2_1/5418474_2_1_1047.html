   <p>A strange assertion published in your valued paper on the 16th of this month prompts me to reply, as that statement profoundly affected hundreds of our citizens. It is in regard to one sentence of Mr. Schlesinger's article "Jew-baiting", wherein he claims... and if the immigration of Russian-Polish Jews does not appear desirable to it, The Illinois Staats Zeitung then it only expresses the sentiment of many Jews. etc.</p>
   <p>Being a German publication, it maybe conceded that the Staats Zeitung considers the immigration of Russian-Polish Jews, as well as those of Slovakia, Bohemia, Italy and other European nationalities as undesirable from its own standpoint, but how does Mr. Schlesinger know so positively, that these claims coincide with the views of so many Jews? After all he probably is not a Jew otherwise how could he make such an allegation?</p>
   <p>I am a Russian Jew., but that fact (Verbatim: circumstance) does not prevent from recognizing the mental and physical superiority of the German Jews (which have settled in the United States for more than a century) in comparison to the recently immigrated Russian-Polish Jews.I cordially accept their expressions of pride, which prompts them to feel superior to us, but I respect <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>my German compartriots too much, to assign to then the narrow-mindedness which Mr. Schlesinger professes.</p>
