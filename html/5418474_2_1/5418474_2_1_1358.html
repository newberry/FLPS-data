   <p>The Gold Reserves in the Federal Treasury at present ate 120 million Dollars, of which 100 Millions must be held back to cover the value of issued Greenbacks. There are consequently only 20 Million Dollars on hand for general expense-purposes.</p>
   <p>We cannot see what profit the Silver-idealist Morgan can derive from this situation, created entirely by the silver-folly. The Government so far has lost during its silver-buying about 12 Million Dollars, which want into the pockets of the Silver Kings. Silver notes are accumulating in the treasury, while the stock of Gold is dwindling. We think, it is high time, to suspend or cancel the unjust and senseless Sherman-Silver-Law.</p>
