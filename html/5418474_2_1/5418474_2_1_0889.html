   <p>To honor Professor James T. Hatfield, the director of the German department of Northwestern University, who celebrates his seventieth birthday in the next few days, the German society of the University will arrange a theatrical evening. Ther performance will be held in the Annie Mae Swift-Hall. Two comedies are to be staged, namely: "The Button," by Julius Rosen, and "An American Duel," by Gustave Von Moser.</p>
   <p>The direction of the theatrical evening lies in the hands of Professor Dr. A. J. F. Zeiglschund.</p>
   <p>Prof. Hatfield had been the director of the German department of Northwestern University for forty-two years. It is to be hoped that many German-Americans will come and participate in this evening arranged in his honor, also such as have no direct connections with the Almer Mater in Evanston.</p>
   <p>Mention should be made of the fact that only students of the University will participate in the performance.</p>
