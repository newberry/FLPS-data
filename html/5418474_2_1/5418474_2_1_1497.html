   <p>In its fight against recognition of the closed shop principle, advocated by unions, the Chicago Master Cleaners and Dyers Association resolved to close its establishments tomorrow evening. This resolution affects 2,500 union workers. All together, 40,000 men and women connected with the industry will be unemployed.</p>
   <p>J. L. Friedmann, president of the Employers Association, declared that all plants will be closed until the employees return from their own accord. His organization will not recognize nor deal with unions.</p>

   <p>Employers admitted this to be a retaliatory measure against a recently planned measure of union officials, whereby the latter intended to compete with the established houses. One of these union officials is Ben A. Abrams, 934 Winona Avenue, president of the Cleaners, Dyers and Pressers Union. It is said that he is interested in an enterprise that will be opened at Diversey Parkway and Tripp Avenue. According to Friedmann, Abrams owns the plant, the capital for which, one million dollars, was extorted from workers and small cleaning shops through terrorism and intimidation.</p>
   <p>Friedmann declares that only two establishments shall remain open, the Morris Becker concern, which enjoys the protection of Capone, and the Central Cleaners and Dyers, supposedly defended by the Moran gang.</p>
