   <p>That the Americans are at long last adopting a reasonable attitude toward Sunday observance may be deduced from the Evening Journal, which is undoubtedly the mouthpiece of the local faction. We quote from the article:</p>
   <p>"An attempt was made several years ago to enforce the Sunday closing laws in this City and proved a failure. Thereupon the candidates of the "Peoples Ticket" (a party organized by the opponents of the Sunday movement) were elected by a majority of ten thousand votes.....However.....parades and.....noise inevitably connected therewith should not be permitted during the hours when church services are held....</p>
   <p>"If Mayor Harrison will enforce the Sunday laws in this manner he will find no opposition among the Germans."</p>
