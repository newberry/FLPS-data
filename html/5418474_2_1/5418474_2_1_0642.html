   <p>The owners of Lincoln Pavilion on North Clark Street can congratulate themselves over the victory they have won over their bad neighbors, Louis Schaffner and Consorts. After an interview with the owners of Lincoln Pavilion, Mr. Schwengel and several others conversant with the facts of the case, the mayor yesterday gave permission that in both localities as previously up to 10:30, concerts may be held on condition that they do not take place in both localities at the same time. If concerts take place the same evening in both places, one orchestra must stop whilst the other one is playing; similarly with dance entertainments, which so far only have taken place in Miller's Garden. No announcement of dances should be given by a public announcer.</p>
