   <p>Due to the underhanded work of a minority the United States will have to concern itself with the regulation of liquor consumption in line with the Eighteenth Amendment, at a time when the Nation's faculties, man power, and resources are strained to the utmost by the requirements of reconstruction, which has just gotten under way. To what extent the radical changes which are contingent upon the enforcement of the Prohibition Amendment will affect the country's capacity for work, or its power of arms, or to what degree the transformation of the life and habits of the American people and the destruction of great economic values and sources of income will weaken commerce and industry, can only be conjectured at present. However, it is certain that the losses will not be small.</p>
   <p>Since the effects of National Prohibition are so uncertain, one would think <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that the professional reformers of the country's morals would take a rest. But the fact is that their seeming victory over the demon run has encouraged them to seek other fields for their pleasure--destroying activity. And they have chosen tobacco for the object of their next battle. The use of tobacco affords some people pleasure--so away with it! The tobacco industry is well organized; manufacturers, dealers, and employees apparently are making a good living and seem to be satisfied. That condition is intolerable! Men who are irritable or worried are often pacified or cheered by a smoke. One cannot defend that from an ethical viewpoint. So away with tobacco!</p>
   <p>Our missionaries have found a way to protect China against the results of the use of pernicious opium. It is high time that they come home to the United States and take up the fight against tea and coffee, which undermine the nervous systems of millions of people. These poisonous drinks make weaklings and criminals of children, but enable men and women more readily to withstand cold and best and to remain awake unnaturally long. Theatrical plays and moving pictures in which people are shown enjoying tea or coffee should be <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>prohibited as tempting to evil. It is absolutely necessary to enact a law against the importation of coffee beans and tea leaves--the moral welfare of the nation demands it!</p>
   <p>However, not only are liquors abused, but also edibles. And as a result there is much sickness. Animals find comfort in their meals, but man should be far superior to animals. He should eat only to live. Eating should not be a "spice of life" to him. The more common his food the better his health. Seasoned foods induce us to eat more than is necessary. Ketchup should, therefore, be classified as a poison, and anyone who offers us mustard should be put in prison. A similar condition obtains in regard to clothing. Our long-haired brothers and our short-haired sisters who are flat-footed and proudly tread the paths of virtue should no longer be relegated to the shadows by those creatures who go about in high heels and the latest styles of dress. Since the regulation of our neighbor's way of living has become a preferred activity of zealous reformers, it should not be difficult to assemble a "universal" suit of clothing and force everybody to wear it.</p>

   <p>There are people who can enjoy works of art without paying any attention to objectionable nudity; others visit theatres, in which problem plays are presented which professional reformers never see; others, again, listen with pleasure to musical selections which have no semblance to hymns, while a great number of our citizens enjoy seeing a baseball game or other forms of athletic exercise. But all these sources of amusement and happiness will soon be taboo, if the American people continue in their apathy toward the small clique which is intent upon the suppression of all pleasure. The victory of the national prohibitionists proves that, in other countries as well as in America, it is too late to lock the barn door after the horse has been stolen.</p>
