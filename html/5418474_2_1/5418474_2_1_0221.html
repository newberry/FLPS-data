   <p>The Anti-Saloon League responded to the onslaught of the wet citizens upon the Volstead act with the announcement that it intends to accumulate an enormous campaign fund. Of course, the money is supposed to be used to combat the opponents of prohibition. It thus serves a good purpose, from the standpoint of the dry idealists. But when looked at in broad daylight the purpose is totally different.</p>
   <p>The combat for dry legislation is naturally conducted by the Anti-Saloon League, which proves nothing but that the brave combatants of the League are paid out of those funds. In the first place, the funds must be raised and this involves considerable expense. For the valiant ladies and gentlemen who are active in the League must be expert speakers; these persons generally want to be well paid for their services.</p>

   <p>This is the reason why a considerable part of the fund will remain sticking to their fingers. But it is hoped that the chiefs of the League will not go empty-handed. According to the fifty-fifty system (sic), so popular in these circles, they will share the commission of these oratorial experts. For this purpose it is advisable to make the entries into the books with caution. The good shepherd of souls and superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League, William H. Anderson, has been somewhat forgetful in these matters. Thus the "double entry" system was evolved in his bookkeeping, and Mr. Anderson was given the opportunity to contemplate, for a long time, the technical difficulties of the system in the state prison of Sing Sing.</p>
   <p>There is an old adage which says, "The pen is mightier than the sword!" It behooves us, therefore, to put the pen into the service of the dry cause. And where could you buy stronger and more convincing little tracts than at the American Issue Publishing Company, in Westerville, Ohio? It provides the literature for the dry campaigns in the entire country. Its owners are the heads of the Anti-Saloon League, and so the League <span class="page-break">\3</span>buys all these little tracts from itself. Since there is no competition to be feared, there is hope that it grants itself a decent price for these exercises in style. This money is likewise spent for a good purpose.</p>
   <p>In such a manner, the campaign can now be started. The roles are given out and all is well. The wealthy business prohibitionists and the great number of all those who die particularily hard supply the war cash, and the Anti-Saloon League is at war. And so the costs of war flow into the pockets of its heads and collaborators. This is the only purpose of their exertion; it is altogether the only real purpose of the Anti-Saloon League.</p>
