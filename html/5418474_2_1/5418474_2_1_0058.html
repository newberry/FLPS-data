   <p>Yesterday the German saloonkeepers of the city met at 23 West Madison Street to elect a delegate to serve on the Anti-Temperance Committee. All the men present were convinced that in view of the peculiar circumstances in which the saloonkeepers of Chicago find themselves today--everyone of them is prey to the whims and arbitrary acts of the police department--it is absolutely necessary to organize to protect their interests.

   <p>After the meeting had been called to order by Mr. Kuper, the chairman, of the Committee, Wilhelm Rintelmann was appointed chairman of the meeting. Wilhelm Schaefer was unanimously elected as a delegate to the Anti-Temperance Committee, and a committee of seven members was chosen to <span class="page-break">2</span>interview all saloonkeepers with reference to organizing an association of saloonkeepers.</p>
