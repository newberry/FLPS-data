   <p>A violent fight took place yesterday in Jones file-kiln between German and Irish working men. As usual, the Irish could not endure the praises the Germans were receiving from their employers for their application and temperance.</p>
   <p>As there were no guns, the fight took place with tiles, spades and clubs. The Irish were finally beaten up and one of their ring leaders, Thos. Leahey, was arrested and later released on the posting of a $500.00 bond.</p>
