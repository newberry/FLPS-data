   <p>America's production capacity demands a market in foreign lands, especially in Europe, but the high tariff walls, erected there, make export extremely difficult and where American products could be sold in spite of high tariffs, invalid reasons are given, as by France and Germany, whereby our meat products are kept out of their country. However, there is one product which escapes every microscopic examination and which can surmount all the tariff barriers.</p>
   <p>Every spring one can see young American girls in company with serious and forward looking mothers at New York and other sea-port cities embarking in steamships to travel across the ocean. They are trying to find their happiness in marriage in other countries. Mothers and daughters are expensively dressed. Many of them have the necessary means to find what they are looking for. The daughter of the American millionaire is seeking a baron, a count, or any man of the nobility; and rarely does she seek in vain. From a merely human standpoint her success is not enviable, because the man she found is "discarded merchandise" which no one in Europe wants, but which is highly esteemed by the "republican <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>minded" American. Those noblemen, who have lost their health and wealth through extravagant living in Europe's metropolises, have no attraction and are worthless for woman of equal rank, but are acceptable and welcomed by the American women, because they have something to offer her, what the American republic can not give - a title of nobility.</p>
   <p>Against such startling stupidity but little can be said. On the contrary, it can only be desirable for our country to get rid of all such elements which have no understanding and appreciation for its free and democratic institutions. Women who possess no other values but money, and men who are devoid of merit, and who obtained their title of nobility by birth, are nothing else but gilded nuts, hollow or decayed inside. No country is made more fortunate or blessed by their presence.</p>
   <p>It is, of course, an entirely different matter when American girls travel to Europe, to hunt for a fortune with their personal charms and powers. This is being done by large numbers and has expanded to such an extent that the press <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>has discussed this matter frequently. The American adventuress is well known in the capital cities of Europe. This affair can add very little to our national reputation and prestige and constitutes a grave danger for the girls themselves. It may happen that such a sophisticated, gambling American captures the son of a rich aristocrat, but in most cases the cheater deceives herself. Such an adventuress will create the impression by her extravagance and luxury that she is wealthy and therefore very desirable. The lords of "Pennyless" admire and court her, but when she pulls in her net she has caught a miserable herring, who has more debts than hairs on his head and whose possessions and mansions are located in the moon.</p>
   <p>The question will undoubtedly arise, are there not sufficient rich young men in this country; why must they be sought in Europe. This can be answered in the negative. In Europe there are more people with personal wealth than in the United States, because the Europeans are more thrifty and economical. The American lives above his income almost exclusively. If he earns $10,000 annually, he spends $11,000. The extravagance of our middle class is the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>cancerous sore of our country. It is high-living which induces the American business man to speculate.</p>
   <p>This destroys his honor and his wealth and forces his daughters to become adventuresses and fortune-hunters in foreign lands. This also explains why the Germans, in the habit of thrift and economy, usually succeed well in this country.</p>
