   <p>In the "Chicago Herald" we find the confession of a woman saying that the American children are often presumptive and precocious. She compares the American methods of training with the English and German and admits freely, that the children in Germany and England are better trained than in the United States, but she also finds excuses for this fact.--</p>

They desire that their own children as well as all the others should be trained by the paid teachers and guided in the path of virtue and moderation by the policemen's club. This is undermining their own influence in home training and they are surprised if they fail in this.</p>
   <p>Concerning the "American" husband it must be said, that they are too eager to leave the care of the children, the management of home and kitchen in the hands of the wife. By earning money they think they have justly met all reasonable demands. It is true that they are very tender often too tender and have</p>
