   <p>It is true that the Prohibitionists have no candidate of their own in the coming election for the Cook County offices because they would not have a chance; nevertheless they are doing their utmost to defeat one of their strongest opponents. In their official organ, Patriotic Flag, and in a bulletin entitled Shall the United Societies be Sheriff of Cook County, they attack Anton J. Cermak, the secretary of the United Societies, who is running for the office of sheriff of Cook County on the Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>"The United Societies are applying for the office of sheriff," the Prohibitionists write in their slanderous article. "Their secretary, Anton J. Cermak, is their candidate. But he is a willing tool in the hands of the booze interests. In every office that Tony has held so far, he has battled and bled for alcohol and has even put his life at stake for it. We don't mean to say that he is no <span class="page-break">\2</span>good; he is just a colorless, unscrupulous servant of booze and immorality.</p>
   <p>"Cermak, obedient to the booze interests, opposed Bill No. 70 in 1911, the adoption of which would have prevented the establishment of taverns within 250 feet of a church or school building. Such a crusade on behalf of 'booze culture' needs no comment.</p>
   <p>"In 1912 Cermak fought against the reorganization of the Police Department and gave the following reasons: 'We (the United Societies) have fought any regulation of the liquor trade except by city ordinances and we are going to fight any measure which, in our estimation, has even the faintest relationship to the Sunday closing law which we all hate.'</p>
   <p>"He made a public threat that the finance committee would be dissolved if saloons were closed, and succeeded in having the clause 'the enforcement of all laws' eliminated. [Translator's note: The foregoing paragraph is a faithful translation. There is no further information available regarding the <span class="page-break">\3</span>"finance committee" or the "clause" referred to.]</p>
   <p>"Do we want a sheriff who is an enemy of our state laws?</p>
   <p>"When the saloons were closed on Sunday and clergymen of all denominations praised this act unanimously, Tony's United Societies put on a demonstration and tried to terrorize the authorities by shamelessly parading around on the Sabbath which they had desecrated for such a long time.</p>
   <p>"In 1906 Cermak's association held a mass meeting in the Armory. At this meeting a demand was made for the renewal of special liquor licenses which Mayor Dunne had previously revoked after a young girl had committed suicide in front of the American Dance Hall on 31st Street.</p>
   <p>"Between June 22, 1906, and May 6, 1918, 56,812 special liquor licenses were issued."</p>
   <p>We quote another paragraph from the pamphlet of the "dry" fanatics:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"The German-American Alliance has worked through the United Societies. An official publication of the United Societies contains a list of 619 organizations of which 301 are German. Let the voters draw their own conclusions about the really genuine Americanism of Cermak, who is secretary of an association which tolerates organizations of this character."</p>
