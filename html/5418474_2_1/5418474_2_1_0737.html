   <p>The German-American, who was recently criticized by us for having had his defense of the Sunday law published in the Times, now sends us the following communication:</p>
   <p>"My dear Editor: Allow me to answer yoour article in which you call me a coward and a hypocrite. You call me a coward because I did not sign my name after an article in the Times. I do not deny that Germany has had outstanding men, but where there is much light there are also many shadows. It must be said that the uneducated German surpasses any other nation in coarseness. I did not sign my name because I did not want to expose myself to the vengeance and brutality of that type of person who is strongly represented in the "Liberty League." I have never claimed to speak in the name of all the Germans, but only in the name of decent German-Americans.</p>
   <p>No one can deny that we have too many saloons in Chicago and that many people have given up an honorable trade to become saloon-keepers, so as to indulge in laziness and often in drunkenness. Generally those saloon-keepers are Germans. When that type of person is exhorted to violate the law and after conviction is represented as a class of martyr, then indeed it is to be hoped
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
that the Germanization of this country will still be postponed for thousands of years. I sign once more - A German-American."</p>
   <p>Our opposition against this German American was based solely on the fact that instead of working among and with the Germans, he had to publish his views in an English newspaper, which is known for its hypocrisy and hatred for the Germans. At some other time we may answer the other accusations made in this letter.</p>
   <p>The Editor.</p>
