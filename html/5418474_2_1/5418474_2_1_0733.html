   <p>The saloon keepers of the North Side have formed an association. The question is, what is the purpose of the 1,500 German saloon keepers? Their constitution does not say a word about it. Does the association intend to force its members to keep open on Sundays? If so, is the association willing to pay the legal fees, etc., of each of its members who is indicted?</p>
   <p>The general closing of all the saloons on Sundays would be without doubt the best means to awaken a common participation of the public in the dispute.</p>
   <p>But the creation of new associations can only bring about a confusion, harmless to the already existing associations. An association for the protection of personal liberty was founded in Cook County one year ago. Even if it did not live up to all the expectations, under the present circumstances, the Personal Liberty League has done all it could.</p>
