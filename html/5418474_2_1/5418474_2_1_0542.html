   <p>The German-Americans stand almost exclusively on the side of reason and justice in the matter of prohibition. It was due to the efforts of Germans that the State of Iowa repealed prohibition in 1894 after it had been in force for 22 years. In some of the cities in the State Mississippi, where the population was predominantly of German descent, prohibition never became a law. An attempt was made during the preceding year by the prohibitionists in the State of Georgia to enforce a general law, forbidding the sale of alcoholic beverages. The House of Representatives carried the Prohibition bill, but it was defeated in the senate.</p>
   <p>It can be said in general that the Prohibition movements in the United States made little progress recently. The people realize more and more that nothing can be accomplished by force. True moderation can be achieved only by thorough education and development of character.</p>
