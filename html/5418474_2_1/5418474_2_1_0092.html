   <p>Negotiations between the committees of the state senate and the house of representatives have progressed to such an extent that a law regulating the sale of alcoholic liquors may soon be enacted. Irrespective of the number of faults it may have, it will at least prevent some Republican members of the house from presenting a new bill, intended to permit the sale of strong alcoholic liquors in packages only. Such a bill would merely have complicated matters, and would not have been passed anyhow. It would also have caused the reopening of "speakeasies".</p>
   <p>After considerable deliberation, the committees agreed to permit the continued use of bars, but only to dispense beer. It is reported that this provision has the consent of the Governor also, so it is expected that it will become law. Undoubtedly, this part of the law is a mistake. It is a half measure which is <span class="page-break">\2</span>a result of our parliamentary system. Where beer is dispensed from the bar, there will always be a bottle of whiskey under the bar. The men who drink whiskey will not permit beer drinkers to deprive them of the pleasure of drinking whiskey while standing.</p>
   <p>We admit that it may be difficult legally to establish the difference between a bar and a lunch counter. Still the bar is clearly characterized by certain appliances that are necessary to dispense and serve beverages. Our legislators should have had enough courage to decide either for or against the bar. If the proposed provision becomes law, the State will have another law which everybody will treat with indifference, excepting a few unscrupulous officials who will use it to force saloonkeepers to pay "hush money".</p>
   <p>The temperate element that follows the Golden Rule and casts the decisive vote against prohibition is undoubtedly in favor of moderation in drinking. It is no easy task to enforce moderation where strong alcoholic drinks are preferred to "light" beverages; this can be done only by way of education, and, as <span class="page-break">\3</span>everybody knows, it requires much time to educate people. If the public could be gradually taught to consume alcoholic liquors with moderation, and to look upon them as a means of recreation and sociability, the objections of the "drys" would soon be of no consequence, and legal restrictions would be unnecessary. Then, perhaps, the time would also come when Americans would find a place in their language for the German word "Gemuetlichkeit".</p>
