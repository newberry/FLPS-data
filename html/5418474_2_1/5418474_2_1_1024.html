   <p>It appears that some of the Americans are becoming aware of the fact, that not all of them know everything from birth on and can later in life accomplish anything they wish. The Chicago Herald in calling attention to the "Grand Exposition" of Chicago-made furniture, admits that the credit for the marvelous development of this industry belongs to "Foreigners" only. Not only are Germans, Scandinavians and French the directors of these firms but are also, besides some English cabinet-makers, the leaders of the technical management. Referring to these industries, the Americans are subordinate workers only.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt about the truth of this statement. However, if the "Herald is of the opinion, that these pitiable conditions can be remedied through the improvement of the public school system and the introduction of training in handicraft, then it is mistaken.</p>

   <p>The best schools can not cure the Americans of the prejudice against manual labor. Every Fourteen year old boy wants to quit school in order to go "in business" and "earn money" for himself. Those who are unable to become lawyers and doctors, at least can become "agents" and "salesmen."</p>
   <p>Although handicrafts and skilled trades are highly praised, yet they are left to the "foreigner."</p>
