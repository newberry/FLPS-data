   <p>It is not our intention to throw cold water on all efforts to enlarge the business of the Gas Company. It is only natural that expanding utility corporations will try to get the Mayor's sanctions towards ambitious goals. If the city-council is kicking and bucking, before signing any agreements in that direction, then you cannot blame their lack of desired cooperation, but charge it up to their distrust and caution, which they acquired during many years of bad experiences concerning deals between city and industries. We all wish an expansion of the modern gas-system and we all cherish thoughts of a cheaper gas.</p>
