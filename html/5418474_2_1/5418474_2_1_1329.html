   <p>The building of most railroads of the country was considered to be, and no doubt was, an exceedingly risky undertaking. That is true not only of the first railroads of the land, but also of the great railroads connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which were built in later days, and through which the great west was opened. Because of the great risks involved, the persons engaged in such enterprises were accorded special advantages and privileges; and they enjoyed absolute freedom in the management of their property and in the operation of their business.</p>
   <p>The "infant" which was considered to be in need of extensive support and careful handling soon developed into a giant who fully utilized the rights and privileges with which he was endowed. The railroads gradually became economic masters in the areas which they were to serve, and they acted as such; where they had once been welcomed as benefactors they were later hated as oppressors and extortioners.</p>
   <p>People remembered their own rights and privileges, and besieged the legislative bodies of the land with demands for adequate protection against the arbitrariness of the railroads. They demanded laws which would make these much-favored corporations provide service that was commensurate with their privileges.</p>
   <p>Thus the railroads became unpopular. And in political circles this unpopularity of the railroads was taken advantage of by candidates for public offices. Politicians gained the good will and the support of many voters by taking a stand against the roads and by advocating radical laws against then. At the same time these proposed radical laws were used as a moans for extorting money from the railroads.</p>
   
   <p>The railroads countered by sending a host of experienced and cunning lawyers, who knew their way around, to the capitals of the various states; and the result was the long, scandalous fight between ambitions, plundering politicians and the railroad lobbies. During this fight many laws were enacted, injudicious laws, contradictory laws, laws which hindered the railroads to some extent, but did not remedy the situation.</p>
   <p>Thus the operation of railroads was made more difficult and, in consequence, the service to the public decreased in quality and increased in price.</p>
   <p>Having learned to depend upon their lobbies against political attack, many railroads practiced conscienceless and pernicious politics for profit, while others fell into the hands of unscrupulous bunglers who enriched themselves by inexcusable financial manipulations and burdened the railroads with a load of debt.</p>
   <p>Thus the dissatisfaction with the railroads grew to ever greater proportions, and thorough measures to remedy the situation were demanded of the National Government. Some even went so far as to demand that the Government take over the railroads and operate them. Then, when war came, and the Government did take over the railroads, because they threatened to break down completely during the winter of 1916-1917, the public at large undoubtedly approved of the step and expected that the temporary operation of the railroads by the Government would become a permanent arrangement and develop into government ownership of the roads.</p>
   <p>However, railroadmen and financiers are strongly opposed to government ownership of railroads, and even in other circles we hear protesting voices. These protests should not be disregarded; they should receive very careful consideration. But all are agreed that the roads should not be permitted to operate under the old system--or rather, lack of system. All demand that the Government control the railroads at least to the extent of co-ordinating the management so that it operates as a unified entity. The only question is, how can this be done?</p>
   <p>The first director of railroads, Mr. William G. McAdoo, recommended that government operation of railroads be continued for five years after the declaration of peace. This recommendation is gaining favor in ever wider circles, and it certainly merits the approval of the general public, for there is very little which can be said against it. Though the operation of the railroads by the Government is not entirely satisfactory, it cannot be denied that in many respects it is preferable to operation by private corporations. Improvements should be made through centralization and simplification. Such a change is not possible under private operation because of the diversity of opinions and interests prevalent among the many private operators.</p>
   <p>To effect the necessary changes would require considerable time. According to the best-informed sources adequate centralization and simplification could not be brought about in less than five years. Common sense dictates that this period of time be granted. And, if a unified and efficient railroad system is achieved through control and operation by the Government, then it is of little importance whether the system comes into the possession of the Government, or is returned to private ownership, or remains under the supervision and control of the Government. Good service, free of scandal and danger, is more important than any other consideration.</p>
