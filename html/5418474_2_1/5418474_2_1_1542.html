   <p>Collapse and Reconstruction</p>
   <p>"The change from one social system to another has never been accomplished in one jump, by one single test of strength alone. Political revolutions are rather the result of a slow, economic evolution of which the revolution it self is only the culmination."</p>
   <p>Since the revolution in Germany was to be artificially created by outside pressure, diplomatic circles were confident that the economic power of the nation could be smashed in such manner that reconstruction from the chaos <span class="page-break">\2</span>would be virtually impossible.</p>
   <p>The things that were left undone[for this purpose]and which one forgot to consider in the Entente countries, we will not discuss here. However, at the time the German system of workers' representation was introduced in the plants of the "International Harvester Company"--some high officials of which were also members of the board of directors of the Steel Trust--it was mentioned, among other things, that the almost inexhaustible efficiency of the German workers during the war caused one of the parlor socialists of the McCormick tribe (the fortune of this family is invested in this giant concern) to search more closely for the source of this energy.</p>
   <p>From a speech made at a meeting of factory department heads in Chicago by one of the plant managers who had returned from Russia some months ago, we have learned quite a number of interesting facts. We can frankly say that realization seems to be dawning among the more progressive heads of industry <span class="page-break">\3</span>in this country that only by introducing and adopting the best methods which have resulted from the revolutionary processes in Europe can a wild and reckless unrest be checked in this country; apparently they have discovered that reconstruction can only begin through co-operation with the great masses of workers who will no longer be led around by the nose by unscrupulous agitators.</p>
   <p>Government by anti-espionage legislation and violence is too expensive, and the results are so questionable that even the experts may become afraid of the spirits which they have raised up.</p>
   <p>This country needs peace and order even more than the countries of Europe. High-sounding phrases and promises have had a portentous influence in the life of the people, and the masses will not be fooled any longer. The political breach of trust has caused resentment; the confidence of the people is shaken, and not least the confidence of the American people. That they had <span class="page-break">\4</span>confidence, that they gave all their strength and all their sentiment, believing in promises; that they have had a painful awakening and are now in a rebellious mood is absolute proof that, in spite of all the superficial paradoxes in their behavior, there is inherent in the people a great, noble, and wholesome virtue, a sense of justice, a desire for fair play. Under their superficialities we can discern the profound human desire to bring those forces into play which will forestall a collapse--for that really is the state of the nation--and to tackle the job of reconstruction all the way down the line.</p>
   <p>If the collapse should turn out to be a direct consequence of a deliberate deception, the people and the masses of workers cannot be expected to trust those who have been guilty of this gross misrepresentation. In this statement we do not refer so much to the President of the country but rather to those who were his advisers. When Theodore Roosevelt was President he was fortunate in that he was surrounded by men who were full of constructive <span class="page-break">\5</span>ideas--and many of them still enjoy the implicit confidence of a great number of people, even if some of them have recently joined the Socialist camp. But the Socialist advisers of President Wilson like Spargo, Walling, and Russell, and those from the roster of the high command of "business agents," like Gompers, Tobin, Johnson, and others, may for years keep running around from one "industrial conference" to another and may talk the world dizzy with beautiful, melodramatic phrases for all the attention they will get from the people. They are distinguished only as advocates of selfishness, and at best they become partners to conspiracies of the kind the brothers McNamara once concocted.</p>
   <p>Confidence in the declarations proclaiming human rights, which this country spread all over the world, brought about the huge catastrophe which has engulfed Europe. It was hoped that after a political revolution, the economic collapse of the central European countries would follow in its wake; only recently does one realize that empty promises will not guarantee prosperity <span class="page-break">\6</span>for the American people and that the unrest of the masses may easily prevent the desired opportunity to inaugurate a golden era on Europe's ruins. The hoped-for economic collapse of Germany will not take place because the working class has cast off the spell of deception. And since the struggle for world markets will go on without a letup, American industry would do well to make preparations to remain in competition. If we consider that in the end competition will always act as a stabilizer, even corrupt agreements--as for instance the one between the milk wagon drivers and the dairy bosses--and resorting to a strike accompanied by violence, and carried out according to a preconceived scheme, will not be able in the long run to prevent the establishment of normal conditions. First we have to analyze the fallacy of calculations which were based on faulty premises.</p>
   <p>The Fourteen Points, which embodied the main objectives of this country upon entering the war, became the driving power for tremendous ideological and spiritual upheavals. They were taken from the familiar vocabulary of workers and from Socialist congresses and therefore were destined to have a strong <span class="page-break">\7</span>emotional appeal for millions of people on either side of the battlefield. They were not the brain children of one man alone. They were the combined products of careful deliberations of manual workers on one hand and great intellectual minds on the other. They reflected the hopes of countless millions of people, and, last but not least, they expressed in coherent form the tremendous mental work, the creative organizing talent of the progressive and educated German working class and of the majority of the German people.</p>
   <p>Mankind cannot be blamed for having trusted a country of over one hundred million people, which attempted to give active support to a socialistic set of theories by throwing lives and fortunes into the scales of fate. But it was German money, the pennies of the workers, which made the Fourteen Points intelligible to all thinking people all over the world.</p>
   <p>The German people could have maintained their own economic position, their <span class="page-break">\8</span>struggle against all obstacles, toward a loftier cultural level only if they could have brought all humanity--even the savage and the semi-civilized--within the scope of their civilizing influence, made them aware of the concepts of human dignity, and helped them find their way--bloody from the thorns on the path but nevertheless jubilant--toward the sun, instead of cringing with fear in the dark.</p>
   <p>"We who are not Germans are eternally grateful to those who, through their mental efforts, have shown us life's noblest objective, namely, to make the whole world a garden of peace and prosperity for all."</p>
   <p>The enormous sums of money for the gigantic struggle to put the relations between capital and labor in Denmark on a modern basis were furnished solely by German workers. And Denmark today has the best organized labor protection system in the world. During the general strike in Sweden, another test of strength which seemed to be absolutely necessary, the German people raised millions of marks, as compared with a measly forty thousand dollars from this <span class="page-break">\9</span>country and eighty two thousand francs from France.</p>
   <p>During the general strike in Belgium, when liberal-minded industrialists closed their factories in order to stop the unfair competition of the clerical enterprises and the government behind them, millions of marks were immediately provided by German workers to help the Belgian people gain a greater measure of control over their own destinies.</p>
   <p>We who, years ago, received from France the "boon" of terroristic syndicalism, as well as criminal sabotage practiced by men like Foster and others, advocates of an economic doctrine based on disgraceful moral standards--we are liable to forget that two years before the outbreak of the War Gustav Herve, now the archenemy of the German workers, expressed his personal gratitude to the German workers because the newspaper Humanite, of which he was assistant editor, was kept going only by their contributions. Herve was on a visit to Berlin when he made this acknowledgment.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>And we who have watched Samuel Gompers get his start with the financial aid of German political refugees see in him now the caricature of a workers' representative before the "industrial congress;" and we think sadly of the time we emptied our pockets; when, encouraged by contributions from Germany, we raised hundreds and thousands of dollars for the establishment of daily papers printed in English. But of course the A. M. Simons's, the Spargos, the Edward Russells, as highly paid editors, accepted the money contributed by the "stupid[German]Michel"--the same fellows who now, in spite of President Wilson's frank statement that nothing but commercial and economic rivalry had caused the war, are still asking for the complete pauperization of the German people and the German workers whose hard-earned pennies they had once pocketed.</p>
   <p>Indeed, only because of the pioneer work of intellectual enlightenment which Germany has promoted with the aid of her people could a keen conception of the fourteen peace points be conveyed to all the peoples. When the demand <span class="page-break">\11</span>of the Socialist representative, Meyer London, that a congress of all neutral nations be called to Washington made the question of justice and reconciliation an acute one, we notice that during the proceedings, beginning on February 24, 1916, the representatives of all nations--and above all Morris Hillquit--formulated and interpreted the Fourteen Points and declared them to be the basis for a League of Nations (H. J. Res. 38, House of Representatives, Sixty-fourth Congress, first session).</p>
   <p>He repeat, the General breach of trust has won followers for those elements who thrive by disseminations subversive propaganda.. Only a frank discussion and brings to the fore those which the people can trust to adjust and reconstruct economic life.</p>
