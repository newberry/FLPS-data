   <p>Some time ago there were only two gas companies in Chicago. In the beginning they were competitors but soon they found it more profitable to divide the territory of the city between themselves; they were the Chicago Gaslight and Coke Company and the People's Gaslight Company. Because of the colossal profits they made, certain capitalists became envious and requested of the City Council the right to lay their own pipes for gas, pretending to furnish better and cheaper gas for consumers. The city granted permission and the Consumers and afterwards, the Equitable Gas Company came into existence.</p>
   <p>After the new companies had carried on for some time and had torn up several miles of streets, they discovered that the war of competition was more expensive than an amicable settlement, which of course, was planned originally. They organized a gas trust, which permitted the various companies to retain an apparently independent existence and which paid a total of $18,000,000,00 for the various properties. The trust raised this money by a bond issue. It then sold $25,000,000.00 worth of stock, of which the trust received a large share for its organizing efforts. By increasing the price of gas, even this excessively watered capital earned a five percent dividend. The price of the stook increased <span class="page-break">2</span>rapidly and sold like hot cakes. The trust made a profit of $7,000,000,00.</p>
   <p>After this was accomplished, opposition arose against this exploitation and the gas trust was declared illegal. However, the gas companies were able to overcome this, and continued to profit under another arrangement. Its business became so lucrative that still other capitalists desired to participate in the profits. In fact, they were the same financiers who previously had made $7,000,000; but they were not satisfied and wanted more. They took this matter up in conjunction with anewly organized company which had tried in vain to secure a franchise from the City Hall. Either they did not know how to proceed, or their request lacked the necessary pecuniary emphasis. The final result however was that the Economic Gas Light and Fuel Company received permission to tear up the streets of Chicago and to lay pipes and to furnish gas at $1.00 per 1000 cubic feet, natural gas at fifty-five cents and gas for heating purposes at forty-five cents.</p>
   <p>As soon as it had the license in its possession they began to negotiate with the old gas company to sell out. The gas trust felt secure in its position and refused to deal with the new company. Economic was then forced to carry out its threats to become a competitor. Pipes were purchased and 30 miles of city streets were torn up. This brought the old company to terms, they declared to be ready <span class="page-break">3</span>to negotiate, and a few days ago the transaction took place; Economic was sold to the gas trust for an alleged sum of $5,000,000. It is estimated that expenses amounted to $1,400,000, leaving a net profit of $3,600,000.</p>
   <p>Of course the gas trust does not pay this amount out of their own pockets. The public must pay for it and the gas bills of late give evidence of this. What does this teach us? No matter how many new companies we permit to enter this business, we will always suffer a twofold loss; our streets will be torn up every time and our gas bills, instead of being reduced will only increase. This latest transaction is additional overwhelming proof that the only remedy is the complete elimination of private gas companies and the substitution of gas works owned and operated by the city. Evidently it is not clear how to proceed, but the determination of the people must find a way. Let us hope that the mass-meeting which will be held next Wednesday in the interest of this matter may clear the way for action.</p>
