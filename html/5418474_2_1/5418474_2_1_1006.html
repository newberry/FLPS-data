   <p>Never before in the history of Chicago's singing societies, have they joined their forces, as they are scheduled to do March 8th, at the Auditorium Theater. At this pro-Boer mass-demonstration 800 to 900 singers are expected to participate. The first of the rehearsals was held last night at which Pastor Geo. D. Heldmann welcomed the singers in a brief address. He said, that whenever the German singing societies join in lending their services to a worthy cause, success cannot be doubted. This extraordinary interest shown by these societies in the forth coming mass-meeting assures a success which will overshadow any such undertaking of the past in the city of Chicago singing societies of various other nationalities have tried hard to imitate the German singers, said Pastor Heldmann. but it is absolutely out of question that they could every reach that pinnacle.</p>
