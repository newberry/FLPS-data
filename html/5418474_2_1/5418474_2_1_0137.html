   <p>There is always news from the Prohibition theater of war. Almost daily there are skirmishes, and the front lines are changing all the time. The election in Oklahoma can be marked up as a splendid victory for the anti-Prohibitionists. Although Oklahoma does not belong to what is called the "dry" Solid South, it nevertheless had been one of the leading pro-Prohibition states. The fact that this state has voted by a two-to-one majority to give beer a legal status is indeed significant. It makes the assumption almost a certainty that the state will vote for repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.</p>
   <p>The news from Ohio and California is just as important. In Ohio, the "drys" had attempted to forestall the election which was scheduled for November 7. To this end, they had circulated a petition, which they submitted to the Secretary of State, according to which the law regulating the election schedule should itself be made subject to a referendum vote. By this measure, the final and inevitable decision on the repeal issue would not have been avoided, to be sure, but could easily have been postponed. The State Supreme Court has just ruled that the petition should be thrown out, and that the election is to take place on November 7.</p>
   <p>A similar trick was tried by the "dry" general staff in California. In that state, they sought by means of an injunction to prevent the election authorities from counting the votes given the repeal candidates, and thus to render the election void. The petition was denied by the Superior Court. In both cases the procedure of the "drys" was designed for the sole purpose of preventing the majority of the voters from expressing their will. It is a good thing that the courts have frustrated these attempts.</p>
   <p>If one compares these court decisions with the ones made previously, when the "drys" were in the saddle and tyrannized the whole country, one cannot help getting the impression that even the judiciary has made an about-face in its attitude toward Prohibition. Some decades ago, a Chicago journalist made the remark: "The Supreme Court follows the election returns." This "wisecrack" obviously contains more truth than people generally realize.</p>
