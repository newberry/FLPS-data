   <p>The executive committee of the American Federation of Labor and the Brotherhood of Railroad Employees have called a conference of the union heads December 13, in Washington, D. C. From the letter announcing the conference, we quote the following:</p>
   <p>"During this critical period of reconstruction, labor is facing grave dangers--dangers which threaten the foundations of its whole structure."</p>
   <p>Regarding the purpose of the conference, the letter goes on to say that it is necessary "to talk things over and to agree upon a course of action which will serve to safeguard and promote the rights, interests, and the liberty of the wage-earners who make up the bulk of the people in our republic".</p>
   
   <p>Nobody could object to that. This purpose of the conference must be wholly approved by everyone who has the welfare of the general public at heart. And the reason that is given for calling a conference is absolutely plausible. It is true without a doubt that right now organized Labor faces great dangers--dangers which threaten the foundation of its whole structure. We can even go a step farther and say that organized labor is now in greater danger than it has been for a long time. But it seems that a line should be drawn between "labor"--labor in general--and "organized labor"--labor organizations, i. e., the structure of organized labor. This difference should be more clearly emphasized. And now the questions arise: Of what nature are these dangers? From which side do they threaten? How did they originate?</p>
   <p>The indifference of the general public, their sheep-like patience which accepts even gross violations of constitutionally guaranteed liberties and rights of the people, is undoubtedly a dangerous attitude, and threatens labor as well as the welfare of the people. However, it is doubtful whether the union heads had this particular problem in mind when they decided on a conference. Greed for profit, if not the only cause, was probably the determining factor. But employers do not have a monopoly on this greed for profit; it is also found among the farmers and workers who demand higher and still higher prices for their products and higher wages for their labor. Of course every farmer has the right to ask as much as he can get for his wheat and corn, and every laborer has the right to demand good wages and to ask for a raise if he believes himself entitled to it--and is in a position to insist on it. One does not call that greed; that word could not be applied here. But for all practical purposes it is just that, if the granting of demands is sought by forceful methods and ruthless violence.</p>
   <p>Reliance on temporary power seems to constitute the main danger for "labor". It ignores the fact that by ruthless pursuit of its own temporary advantages others will be put at a great disadvantage. In the struggle of organized labor against organized capital, the general public may find itself between two millstones, and may take a very definite attitude in this controversy, indifferent though it may have been at other times. The public does not intend to play the part of the silent loser. It will take sides in this struggle of organized labor against capital, and the party against which it turns will be fighting a losing battle.</p>
   <p>The greatest danger which organized labor has to face is found within its own ranks and among its own leaders. This danger will increase and become more acute if more unreasonable demands are insisted upon, or if threats are made and orders are issued which endanger the economic equilibrium. The general public sees only the thing closest at hand, and is likely to put the blame there when its interests are challenged. If the threatened coal miners' strike becomes a fact, the public will hold the officials of the miners" unions responsible for all the damage done. And very likely the whole structure of organized labor will totter and suffer severe damage-- if it is not completely destroyed to make room for a better system.</p>
