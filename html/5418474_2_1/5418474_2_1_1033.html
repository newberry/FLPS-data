   <p>According to news emanating from Pittsburg, it is contemplated trying Chinese day laborers on N. Y. buildings.</p>
   <p>If they fulfill expectations, then thousands more are scheduled for importation. Lien Chien, dealer in "Coolies", who led the advance guard, told a reporter he has closed deals with many N.Y. contractors to supply the yellow cargo. Formerly, they employed Hungarian, Italian and Swedish workers, but they proved "unsatisfactory." The Chinese however, will labor for one half the customary rate and refrain from striking. Thousands are prepared to migrate to New York, whenever required. When questioned concerning the immigration law, the Chinese smiled nonchalantly. There is a sufficiency of Chinese in this country, but if additional ones are required, there will be no difficulty in obtaining them as it is a simple matter to circumvert the law. We have no apprehension regarding their <span class="page-break">2</span>importation. The poor fellows will probably be clubbed to death and the combined forced of police and militia cannot prevent it. This news proves the farce of the Chinese Exclusion Law.--Phila. Tagellatt.</p>
