   <p>President Collidge has signed the revenue measure, although he is not at all satisfied with its most important provisions. In his official opinion attached to the document he emphasizes that he regards the bill as a form of installment payment and that he expects a genuine tax reform next year. The president's explanation shows by irrefutable logic that although the new law provides for a slight tax reduction it is far from being a basically sound, scientifically accurate measure.</p>
   <p>The responsibility rests first and foremost, with the progressive Republicans. That group collaborated with the Democrats, killed Mellon's bill, and substituted a compromise measure which was enacted. The enactment of the law, like everything else Congress has done within the last months, is designed to catch votes. It is an amateurish contraption with a decidely demagogical aspect. While the Mellon bill subscribes to the principle that the taxation of possessions, i.e. property in its larger sense, and income should be made a principal source of revenue, the new measure is especially designed to make these acquisitions untaxable.</p>
   <p>The subsequent results have been very aptly foreseen by President Coolidge. He calls attention to the twelve billion dollars which are invested in tax-exempt bonds. A new bond issue amounting to another billion -- will soon be on the market. Now in order to avoid exorbitant surtaxes, capitalists need only invest their money in tax-exempt issues. Aside from increasing the taxes which the public -- the majority -- must pay, this [type of investment] withdraws immense sums from our national economic activities.</p>
   <p>The buyer of tax-exempt bonds knows that his investment is absolutely safe. He need not worry about the interest, which is paid promptly and regularly. However, if one's money is invested in industrial or commercial enterprises then one risks his entire fortune. He is also fully aware that the investment may be the harbinger of many a sleepless night. Therefore, a capitalist expects profit commensurate with the risk and is absolutely entitled to it. But when most of the profits are absorbed by taxes, then he will divest himself of such burdensome investments and will instead acquire [government] bonds.</p>
   <p>These are "axioms" but they are beyond the comprehension of Mellon's opponents. They should have been aware that revenues fail to materialize when confiscation becomes a substitute for taxation.</p>
   <p>This principle also applies to inheritance, property, and gift taxes. Whenever the State reaches beyond certain limits and the inviolability of private property is endangered, then the threatened citizen will always find ways to extricate himself.</p>
   <p>At worst, one might go to Canada, or to Cuba, or to the Riviera, or to Paris, all fairly pleasant places in which to live. Unfortunately there are already too many Americans who have definitely settled elsewhere and thus have escaped the schemes of demagogues and reformers.</p>
   <p>President Coolidge correctly states that the new law will bring little, if any, lessening of the tax burden borne by the masses. Only those taxes will be reduced which affect the income of less than four million people. The indirect taxes which every man, woman, and child, even the poorest, must pay will not be reduced by the new law. Why?</p>
   <p>The explanation is obvious. A reduction of the income tax is plainly visible and is an excellent means of garnering votes, whereas a reduction of indirect taxes would not be so plainly apparent.</p>
   <p>Yet every American pays an average per capita tax of thirty-five dollars to the national government. All of this amount is derived from indirect taxation, thus providing proof of the mighty load every family must shoulder.</p>
   <p>President Coolidge displayed prudent moderation when he signed the bill despite its omissions and imperfections. He deserves commendation for his service to the nation in unreservedly reiterating the contention of the Administration.</p>
   <p>Before the war, the country could countenance haphazard tax measures, because taxes were trivial in comparison with our national wealth. But times have changed. Government expenditures have trebled since the World War; most of the increase is attributable to interest payments and redemption of Liberty bonds and other war loans. Under these circumstances it is a dire necessity that the problem be solved in a sound manner -- on a scientific basis.</p>
   <p>The public demands such a solution of Congress and expects that body to concur in the President's request for genuine tax reform next year.</p>
