   <p>Interest in government ownership of railroads has been revived, and so it is in order that we concern ourselves with the advantages and disadvantages of government ownership. People are easily misled, for they draw [false] parallels between the United States and other countries, and they forget to consider that fundamentally different conditions prevail in various countries.</p>
   <p>Americans of German descent naturally compare conditions in the United States with those in Germany. In the latter country all railroads have been united since 1920 in the German National Railroad Company. It is true that prior to that year a large percentage of the railroads were operated by the Government; but the larger provinces, such as Prussia, Bavaria, and Wuertemberg, operated their railroads independently of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>National Government. At that time, as well as later under the German National Railroad Company, the railroads were a source of great income for the country, except during the time of the Ruhr occupation and the subsequent period of inflation; for it was the railroads that furnished no small part of reparations.</p>
   <p>This fact might mislead a person to assume that government ownership of railroads would also be just as successful in America. But the matter is not so simple. For one thing, we in the United States must reckon with much greater distances, and that would undoubtedly prove to be a great disadvantage for the railroads. Still, this factor might not be so important as many people think, since statistics show that long-distance freight traffic, which is the principal source of income of railroads, is more profitable than short hauls.</p>
   <p>The chief distinction between conditions in Germany and conditions in America lies in an altogether different sphere. The personnel of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>German National Railroad Company consists exclusively of experts. They devote their whole lives to railroading, and therefore they possess a special knowledge that must redound to the advantage of the roads.</p>
   <p>If our railroads were placed under government ownership, the President would appoint as the head of the united roads a politician, who would receive the position solely because of his political connections and would know little or nothing about railroads. The same principle would be followed in engaging district supervisors and even minor employees. We admit, of course, that President Roosevelt would not be wholly guided by political considerations when making appointments, but unfortunately we cannot expect that we shall always have a Franklin Delano Roosevelt in that office, and under some other leader politicians would have ample opportunity to reserve well-paying railroad positions for themselves and their friends.</p>
   <p>The proposal would be worthy of consideration, if it were possible to <span class="page-break">\4</span>change the system and eliminate politics from the administration of railroads. In that case the merger of all railroads would prove to be very economical for our country, and the transportation systems would develop into a good source of income. However, under our present political system government ownership of railroads would make them the prey of politicians.</p>
   <p>Mail service, which is operated by the Government both in Germany and in the United states, is a pertinent example. In Germany postal service has always been an important source of income for the country, while the mail service of the United States, which formerly showed a profit, has been operating under a deficit during the last few years. In this instance long distances have proved disadvantageous; besides, the post office is heavily burdened by the franking privileges of Government agencies and Congressmen. And the high wages of host of postmasters of the four classes are also a drain on the income of the postal service. But the greatest drawback is the fact that these gentlemen lack expert knowledge and often make arrangements that prove to be a hindrance to commerce and traffic and <span class="page-break">\5</span>thus impair the mail service.</p>
   <p>Municipal ownership of street car lines, gas plants, electric plants, etc., in Germany also furnishes pertinent examples. In most cases this form of ownership also has been profitable for various communities. Although it might be possible to operate our public utilities by experts for some time, it does not, as a rule, take long before our political bosses interfere and remove the cream from the milk, sometimes even absconding with the milk itself.</p>
