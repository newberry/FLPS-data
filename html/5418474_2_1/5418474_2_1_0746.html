   <p>Only continuous vigilance brings victory. This word we address, today, to our German Aldermen. Your German fellow citizens look up to you. They hope that you will persevere in the fight to gain recognition of the principle, that in a Republic each one should have the privilege to celebrate Sunday as he chooses. It is most important that they do not fail to attend any session of the committee. Today, especially, an important session takes place. The revised reglations containing the abolition of the Sunday law will be submitted to them. The temperance people will certainly do all in their power to prevent the enactment of this abolition. It is expected that perhaps already, tonight, a substitute for the present Sunday law will be passed which is acceptable to the Germans. In that case the Aldermen will see to it, that the clause which obliges the mayor to revoke the license of any saloonkeeper violating the Sunday law, is stricken from the books. Similarly, another clause should be cancelled which gives the Mayor the power to revoke a license for any violation concerning alcoholic drinks. Else, any mild Sunday will be of little value; then in that case all the saloon keepers would be made subservient to the arbitrary testimony of witnesses, of police judges, or of the Mayor.</p>
