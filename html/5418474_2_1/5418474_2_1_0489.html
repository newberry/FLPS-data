   <p>The Anti-Prohibition mass demonstration of yesterday received an ugly echo from the clergymen of various Chicago churches.</p>
   <p>Pastor E. C. Kindred of the Englewood Christian Church compared the demonstration with the noisy meeting of anarchists.</p>
   <p>Pastor John Thompson of the Methodist Mc Cabe Memorial Church called the demonstration a plot between the Chicago Police and the tavern-keepers to deceive the law. Pastor M. P. Boynton of the Lexington Avenue Baptist Church is calling the demonstrators a bunch of undesirable foreigners, crying for more freedom.</p>
   <p>Father P. O. Callaghan of the Roman-Catholic St. Mary Church on Wabash Avenue calls it a shame, that not more Catholics are courageous enough to stand up for a "Christian" Sunday. Dr. Frank Gunsanlus of the Central Church declares, that the Chicago Tavernkeepers are racing towards an abyss...and so on. These utterances of Clergymen only prove the hard task of the United Societies to enlighten the public towards a sensible understanding for a carefree open Sunday.</p>
