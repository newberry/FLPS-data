   <p>The Motivating Factors behind an Artificial Revolution</p>
   <p>The objective of the World War was to crush the Central Powers economically--Germany, in particular. Therefore, only an economically stable and well-established power could foil such a plan. But if such a power is strong enough to obviate a collapse within her own boundaries, other countries are likely to emulate the same methods and activate the forces which make for stable conditions. Big business could never be so blind as not to make the proper choice if faced with the facts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Since we are studying this subject, we must always keep in mind the final purpose of all these efforts: to bring about normal conditions in all countries of the world. We must disregard all political demands for the elimination of private profits in the process of production, and instead, center our attention on certain phenomena, of which most people have not been aware, but which nevertheless have been instrumental in bringing about a gradual upheaval.</p>
   <p>The proclamation of human rights, promulgated in America, was hailed by all serious-minded people everywhere, but particularly by Germany and Austria. With sincerity and the courage of their convictions, millions of people started movements in their own countries to put an end to the bloody devastation of war.</p>
   <p>To bring about Germany's liberation had become the watchword of the faithful; her economic destruction was only planned at the conference tables of diplomats and mercenaries.</p>
   <p>If the upheaval in Germany could be effected by the demands of her own people, <span class="page-break">\3</span>the purpose of the War had apparently been fulfilled. Germany's tremendous industrial organization and her labor organizations, handled wisely and astutely, were to be the levers by which the political revolution would be put over--at least that was the pious hope of the true friends of German democracy, who were babbling over with the enthusiasm of Wilson's Fourteen Points. They were serving the noble cause and, with only few exceptions, believed in the sincerity of the (American) declarations.</p>
   <p>Germany's powerful industrial labor organizations formed the bulwarks which had to be conquered first, if the idealistic purposes of the War were to be accomplished. On the other hand, they had to be destroyed or even converted into instruments of violence, if the intentions of the diplomats and the mercenary-minded were to be realized: The economoc destruction and complete enslavement of the German creative spirit.</p>
   <p>The diplomats and the mercenary-minded forces had to play a deceitful game and thwart the intentions of the idealistically minded and they knew only too well <span class="page-break">\4</span>that the German people would trust only those who had no reason to foment hatred against them; to preach hatred against a people from which sprang men who, exiled though they were, had left their native land only because they loved it so much that they were willing to risk their lives and fortunes to liberate it from tyranny, and because, by living far away from the home soil of their forebears, they could instil in their descendants loyalty to the same cause: the liberation of Germany as well as all mankind.</p>
   <p>The denunciation of German labor organizations by hired agents, started a few years before the War when the German workers were not violent and bloodthirsty enough in their actions, was carried on here in America especially. (Letters of W. T. Foster from Berlin, Vienna, and Budapest, also in the Movement Syndicalist, Paris).</p>
   <p>[Abendpost Editor's note:] W. T. Foster, whom we mention here, is one of the managers of the present steel strike. According to his own testimony before the Senate Committee, he was reared in the slums, and has been at various times, <span class="page-break">\5</span>a preacher, a Socialistic agitator, and a hobo, but never, at any time in his life, a worker. In 1910 he went to Germany at his own expense. Vincent St. John, at that time secretary of the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.), sent Foster to Budapest, Paris, and other places without sanction of the organization. In Budapest, Foster got into arguments with James Duncan, the representative of the American Federation of Labor, but effected a reconciliation with him by making certain promises. These promises led Foster to denounce immediately, in his correspondence to America, the bureaucracy of German labor organizations, and to condone propaganda for the destruction of machines and human lives and criminal sabotage as the sole means of action in the fight against the bourgeoisie. In Vienna, Foster was arrested on a charge of larceny and vagrancy, but was released presently when he proved his American citizenship. After his return to America and his disavowal by the I.W.W., Foster founded the Syndicalist Leagues with the aid and support of the officials of the American Federation of Labor. Men like Johnstone, at present secretary of the Packing House Workers' Union; Dezettle, publisher of a Chicago weekly; and Carl Rabe, who was police "stool pigeon" and "agent provocateur" during the teamsters' strike in <span class="page-break">\6</span>1904, travelled all over the country propagandizing for criminal sabotage against human lives and the means of production, until finally almost all these agitators landed in well-paying official positions in the Gompers Unions.)</p>
   <p>A movement in this country which paved the way for labor representation in the factories after the German pattern, and in which Franz Bohn (whom we have to mention later) played an active part, was soon frustrated by propaganda advocating destruction of property and physical violence.</p>
   <p>When this country decided to enter the War, it was necessary to put into action forces which could be found neither in England nor in France. These forces were found among the descendants of those German emigrants and political refugees who had joined together, trusting blindly in the sincerity of the President's declarations, to participate in smashing the citadel of German invincibility on the economic field, and to convert it into a hotbed of revolution.</p>
   <p>The Friends of German Democracy were to play a part which was to be even more <span class="page-break">\7</span>decisive than that of the Expeditionary Forces. The way they discharged their assignment reveals the trusting gullibility of German labor on the one hand, and of the main actors in the camp of the Friends of German Democracy on the other.</p>
   <p>Because of their gullibility, both sides finally suffered the fate of "bamboozled sheep," even though we must admit that opportunism on the part of many Friends of German Democracy was the sole motive for their actions, which brought on the tragedy.</p>
   <p>France's greatly overadvertised Confederation du Travail (Confederation of Labor), which had boasted only a few weeks before the outbreak of hostilities, that it would bring about the social revolution in France over night, collapsed miserably when the storm broke. No forces could be recruited from their ranks to encourage German labor, or to influence the liberty-minded masses.</p>
   <p>English labor was least suited to set an example for the German proletariat.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The prosperity of Great Britain's organized labor is founded on British imperialism, and their assurances of solidarity were not more than a rubber-stamp phrase when the time came to decide questions of basic principle by a contest of strength. Until recently the "shopkeeper" and barter spirit ruled the relationship between capital and labor in the British isles.</p>
   <p>But an appeal to German labor would bear infinitely greater weight if made by organizations giving assurances of sincere friendship and claiming within their ranks men of unquestionable reputation in matters of labor movements. The Friends of German Democracy embodied within their structure as an organization all those elements which would co-operate with like-minded people in Germany for the achievement of the same purpose.</p>
   <p>All those who honestly worked for a political revolution in Germany, with the obvious objective of bringing about the termination of the war, were dependent to an ever-increasing degree on the liberal-minded bourgeoisie. They did not require any lengthy explanations about the Fourteen Points as a means of <span class="page-break">\9</span>socialization of the means of production, for this should not and must not be the purpose of a political revolution. That was why, under the sponsor-ship of Prince Hohenlohe and others, working from Switzerland, the revolutionary idea made much better headway among the middle class people of Southern Germany than in regions where an enlightened industrial proletariat had developed. But the plotters at the diplomatic conference tables, as well as the industrialists who swear by Gompers, hoped completely to undermine the structure of the Germans economic organization, including the labor unions.</p>
   <p>The plotters in our own country are only too ready to forgive and forget the hotheads who attempted the overthrow of the "exploitation system" by preaching force and violence. The sincerity and honesty of our intentions had to be demonstrated to the German and Austrian workers by men who enjoyed their confidence. Hardly anything is left to chance when it is necessary to accomplish an objective quickly. E. Koettgen, at one time London correspondent of the Berlin Vorwaerts (Forward: Social-Democratic daily), and before the entrance of this country into the War, lecturer for the American Socialist party, became <span class="page-break">\10</span>secretary of the Friends of German Democracy only because of his extensive connections among the organized masses in Germany. These, above all others, had to be made familiar with the significance of the Fourteen Points and their scrupulous application, so that the way might be paved for the military and political demoralization of the masses and the army.</p>
   <p>The leading part was to be played by Franz Bohn, and he carried it out. It is quite probable that even he did not believe that the German labor unions would have the strength to create a new order by themselves because, before he left for France, in his articles in various American newspapers, he predicted the downfall of the industrial labor unions as a prerequisite to a successful revolution in the homeland of his ancestors.</p>
   <p>Dr. Frank Bohn was known in Germany. After serving as a volunteer in the Spanish-American War, he became a Socialist, gained a reputation as an author and historian (by giving lectures at Columbia University), and in 1905 became co-founder of the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.), which at that time <span class="page-break">\11</span>was based on principles taken from the textbooks of the German movement. He then became secretary of the Socialist Workers' party, and was sent as a delegate to the Workers' and Socialist Congress in Stuttgart (Germany). He travelled all over Italy and France and, in collaboration with William D. Haywood, he wrote books on industrial democracy, one of which is still very popular.</p>
   <p>It was Bohn's job to inform the German masses and soldiers of the sincere, pro-German intentions of the leading statesmen of this country, and to interpret the Fourteen Points from a purely Socialistic point of view. While a volunteer in the aviation corps, he and other volunteers dropped tons of literature on the German lines. From The Hague, where the northern headquarters of the Friends of German Democracy was established, a lively traffic with the German agitators for an upheaval in Germany was organized. In August, 1918, there were reports in the American press that members of the Spartakus group (minority of German radicals) frequently and openly visited the headquarters, and that the campaign of enlightenment for the German masses on the sincerity and pro-German intentions of our nation had made tremendous headway. And now we are receiving reports <span class="page-break">\12</span>which reveal how intensive and far-reaching these connections throughout Germany were.</p>
   <p>Wilhelm Liebknecht's (German radical) accusation against the German Government is published in English by our own Federal Government for American mass consumption.</p>
   <p>War Memoirs of a German Soldier, the work of Bertan--now editor of the "Class Struggle" (Klassenkampf), an I.W.W. weekly--is being translated by secretary Koettgen of the Friends of German Democracy, and will be published in book form by Huebsch, New York publisher, and will also appear in all syndicated newspapers in all the larger cities. All references which might place England in an embarrassing position are omitted, and all attacks on Germany are emphasized. This publication is available to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of readers, and only serves the main purpose of the War: to liberate the German people as quickly as possible from the yoke of the feudal lords.</p>
   <p>The Russian methods during the armistice and peace negotiations in Brest Litovsk <span class="page-break">\13</span>were more deliberate. By printed appeals to the class consciousness of the German soldiers, the discipline on the Eastern Front was completely undermined, and fraternization between Russians and Germans was encouraged. And furthermore, the German masses were to be convinced that with the outbreak of the revolution in Germany the French people and the English workers would join the revolution to bring peace and justice to the world. The connivers, the henchmen of the imperialists and the jingoists, who even today play the greatest part in the destiny of all nations, conspired to bring about economic chaos by a political revolution in Germany, and to destroy the creative spirit of the German people and their courage for reconstruction.</p>
   <p>Nothing was further from the minds of the French and English, not to mention the Americans, than giving the signal for a general world revolution once a political revolution had actually taken place in Germany, but this hope had been fostered within the German people until it had become their catechism. Just like all promises made before, the leaflets showered upon the German civilians and soldiers contained nothing but meaningless illusions. Did not the Friends <span class="page-break">\14</span>of German Democracy know that?</p>
   <p>Three days after the outbreak of the revolution in Germany, Wilhelm Liebknecht (sic) said the following words at the graves of the fallen soldiers in Berlin's Friedrichshain cemetery:</p>
   <p>"Too long have the other nations waited to make good their promises; too much has been lost already by hesitation; here, at the grave of our heroes, we demand that the revolution of the proletariat be announced immediately in France, Italy, England, and the United States...."</p>
   <p>These promises had been made to the German people and to the industrial proletariat by means of leaflets which were paid for in this country; the German people had exerted their whole economic and political strength in a gigantic effort to accomplish a peace of justice and reconciliation through a revolution; and then, a few weeks later, it was realized that the Allies' promises were nothing but fakes. The labor unions, denounced and ridiculed by Dr. Frank Bohn <span class="page-break">\15</span>and Mr. E. Koettgen, came to the rescue to stave off the condition for which the Allied vultures were waiting--the economic collapse of Germany.</p>
   <p>Such recuperative power, doing the well-nigh impossible, has always been marvelled at by thinking people everywhere, which is probably the reason economists of this country study these problems more closely now.</p>
   <p>The seed of German pseudo radicalism is beginning to bear fruit in this country. One sowed the wind and is now reaping the storm, and now everybody is wondering where that hurricane originated. The spirit of Spartakus, which was described to The Hague as an Allied bogeyman enslaving the German people for centuries to come, is haunting this country now, freed by the propaganda call of a political revolution in Europe. If many disappointed people are becoming restless now, let us not forget that Liebknecht's indictment of the German form of government and the call for a social revolution was prepared and fostered by our own government, and disseminated among our own people, and that here, too, hopes have been aroused that cannot be fulfilled. There are muddleheads who cherish the idea of <span class="page-break">\16</span>proclaiming the dictatorship of the proletariat in this country simply because some of our leading men encouraged that procedure for Germany, where a revolution was the surest way to bring about the economic collapse. Those who played with fire are now afraid of the conflagration.</p>
   <p>The ship has been set on its course; and military rule in Gary indicates that this is only one of the landing places on her way to a final destination. Which way from here?</p>
