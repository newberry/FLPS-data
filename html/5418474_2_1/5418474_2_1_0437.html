   <p>German members of the United Societies convened in the Englewood Hall to protest against gagging of personal liberty. In pursuance of the protest meeting held last Monday evening at the North Side Turner Hall, under the auspices of the United Societies, German sections, yesterday evening, another protest meeting was held in the Englewood Hall, 1048 W. 63rd Street. The meeting was presided over by Dr. Jean Kercher, member of the Executive Committee of the United Societies. He explained to the large audience the purpose of the meeting, and then introduced Mr. Leopold Newman, the organizer of the United Societies, as the first speaker. To explain to those members of the United Societies who live on the South Side and who were unable to be present at last Monday's meeting at the North Side Turner Hall why the special Bar Permit Law should be opposed is the reason for this meeting.</p>
   <p>The aldermen were also invited but they did not find it worth while to put in appearance and presumably used as an excuse that they do not understand <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>German; but this could have been easily remedied because the speakers of the evening might have addressed them in the American language just as well. It is peculiar that these gentlemen were always found, before election, at all meetings where German was spoken exclusively, but after election they did not understand German at all. Mr. Neumann declared that the whole movement against the restriction of bar permits on the occasion of festivals has only one purpose--to work hand-in-hand with the reformers.</p>
   <p>The ultimate purpose of the movement culminates in their effort to dry up the whole country, in other words to carry through a law of prohibition in America. While Dunne was mayor of Chicago, a similar movement was launched. The United Societies, even at that time, took up the fight against the restriction of personal liberty; the Anglo-American press consented to the call for restriction of bar permits but when they placed a pistol against the breast of the Daily News, with the threat of a boycott of the paper, they made a sudden change in its attitude because its interests were at stake. When the dollar was concerned the Daily News then wrote that the people's liberty should not <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>be restricted, and after that, with the assistance of the United Societies, six special bar permits were issued.</p>
   <p>If the citizens of this country are willing to stand for a restriction as proposed, we soon will have Russian conditions prevailing in America. We should not forget that through a general prohibition the distress and unemployment of thousands of men with thousands of families and children suffering will be effected. The aim of the reformers is to ruin the laboring classes, to take the bread away from their mouths. Send therefore, the resolutions brought in here to all aldermen and demand your rights.</p>
   <p>With these words the speaker concluded amidst great applause.</p>
