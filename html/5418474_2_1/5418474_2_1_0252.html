   <p>"A joy shared is a joy doubled; a grief shared is a grief halved" was a familiar proverb in the time of the ancient Greeks. Joys which can be doubled by sharing are very rare and far between in this day and age of political revolution and economic struggle. This is especially true for the average citizen, who is neither a war profiteer nor a highly-paid, skilled worker; who has neither an uncle from whom he can inherit a fortune nor a rich wife, and who must depend upon what he earns by his brain or his brawn, since he was not careful enough in the selection of his parents. So whoever wants to test the validity of the proverb quoted above will do well to concentrate on the second part. we all have troubles that could be cut in half. It might not be wise to exchange our troubles with the other fellow; we might find that his troubles are much worse than our own. But most people find consolation in the fact that they are not the only stepchildren of "Lady Luck" but that others, too, run <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>around with "aching corns." Misery loves company; the more companions sit in the same boat with him the easier he will boar fortune's frown. After all there is some truth in that proverb.</p>
   <p>This may be the reason son why many people, whose pleasure has been. partially spoiled by Prohibition, and who find it hard to beer this Hisfortune--although they them-selves are partly to blame for it--will find a measure of consolation in being told that the boor in Germany is no longer good. This is only small consolation, however, for over there the trouble is only temporary, while over here it is permanent. Anybody who sits at the beer table these days, gloomily staring into his glass of "near" beer ("far" beer would be more appropriate name), but not finding the courage to your it down the hatch, would do well to remember that his his pals across the big pond are scarcely any better off. It is true that beer Can can still be called beer over there without danger of being dragged before a judge, but the stuff that circulates under that name is really nothing but a weak, low-percentage fluid.</p>
   <p>As proof of that let us mention the report at the Hague of the American trade <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>attache, P. L. Edwards, appearing in one of the latest editions of the Commercial News, published by the Department of Commerce. According to this report, in 1918 the North-German broweries obtained only ten per cent of the amount of barley they consumed during 1913. That means, they were supposed to get that much, but in reality they were given less, in come cases only five per cent. Since the consumption of beer in Germany has not been reduced, in spite of rising beer prices, the natural consequence was the browing of a beer that resembles in quality our Prohibition "beer". The Bavarian breweries are receiving fifteen per cent of the prewar amount of barley. This generosity is due to the fact that in the south beer is considered a food. We would like to see the faces of the good people of Munich who have to wash down their Kalbshaxen (leg of veal) with a "Luehje Duenn" [Literally, "Little Thin"].</p>
   <p>In addition to that the price of bear has rison in reverse ratio to the alcoholic content of the beverage. A small barrel of beer for which one paid eleven marks in 1913 (under protest), sold this spring for thirty-eight marks. Larger barrels, which cost twenty-four marks six years ago, today cost eighty-two marks and over. Since the restaurant owners add their profit on all retail sales, one <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>can just about imagine how much it costs to satisfy a good thirst in Germany, considering the low contents of spirits in the brew. It is just like over here.</p>
   <p>Let that be a consolation to everybody.</p>
