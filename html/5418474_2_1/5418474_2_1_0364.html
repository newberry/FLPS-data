   <p>While the more or less qualified and self-satisfied "pillars of the state" and of society enthusiastically indorsed and supported the violation of our Federal Constitution, which is the foundation of the state and of society, and even now are celebrating because of the ratification and proclamation of the Prohibition Amendment, there are sporadic indications that the masses, whom the Prohibitionists consider to be more or less untrustworthy, un-American, and unpatriotic, are not so willing to submit to the grave violation of our Constitution; nor are the masses satisfied to have their freedom curtailed or usurped by self-appointed guardians, as happened when the Eighteenth Amendment was enacted and ratified. And at times one meets Congressmen, the representatives of the people, who also have sufficient intelligence and courage to defend the Constitution and the liberty of our citizens....</p>

   <p>In New York, as well as in New Jersey, organized labor has voiced its opposition to Prohibition, and is now demanding that the manufacture of light wines and beer be permitted--especially that of beer. It is said that hundreds of thousands of buttons bearing the inscription, "No beer, no work," can be seen on the coat lapels of union laborers and other liberal-minded men, and that the use of these buttons is spreading very rapidly. Today it is reported that operators of restaurants in the Italian quarters of New York's East Side are distributing cards which bear the inscription, "No wine, no marriages," and that opposition to Prohibition is finding expression in many other ways.</p>
   <p>According to the principle, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" [Translator's note: The original cites two "avenging" expressions: "Sausage against sausage," and: "If you hit my Jew, I will hit your Jew"] some New Yorkers will protest against the manufacture of 736 patent medicines which contain between nine and ninety-six per cent of alcohol; and yesterday a bill declaring cider <span class="page-break">\3</span>which is a month old to be "undrinkable," was introduced in the New York State Legislature. These measures are but straws in the wind, but they indicate the trend in the East, and we hope that similar forceful expressions of public opinion will soon be forthcoming from the Middle west--yes, from all parts of our country.</p>
   <p>The most important of the aforementioned measures is the one which proposes a legal definition of "intoxicating liquors". The New York bill defines any liquor which contains more than fifteen per cent of alcohol as "intoxicating". This interpretation would naturally permit the manufacture of the finest beer, ale, and porter, and of wine of sufficient strength to satisfy any sensible person.</p>
   <p>Of course, the position must be maintained that the Prohibition Amendment is unconstitutional, and that it is the duty of the Supreme Court of the United States to so find. It is much more important to avoid a violation of the Constitution than it is to preserve any individual personal right or to <span class="page-break">\4</span>prevent a grave injustice to a whole industry and class of owners. The problem is to preserve the spirit of the Constitution, to thwart any attempt to use the Constitution as a means of depriving the masses of their liberty and their possessions. For the Constitution was conceived and framed to protect human rights and possessions, even against arbitrary majorities. However, we are living in abnormal times, and under the present conditions the wise man is satisfied with half a loaf if he is not able to obtain the whole loaf, and he will try to reach his goal by roundabout routes if the direct way is obstructed by narrow-mindedness and fanatics. Therefore, the attempt to extract the poisonous fangs of Prohibition by a definition of "intoxicating liquors" is to be applauded, in case the Supreme Court of the United States shows no consideration. A further reason for indorsing the movement to have "intoxicating liquor" defined by legislative act is that, in this way, the obscurity and absurdity of the Prohibition Amendment will be revealed. And if the attempt is successful, it will prove to the Prohibitionists that they have gone beyond the limits which are established by the Constitution. And <span class="page-break">\5</span>then the task of the Supreme Court should not be difficult.</p>
   <p>Prospects of extracting the poisonous fangs of Prohibition by obtaining a legal definition of "intoxicating liquors" are by no means small. Naturally, the law forbidding the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors forced the issue of the question; What is "intoxicating liquor"? Various answers are given. All who have made the aquaintance of "old man cider," the favorite drink of the farm population, will admit (if they are honest) that aged cider is an intoxicating beverage. But not one in a hundred thousand would say that beer of three per cent alcoholic content is intoxicating. And how about "Peruna," and other strongly alcoholic "tonics" which are so freely purchased in Prohibition areas? Are they intoxicating liquors: Or are they harmless, while beer which contains but one tenth, and wine which contains but one third as much alcohol as these so-called tonics deserve to be called "devil's poison"?</p>
   <p>Some people believe that a definition of "intoxicating liquor" like the one <span class="page-break">\6</span>proposed in the State of New York is possible and permissible under the law, and that it would serve to right a great wrong, inasmuch as pernicious whisky would be forbidden everywhere, but beverages of light alcoholic content permitted everywhere--in some states only two or three per cent beer would be permitted; in other states beverages, including California wines, containing eight or ten per cent of alcohol. That, in the opinion of these good people, would make everything right, and everybody would be satisfied.</p>
   <p>Indeed, everybody would be satisfied, or just about everybody; for, even though many would also like to drink a glass of good whisky now and then, very few would long insist upon freedom to use whisky as a beverage, since nobody can deny that it has done much harm. Only our Constitution would suffer through such a deal. The violation would not be nullified thus. The abominable precedent would still exist. and it must not. No good, loyal, American citizen should be satisfied with the plausible and possible solution as outlined above. As long as the last word has not yet been spoken, we must <span class="page-break">\7</span>persist in our demand that the Supreme Court of the United States reject the Eighteenth Amendment.</p>
