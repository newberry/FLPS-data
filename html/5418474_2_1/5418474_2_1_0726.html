   <p>It has been asked why nothing is heard any longer from the German-American organization. No one has need to be worried. The German-American organization is doing well and will appear in the political arena at the right moment.</p>
   <p>The police tyranny has now deeply wounded the Bohemian voter by raiding in a most brutal manner a Czech club. The Irish population is more and more offended, because the ruling clique is attacking one of the most popular Irishmen of Chicago, who is Police Commissioner Sheridan. Not one week passes by without an act of violence by the police. Among the Scandinavians the resentment is growing constantly, and even the French voters are joining the Germans. The Puritan nativist party, which calls itself now the party of law and order, can win in November only, if it should be able to create dissension among its adversaries. So by remaining united, victory will be ours.</p>
