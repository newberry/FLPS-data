   <p>Emperor William should be honored just as much as St. Patrick, so Albert T. Mueller thinks. Saturday. Mayor Washburne received the following letter from Mr. Mueller:</p>
   <p>"To the Hon. Hempstead Washburne Mayor of Chicago: you have issued a proclamation making today (March 17) a legal holiday for the employes of the City Hall, thereby causing all other citizens of this great city to wonder whether they are in Ireland or really in America. As Wednesday, March 2, is the birthday of William III, Emperor of Germany, and is celebrated as a holidays throughout Germany, it would only be fair for you to issue another proclamation making the second also a legal holiday for the employes of the City Hall, as I think you have a few Germans employed there. My personal opinion is that the Emperor William has done as much for Chicago as St. Patrick.</p>
   <p>Albert J. Mueller."</p>
   <p>In speaking of the letter Mr. Washburne said that his St. Patrick's day proclamation had been issued in pursuance of an order from the Council and that if that body chose to declare another holiday he would act in accordance With that decision.</p>
