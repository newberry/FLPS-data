   <p>The fanatics who have succeeded in bringing about the enactment of a law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of spirituous liquors in the United States--at least for the time being--now intend to direct their attention to another enemy of human happiness--tobacco. They have already ordered several posters depicting to the public the "terrible consequences" of smoking. These posters are patterned after those that proved so effective in the campaign against whisky, wine, and beer. And in addition, these fanatics are circulating everywhere printed matter of every description, from modest pamphlets to elaborately illustrated books, to prove that the use of tobacco in any and every form is exceedingly harmful.</p>
   <p>The prohibitionists have always been excellent statisticians. Their compilations of figures and percentages are sufficiently confusing to make even the most confirmed "wets" dizzy. Their calculations are very bold--<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> and just as questionable. They remind us of a story. A man requested a friend to state the exact number of stars in the heavens. "There are 3,327,643,721 stars," was the prompt answer. Overhearing the conversation, a third man took the know-it-all and reprimanded him, saying: "How can you make such an unreliable statement? Who on earth would believe anything like that?" The wise one replied: "If you do not believe me, count them yourself."</p>
   <p>In fact, the apostles of temperance have often made statements and published statistics which place anyone who would check their accuracy in the position of the man who was asked to count the stars. We cite two examples which they adduce to prove the alleged evil effects of tobacco: Men who were shooting at a target lost 4.8 per cent of their accuracy of aim after smoking only one cigar. Baseball pitchers lost 12 percent of their effectiveness after smoking one cigar, and 14.5 percent after smoking two cigars.</p>
   <p>The antitobacco people know their public just as well as the prohibitionists did.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>They appeal to hysteria and sentimentality, and not to calm reasoning. And so their evidence is contradictory--but confusing to the opposition. Of course, they never fail to don the cloak of patriotism whenever this is possible, representing themselves as "saviors" of their city, country, state, and nation.</p>
   <p>For instance, we read in a pamphlet issued by the Anti-Tobacco League: "Unless you prevent it, 1,460,000 acres of good arable land will be ruined this year through the cultivation of tobacco. This land could yield sufficient food for us and our allies. And the work necessary to prepare and cultivate the soil for this purpose would help to decrease unemployment." However, the publishers of this pamphlet fail to note that the cultivation, cure, and preparation of tobacco is a vast industry, affording many thousands of workers employment.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the League informs us of the following facts, which are entirely unknown to medical science: "Tobacco impairs the mental faculties in no little degree, and it causes deafness, blindness, cancer, tuberculosis, insanity, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>apoplexy, indigestion, arthritis, and heart trouble.</p>
   <p>Now, men suffered from all these diseases long before anyone thought of tobacco. But these fanatics are indifferent to this fact. Their sole object is to enumerate a great number of diseases and then represent them to be the consequence of smoking. And there are many timid souls who are afraid of such bugaboos.</p>
   <p>However, the list of evils caused by tobacco is not yet complete. Continuing to peruse this pamphlet, we come upon such statements as this: "The use of tobacco reduces humanity to poverty; it decreases muscular power; it causes great losses by fire. Infants have died from tobacco smoke."</p>
   <p>That is strong stuff, indeed. But we do not believe that it is strong enough to influence the judgment of our people, or gain the co-operation of the press. On the contrary, there are many indications that the English language press, which paved the way for prohibition, partly because it was permeated by a puritanical spirit, partly because it was hostile toward those of foreign birth, has no <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>sympathy for the antitobacconists.</p>
   <p>"We did not mean to go that far," they now say, and it is amusing to note how zealously they try to deceive the public in regard to their previous stand.</p>
   <p>"If these people could prohibit the sale of tobacco," says the New York Herald, "the excessive use of tobacco would be curbed, it is true; 'so let us forbid the use of tobacco,' the fanatics say. But there would they stop 'prohibiting'? Their next step would be to bar the use of coffee and tea, because they contain poisonous substances. If we proceed to make a patchwork of that blessed heritage of our fathers, the Constitution, so that it look like the camouflaged side of a battleship, people will begin to inquire why we 'idiotic Yankees' should have a constitution at all. What is needed is liberty, not restriction. If we have liberty, real liberty, then those minor evils which enable bombastic world reformers to travel about the country will vanish."</p>
   <p>Accordingly, it would not surprise us in the least if many another organ of public opinion which heretofore has secretly aided the cause of prohibition, would soon show a change of heart. Just last week the "world's greatest news-<a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>paper" condemned prohibition in a very scholarly article. That, at least, is a beginning.</p>
