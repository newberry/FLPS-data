   <p>The Illinois Supreme Court's decision which requires that the citizens of Chicago vote on the question whether the taverns should be closed, or their proprietors permitted to continue their business, was made at a very opportune time, at the right psychological moment, so to say. There can be no doubt as to the outcome of the voting, if all eligible voters do their duty as citizens. The general dissatisfaction, growing out of the fact that the people's will was ignored when more than seventy five per cent of our country's state legislatures ratified the prohibition Amendment to the Constitution, has grown to such proportions that the result of the balloting will be a stern protest. Therefore the decision of the court should be gladly welcomed, even though it does complicate the campaign to some extent. For the outcome will tell the weak-kneed members of the Illinois State Legislature what the citizens of Chicago think of them.</p>

   <p>Perhaps the voting will also give other gentlemen plenty to think about. We do not refer to the fanatic "water-apostles". They are so well convinced that their principles are just, that nothing can cause them to waver--even though not they, but others, have the doubtful pleasure of trying to apply these principles. Moreover, we refer to those persons whose duty it is to enforce this law, which is contrary to the American conception of freedom. It is true, the National Prohibition Amendment has been accepted and will be law until the Supreme Court of the United States has declared that it is unconstitutional; but there is a great difference of opinion in regard to the manner of enforcing it, and it is the duty of Congress to prescribe the way to carry out the Amendment and to determine which liquors are to be considered "alcoholic" in the sense of the law. It is not impossible that the voting by the citizens of Chicago will have some influence upon the decision.</p>
   <p>Hence it is absolutely necessary that all citizens who are interested in preserving the liberty of our country show their patriotic spirit by <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>going to their polling place in spring and casting their ballot. Let nobody offer the excuse that one vote more or less will make no difference, and that the result of the vote will, in any event, be a victory over the prohibitionists. That may be so. But the victory must be so decisive that the difference between the resolution of the Legislature and the will of the people will be apparent to every American and "some people" will make the necessary deductions. The prohibitionists who last year proposed that the vote be taken are very likely anything but happy that the people are to indicate their will just at this time, when our citizens have been aroused from their indifference. And the enemies of prohibition will never forego the opportunity to give vent to their feelings.</p>
