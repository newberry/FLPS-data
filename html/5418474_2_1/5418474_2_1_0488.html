   <p>In order to hide their weakness, the Sabbathists are putting up a stubborn fight against a people's "referendum" on the submitted Sunday laws. Those fanatics know that at least nine tenths of the voters would declare themselves against the introduction of any laws, interfering with open saloons, open theaters, amusement parks, and individual freedom on Sundays.</p>
   <p>We fully understand, why the Republican politicians are siding in with the opposition against the referendum. The latter would show of course, in figures, to what extent the Republicans have supported the Prohibitionists. At the same time the referendum would point to the real enemies of the people's freedom.</p>
   <p>It is not the first time that the Republican Party has evaded a fight in the open. We hope that the Chicago citizens, particularly the Germans, will understand the situation and will remember it during the next election.</p>
