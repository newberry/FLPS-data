   <p>To the editor of the Abendpost:</p>
   <p>Concerning the editorial in the Abendpost entitled "My Country, right or wrong," I feel compelled to say a few words. In our liberty loving land the whole problem is entirely immaterial, because sixty per cent of the people are not educated enough to distinguish between right and wrong. In the home (most) children are not taught at all what is right and what is wrong, because the laws do not allow us to break a youngster's stubborn disposition by drastic means. There are plenty of cases where kindness would be wasted. In this respect, our laws are patterned after that hypocritical British system, i.e. liberal education by giving youth full rein. Our young people in particular are disposed to destruction and rowdyism, thus becoming a pest to adults. I am against any kind of brutality or too strict a discipline for children, but I am equally opposed to no discipline at all, which will make children become brutal, noisome, and dull-witted.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>[signed] Paul Wisskant.</p>
