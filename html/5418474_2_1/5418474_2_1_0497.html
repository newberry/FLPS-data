   <p>It will be hardly possible to allow the "Associated Societies" to rest on their laurels. The minority will certainly not be content to accept defeat, as is customary after American election battles, but they are boiling with rage and are slinging some awful threats. To the "real" Americans and particularly to the sensation preachers, who never sought to get in touch with the "vagabond foreigners" and consequently are addressing empty benches, it seems as an unbearable disgrace that the alien trash has victoriously defeated them. But, because they know that in Chicago they cannot overcome the intruding horde, so they want to call on the farmers for help. Ignorantly they imagine, that the country is populated by people of their kind, and that the country's politicians will take pleasure in helping them to take revenge. That is why they confidently announce in advance that the next legislature will empower "the voters of a ward" or a part of them, to decide whether the saloons should remain or go. The real prohibitionist talk foolishly of a general prohibition law and of a severe enforcement of the Puritanical Sunday law.</p>

   <p>Since the Legislature but lately passed a local option law, it would hesitate to pass a still more stringent act so soon, or one that would apply to Chicago. But since the aliens in Chicago have fully proved they know their political might and how to use it, the Republican leaders, of course, will not meet the wishes of the prohibitionists. The "Associated Societies" have not yet declared war on the Republican party; on the contrary, they have sought to restrain the latter from an evidently wrong step, to make the charter a party issue. However not having been successful in this they do not wish to regard it as a triumph over the Republican organization. They do not at all wish to carry on party politics. as long as they are not forced to it, but they only want to carry out the demand, which the charter convention has recognized unanimously, that they are entitled to, and to which even the Legislature could yield. But these demands will be renewed, inspite of the endeavors of the prohibitionists to scare them. If the Republican organization in Chicago honestly wants to assist them, then the Legislature undoubtedly will be convinced that it is the better policy to cater to the wishes of the people. If the "United Societies" will not be listened to, then they will have to introduce <span class="page-break">\3</span>their demands in the next state and presidential election. Then it will be shown if the country is really under the rule of the prohibitionists, as their local spokesman claims.</p>
   <p>Actually not only in Chicago, but in all larger cities in Illinois the immigrants and their sons are the majority. Especially the Germans are so well represented, that they can support a successful press. Also in many localities are more German farmers than Anglo-Americans. It is only because until now the foreigners have not been organized and not found common ground that the natives insolently have stepped over them roughshod. So soon as they turn from a weak defense to a forceful attack the picture of the battlefield will be materially altered. Those naturalized citizens from foreign countries and their children have no desire to form a "State within a State," nor do they want to force their views upon other citizens, but they demand that their innocent habits should not be subject to punishment and that the law befit these conditions. They will no longer tolerate the audacious tutelage of the presumptious hypocritical throng. The sooner the ruling party recognizes this and acts accordingly, the better it will be for it.</p>
