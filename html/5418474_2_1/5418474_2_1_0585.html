   <p>Through laws and police-clubs all human depravity can be exterminated, every social evil banished; some people believe in that doctrine. So a Chicago jury came to the conclusion that gambling would cease instantly and permanently, if the city administration merely deserves it. It's all "up to" the mayor and his subordinates, whether thousands in Chicago remain addicted to the gambling passion. If the man in the city hall utters the magic word, then, instantaneous greed turns to sacrifice, the desire for excitement changes to quiescence, and obstinacy to obediant indifference. Undoubtedly, it is a disgrace and shame, that Cregier(Mayor) does not pronounce the mystic syllables, which after all are the cause of the existence of hundreds of club-rooms, gambling dens, brothels, saloon-tables, (aside from the stock market,) where stakes are high. Speaking candidly and earnestly, the police are not above suspicion that they remain inactive, in exchange for a certain amount of hush-money; making a "raid" only when the army of the exploited fools, called popular opinion, compels them. It usually terminates with the arrest of a few" men of the trade" generally conviction and fine. Gambling paraphernalia is left intact, so that the "knights of the Bush" can resume their calling at the green tables, upon their return.</p>
   <p>The true vice of the nation is gambling-----not booze, etc.</p>
