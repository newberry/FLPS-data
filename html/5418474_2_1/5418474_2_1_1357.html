   <p>The foolish, shortsighted tariff-policy of our Government is responsible for the steadily growing power of our American Monopolies, which control our inland-commerce and now begin to expand their power to Over-see-countries.</p>
   <p>The best proof for this is given by the operations of the American Sugar Trust, which is dictating every phase and fluctuation of our home-market in sugar. Due to the high American import tariffs, Germany is exporting very small quantities of sugar to America.</p>
   <p>As a direct consequence, sugar stocks in this country are shrinking fast. American sugar, controlled by our sugar-kings, is getting therefore the demanded high price, to be paid for by the helpless dealers and consumers.</p>
