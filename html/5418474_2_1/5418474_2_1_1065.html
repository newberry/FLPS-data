   <p>One of our most distinguished citizens, the attorney and west park commissioner, H. H. Kohlsaat, founded an educational institution for our colored citizens, which humane act was disclosed recently. Without any publicity as to his intention or actions, Mr. Kohlsaat founded, last spring, the "Colored Men's Library Association", and donated a library for the use of colored men which has proven invaluable in the educational progress of the Negroes. The management of the library is in the hands of a board of directors consisting of nine members. The bills for received supplies are submitted to Mr. Kohlsaat, who so generously takes the responsibility of paying them out of his private funds. The sum of $1,000.00 donated by Mr. Kohlsaat, last spring, hastened the opening of the library May 2nd. It is situated on the north east corner of Dearborn and Harrison Streets. The library has disposed of over 300 books at the present time. There are several reading rooms and rooms intended for innocent games, and in connection with the institution is also an employment agency. The average daily visitors are seventy one in number. A cycle of lectures has been planned for the winter season.</p>
