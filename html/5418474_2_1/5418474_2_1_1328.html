   <p>Lucey, one of the three members of the State Public Utilities Commission, seems to be a very public-spirited man. To judge from his statements, he intends to put an end to Chicago's dissatisfaction with the Streetcar Company, by absolving the corporation from its obligation to pave and clean its right of way and to pay a certain percentage of its profits to the city; and from other contractual obligations. If he helps the company to increase the fare from five to six or seven cents, the Streetcar Company's stock, which is already one hundred and fifty per cent watered, should yield a very substantial profit for the poor shareholders. At times we wish that we could act like Bolsheviks!</p>
