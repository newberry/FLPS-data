In the meeting, held several months ago by the authorities, such a resolution was adopted, and the officers were instructed, to do anything in their power, in the name of the United Societies, to obstruct the passage of such ordinance. As it is not impossible, that the city council will have another opportunity to vote about same, and considering that a few aldermen, who signed the "pledge" of the United Societies, voted for it Monday, they should be reminded very energetically of their promise.</p>
