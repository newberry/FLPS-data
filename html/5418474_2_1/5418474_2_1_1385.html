   <p>A few days ago a local paper made a careful investigation about how much land fitted for settling is yet in the possession of the Federal Government. It came to the terrifying conclusion that only a few million acres are left. During the past thirty years, preferably since the year 1861, under the rule of the Republican Party, hundreds of millions of acres were wasted on railroad companies. In addition another lamentable evil was associated with this, the acquisition of large tracts of real estate by foreigners, - English and Scotch nobleman, "money bags", or in syndicates. These areas do not only consist of hundreds, but of thousands of square miles. One in Texas has not less than 4,700. On all these estates there exist no free farmers who own their property, but only tenant-farmers as in England or Ireland.</p>
   <p>(There follows a list of twenty-nine big landholders whose owners are foreigners) -</p>
   <p>These twentynine huge foreign landowners possess 32,260 square miles of land; this is 300 more than the area of thekingdoms of the Netherlands and Belgium combined. Would it not be wise to use here a little smoking out "a la Bismarck"?</p>
