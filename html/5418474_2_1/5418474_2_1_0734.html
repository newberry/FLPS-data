   <p>Although I have been only a short time in Chicago (I lived for the last 18 years in Ohio) I allow myself to direct a few words to the Germans of this city.</p>
   <p>As I see in different papers, our water fanatics are waging war against us German citizens. I say citizens and not saloon-keepers. Then thousands of Germans are forced to work from Monday until Saturday. I now ask, so we live in a free republic? Who prevents Catholics or Protestants from attending church? Certainly not the Germans. When we Germans believe that is benefits us after a week's work to fortify ourselves on Sundays through several glasses of beer in the midst of our friends, who has the power to forbid us to do that? Who has the power to force us to go to church, as long as we wish to visit beer halls? Let us Germans adopt the motto: "Justitia at i." Only united will we be strong.</p>
