   <p>All statute books of the states of the North American Union contain a clause which prohibits gambling in any from. This clause goes back ultimately to the Puritans, who were also responsible for the Sunday blue laws. Times were different then, probably better than at present, although that is still an open question. At any rate, the community of Puritans living in the New England States at that time were only a small group compared with the present population of the country. In these communities they wanted to live a life that to them was good, righteous, and pleasing to God. At that time conditions were not nearly as complex as they are today. The communities remained exclusive. Undesirable strangers were easily discouraged, because communication from one place to another or from state to state was difficult, They married within the community, preserved their old customs and habits, and did not go in for "foreign" ideas. They lived an extremely simple life, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>dressed plainly, ate and drank moderately, and expected others who settled in their community to lead the same kind of existence.</p>
   <p>It was absurd to attempt to impose these restrictions on the new immigrants who later came to America in vast hordes, and who brought with them different customs and habits. It was arrogant to assume that the habits and customs of the newcomers were less respectable, and to attempt to compel them by law to give up their own habits and adopt instead the Puritannical way of life. This laid the foundation for that particular kind of hypocrisy regarding morals, good behavior and conduct, which is so obnoxious to the newly arrived European even today. This hypocrisy scored its greatest triumphs under the boss rule of the Anti-Saloon League. The bootleggers and racketeers were its immediate products, as well as the snoopers and sycophants, those unscrupulous Prohibition agents, who first laid a trap for their victims and then pulled them before the judge to be sent to a penitentiary.</p>
   <p>The least guilty of them all was the bootlegger who, by violating the laws, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>provided people with the goods they did not want to be without, but the enjoyment of which was prohibited by a law concocted by hypocrites and enforced by fanatics. The bootlegger was, during Prohibition, what his counterpart, the bookmaker, is in the gambling and betting world. He fills a painful gap in the sphere of American social life. The gambling desire is deeply rooted in man. Innumerable people all over the world are gambling addicts in one form or another. Governments with a bad case of moral jitters have considered it necessary to forbid their citizens to gamble. They obviously do not trust the ordinary citizen to muster up enough will power to know when to stop playing. Where gambling becomes a passion, it constitutes a danger for the player and his dependents, whom he might gamble out of house and home. It is evident that there are characters like that, just as there are people who do not know when to stop drinking. But after all, they comprise only a small minority compared with the many millions who can enjoy a few glasses of beer without getting drunk, or who look upon gambling as a little stimulation for the nerves and keep it within reasonable bounds. Because of the few exceptions then, many governments have found it <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>advisable to forbid their subjects to gamble. But it is a well-known fact that prohibitory laws like that can never be enforced.</p>
   <p>In no country where these laws exist do those who do want to transgress pay any attention to them. If they cannot gratify their passion in public, they will find a place where they can gamble behind closed doors. It is the same old story everywhere. If we Americans wanted to abide by the gambling laws, nobody should play poker, yet they say that this, our national card game is still played night after night by hundreds of thousands of people from Alaska to Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone. And it is no secret that, in spited of the law, bets are made on horse racing all over the nation, or that in most states all kinds of gambling devices and machines are operated by the thousands, with the tacit consent of the authorities, and that they pay huge dividends. How many of our lawmakers would object violently to repeal of the gambling and betting laws because of their fear of the bad impression it would make on the voting public, and how many would be loath to handle these machines in gay society and behind closed doors, to satisfy their own <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>passion for gambling. Let everyone answer this question for himself. There is not the slightest doubt that very few would stay away from the game if they could only be sure that the public would not find out about it.</p>
   <p>This hypocrisy is unwholesome and immoral, regardless whether the hypocrite is a legislator or just another citizen. The laws which prohibit betting and gambling cannot be enforced in their present setup, because they do not take human nature into consideration. Not all men are saints, and not even the best laws could make them so. In other countries a different method has been adopted. Although gambling as such is prohibited, the gambling instinct of sinful people is nevertheless satisfied to a large degree by lotteries. In this country, lotteries are prohibited along with all other games of chance. Under government supervision lotteries which yield a steady income to the national treasury. They recognize human nature for what it is, and take advantage of it by diverting the profits to the state. It is a question whether it would be good policy to do a similar thing here in the United States. If the city of Chicago, for instance, were in a position <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>to hold lotteries, the city treasury would receive the easy millions which right now are disappearing into the pockets of professional gamblers. The gambling craze cannot be smothered, but it could be routed into the channels of legality, to be used for the general good rather than for the support of criminal elements as it is now.</p>
