   <p>We are confronted with the question of what to do with the essence and ideals of German culture. Shall we preserve them for our new home, America, or shall we cast them aside and thus permit them to disintegrate?</p>
   <p>To choose the latter course would be a crime against ourselves; moreover, it would be a greater crime against our new home, America. For the ideals of German culture can only be a source of refinement and improvement for the entire population of the United States. Even Theodore Roosevelt, who certainly has little respect for the German nation, has admitted that German culture has had a beneficial effect upon American life.</p>
   <p>The German love of order has been transplanted to America in no small degree. It is very apparent just how great this love of order is, apparent to all the world, especially at present; for although Germans are universally maligned and condemned, the great majority of them still have a very high regard for order. I am not exaggerating in the least when I say that no country in the world could fight anarchy as effectively, under such adverse conditions, as Germany has. When conditions have cleared up somewhat, and love of order has performed its miracles, Germany will be the best-governed democracy in the world. It will have the ideal government which will serve as a pattern for all other nations. That is evident from the social reforms which the German people have achieved for themselves and for which they have fought. True democracy will form the basic principle of Germany's government, and it will not be oiled with avarice and underhanded dealings, as is the case in England.</p>
   <p>But we must wake up and put aside our lassitude if we are to serve our new country, America. We must learn to know that the welfare of our country can be fostered only by united participation in public affairs (In America they call it "taking an active interest in politics".) By reason of our ideals, our sense of order, we Americans of German descent are well qualified to serve and protect our country. It is evident from the events of the past ten years that a change of affairs is absolutely imperative. Anyone who has not learned this is beyond help and does not deserve to live, for our entire existence is a fight for life. We Americans of German descent must not be found wanting; we must not be cowards in this battle, but we must fight valiantly for law and justice, for our life, even in this our country to which fate has transplanted us. We Americans of German descent must unite and form a block upon which falsehood and deceit will be shattered.</p>
   <p>Let us cast all languor aside. We despise all who are ashamed of their German origin; they are nothing but the scum of a noble race and are so considered by all right-thinking people, no matter whence these come. Unfortunately, fear has given birth to a number of such monsters.</p>
   <p>German newspapers are an effective means for uniting Americans of German descent and also for keeping them together. They must, therefore, be kept in circulation at all events. And all Americans of German descent must be united. The leaders of this union must be able men, men who have the welfare of our new home, America, at heart, men who have the necessary talent to organize, men who are ever conscious of the fact that we are not seeking German ascendancy here through the preservation of German mores, but that our sole object is the reformation of American politics through the application of German thoroughness and order.</p>
   <p>The American press of today is a cesspool. Its chief occupation is the condemnation of everything that is German, or that has a German tint. Will the American press ever realize that it is only doing great harm to the mixed population, and that it is an accursed deed to disseminate mutual hatred in a great cosmopolitan country like America?</p>
   <p>The chief duty of the leaders of the united Americans of German descent must be to counteract the despicable work of these agitators. And to that end the right men must be put in the right place.</p>
   
   <p>A union of all Americans of German descent must be effected if we are to preserve faithfulness, order, and a happy disposition, the heritage of our fathers....[Translator's note: The remaining sentences of this paragraph merely repeat thoughts expressed previously.]</p>
   <p>Americans of German descent want to be good citizens, but they also wish to exercise their rights as such. They can attain this end only if they are more active in politics, for in America everything hinges on, and revolves about, politics.</p>
