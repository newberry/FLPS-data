   <p>A letter directed to the editor in the interests of German, Bohemian and Irish workers of the stock yards, complains about the withholding of funds approximately $60,000 belonging to the laborers. Editors reply in part, "Information obtained by our reporter shows that amounts ranging from $15,00 to $55.00 per man have been retained by Swift and Company and Nelson Norris.</p>
   <p>The companies in question retain an average of $20 from each employee; same of these corporations even disdain giving a receipt, on the pretext of giving the employer security against resigning employees. Thus the company enjoys the use of $60,000 without interest. Norris only is considerate enough to write a receipt. While this system protects the employer, there is no reciprocity to the worker, in case of dismissal. A union is to be inaugurated next Sunday to cope with this injustice.</p>
