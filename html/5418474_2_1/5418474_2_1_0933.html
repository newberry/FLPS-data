   <p>In a commonwealth in which law and order rules, we do not have to fear for our life and our bodily freedom; but only too often and persistently, the attempts are repeated to rob us of our internal freedom, or in other words, to enslave us spiritually, because these annoyances cannot be considered as anything else, to which our German cultural life is exposed. The almost violent prevention of public concerts with German songs, the encroachment against the use of the German language, which, in fact, is driven towards direct, even official suppression. To crown the work of German baiting in our own country, to which we are true and loyal citizens, is the aim to suppress German newspapers. Who surrenders himself is irretrievably lost.

   <p>this country, who have represented for many years the cause of the German people, receive the full and joyous support of all those, who are esteemed as the spiritual leaders of the German population and as such enjoy their confidence. It cannot be permitted, that in a metropolis like ours, with such a large German population, a greatly esteemed newspaper, with such an honorable past as has the Illinois Staats Zeitung should succumb to the assaults of time and enemies.</p>
