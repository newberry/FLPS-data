   <p>The committee for political activities of the United Societies for Local Self government, helda meeting yesterday afternoon, at which claims as to the regulation of the Sunday question, were formulated the same to be submitted by the society to the managing committee of the charter convention tomorrow and a subcommittee consisting of Messrs. George Pfeiffer, Fritz Gloganer, Nicholas Michels, Anton J. Cermak, and Mathias Huss was appointed to submit to the charter convention the wishes of the society.</p>
   <p>The committee will insist on the change in sections 4, 5, 9 and 22 of the charter, repudiated by the citizens last year, and request that the City of Chicago, in questions specially dear to the heart of the society, should have the right of unlimited self government. These changes concern, in the first place, the determination about regulation of the Sunday question, the retail dispensation of drinks, and the issurance of licenses to clubs and societies.</p>
