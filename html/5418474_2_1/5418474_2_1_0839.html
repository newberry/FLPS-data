   <p>Recent statistics prove that the number of automobile thefts in Chicago has decreased This news will be hailed with great joy, but that joy is lessened by the fact that it is established on authority that automobile accidents have increased. And now the question arises: Who is to blame? And that question cannot be answered very readily. Immediate blame must be placed upon the drivers themselves. Many of them are very negligent and do not observe traffic laws unless they happen to see a policeman. Stricter supervision by the officers of the law may be of some help. Many an accident might be avoided by timely admonition, but not all by any means. Many accidents occur because in Chicago any one is permitted to drive an automobile who has acquired one, legally or illegally. In every thousand there are some people who are

   feeble-minded or have physical defeats or lack the sense of responsibility, and they should not be permitted to drive a car. Nobody who is color-blind and cannot distinguish red from green has any right to operate an automobile on our streets, on which red and green signal lights are used to regulate traffic.</p>
   <p>Young people of high-school age, driving through our streets at midnight, or even in the early hours of the morning, have recently been responsible for several very serious accidents. In these instances parents were unquestionably at fault because they were too lenient with their offspring and finally lost all control over them. For example, what business has an automobile loaded with half-grown boys and girls in the vicinity of a suburban roadhouse at midnight? The members of such a party not only have no sense of responsibility, either toward themselves or toward others, whom they endanger by careless driving, but also increases their devil-may-care attitude by consuming alchoholic drinks. If resulting accidents affect only the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>joyriders, it can be considered fortunate. They merely reap the wages of their unrestrained love of pleasure, and their parents reap the benefit of their own weakness and of their inability to teach their children a sense of responsibility. Unfortunately, however, it also frequently happens that youthful exuberance and failure to observe the rights of other people damage the life, health, and the property rights of innocent persons. Our schools too are to be blamed to some extent. Apparently they no longer exercise the expected and necessary influence upon the character-formation of our city children. In this respect they are a complete failure. Authorities on the subject have known for a long time that coeducation, that is, the joint instruction of boys and girls up to eighteen or nineteen years of age, and the short-sightedness of placing the instruction of growing boys into the hands of women are to a great extent responsible for the conditions that have developed in our larger cities, even though some so-called experts refuse to admit this, for obvious reasons.</p>

   <p>The increasing number of automobile accidents which are caused by pleasure-seeking joyriders are in their final analysis merely coincidental to the evil conditions attributable to the unbridled misbehavior of our school children. When a child is not taught to be polite, to be moral, to be considerate of the rights of its fellows, and to be responsible to itself and to others, and when boys do not learn manly virtues of men, and girls are not taught feminine reserve by their mothers, one cannot expect half-grown boys and girls to bother about moral restraint in any respect. They are systematically educated to be egoists who consider pleasure the highest object of life, and they maintain this attitude until real life has ground and polished them, or until they lose their lives under the wheels of an automobile. Of course, there are also parents today who educate their children as sensibly as is possible under present conditions; but the number of the others, of those who seek comfort, who let their children educate themselves, or who are even "educated" by their children, seems to increase rather than to diminish. And now a law is to be passed that <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>forbids all young people under eighteen years of age to work, thus giving them more time to loiter and more opportunity to do things that are not conducive to their welfare or to the welfare of others. And what will be the result? Whither are we drifting?</p>
