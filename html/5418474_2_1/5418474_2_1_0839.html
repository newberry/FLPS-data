Nobody who is color-blind and cannot distinguish red from green has any right to operate an automobile on our streets, on which red and green signal lights are used to regulate traffic.</p>
   <p>Young people of high-school age, driving through our streets at midnight, or even in the early hours of the morning, have recently been responsible for several very serious accidents. In these instances parents were unquestionably at fault because they were too lenient with their offspring and finally lost all control over them. For example, what business has an automobile loaded with half-grown boys and girls in the vicinity of a suburban roadhouse at midnight? The members of such a party not only have no sense of responsibility, either toward themselves or toward others, whom they endanger by careless driving, but also increases their devil-may-care attitude by consuming alchoholic drinks.

   <p>The increasing number of automobile accidents which are caused by pleasure-seeking joyriders are in their final analysis merely coincidental to the evil conditions attributable to the unbridled misbehavior of our school children. When a child is not taught to be polite, to be moral, to be considerate of the rights of its fellows, and to be responsible to itself and to others, and when boys do not learn manly virtues of men, and girls are not taught feminine reserve by their mothers, one cannot expect half-grown boys and girls to bother about moral restraint in any respect. They are systematically educated to be egoists who consider pleasure the highest object of life, and they maintain this attitude until real life has ground and polished them, or until they lose their lives under the wheels of an automobile. Of course, there are also parents today who educate their children as sensibly as is possible under present conditions; but the number of the others, of those who seek comfort, who let their children educate themselves, or who are even "educated" by their children, seems to increase rather than to diminish. And now a law is to be passed that <span class="page-break">5</span>forbids all young people under eighteen years of age to work, thus giving them more time to loiter and more opportunity to do things that are not conducive to their welfare or to the welfare of others. And what will be the result? Whither are we drifting?</p>
