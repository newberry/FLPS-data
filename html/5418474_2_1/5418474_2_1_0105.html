   <p>Dr. F. Scott McBride, the head of the Anti-Saloon League, has opened up his mouth and made an important statement. A few days ago the League held a conference in Chicago, and at that time decided to prevent the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. The carrying out of this decision is not so difficult as the layman might think. The leaders of the "drys" admit, of course, that in all the twenty-four states in which the question has been voted upon the vote was for repeal. This means nothing, however, in Dr. McBride's opinion for, of the twenty-four states in which a vote has not yet taken place, twenty were dry at the time when National Prohibition was introduced. These, the heads of the League declare, will remain true to their old love and will bring about the defeat of the repeal movement. Naturally these assertions are perfectly absurd.</p>
   
   <p>Among the states which have already voted there are several which were bone dry for decades. Probably a majority of the population was really for Prohibition, but during the last few years they have shifted over to the side of the "wets". It is likely that the same situation exists in the states which have not yet voted.</p>
   <p>The League wants to have nothing to do with the National Administration. It holds it directly responsible for the fact that many states have voted for repeal, and in view of the facts this cannot very well be denied. At the same time President Roosevelt and Postmaster General Farley, who are leading the fight against the the "dry" Amendment from the Capital, will be able to bear up under the displeasure of the League. Moreover, one need not take the assertions of the general staff of the "drys" too seriously. The worthy statesmen are aware that their rule is at an end. They want to make their followers believe that the fight is not yet lost in order, perhaps, to garner in a few more contributions for the war chest, for, after all, it is from this war chest that the gentlemen must live, and they obviously have little intention of joining the ranks of the unemployed.</p>
   <p>A remark made by McBride deserves some attention, however. He contends that only about twenty-five per cent of those eligible to vote have participated in the voting on repeal. He also declares that if the citizens could be roused from their lethargy more would take part and the opponents of repeal would win. In this statement, of course, he is putting the case topsyturvy. Experience has shown that the "drys" mobilize all their people and bring them to the polls, while the "wets," for the most part, remain at home. The opponents of Prohibition, therefore, need pay no attention to this assertion of the "dry" leader.</p>
   <p>In this connection, however, it is extremely interesting that, according to McBride's statement, only about twenty-five per cent of the eligible voters went to the polls. A few examples taken at random show that this assertion is by no means an exaggeration. A comparison of the number of those who participated in the Presidential Election with those who voted on Prohibition in four states, chosen arbitrarily, gives the following result: In Illinois 3,407,000 votes were cast in the Presidential Election, while 1,569,000 voted on Prohibition. For Iowa the corresponding figures are 1,036,000 and 611,000; for Connecticut, 593,000 and 116,000; for Washington, 614,000 and 515,000.</p>
   <p>It should be noted that the returns are not all in for the vote on Prohibition. In all cases, however, only a few remote country precincts, which usually report the results of elections very late, are missing. Consequently, with the exception of Washington, all these states show a very significant decline in the number of those voting. In Connecticut the number of votes declined a fifth, in Illinois and Iowa about a half. Since only a half of those entitled to vote participated in the Presidential Election, McBride is doubtless correct in asserting that only about twenty-five per cent of the citizens voted on the Prohibition question.</p>
   
   <p>That means that the democratic idea is bankrupt. For years there have been hot and passionate struggles over Prohibition. From statements in the press one would have to assume that the whole electorate, both men and women, were aching to get to the polls and cast their vote for or against the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. Instead, about seventy-five per cent of the citizens entitled to vote stayed at home. Hence in this case also the people have stubbornly and obstinately refused to make use of their political rights. This is one more piece of evidence that democracy in the United States of America is an illusion.</p>
