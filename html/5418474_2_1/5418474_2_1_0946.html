   <p>William J. Calhoun, former ambassador to China, and one of the shining examples of the legal profession in the Middle West, expressed his sentiments yesterday during the annual banquet of the German Club of Chicago, at the La Salle Hotel. Mr. Calhoun's statements provided a pleasant contrast when compared to those of our vituperous newspapers, which are so inimical to Germanism. In referring to a citizen's duty in a republic, he expressed the conviction that the German-Americans would come to the rescue of our nation just as fervently as of yore, when German blood flowed in profusion during the Civil War. He spoke of the German immigrant in laudable terms, regarding him as a highly desirable element in our population. In describing his characteristics, he mentioned his adaptability and prompt conformity to our citizenship duties, as required by a republic of its citizens. He considered it natural that the Germans here should show sympathy for the land of their ancestors, which is now involved in a titanic struggle.</p>
   <p>Calhoun's Speech</p>
   <p>"The great problem of our Nation," said the speaker, "consists in combining all the racial units which live here into a single, homogeneous people. During my youth, immigration in general applied only to English, Scotch, Irish, and German settlers. Adaptability was not lacking and fusion of the various elements was quickly accomplished. Racial peculiarities which are common facilitated it. Today we witness an increasing influx of other nationals, who retain their inherent traits longer because they are of a different stock. This retards our assimilation. But I am fully convinced that such an admixture will produce greater vitality and a stronger race. The blood relationship of these combined people presages a new American type.</p>
   <p>Recognizes Germanic Attitude "Our Land is surrounded by nations at war. Our problems are more serious than at other times. I am neither pro-British nor pro-German; I am an American. As a people, we are not responsible for this war, had nothing to do with its origin; and only suffer because of it. I cannot censure them if the memories of childhood days and early youth are so compelling that their sympathies revert to their loved ones, who are now an intrinsic part of this terrible conflict. It is definitely human. But they are American citizens and as such, America has the first claim. The people in a republic must have certain characteristic and the essential intelligence to uphold the principles upon which such a government is founded, and should be always conscious of the fact that a nation progresses and grows; that progress and growth create new problems which need solving. It will not do to let others worry about administrational matters. Everyone must be aware, when voting, that we are duty bound to maintain and improve what others fashioned before.</p>
   <p>Has Confidence in the Germans "I have absolute confidence in the German element whenever this question arises. Individualistic, natal peculiarities facilitate his existence, since he quickly adapts himself to a new environment, and conforms. I still remember the Civil War; the enthusiastic, sacrificial spirit of the people. I recall the slogan, 'We fight with Siegel!' It rolled over the land like a holocaust; how German blood flowed on every battlefield. I am positive that the German conduct in the past provides an indication for the future; they will be just as trustworthy as always, when our Nation is endangered."</p>
   <p>Mr. Calhoun's speech was the climax of the evening and brought the banquet to a close. It was a reunion of 800 members of the German Club, as well as their companions. The festival proved that the Club still upholds the German spirit, although the ancestral language is not used any more.</p>
   <p>With music, singing, and finally dancing, the delightful celebration came to an end.</p>
