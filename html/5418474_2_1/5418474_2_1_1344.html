   <p>Mr, Lewis, Chicago's corporation counsel, is not one of those shortsighted persons who recognize a tree only when they are pushed against it, if it is large enough he can identify it at a distance of ten feet. Nor are his intellectual powers so weak that he does not recognize a dog unless a large sign, bearing the inscription, "This is a yellow dog," is attached to the tail or some other part of the canine. He knows the animal by its color and shape. Therefore, we need not be overcome by surprise because Colonel Lewis immediately noticed the slight mistake which the streetcar companies made when they estimated the sale value of their tangible property some time ago, and the difference when they reported its taxable value recently. The difference is certainly great enough to be recognized. The Union Traction Company and the Chicago City Railway Company offered their tangible assets to the City of Chicago for $47,000,000, but estimated the value of this very <span class="page-break">\2</span>same property at less than $23,000,000 in their tax report. Anyone who is as keen-minded as Colonel Lewis needs no one to point out this great discrepancy--a sudden increase of more than one hundred per cent, or a decrease of more than fifty per cent. He immediately saw that there must be something wrong about the estimates of the traction companies; indeed, he recognized that yellow dog called tax evasion. Following the scent he soon found other yellow dogs.</p>
   <p>Since Mr. Lewis has not only a keen mind but also a keen sense of duty, he resolved to put an end to this evasion business and to see to it that the rights of the city are observed. He will not only insist that the Tax Board increase the assessed valuation of the streetcar companies as reported to the city council by the officers of these corporations, but he will also demand that the estimates of other semi-public companies and of some large estates be estimated at their full value for purposes of taxation. In this way he hopes to raise the assessed value of Chicago's taxable property by at least $200,000,000.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Mr. Lewis's procedure is beneficial to the city's treasury, and every honest citizen will wish him success. There is ample use for any eventual increase in income.</p>
   <p>However, the fact must not be overlooked that an injustice will result if the endeavors of the corporation counsel are successful. Not that the so-called semi-public corporations that operate and make money under public privilege would pay proportionately more taxes than private corporations or businessmen. However, estates, that is, the property of people who died, would be taxed more than the property of living persons. Although it is not probable that the publications that always pretend to be champions and guardians of the oppressed and poor, and especially of widows and orphans who are bereft of their natural protectors, will howl as they are wont, should Mr. Lewis succeed in having the tax valuations of the estates of Marshall Field, Henry Field, E. G. Keith, and others increased by fifty or one hundred percent, it would not alter the fact that the heirs of these millionaires would be taxed proportionately much more then other millionaires, or than any other <span class="page-break">\4</span>Chicagoans. For, if those estates are not taxed at their full value, the property of living persons will certainly not be. The movable property of estates is already taxed much more than any other because it is visible and cannot be concealed. The tax appraisers were actuated only by a sense of justice when they reported only fifty or seventy-five per cent of the actual value of estates, although the real worth could easily have been established; they knew that, as matters were, the appraisal was proportionately very high.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lewis may be able to force the semi-public corporations and the large estates to pay taxes on the full value of their property. It will not cause them much suffering and the city treasury will be benefited. However, his method will put an end to tax evasions just as much as one drop of water will cool a hot stone, since tax evasions has apparently become a part of public life. The average citizen of Chicago has no scruples about being dishonest with reference to taxes. The desire to make a display of public righteousness may urge one or the other to report and pay taxes on all his property. The trend toward dishonesty in tax matters is not an innate wickedness; moreover <span class="page-break">\5</span>it is a desire to defend one's self against a ruinous tax system. Tax evasion will not be abolished until that system has been thoroughly reorganized.</p>
