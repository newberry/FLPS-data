   <p>Wallach Brothers contemplate erecting a building with forty-four flats at 4891 North Ashland Avenue. Architect Raymond Gregori drew the plans for the $225,000 structure, which is to be built shortly after the New Year. The first and second floors will be faced with terra cotta. Elevators, mechanical refrigeration, in-a-door beds, and other recent innovations are to be included. [Translator's note: Items omitting the purchase price have not been included.]</p>
