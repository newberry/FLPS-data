   <p>The temperance fanatics suffered a defeat yesterday when Police Judge Walsh rendered his decision in the case brought before him. It was quite obvious that the sole concern of the temperance clique and their attorney was to hear sentence pronounced, while on the other hand the lawyer was not at all disposed to see those laws, desired and expected by the great majority of citizens, go into effect.</p>
   <p>The cases supposed to come before Judge Walsh yesterday were those of the innkeepers, Jacob Schneider, and Jas. A. Kavanaugh, accused by a police informer, J. W. Lyon, of violating the Sunday closing law. The accused parties and their counsel, Mr. Rubens, were present, of course, as well as Lyon, the police informer, who was accompanied by several women of the temperance organization and the extremely reputable petti-fogging young lawyer, Mr. Blanchard.</p>
   <p>As the first case was called, this young attorney requested that a jury be <span class="page-break">2</span>summoned. To this, however, Mr. Rubens protested energetically, for this is a prerogative of the defense and not of the prosecution. Judge Walsh's decision was of course in favor of Mr. Rubens, whereupon the defense lawyer made use of his prerogative, requesting the summons of a jury, and it was Mr. Blanchard's turn then to oppose that action. Judge Walsh, upheld the defense lawyer's request thus causing Mr. Blanchard to reflect, and finally to withdraw the charges made. This was done in preference to submit to the lawful court procedure.</p>
   <p>What will the temperance women next attempt in order to deprive the liberal minded public of their Sunday freedom?</p>
