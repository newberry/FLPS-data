   <p>The Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers association) held its regular meeting yesterday afternoon at the Vorwaerts Turnhalle. J. Feldkamp acted as chairman, and P. Mueller served as secretary, since Carl Bruder was absent.</p>
   <p>The only important item of the session was a report of the committee on legal matters, presented by Charles Mueller, wherein the employment of snoopers as policemen, to be paid by the citizens' league--the suggestion of the "drys" to the mayor--was considered.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mueller stated that the committee on legal matters saw the mayor and protested against the appointment of special police--members of the citizens' league--to inspect saloons, and that the mayor did not give a very assuring reply. The mayor said that he had given no definite promise to the citizens league, but had given the impression that he did not consider the request of the temperance people unreasonable. As the committee ascertained that the "drys" intend to see the mayor again, the committee repeated its objections <span class="page-break">2</span>to the scheme, and the mayor finally suggested that a written protest be presented, so that he can answer the argument of the "drys."</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller said, at this point, that the actions of the committee may have been somewhat premature. The appointment of snoopers was declared to be definitely out of order by the former mayor, Heath.</p>
   <p>Charles Mueller replied that the committee had reminded the mayor of Heath's veto, but that the mayor had said : "I am Harrison, not Heath, and I have my own opinions!"</p>
   <p>The chairman asked if anyone present believed Harrison's promises, (shouts: "Nobody, nobody!") but President Schwuchow declared the question out of order.</p>
   <p>Knoblauch thought it would be best to let the matter rest at present.</p>
   <p>Chairman Feldkamp was of a different opinion, and warned his colleagues not <span class="page-break">3</span>to trust Harrison. He knew "Old Carter" for more than eight years, and predicted that the mayor will give Chicago an iron-clad temperance ordinance, if not watched.</p>
   <p>Schwuchow repeated his protest and said that before the election Harrison had made definite promises to the Wirthsverein and that the mayor has not done anything warranting criticism, or giving cause to doubt his word.</p>
   <p>Charles Mueller said, that the mayor's answers were by no means satisfactory, but that one should consider that he had advised the committee to submit a written protest. This protest should be given to the mayor in the morning.</p>
   <p>Feldkamp, as well as Schwuchow, wanted to be present when the protest was to be handed to the mayor, and therefore the two gentlemen were included as members of the committee. Upon Schwuchow's motion, the actions of the committee were cheered.</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller, in a lengthy speech, expressed regret that the affair was <span class="page-break">4</span>treated in such a manner. Even if the mayor were willing to respect the wishes of the "drys," there is a power to balk him; the police committee would never consent to the employment of special snoopers.</p>
   <p>Feldkamp considered it best to prevent the employment of snoopers, on general principles. Above all, one must be alert, as far as Harrison is concerned, and not place any reliance in him.</p>
   <p>During the meeting, Mr. P. Mueller spoke about the nuisance tax, one dollar for applications for saloon licenses, which he considered an extortion. He was told that saloonkeepers can avoid such charges by filling out applications themselves; the blanks only cost twenty-five cents, and become effective when presented to a notary public.</p>
   <p>The same gentleman [P. Mueller] also made a motion (which passed) that all the tavernkeepers of the state should hold a convention and organize to <span class="page-break">5</span>counteract the propoganda of the temperance forces. The chairman declared that the matter should be presented to the next general meeting, regardless of Kuehne's declaration that procrastination would cause serious difficulties. The tavernkeepers must not lose any time, and should start forming a statewide organization immediately.</p>
   <p>However, no further resolutions were passed, and the meeting was adjourned until next Friday. The meeting will be held at the Aurora Turnhalle.</p>
   <p>The Protest</p>
   <p>The protest which the committee intends to present to the mayor this morning contains three main features. The employment of special police to investigate transgressions in saloons is superfluous, as any citizen can cause the arrest of a tavernkeeper who disregards the law. Second, it would cause considerable abuse if special agents of the citizens' league were enabled to arrest people <span class="page-break">6</span>without a warrant. Many saloonkeepers employ no help, and sudden arrests by detectives would cause unjustified losses. Finally, the protest calls attention to the fact that the citizens' league has employed only highly disreputable fellows, who should be given no police powers under any circumstances. One of these league employees, Walsh, was in the penitentiary, convicted on a charge of attempted murder, and La Berge and Scott were accused of rape, the evidence showing sordid details.</p>
