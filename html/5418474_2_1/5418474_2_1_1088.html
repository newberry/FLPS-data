Here in the United States, wherever a number of Jews live in one community, they form benevolent societies which do much important work.

The needy are admitted free of charge, and those able to pay are charged but a small fee.

There are six Jewish orphanages in the United States which are also well supported, one in each of the following cities: New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland, New Orleans, and San Francisco. A beautiful Jewish orphanage has been built in the city of Baltimore which is second in excellence only to that of the City of Cleveland, to which orphans from any state are admitted, and which is indebted to the Chicago Jewish women for their untiring activities and support...</p>
