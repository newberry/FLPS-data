   <p>The body of a man was found yesterday on the lake shore in the neighborhood of Rogers Park. From a letter found on the body it was identified as that of a German, by the name of John Becker. The letter was from Waukegan and was signed Sarah Dembran. Becker was told in the letter, that due to the opposition of the parents, he should look for another girl friend. Besides the letter a knife was found, the blade of which fitted the wound perfectly.</p>
   <p>Becker was a fresco painter and came as such to Chicago about two years ago. He had taken part in the Franco-German War and was 30 years of age. His last works were the mural paintings in Koody's Church, corner of Chicago Ave. and LaSalle St.</p>
