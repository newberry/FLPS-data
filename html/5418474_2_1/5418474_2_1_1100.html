   <p>It seems as though the Swedish press, which for a long time was rather hostile to everything German, has changed its attitude and is beginning to realize that salvation for the Swedes does not lie in opposition to but in harmony with the Germans. This is at least indicated by an article in the Svenska-Amerikanaren which deplores the inimical spirit of the Swedish press and states that there is no reason for any hostility between the two nationalities. Both nationalities agree on the Sunday question, also most of them have the same religion and both are fighting corruption and immorality in politics. Thus there is no reason for enemity. The article also says that the Germans and their leaders have never given any cause for this animosity, but on the contrary, have supported the Swedes whenever possible.</p>
