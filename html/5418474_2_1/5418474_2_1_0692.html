   <p>We recommend that the pious gentlemen, Mr. Elmendorff and associates, heading the Citizens' League, read the recent exposures in the case of Paxton vs. Baum, and then ask themselves what is to prevent the general public from regarding Elmendorf et al. as despicable, infamous rascals and proven hypocrites. These noble gentlemen of the Citizens' League, while professing to protect our youth from the vicious influences of saloons, show no hesitancy in hiring these same youths, in making young men susceptible to bribery--snooping at a price--and in inducing our growing boys to frequent taverns for the purpose of manufacturing evidence. Thus our young men lie about their age today, and on the morrow resort to perjury for a sum of money; they are now on the road to become corrupt jurors and party members within the next few years, if indeed they have not degenerated into robbers and murderers before that time.</p>

   <p>Yet, this band of crooks, which systematically poisons our youth, has the temerity to judge morals and cast aspersions on respectable businessmen. Incidentally, we would like to ask the state's attorney whether these saintly scoundrels can be apprehended on the basis of conspiracy and inciting others to commit crimes.</p>
