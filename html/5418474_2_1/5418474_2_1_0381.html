   <p>In our zeal to place the United States on a "bone-dry" basis we should not completely overlook a few little things which are dear to our people and would suffer unnecessarily through the general enforcement of the prohibition laws.</p>
   <p>Among these there is the pastry called mince pie which has its important place among us, especially during the winter season.</p>
   <p>We quote from the remarks of a gourmet: "Keep your hands off our American mince pie. Some among those who relish it do not know what ingredients are necessary to the manufacture of this pastry, and hence are perhaps unaware of the possible effect which prohibition may have on it.</p>
   <p>"Well, wherever mincemeat is made in sufficient quantities to last through the <span class="page-break">\2</span>winter, a certain ingredient is added to keep the mixture from spoiling. Every New England housewife knows that this 'preserver' is sherry or brandy, or better still, both, without one, or both, the delicacy simply has not the right 'tone'. Let us hope that the manufacturers will be permitted to continue the use of this necessary ingredient in sufficient quantity; they are just as much entitled to use it as the manufacturers of patent medicines are."</p>
