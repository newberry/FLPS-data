   <p>The temperance representatives are making preparations to raise a fund of $100,000 to be used in the approaching fight with the liberal elements. Churches and private individuals are requested to furnish the capital. The finance committee, under the leadership of C. E. Cornell, who concocted the collection plans, expects no difficulties. Five hundred private parties shall be asked to contribute $100 each and the churches will be requested to make a special collection for the ensuing battle against the liberal element. Besides, Mr. Cornell contemplates donations of $1.00, from families. The entire city is to be divided into districts which will be systematically farmed by the district leaders. The Board of Finance, will hold its first meeting on Wednesday at the Methodist Publishing House. Pastor Boynton declared yesterday, that the cause of the Prohibitionists will be lost, if the churches of the city do not come to the rescue.</p>
