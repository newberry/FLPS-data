   <p>If you would believe the business-reports of oatmeal-manufacturers, the latter are facing complete bankruptcy. As far as we know, the actual situation is different.</p>
   <p>Those oatmeal-manufacturers, who are paying, according to information on hand, very poor wages for labor, have combined into a well solidified trust. This trust found ways to induce the Mc Kinley tariff expert-committee, to introduce a 100 increase on the importation tax for oatmeal. This increase was adopted and legalized for the purpose, to enable an effective competition of American Oatmeal manufacturers on the world-market; in spite of the fact that these poor manufacturers are exporting already every year about 25,000,000 pounds of American oatmeal.</p>
   <p>As soon as the increased importation tax became law, the Oatmeal-Trust raised the oatmeal price for American consumers 1Â¢ per pound, while foreign exporters of oatmeal abroad saw their shipments to this country stopped. To make this disgusting picture of greed and selfishness complete, the American Oatmeal-manu-facturers effected another wage-decrease, which for instance in the factories of Akron, Onio, is 40-50 per cent.</p>
