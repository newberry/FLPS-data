   <p>In order to make the agitation against saloons still more effective, the Hydepark Protective Association, has decided to be incorporated. As soon as the Incorporation-Charter has been granted, the said Association will hold propaganda-meetings in various sections of Hydepark. These meetings will explain to the public, the good points of drinking water, and also of course, will have collections taken up to swell the Agitation Funds. By and by, they hope, Prohibition will spread to other parts of Chicago.</p>
