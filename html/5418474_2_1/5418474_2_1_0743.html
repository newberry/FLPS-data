   <p>Captain Gund has been attacked violently the last few days, because last Sunday he had not informed against the Turnhalle nor against any tavern keeper in his district. On account of that he was called to justify himself before Washburn. Captain Gund declared that he had seen no open saloons on the north side. He also stated that no drinks were sold nor consumed at the Turnhalle and that this is true, anyone who was there last Sunday can authenticate. It is said a few glasses of beer were drunk in the lower hall. Captain Gund, who was on service in the upper hall, could not have been aware of that. It is most contemptible to see newspapers open their columns to such news.</p>
