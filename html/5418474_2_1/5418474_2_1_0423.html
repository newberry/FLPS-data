   <p>The recent successes of the Prohibitionists have proved that Prohibition will not work. It augments the evil which it is supposed to stamp out. Experience shows that since the manufacture of whisky was prohibited and its price was tremendously increased because of the high war tax, those [people] were right who insisted, time and again, that the manufacture and consumption of beer and light wines should not only be permitted but even encouraged, if true temperance were aimed at and whiskey and other intoxicating liquors were to be driven out. As over here, so "over there"--in France, where soldiers are not allowed to drink hard liquor, but where beer and wine are premitted. And as far as the French are concerned, more than permitted: every "poilu" gets a liter of wine a day as part of his ration, just as the Germans get their beer, if possible. But even the most fanatical Prohibitionists could not say that the French soldiers were not good fighters, but slovenly and incapable (as indeed they should be, if we were to believe the claims made by fanatics regarding even the moderate consumption of wine). These Frenchmen are now the closest <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>comrades-in-arms of our boys. They fight side by side with them, share their dangers and all the little pleasures of life at the front: The white bread which the Frenchman cherishes and which he gets only rarely, the delicacies which the "poilu" always knows how to get hold of, cigarettes and tobacco--and wine! It is with these wine-happy French "poilus" that "our boys" drink, after braving danger and exertion. Were they poor fighters? Are they weak and stupid?</p>
   <p>At the present time, there are 1,300,000 young Americans "over there"; if the war keeps on, their number will rise to at least three million. And these three million will see and learn by their own experience what true moderation means; they will learn to "drink" as the French drink, and the Italians and also the Germans: that is, without getting intoxicated. They will return, sooner or later, as men natured beyond their years in the hardest and most dangerous school. They will want to have a voice in the politics and legislation of their country, and they will not only have the best right to it but also the power and influence to achieve it. They will be "thirsty" when they come back and will <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a> want to drink as they did during hard times in France, declared two American captains over here on furlough, in almost the same words spoken on separate occasions. They will not shoulder the yoke of Prohibition without protest--as we are doing now. They will consider it their proper right to be allowed to drink beer and light wines, and they will to it that they get them.</p>
   <p>Maybe the Prohibitionists suspect just that, maybe they say to themselves: Now or never! After "our boys" have returned from France and its demoralizing influence, we will hardly have a chance to enforce national Prohibition. Therefore it has to be put over as a war measure--then nobody will be able to change an accomplished fact.</p>
   <p>Perhaps that is the way the Prohibitionists have figured it out. But perhaps this is also recognized by a number of senators sufficient to defeat the bill and brand the measure as completely disloyal, un-American, and unpatriotic. If not, it is almost certain that the President will assume this point of view, and will veto the Prohibition bill, thus preserving the right for those who <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>are coming back and in hose hands the future of our country lies, to decide for themselves about their future way of living. This is a purely democratic demand, and the democratic idea, for which this nation is fighting, must be honored and recognized not only in foreign countries but also here at home.</p>
