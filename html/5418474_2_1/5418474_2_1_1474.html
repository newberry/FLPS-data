   <p>The North side is usually progressive and in the lead, giving us both good and bad examples for emulation, but as a matter of variety it now supplies the latter. The livery owners and undertakers have formed a trust, and their first official transaction revolved about a mere matter of price. The rates for coaches have been increased from 4 and 5 to 5 and 6. During the last decade the customary change was 4 for the ride to Graceland or Bonifacious cemeteries, and 5 to all others. But now the gentlemen of the trust consider this an insufficient remuneration. Horses, coaches, harness, feed, and wages have risen, so according to their opinion, one need not look <span class="gap">[gap]</span>tically for suitable pretext to justify the increase. The new "trust" has been organized as follows: Charles <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, President; <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, secretary; W. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, treasurer.</p>
