   <p>The Food Conservation Act--a very pretty name--of November 21, 1918, through its notorious prohibition rider, forbids the manufacture of intoxicating liquors on May 1 and thereafter, and the sale of such liquors on July 1 and thereafter.</p>
   <p>What is "intoxicating liquor"? When is a liquor to be considered "intoxicating"?</p>
   <p>The wise men in our Internal Revenue Office have declared that, according to the law of November 1, 1918, and according to a prior law which was enacted on August 10, 1917, every brew which contains more than one half of one per cent of alcohol is prohibited and, therefore, intoxicating.</p>
   <p>The members of the Lager Beer Brewers' Board of Trade, an organization <span class="page-break">\2</span>which has its headquarters in New York and is composed of the officials of forty-three breweries in New York and New Jersey, assert that the above definition of "intoxicating" is arbitrary and wrong. They state that a much greater quantity than one half of one per cent is necessary to make a drink intoxicating; that malt liquor, or beer, could not be considered intoxicating if it contained not more than two and three-quarters percent of alcohol by weight, or not more than three and three-tenths per cent by volume. They assured their attorneys, Elihu Root and William D. Guthrie, two prominent New York lawyers, that the truth of this assertion could be attested to by expert scientific testimony. Root and Guthrie then advised them to resume the manufacture and sale of beer which has an alcoholic content of no more than two and three-quarters per cent by weight and three and three-tenths per cent by volume, since the various prohibitions were directed against "intoxicating" liquors only, and the Internal Revenue Office's unfounded and incorrect definition of "intoxicating" could not be looked upon as binding.</p>
   <p>It is reported that every brewer in our country was notified by telegraph of <span class="page-break">\3</span>the New York Brewers' procedure last evening, and it is believed that many of those who are not affiliated with the New York organization will also resume making beer.</p>
   <p>That is to be expected. It would be queer if matters turned out differently. From the fact that Root and Guthrie gave the advice it is to be inferred that they know what they are about, and believe that they can win the case if it can be proved that beer with an alcoholic content of two and three-quarters per cent is not intoxicating--and that should not be difficult. It is not necessary to visit a Bavarian beer hall or some other meeting place of confirmed drinkers to find many expert men (and women, too) who will swear, according to their best knowledge and conscience, that a halfway normal person cannot possibly become even nearly intoxicated by drinking two and three-quarters per cent beer; and that a person could not possibly contain enough of the stuff to make him drunk. And one will be able to find thousands of experts who will testify to the harmlessness of two and three-quarters per cent beer--the only danger is that one might be careless enough to select men who will declare on the witness stand that a brew of that kind <span class="page-break">\4</span>is not only not intoxicating, but also not wholesome, and that such horrible swipes should not be called beer.</p>
   <p>The New York brewers are to be commended upon their procedure, and we wish them, and all those who follow their example, good luck and success. Of course they have their business interests at heart above all else, but at the same time they are working for the welfare of the entire community, for it is in the interest of all--yes, the welfare of all demands--that the manufacture and sale of such a harmless and wholesome drink as light beer be permitted.</p>
   <p>By interceding for themselves the brewers are fostering the cause of the community, and especially of the liberal element of the population. Perhaps they will succeed in obtaining light beer for the people--at least for the present. But they will not succeed for all time to come unless the people themselves clearly indicate their wish in the matter. No brewers' association, or any other organization or group, or all of them combined, can, or will be able to, prevent the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment <span class="page-break">\5</span>if the people do not declare themselves against prohibition at every opportunity.</p>
   <p>The people of Chicago will have an opportunity on April 1. The question is, "Shall Chicago be included in the prohibition area?" The answer should be seven hundred thousand noes.</p>
