   <p>In a short time the "Personal Liberty League" will have been one year in existence. If one considers the accomplishments of the League so far, one must concede that they are rather small. It has gained no results in the temperance question nor on the Sunday question, nor in the conflict between the mayor and the police. The aim of the "Personal Liberty League" is to protect the liberty of the individual against the law. The League should not forget this aim. These criticism are made not in order to harm but to benefit the League.</p>
