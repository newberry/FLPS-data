   <p>Americans have a proverb: "He bites off his nose to spite his face, " an adage which could well be applied to all German-Americans who, while nursing a grudge and seething with resentment, are prone to launch a malicious campaign against this country and its institutions, against the people and their concepts of culture. But this would cause never-ending conflicts, and would only jeopandize or all vitiate all future cultural achievements which might be accomplished by our blood brothers whose roots are deep in the soil of this country.</p>
   <p>Just recently voices were heard making comparisons between the past and present <span class="page-break">\2</span>achievements of German-Americans. Bitter complaints were heard concerning the ingratitude of the American people; but one must not forget that the people have never been made to realize fully just how much they owed to the Americans who came of German stock. On the other hand we cannot spare German-Americans the reproach that as far as ideas and suggestions are concerned they have often shown ingenuity, but that time and time again their plans have been snatched away from them; and because of their inertia and loss of interest their well-meant projects have not always worked for the common good.</p>
   <p>Our objective, to clear the path for future creative work by self-criticism, can only be reached if we become acquainted with the trend of the times, and if we apply the essence of various Weltanschauungen as a scale to evaluate our own position with relation to present-day aspects. The reader will have to interpret the sketches presented here according to his station in life and his class concepts; if a majority arrives at the same conclusion it is to be hoped that common sentiment will provide the driving power for common <span class="page-break">\3</span>action and a more solid co-operation. Such action and co-operation must be utilized for the tremendous tasks which we will undoubtedly have to face.</p>
   <p>The economic unrest which since the beginning of the year has been causing steadily increasing mass movements, demands strong measures designed to put industry and commerce back on a safe and normal basis. But a sound policy--one unaffected either by revolutionary phrases or uncalled for jingoism--must find a way for the solution of these problems.</p>
   <p>At present the great strike of the steel and foundry workers is causing quite a sensation. We have been hearing and reading all kinds of stories, and the union officials who claim to represent the workers insist that the refusal of the directors of the steel trust to enter into negotiations with them made the strike inevitable and was the cause of all this strife.</p>
   <p>But Judge Elbert H. Gary adheres to principles which apparently are not open <span class="page-break">\4</span>to arbitration.</p>
   <p>The uninitiated cannot make any sense out of these conflicting explanations and opinions. The investigation before the Senate Committee did not shed any light on the cause of the controversy. The assertion of the union officials that the United States Steel Corporation (known also as the "Steel Trust") do not tolerate any unions in their plants does not represent the full truth; whereas the description of bad working conditions--which admittedly exist and which have to be remedied--does not have much effect because not a single employee of the steel works has given testimony about the horrible conditions existing there.</p>
   <p>Judge Gary declared weeks ago that the majority of employees were not in agreement with the principles of the American Federation of Labor; but five weeks ago in Youngstown, Ohio, at a convention of twenty-four national trade union leaders, each of whom claimed jurisdiction over the steel workers, the first point of the demands was the notorious "check-off system". These <span class="page-break">\5</span>demands were submitted to Mr. Elbert H. Gary, and thus the possibility of a conference with him was destroyed right at the start. The "check-off system" would have made the corporation a dues collector for the unions; all that would have been left for the union officials to do was to call at the offices of the various plants each payday and collect the money retained for dues and fines.</p>
   <p>Compliance with such demands would have obviated the strike at this time, but it would also have raised such great problems for the future that it was deemed more advisable to accept this challenge and to find within the next few weeks the right solution: one dictated by a mutual understanding of the principles involved.</p>
   <p>This leads us right up to the focal point of the controversy; and now we have to digress a little from our subject, and attempt to arrive at an understanding of all our problems by a different route.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Unionism, as it was developed in Germany and in Central European countries before the war, and as it will be further strengthened and extended by social legislation in Germany, is radically different in essence, ideology, and objectives from the system established in England and, since 1888, in this country. The underlying principle of the German system has been and still is: To secure for the workers the right to representation by committees of workers employed at the plant for the purpose either of making demands or the alleviation of poor working conditions. The officials of the unions are hardly ever called upon to participate in conferences with the plant management. A system of this kind enables the workers better to understand their position in the factory, and to exercise the self-discipline which has so often aroused the scorn and contempt of the "parlor socialists" in this country, but which nevertheless safeguards the stability of the working personnel and makes for order in the plant. The English and the <span class="page-break">\7</span>American unions, on the other hand, place the power of representation and arbitration in the hands of "business agents" or "walking delegates," whose main objective naturally must be to employ every means to retain their well-paying positions and to prolong their power while in office.</p>
   <p>The drawbacks--the "propaganda of power" which is running wild, especially in this country--are excrescences of a system the main elements of which were briefly referred to above. One would assume, therefore, that German-Americans would give preference to the German system. As a matter of fact, German workers who were expelled from Germany under the Socialist Law [Socialistengesetz] have laid the foundation in this country for the extension of a representative body of workers according to the German pattern, and have begun at their own expense, the task of organizing workers into unions.</p>
   <p>The intention to do this was already prevalent in 1885, but their lack of knowledge of the English language was a stumbling block for these pioneers. They had to make use of people who through their knowledge of the language <span class="page-break">\8</span>were able to translate into English the German theorists' ideas for the promotion of [social] education and organization.</p>
   <p>The meeting place, of these elements--mainly composed of German refugees some of whom were well-educated men--was Justus Schwab's Bierhalle on Fourth Street in New York City, a place also frequented by Samuel Gompers or Gompertz, as the New Yorker Volkszeitung used to print his name. In his close daily contact with these people Gompers gained such a good knowledge of the German language that he could soon speak it fluently. They gave this young man the financial support which enabled him to get along, since he was barely able to make a living in his trade of cigar making. He had made a name for himself through the investigation of the horrible conditions which existed in New York's home industry at that time.</p>
   <p>Soon afterwards the New Yorker Volkszeitung engaged Gompers as a special reporter, and he remained in the services of this paper until he was ready <span class="page-break">\9</span>to begin his career as a union leader.</p>
   <p>The documents of what was at that time the headquarters of the "Socialistic Labor Party," which were preserved by Hugo Vogt, reveal that in April, 1887, Gompers turned for financial aid to the Germans--mainly those who had been expelled from the old country--to help in organizing the workers of America into "open" unions, in contradistinction to "secret" workers' organizations. The documents tell us further that Gompers, who of late evinces hatred toward anything remotely German, reached his present station only through the contributions of German Socialists who had once been compelled to leave the old country [for political reasons].</p>
   <p>At that time Gompers had been trusted, probably with full justification, to promote in this country the German system of unionism as outlined above. This confidence still existed in 1895, when German organizations gave a banquet for him at Wilzig's Halle, 184 East Fourth Street, New York City, on the <span class="page-break">\10</span>occasion of his immigrant father's arrival from London, where Gompers himself was born He and his old father, who appeared in the garb of an orthodox Jew, made speeches in German praising the unselfishness of the Germans is this country their activities and their adherence to principle <span class="gap">[gap]</span> workers' organizations,</p>

He and his old father, who appeared in the garb of an orthodox Jew, made speeches in German praising the unselfishness of the Germans in this country, their activities, and their adherence to principles.</p>
   <p>The system which was to be introduced in the workshops of this country, and which had been sponsored by German energy and financially aided by the contributions of Germans (mostly political refugees), was soon displaced in this country by the English system. In the course of time this system degenerated and was the cause of many strikes and controversies; it is this system which must be blamed for the present strike. But the English system has seen its day, and we will show that the failure of the strike at the Bethlehem Steel Company, where the German system was introduced eighteen months ago, must make it clear to the officials of the United States Steel Corporation that salvation will be found in the German system; that in order to obviate strikes and violence, the right to arbitrate disputes over working conditions <span class="page-break">\12</span>must be conceded the workers of these giant corporations all over the country--this excludes all "business agents" who are not shop employees. Once this concession is made, the questions of working hours, wages, and plant rules will be solved in a much more satisfactory manner than by arbitration with corrupt union officials.</p>
   <p>But if the union leaders who are directing the present strike are willing to shoulder the responsibility for the prolongation of the present intolerable conditions by insisting that "Gary" has to negotiate with them, then many thousands who have on various occasions demonstrated their ability to arbitrate with corporation officials may become "strike breakers"; then violence will be rampant, and blood will flow. Then it will be difficult if not impossible to eliminate bad conditions, or to placate a resentful mob by the intelligence and the objective judgment of the true representatives of the steel workers. The danger of revolutionary propaganda may also have to be considered.</p>
