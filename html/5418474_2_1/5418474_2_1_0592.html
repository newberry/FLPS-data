   <p>The Sunday Observance Association arranged a mass-meeting yesterday, and 18 speakers were scheduled to address the audience.</p>
   <p>Rev. J. Berger, a German clergyman of this city, was one of the first and best speakers. He asserted that he enjoyed taking a part in the meeting, and that he was proud to represent the German nationality in the interest of Sunday observance. "The Germans," he stated, "never remain passive and are also in this movement in the front lines. The Germans are law-abiding citizens, and demand that the laws be observed. The observance of Sunday is constitutional, and those who try to abolish it, undermine the liberty of the people. The large audience is an evidence that all nationalities are interested in the enforcement of Sunday laws, and that, above all, the workers want a day of rest. Since every decent person is a worker, therefore, every citizen demands the observance of Sunday."</p>
   <p>At the close of the meeting resolutions were read requesting the Mayor, the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Police department, and even the state legislature, to enforce the existing Sunday laws.</p>
