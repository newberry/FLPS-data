   <p>During Woodrow Wilson's candidacy for the presidency he seemed to have borrowed the thunder from Jupiter, threatened to bust the dreadful trusts. President Wilson has certainly thundered enough, and even now he occasionally looses a muffled noise, but his lightning seems to strike in the wrong place. The Democrats shout that the trusts grew up under the Republican regime. This reproach should fill the Republicans with pride, because only in flowering times can powerful enterprises or combinations of powerful enterprises originate under the present administration enterprising spirit really finds no encouragement, and the wheels do not double their humming, instead they are at a standstill. But if under the Republican protective tariff, American industry gained rightfully admired expansion, and with its expansion enabled the origin of trusts, then it was also a Republican administration, which first thought of exterminating this drawback, and created laws accordingly. The anti-trust laws were made and executed under the Republican president, Harrison, in 1890. His successor, the Democrat Cleveland, let the anti-trust laws sleep, but on the other hand, he closed a little business deal with the largest financiers of the country, Morgan and Belmont, which brought good profits to the parties concerned. We would like to tell a certain Democratic newspaper that Cleveland sold to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Syndicate mentioned, Government Bonds whose market value was $114.00 at $104.00 a piece. Mr. Cleveland was, until Woodrow Wilson, the last Democratic president. The nation did not seem to favor such Democracy because this most democratic of all democratic presidents obstinately refused to take action against the sugar trust, whose transactions at that time had such bad smell. He was immediately followed by the martyred President, McKinley, a Republican trust breeder, as the Democrats call him. This trust breeder in the name of the nation took up the fight against one of the most powerful syndicates, the Union Pacific, and carried it through victoriously, to the nation's advantage. Against the two immediate predecessors of Wilson, Roosevelt and Taft, the Democrats made the accusation that they warmed the trusts with their hearts' blood. And Roosevelt especially was suspected of criminal flirtation with the corporations. None the less it was this Roosevelt, who enforced the dissolution of the most gigantic combination of the Northwestern Railroad which had been brought under unified control, in spite of Morgan's and Hill's poisoned weapons. President Taft called to account the Oil trust, the tobacco trust, the meat trust, and coal trust, and not to the Republican government, but to the law courts is it attributable, that the corporations did not feel the full weight of the law. On the other hand, what has Wilson the "Thunderer", the trust destroyer, done? While the Republican presidents, thundered less and acted more, Mr. Wilson pleases himself with whipping <span class="page-break">\3</span>the anti-trust laws through which not so much threatens the trusts as it threatens the entire economic welfare of the country. With his tariff policy, he directed the first deadly blow against commerce and industry, the planned antitrust laws will be the finishing stroke. And still there are papers, even German, who perceive in Wilson a Messiah and worship him. They have ears, but do not hear, they eyes, but do not see. But they surely will feel it, when the whole weight of the mistaken and fundamentally wrong policy will lie crushingly upon the whole nation.</p>
