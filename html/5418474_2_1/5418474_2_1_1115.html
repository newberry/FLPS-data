   <p>Fred Regan has been established for several days a custodian in the house, 5<span class="gap">[gap]</span>2 Canal street. On Saturday, policeman Barton, No. 4<span class="gap">[gap]</span> came to the house and said, "You German dog! You have no business to be here," and in spite of Mr. Regan's protest that he was there in an official capacity, he took him to the police station. Mr. Regan was held there until Monday, having robbers and criminals as his companions. Only yesterday he was released. We advise Mr. Regan to introduce an indemnity lawsuit.</p>
