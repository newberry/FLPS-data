   <p>Fred Degan has been established for several days a custodian in the house, 552 Canal street. On Saturday, policeman Barton, No. 408 came to the house and said, "You German dog! You have no business to be here," and in spite of Mr. Regan's protest that he was there in an official capacity, he took him to the police station. Mr. Degan was held there until Monday, having robbers and criminals as his companions. Only yesterday he was released. We advise Mr. Degan to introduce an indemnity lawsuit.</p>
