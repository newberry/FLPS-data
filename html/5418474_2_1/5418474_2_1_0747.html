   <p>It was policeman Trenlieb, who was beaten up Sunday at the Aurora "Turnhalle". The Sergeant of the Chicago Avenue station had taken policeman Hoffman from his beat and ordered him to go without his star, dressed in civilian clothes to the Aurora "Turnhalle", in order to spy. Hoffman consented to go with his star as a policeman, but not as a spy. Policeman Trenlieb was more willing. After he had entered the place, he was recognized and politely asked if he came as a citizen or as policeman. As his answer was evasive, he was beaten up. He complained to the sergeant. Indignant, the latter went to the hall with five men. Who had beaten up the policeman? He was told that a civilian had been beaten up, but no one had seen a policeman. When the sergeant went to the manager, it was intimated that he might undergo the same treatment. Thereupon the sergeant and his men decided to withdraw at once.</p>
