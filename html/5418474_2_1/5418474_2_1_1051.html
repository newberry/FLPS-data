   <p>We have received the following communication, evidently the expression of a crank. (It has been fully signed by the writer and that is the only reason why we gave it any consideration.)</p>
   <p>Illinois Staats Zeitung! If you declare that you are not prejudiced against the Jews, then you should not use every opportunity to write the word "Jew" in your news-paper. If ten Christians are convicted for robbery, larceny or manslaughter, then you never state that "so and so" the Protestant or Catholic committed murder because he finds delight in the perpetration of such fiendish outrages - but if a Jewish peddler sells his wares without a license and is cited to court, then your paper instantly says: the Jew.</p>
   <p>You should remember, that your paper is not circulating in Humgary, Bohemia or Russia where your agitating might be appropriate. Here you only injure yourself by your constant Jew-baiting and you should duly consider, what power you are challenging.</p>
   <p>That Mr. "3. C.". perceived such an "eternal anti-Jewish agitation" in the Staats Zeitung which he says we have practiced for years, is only a matter of poetic - license, to which he resorts, and if we base our judgment on his text, <span class="page-break">\2</span>it appears that he has only been a few weeks in Chicago, Anyway, it is politer to assume it, than to say that the contributor is foolish; and it must be essentially that, if he has read the Staats Zeitung for years, and it brought him to the conclusion "that the paper indulges in constant Jew-bating". Under such circumstances we must believe him to be idiotic but prefer to conclude that he is "grass-Green", has hardly read a half dozen issues of our paper but perchance found the appelation "Polish" or "Russian Jew" in one of the meager Police-notices. Talking the above supposition for granted, we would like to convince him, that his childish sensitivity, to which he became addicted (verbatim: brought along) in Hungary, Bohemia and Russia, is entirely out of place over here. In Hungary a Jew may pretend to be a Magyar, or a Czech in Bohemia, i. e. he may cowardly deny his racial origin, but in America there is no cause for such conduct and the appelation "Jew" is no more insulting than is the word "German" to the Germans. Quite to the contrary, he should harbor suspicions toward those who assiduously avoid the word "Jew", and always circumscribe it as "our Hebrew" or "Israelitie Co-citizens", also our "citizens of the Mosaic belief". Amongst those who use such timid, soft peddled expressions, we find that within their innermost, darkest recesses of the mind and heart, - hovers the "damned Jew". That sort of people, which apparently appear so polite and amiable to our "(Mr.) Contributor", are the very ones, who <span class="page-break">\3</span>bear a hatred against the Jews, and animosity which they carefully nurture within the confines of their uncommunicative mind.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the contributor will percieve this, after he has sojourned in this country for longer periods. He may even notice then, that the enemies (jealous competitors) of the Staats Zeitung, designate it as a Jewish-paper, merely because it is an avowed enemy of such despicable conduct, and professes to be a genuine admirer of the second German Emperor, whom all the indolent opportunists, Jingoes and Knights call "Judenkaiser" (Emperor of the Jews.) As a matter of confidence we may tell him, that one of our readers in the distant Territory of Washington canceled his subscription, because he is not willing to read such a "damned yiddish paper". It does not affect us. We have the same benignant smile for the one foolishness as we are amused by the other. The Illinois Staats Zeitung is neither a Jewish paper nor a Jew-baiting publication. That sickly sensitivity, which attempts to classify it into one or the other species, only arouses disdain in us, tempered with a modicum of compassion. Concerning one point however, the contributor and such of his associates who suffer from a similar mental derangement, should seek enlightenment. If the word Jew is used here, it has not any reference to religion whatsoever, as far as the religion of the individual is concerned, (it is not a distinction <span class="page-break">\4</span>between beliefs such as Catholic, Protestant etc.) but solely refers to racial origin or population. We find in those interesting countries which the contributor mentions, to which he might add Galizia and Rumania , part of Asia, many lamentably ignorant and superstitutious Jews (Chassidim). Their similarity with the educated, free-thinking Jews of Germany, as far as mental and religious aspects are concerned, are as remotely alike as the voodoo worshipers of Dark-Africa when compared with a Professor of philosophy in Berlin,- but the racial origin of both is the same. The attempt to eliminate all racial thoughts or suggestions by restricting ourselves to a mere mentioning of paper-citizenship, will be useless as long as the race remains sure and unmixed (which it is at present, with very few exceptions.) There are German citizens who are of Wendish, Danish, Polish and Gallic - origin:- but none feel offended, regardless of the reason, if their past racial offiliations are alluded to.</p>
   <p>Why are the menbers of the Jewish race more sensitive than others? Probably only, because in the central and eastern European countries the word Jew is associated with calumny since mediaeval times. This condition does not exist here. Even if there should be an occasional case, then the surest means for the promulgation of such an attitude, consists in the face that Jews themselves are ashamed of that name. The Jew who is sure of himself has a clear understanding <span class="page-break">\5</span>of his social position and ability, has no such sentiments. When Mr. Julius Rosenthal was interviewed by a reporter of the "Globe", the other day, and the news-paper man refered to him as a prominent "Hebrew citizen" Mr. Rosen-thal replied curtly, if not gruffly; "Never mind that,-I am not a Hebrew, .Israelite, or Mosaical man, but simply a Jew". This item, the contributor "B. C." should consider as an example; it will save him from sending us such nonsense in the future.</p>
