   <p>The Grand Jury which yesterday ended its activity has not made itself the tool of the malicious venom of the wretched slanderers of Tribune, Times and Evening Journal as these had confidently expected. But neither has it had the courage to boldly state of what no doubt all its members must be convinced. It has heard numerous witnesses about the "uprising" of January 15, and cannot have gained any other conviction that the three papers are guilty-if not before the law, at least before the moral consciousness of every honorable man- of a common crime;- of the crime of having invented, with a turpitude and shamelessness unexampled even in America, an uprising that severely affected the credit of the city.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances the Grand Jury would have done its duty only if it has pilloried before public opinion the perpetrators of the infamous calumniations, that described Chicago as the place of a "Prussian an uprising" and of "Communistic violence..."</p>
