   <p>We are informed of the Police Commissioner's plan to replace Capt. George Miller, who was forced to resign, by Sergeant Lull as Police Captain of West Side. Lull distinguished himself at the fire limit demonstration by the brutality, with which he kicked and beat the Germans on the stairs and out of the door of the City Hall, who were not conscious of any impropriety. The opinion is abroad that Miller had been forced to retire, not so much on account of the infraction which he fully confessed, but in order to make possible the appointment of Mr. Gund as Police Captain of the North Side - because "two Germans could not well be captains." If Mr. Gund, or George Miller, can be regarded as the better representative of the Germans, especially of German education, is something that can be left to the judgment of any unprejudiced person.</p>
