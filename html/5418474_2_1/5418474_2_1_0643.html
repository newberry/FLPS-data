   <p>Under the name of National German American Prohibition League a number of fanatical German prohibitionists organized a society. Yesterday, in Chicago, this group chose as its object to do all in its power to make prohibition a reality. Judging future prospects of these simpletons by their meeting, yesterday, which was arranged for the purpose of organizing the society, it can be predicted that this movement will fail sooner or later, since the attitude of the Germans towards prohibition is well-known, and they will not be effected by fanatical prohibitionists.</p>
   <p>There were hardly sufficient persons present to fill the places of officials. After a long battle of words the following officials were elected: H. Ricke, President; B. A. Eisener, of Wheaton, and J. H. Niz, 1st and 2nd Vice-Presidents; J. H. Reissman, Secretary; and C. G. Schultz, Treasurer.</p>
