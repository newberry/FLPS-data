   <p>Various Church-Organizations of Puritan character and numerous women-societies of wealthy people are agitating again for the adoption of a Federal Prohibition Law.</p>
   <p>To counteract this movement, the German-American League has circulated a strong protest concerning the reactionary activity of Puritans, who pretend to represent the opinion of the American People. The said League is urging all Americans of German origin to stand up and fight for the Idealism of their Ancesters, who regardless of Kings and Emperors, would not relinquish all those inherited habits and innocent pleasures of life.</p>
   <p>Furthermore the League says- Prohibition as a legal measure never will improve or reform human character, but in the end will be used as a club, to down personal freedom and choke public opinion.</p>
