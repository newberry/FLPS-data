   <p>In 1922, former vice-president Coolidge spoke before the American Bar Association. At that time, he said: "State rights are justified, the authority of the State remains and must always be respected. [This respect for the State] is the sole fountain of individual liberty. It does not countenance any obnoxious and unwarranted interference by the government in the affairs of the people. There exists no right for intervention in strictly private affairs."</p>
   <p>A few days ago, Mr. Coolidge delivered another speech, expressing an entirely different political philosophy. He asserted: "As civilization becomes more complex, it will be necessary to gradually abolish unrestricted activities, and we will eventually have to live in conformance to the dictates of government regulation. But it is also true that the benefits and privileges accruing to a member of organized society will thereby increase in a much greater proportion.</p>

    This position, which in the long run will be of benefit to the individual and will further safeguard the Unnion, can best be summarized in a single word--restriction."

    When Mr. Coolidge delivered his first speech he was vice-president of the United States. He could give his views on legal tendencies without considering subsequent political effects. And so [he declares that] he would not condone any intrusion in private matters. In its practical aspect his stand implies an uncompromising denunciation of Prohibition and all other administrative attempts at officious meddling in the lives of the citizen.

    Hardly two years elapsed until Mr. Coolidge became President. He now faces a campaign for re-election. He is still as much opposed to Prohibition as ever, but he now lacks the courage to defend his principles in public and to condemn the measure.

   <p>
    He even tries to justify it, and requests his fellow citizens to relinquish their rights of personal liberty and to be satisfied with these orgies of regulations dictated by law and government.

   <p>It merely provides additional proof that the proverb about the "influence of politics on character" has a good deal of truth in it.</p>
