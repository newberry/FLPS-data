   <p>A petition is being circulated for a pardon for Ex-Alderman Hermann O. Glade, and we hope it will receive very many signatures. There is a conviction in wide circles that Glade, the Dutchman, has been used more or less as scape goat for others, especially native Americans. The best jurists agree that Glade has not received a "fair trial", but an extremely partisan one.......An example was to be made at any cost. That has been done. The purpose of the persecution has been realized, and the effect of the sentence cannot be increased by making Glade serve his full sentence.</p>
