   <p>Messrs. Freeman and Jewett, Lawyers for the Water Apostle in Hyde park, are stating with confidence, that the Superior Court will give a decision during October against the Morrison License Application and therewith a judgment in favor of Temperance. According to the opinion of the dry followers any saloon license is in direct opposition to the regulations of the annexation law act.</p>
   <p>At the same time of course, the temperance followers try every thing to swell their campaign funds and bag every good believer, with yard long circular letters, to help and contribute.</p>
   <p>The liberal elements therefore have all reason to be on their guard.</p>
