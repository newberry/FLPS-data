   <p>The Englewood Church Union is doing its utmost to make it miserable for the Police and the Public. Luckily, this Suburb Union consists only of a few backward small churches and does not represent the progressive spirit of Chicago, which does not want any prohibition or any legal control of alcohol.</p>
   <p>As we all know, prohibition as a law would not improve human character and would make a pack of hypocrites of many people.</p>
   <p>The Church Union mentioned, which is keeping spies all over Chicago, will dig its own grave in time. We are proud to say, that so far our German elements have not joined these backward water apostles.</p>
