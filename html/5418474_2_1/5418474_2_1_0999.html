   <p>p. 5. When the Boer delegates return to their homeland, it is quite certain that they will give a report to their fellow citizens of the reception and the enthusiastic pro-Boer demonstration they were privileged to witness in Chicago. Five thousand persons gathered at the Auditorium, to the utter astonishment of the delegates. When Messrs. Fischer, Wessels and Wolmarans appeared on the stage, the entire audience rose...</p>
   <p>The following resolution submitted by Mr. Wm. Vocke was passed unanimously: "We, citizens of the United States gathered in this great Auditorium in the city of Chicago, need not express our firm belief that most of our fellow citizens are in sympathy with the Boers. We are certain that 90 per cent of the population of the United States, regardless of their political affiliations, sympathize with the two South African republics.</p>
   
   <p>"We have the greatest admiration for those nations which have so frequently been forced into war in defense of their freedom. We regret deeply that their liberty, which was the crowning glory for their courage in the year 1884, is at stake again. Through the discovery of gold these nations have fallen again victims to the greediness of the British. It can be safely stated that the corrupt commercial industry of England dictated this political situation. It is it that controls the imperialistic policies of Great Britain. We also regret the fact that the United States, officially, remained silent. This is quite contrary to the tradition and past precedent of our country, as was shown in the case of France, Greece, Hungary, Poland, the South American republics, Mexico, Brazil, Armenia and Cuba. There was never a more righteous cause, since the liberation of our country from British tyranny, than that of the Boer nation.</p>
   
   <p>"To those patriotic Boers we pledge our moral and material support until the day dawns when they will be a free and independent nation again.</p>
   <p>"We thus request the officers of this meeting to send a copy of this resolution to the President of the United States, one to the President of the Republics of South Africa, and one to the Marquis of Salisbury, Prime Minister of Great Britain."</p>
   <p>Speeches were then given by Judge E. F. Dunne and ex-Governor John P. Altgeld. They were followed on the speaker's platform by Dr. Abraham Fischer of Bloemfontein, who is at the head of the delegation....</p>
   
   <p>The public expressed its sympathy for the Boers by salvos of applause at the end of Dr. Fischer's speech. The next speaker was the Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones, an Englishman. In his speech, he assured the emissaries of the South African Republic that ultimate victory will be with those who fight for the cause of the righteous....</p>
   <p>The Boer delegate, Mr. E. H. Wessels, gave a vivid picture of the wolf and the lamb. The last speaker of the evening was ex-Judge Thomas A. Moran. Owing to the late hour, the speech by Mr. Wolmarans, the third member of the Boer delegation, had to be omitted. With the singing of "America," this memorable demonstration came to a close.</p>
   <p>Tonight the Holland Society is giving a banquet in honor of the Boer delegates.</p>
