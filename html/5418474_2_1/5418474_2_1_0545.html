   <p>The much discussed temperance Parade will take its start to-morrow afternoon 2 o'clock from the Park Court at the Lakefront. According to the details of the program, Governor Altgeld, Mayor Hopkins and numerous clergymen will see the parade from the Auditorium Hotel.</p>
   <p>The German elements of Chicago have fought this parade vigorously which is an insult and vicious blow to the American ideal of individual freedom in regards to habits and customs of our citizens.</p>
   <p>Particularly the German Veteran Association has voiced a violent protest and asked all other German Societies, also all German families, to keep their children away from participation in this parade, which has proved again the deplorable submission of the Chicago School Authorities to the dictatorial policy of the Temperance fanatics.</p>
