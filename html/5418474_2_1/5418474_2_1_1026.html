   <p>It is an untruth to assert that the American-Indian prefers Negro-neighbors to the palefaces. The Indian has more disdain for the Negro, than even the White man. The civilized tribes in the Indian domain formerly were slave-holders, like the whites in the south. Even the Seminoles in Florida kept slaves. The Indian, at least the civilized amongst them, consider it an affront to be classified with a Negro. If the Indian Territory will be allocated for settlement, then white and black settlers will have similar privileges, but only identical. One must remember, though the law grants equality, the black man's concessions are not greater. Therefore, when the Cherokee strip becomes available for homesteads, the white as well as the colored may become settlers.</p>
