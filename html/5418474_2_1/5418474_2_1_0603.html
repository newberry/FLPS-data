   <p>Although prohibition proved to be a failure so far wherever it was introduced, the number of those fanatical law and executive leagues which stand for the prohibition principles is growing stronger.</p>
   <p>If that keeps on in this manner there will hardly be a state in existence where that fanatic gang of hypocrites has not the upper hand.</p>
   <p>In the American law bodies, and among the judges, the trend in favor of hypocrisy is seen to grow stronger and the judicial stunts, destined to pour oil on the fire of those hypocrites are getting more risky and bolder.</p>
   <p>Being a fanatical body these hypocrites are forever busy for their ideas. Through that they accumulate more and more influence especially among the so called upper circles on whose opinion the judges feel most dependent.</p>
   <p>This contra - liberty flirting with the wishes of the upper ten is of course nothing new in this country.</p>

   <p>How long will it be under these circumstances until the American judge reaches the same level as the Russian or Turkish judge.</p>
   <p>For us the Republicans and Democrats are the same reactionaries and their promises and fictitious principles the same swindle.</p>
