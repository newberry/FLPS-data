   <p>President Coolidge intends to call a conference of governors in Washington at which ways and means for the reduction of state and municipal taxes are to be discussed. The President's intention is a good one, and it is to be hoped that he will soon carry it out because the question of taxes has by now become one of the most important and most difficult problems.</p>
   <p>According to a report of the Federal Trade Commission to the Senate, the American people, in the year 1922, paid $7,750,000,000 in federal, state, and municipal taxes. The total indebtedness of the national government, the states, the counties, and the communities amounted in 1922 to the enormous sum of thirty-two billion dollars. Thus upon every inhabitant of the United States, whether man, woman, or child, there devolves a debt of $320.</p>
   
   <p>Taking this fact into consideration, one perceives how right President Coolidge is when he keeps on stressing that high taxes mean high prices. Interest is being paid on these thirty-two billions, and this interest must be paid by the American people--not only by the relatively few who pay direct taxes but by everybody, the multimillionaire as well as the poorest of the poor.</p>
   <p>For the increase in federal taxes there is a very simple explanation. Through its participation in the World War, the United States has plunged into a gigantic deot. Interest must be paid promptly and bonds must be redeemed. The lion's share of the federal tax receipts will be spent for these purposes for years to come. But in the federal economy, further retrenchments are possible, and if the government abolishes the many superfluous and harmful bureaus which were established at the insistence of the reformers, then it can reduce its expenditures to a considerably greater extent.</p>
   
   <p>As regards state and municipal taxes, it is within the hands of the people to reduce expenditures and hence the taxes. In nearly all States and cities, the people vote on the larger bond issues. But in this connection there is the evil that people who pay no direct taxes are all too willing to vote for such expenditures, for they erroneously assume that they will not have to pay for them. They are quite ready to make the rich pay in order to provide themselves with beautiful parks, boulevards, bath-houses or anything else they want at other people's expense. But they overlook the fact that in this evil world you cannot get something for nothing and that they, too, as well as the rich, will have to pay for these public works.</p>
   <p>Whether the world can be freed of these evils by a governors' conference is rather doubtful. The experience of recent years is, in this respect, not encouraging. The last two governors' conferences centered around Prohibition and the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment. Even optimists admit that they were absolutely ineffective. Nevertheless, it would be a good idea for the President to call the conference, if only because it will result in drawing the attention of the public to the tax problem.</p>
   <p>In any case, there is a much simpler way to lower the taxes and to put an end to the financial misery. One merely has to tax alcoholic beverages, just as was customary before the Volstead era. Why does the government renounce the taxing of alcoholic drinks? For fear of the Anti-Saloon League and their friends and those with whom they are in collusion, the moonshiners and the smugglers of booze, who now pocket the profits belonging to the American people.</p>
