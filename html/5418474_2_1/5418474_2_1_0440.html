   <p>The German Vereine (Associations) of the North Side, which belong to the United Associations for Local Self-government, decided last night, at the North-Side Turner Hall, to conduct a vigorous campaign against the proposed modification of the liquor license law. Each Verein was asked to adopt a protest resolution and to send it to every member of the City Council. Every Association member was requested to get in touch with the alderman of his ward and ask him to work against the measure. All Vereine were asked to have their members call on the city fathers in a body and tell them their point of view. Finally, everybody present was asked to attend the next session of the City Council to applaud for the champions of liberal ideas and to express displeasure with their opponents. The necessity for an early arrival was pointed out, so that available seats could be taken before arrival of members of women's associations and reform leagues.</p>
   
   <p>All speakers emphasized that a modification of the liquor license law and a restriction of liquor sales at dances was only the initial assault of the Prohibitionists and fanatics, who wanted to test their own strength and that of their foes in the City Council. From there it would be a small step to an open assault against the entire liquor business and toward prohibition. In order to quell all such attempts right at the beginning, quick and energetic action was essential. It was pointed out repeatedly that the indifferent attitude of the Vereine and their members toward public affairs, their lack of determined and energetic action during elections, a lukewarm attitude toward liberal-minded candidates--sometimes they even promote the cause of their opponents for personal reasons--was mostly to blame for the fact that the reformers and Prohibitionists had gained sufficient strength to propose modification of the existing law. The saloonkeepers were also sharply criticised, because some of them were said to be on the side of the associations' opponents on the license question, believing in their shortsightedness that a 1 A. M. curfew for dances was only fair, since they themselves had to close their taverns at that time. But they forgot that the existence of the associations was of vital importance to them. Also severely blamed was the alleged greediness and unwise attitude of tavernkeepers toward candidates for public offices. They often allowed themselves to be fooled by the foes of liberal ideas who spent money with them during their election campaigns.</p>
   <p>Reformers not Sincere</p>
   <p>The chairman of the meeting was Charles H. Kellermann, who opened the session by pointing out the significance of this latest assault against the liberal element. President George Landail of the United Associations pointed out that concerted counter measures were necessary and encouraged attendance at the next session of the City Council, in which the liquor license law was to be taken up. Dr. A. D. Weiner, chairman of the Committee for Political Activities, gave the following description of the origin of the measure:</p>
   
   <p>During the debates of the Chicago Board of Health, which recommended the enactment of the ordinance, the representatives of the United Associations had succeeded in having clauses inserted which would make it impossible for questionable clubs to hold dances and obtain liquor licenses. All the stipulations of the ordinance, with the exception of the 1 A. M. curfew, were suggested by our organization. Even the world reformers could be satisfied with the measure as it now stands if they really meant to do some good and not just to upbraid the liberal element. In order to prove that they were still in opposition to the United Associations, the reform aldermen had included the 1 A. H. curfew provision. I pointed out to them that with decent organizations--and only these are eligible for licenses--it did not matter whether their festivities lasted until three or four o'clock in the morning. But it was of no use. I pointed out that, if this provision was adopted, decent clubs had to suffer for the sins of dubious organizations which shouldn't be allowed to hold dances anyway. We are going to kill this ordinance and will have an ordinance of our own adopted. Worse immorality is created by the Northwester University in employing a young girl nineteen hours a day than by drinking a glass of beer. A. W. Harris, the president of the University, is one of those who want to reform us. To work a girl nineteen hours a day is unethical, and such an employer has no right to set down moral codes for others.</p>
   <p>Wants More Interest in Politics</p>
   <p>Peter Ellert called attention to the fact that the indifference of the members of the United Associations toward public affairs was responsible for the repeated assaults against the liberal element [by the reformers]. "We don't make enough noise," he said. "If we would take a more active interest in the elections, we would get some place." He also recalled previous crusades against the liberal element. Other addresses were made by Fritz Hess, president of the Schwabenverein (Swabian Association), Ernest G. Kusswurm, of the Chicago Turngemeinde (Chicago Turner Society), and Leopold Nellmann, organizer.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow on the South Side Another mass meeting will be held tomorrow night at the Englewood Turner Hall, 1048 West 63rd Street, for the German Vereine of the South Side. All other German associations are also invited.</p>
   <p>The following German Vereine have issued appeals to their members to attend the protest meeting:</p>
   <p>German Tavernkeepers' Verein, Town of Lake</p>
   <p>"It is necessary that you attend the meeting of the United Associations on Dec. 16, 1914, at eight o'clock in the Englewood Turner Hall. The meeting is a protest against the new Special Bar Permit Ordinance which aims to prohibit various festivities. All members should come.</p>
   <p>"Emil Richter, President,</p>
   <p>"E. Peterson, Secretary."</p>
   <p>Vorwaerts Male Chorus</p>
   <p>"A meeting, which is very important to us, will be held on December 16, 1914, at the Englewood Turner Hall under the auspices of the United Associations. All members must be present. Neighborhood aldermen will give details about the Special Bar Permit Ordinance. These gentlemen want to prohibit our drinking after 1 A. M. Pretty soon they'll prohibit festivities altogether. Come to the meeting.</p>
   <p>"(signed) Frank W. Krause, President,</p>
   <p>"Oswald Baer, Secretary."</p>
   <p>Ernestine Women's Verein and Augusta Lodge</p>
   <p>"Come to the meeting of the United Associations December 16, 1914, at the Englewood Turner Hall. The holding of club festivities is in danger. Every member should be present. Neighborhood aldermen are invited.</p>
   <p>"(signed) Anna Hildemann,</p>
   <p>Secretary."</p>
   
   <p>"The members of the Singing Verein Frohsinn are requested to come to the protest meeting December 16, 1914, at the Englewood Turner Hall. We have to take action against the proposed Special Bar Permit Ordinance.</p>
   <p>"(signed) Charles Turner Brown,</p>
   <p>"Delegate"</p>
   <p>United Male Choruses</p>
   <p>"An ordinance affecting singing societies will shortly be voted upon in the City Council. It is called the Special Permit Bar Ordinance, and provides that on the occasion of festivities no more alcholic beverages can be sold after 1 A. M. The ordinance includes a further provision which says that if dancing is part of the program, nothing stronger than water or lemonade may be consumed during the program. The entire ordinance is designed to make club activities altogether impossible. The United Associations, therefore, are going to hold a protest meeting on December 16, at 8 P. M., at the Englewood Turner Hall, and on December 18 at the Wicker Park Hall, West North Avenue. The members of the United Male Choruses are urgently requested to attend the meetings and take part in the protest."</p>
