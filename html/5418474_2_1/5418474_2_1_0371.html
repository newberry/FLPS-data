   <p>Great Britain has notified the Government of the United States in a most polite manner--Great Britain, too, can be polite, if it suits her purposes, or is advantageous to her interests--that America will do well to have money on hand for reimbursing British investors for losses which they may incur through the destruction of their brewery and distillery business. This destruction is foreseen as a result of national prohibition.</p>
   <p>It had to be thus. This is the first evil fruit of the evil deed. America, which loves justice and liberty, America, which fought so unselfishly for justice and liberty in Europe, must suffer to be told with sardonic politeness, by selfish Great Britain--which went to war to increase its power through the spoils of war, and is opposing America's program for a league of nations and world peace, America's plan for justice and freedom--that America is trampling upon justice and freedom at home, and must give an account of its acts and render indemnity to the extent to which British interests are affected. America, proud America, which fought upon foreign soil for the liberty of the nations and for justice, must suffer to be told by England, which rules all these nations, that it will not do to prohibit and destroy large old industries which have been established and maintained at a great expenditure of money and which represent a considerable investment, without making reimbursement to the losers, at least to British losers. Thus Great Britain tells America: "You may infringe upon the rights of your own citizens by ignoring the fundamental principle of justice (that no property must be forfeited or destroyed without the provision of adequate indemnity), but you must not similarly disregard the rights of our citizens. You may tyrannize your own subjects, but we will not permit you to tyrannize ours."</p>
   <p>This is somewhat disgraceful for the great republic which is preaching justice and freedom at the peace conference in Europe. The matter is not improved, but made worse by the fact that the news of Britain's polite jab was favorably received by a great many of our citizens. Though most of them deplore England's conduct, yet it is generally acknowledged that England was justified, and that America received no more than it deserved. For thus it is proved to the whole world that a minority favored or desired this amendment, which overthrows our constitution, and hence that the American people, after more than a hundred years of experience, are not able to protect justice from violation by a minority; and that Americans have either forgotten, or do not yet understand the truth contained in the words: "Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom."</p>
   <p>This, of course, will not meet with the approval of prohibitionists. They will say that the majority of our people really are in favor of prohibition, and that they are in full accord with the manner in which the Eighteenth Amendment was adopted. But that does not put the matter in any better light. If it were true that the majority of our people in all the states approve of prohibition, then an amendment to the Constitution would not be necessary; then the entire country could be made "dry" by state legislation. And if it were true that the majority of our people want prohibition written into the Constitution, it would not have been necessary to whip the prohibition resolution through Congress in the manner in which it was done; then the spirit of the Constitution would have been duly observed; then the prohibition question would have been decided by the direct vote of the country's electorate, or, at least, the letter of the Constitution would have been observed when the amendment itself was drawn up and when Congress voted on the amendment.</p>
   <p>For instance, it would not have been stated in the amendment that the amendment is to become effective one year after its ratification by three fourths of the states, provided that ratification is made within seven years after the amendment was submitted to Congress, whereas the Constitution states that an amendment becomes a law as soon as it is ratified. The Constitution knows of no restriction upon the opportunity to ratify, and it prescribes that two thirds of the members of both Houses of Congress must consider a measure necessary before it may be proposed as an amendment.....</p>

   <p>England is right when she asks reimbursement for the losses which British subjects may suffer as a result of national prohibition. In a manner the demands of England shame us, but they are just, and if they help to avert the evil at the last minute, England will have rendered America a great service; and we will owe the British a debt of gratitude, whether they intended to do us a good turn or not.</p>
