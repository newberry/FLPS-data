   <p>The regular session of the Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers Association) was held yesterday at the Aurora Turnhalle; President Feldkamp presided. The meeting was well attended. After the reading and acceptance of the minutes of the last session, the Committee for investigation of the trustees securities asked for a two weeks time extension, which was granted on condition that all bonds would be properly drawn up by that time, as well as the charter of the Association.</p>
   <p>A resolution was passed authorizing payment of the bill presented by Moerle, financial secretary, but action on his resignation was deferred until the next meeting, and, in the interim, the Committee on finance is to check his books and submit a report.</p>
   <p>Adolph George was elected a member of the Finance committee, taking the place of Adolph Mueller who resigned, and Mr. Baum, whose term had expired, was re-elected.</p>
   <p>A motion to question Mr. Finkelstein for keeping a disorderly house was passed, and then followed a debate about the temperance advocates. The Association's lawyer, Mr. Rubens, was asked to speak on the subject and he gave a detailed account, saying among other things that complaints about selling intoxicating drinks to minors are mostly based on statements of snoopers and manufactured evidence, and he [Rubens] knows of several cases where the judge spoke in a very sarcastic manner about the plaintiffs; nevertheless, from a legal as well as moral standpoint, it is necessary for us to watch for violations, and we must act impartially when they occur. He offered to obtain copies (free of charge) of recent court trials involving saloonkeepers in the aforesaid offense, as well as the names of all tavernkeepers whose places of business are known to have a bad reputation, provided the wirthsverein will publish the list. The offer was accepted and the members thanked him for his efforts.</p>
   <p>Adolph George made a motion that the Association contribute twenty-five dollars toward the Lyons Post for the decoration of graves, since most of the buried people were of German descent. The motion was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>With respect to the license fees for billiard tables, nothing definite can be reported at this tine, because the license committee of the new city council has not held a meeting yet; this applies also to the measuring and official classification of the various sizes of beer barrels.</p>
   <p>President Feldman then asked the Association to consider the plan whereby the Wirthsverein is to be of state-wide importance. Mr Rubens expressed opposition. He said that the Association is fully occupied in making preparations for the important election next year, and therefore this is not the time to think of the organization as of state-wide character. With respect to the plan, the essential thing is to obtain accurate statistical information about the strength of the temperance party in the various districts--and this does not mean Democrats or Republicans, but temperance advocates in general. But such information cannot be obtained by the Association; it will have to be worked out by the Committee on legal matters and that requires time. He [Rubens] made a motion accordingly, which was adopted.</p>
