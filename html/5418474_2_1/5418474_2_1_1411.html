   <p>The trustee of the bankrupt estate of the Greenebaum Bank, by the order of the Comptroller of currency and in accord with the direction issued by the Federal District Court, auctioned off the entire estate with the exception of two pieces of land. According to the prevailing low market price on real estate, the time was not well chosen; therefore the suspicion arises that it has been a prearranged thing with the capitalists and speculators who acquired the property at a very low price. Charles R. Steels and M. Felsenthal were prominent amongst the bidders.</p>
