   <p>Tomorrow the respective committees of the City Council will begin to draft a new law for the regulation of the taxicab business in Chicago. The monopoly held by the Yellow and Checker Cab companies has led to conditions which are generally admitted to be intolerable. This is especially true of the fares, as is evident from the investigations which have been made. The small cab companies which must compete with the monopolies have proved conclusively that they can exist and realize a profit despite their low rates. The difference in fares is as follows: The monopolistic companies demand twenty cents for the first quarter mile and ten cents for each additional half mile, while the smaller companies ask fifteen cents for the first third mile and five cents for each additional third mile. When longer trips are made, the difference in the rates is very pronounced. Of course Chicagoans wish that the lower <span class="page-break">\2</span>rates would be adopted. Such a step would also be advantageous to the companies, for lower prices have always increased demand, and demand is what every successful company wants. During these critical years people have learned to place higher value on the security of investment than on a high rate of profit.</p>
   <p>There will be much to say about the new ordinance when it is finally presented to us. In addition to the fare question, many other matters of public interest must be regulated. For instance, all automobile drivers would like to have taxicab drivers drive more carefully. It is generally known that they show no consideration for other machines. This is especially noticeable on Michigan Avenue during the hours of heavy traffic. The taxicab drivers weave in and out between buses and private autos, obstruct traffic by driving too slowly while looking for passengers, make "U" turns anywhere they please, and have no scruples about making sudden stops in the middle of the block. And only rarely do the police interfere. Therefore, the new ordinance should contain measures against such disorderly chauffeurs, and should provide for <span class="page-break">\3</span>the withdrawal of their licence if they do not mend their ways. It is in the general interest of safe transportation to lay a heavy hand on careless drivers. Experience teaches that inconsiderate people obey only when they are treated with greater inconsideration.</p>
   <p>The same situation prevails with respect to parking. Everywhere in the city taxicab drivers act as though they were more privileged than other autoists, and they actually are, as is evident when one considers the many places where they have sole parking rights, and where the city forbids private owners to park their cars. There are too many of these places in the city, especially in the Loop; if taxicab drivers are not to become a city pest, our city fathers had better see to it that no new parking places or "stands" for cabs are granted in the new ordinance. Furthermore, the ordinance will provide for better control over the taxicab meters, for the public is entitled to official protection against dishonest taxicab drivers. The new ordinance should also provide for a uniform zone and rate schedule for the Loop district, including <span class="page-break">\4</span>the main railroad depots. The strict maintenance of the monopoly of the Yellow Cab Company and the Checker Cab Company is indefensible in view of present conditions, and the smaller companies will have to be given more consideration than they have received in the past. Since the taxicab question is of such great importance, the public of Chicago will carefully analyze the new ordinance and form its own opinion as to whether its interests have been fully protected by the City Council.</p>
