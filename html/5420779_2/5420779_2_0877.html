   <p>A few days ago Congress introduced a bill under which the immigrants will have to undergo an examination in reading and writing before they will be allowed to land.</p>
   <p>If this bill becomes law the number of immigrants will be restricted. It is droll that the greatest enemies of immigration are immigrants themselves or sons of immigrants.</p>
   <p>How much we owe to the immigrants and how much they contributed that this land of ours prospered is shown in one magazine article where it is said: "I am an immigrant. Since my birth I tread roads over the whole earth. My fragile ship sails over all the seas. My liking for travel developed out of hope for more freedom and for greater reward for my toil.</p>
   <p>"I looked upon America with eyes of strong desire, my heart beat with strong hope. Full of hope I approached the gates of America, and full of hope I entered.</p>

   <p>"I accepted the burden of the heaviest work on my back.</p>
   <p>"Today I perform 85% of all the work in slaughterhouses and butcher shops.</p>
   <p>"I dig from the earth seven tenths of all the coal. I perform 78% of all the work in the wooden mills. I do 90% of all the work in steel mills, on streets and roads. I make nineteen twentieths of all the clothing. I make more than half of all the shoes. I perform four fifths of all the housework. I make one half of all the ties, shirts and cuffs. I tan four fifths of all the leathers. I refine nineteen twentieths of all the sugar. I make one half of all the cigarettes and cigars. And, in spite of all that, I am a great problem for America.</p>
   <p>"When I offer my blood on the altar of labor, when I sacrifice my life to the god of industry and perish, many people pay as much attention to it as if a sparrow dropped from the roof. But our national existence is interwoven thickly with my muscles.</p>
   <p>"My children must be your children. Your country must be my country, because my blood and my sweat laid the foundation on which it develops."</p>

   <p>Gentlemen, legislators seem to forget these facts, and lift their noses, but they did not contribute one pebble to the progress of this country. On the contrary, they would starve if dependent on work of their own hands.</p>
