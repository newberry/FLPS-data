   <p>Many Comrades were disappointed after the Chicago elections, because they hoped that at least three of our Socialist comrades would be elected City Aldermen. Not one of our candidates was elected.</p>
   <p>Only Comrade Kennedy was close to being a winner, as he received over 7,000 votes. Of these, 500 were men's votes, more than his opposing Candidate received, who was elected by the votes of women. Comrade Kennedy lost on account of women's vote.</p>
   <p>Our party received about 40,000 votes of which there were 11,000 women's votes.</p>
   <p>It is significant that our candidates received more votes where there are our stronger organizations located and where a constructive Socialist agitation is conducted.</p>
   <p>From this we may extract great information.</p>
   <p>Even if we would receive a great many votes for one or the other reason, we <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>should not have great illusions, as long as we do not have really strong Organizations to serve as lighthouses and main centres of socialism.</p>
   <p>As to women it must be said, that the socialist party is the most stanch supporter of their rights and that this party did the most when women received the right to vote. But women in spite of that for the greater part voted for the Republican or Democratic party. We must not forget, that women are just like men. How many thousands of workers are there, who voted for a bourgeois candidate and against their own party, which struggles for their liberation.</p>
   <p>Here as everywhere, among men and women is a great misunderstanding and miscomprehension of their own interests.</p>
   <p>The duty and main purpose of the socialist party in Chicago must be, not so much to get a great number of voters, but to instruct the working class, to open night schools, to hold many meetings, and lectures, and to establish at least one daily paper, as the property of the party, which paper would in a most successful way spread socialistic principles.</p>
   <p>As long as said things are not accomplished, our expectations will not be fulfilled at coming elections. Our party will not have any who are influential on social problems in Chicago.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The slogan of all our members in Chicago should be; "Organization and Enlightenment. Enlightenment and Organization. More of Socialism."</p>
   <p>A good, educated Socialist is worth more for the party, than one hundred of unheeding and chance voters.</p>
