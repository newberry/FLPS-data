   <p>Last Sunday, as announced in Radnicka Straza a theatrical performance was given by our Dramatic Society,"Prosvjeta" (Culture.) The Society presented a drama, "Ne Izgoriva Kupina". (The non-inflammable Blackberry Bush.)</p>
   <p>Because it was the first theatrical performance, without any additional entertainment, we expected a small attendance.</p>
   <p>Beside as it was a nice spring day, people craved the outdoors.</p>
   <p>But the Hall held many spectators against our expectation.</p>
   <p>According to that large attendance we assume that the public is able to understand such theatrical presentations.</p>
   <p>Where there are dancing and drinking there is no mental improvement, as when everybody is sober and can concentrate on the performance.</p>
   
   <p>The performance was good. Certainly for one reason, that its cast had men and women, Comrades, who felt the burden of capitalism, just as those must have who were portrayed.</p>
   <p>The public applauded a great deal. It was the best sign, that the significance of the play was understood.</p>
   <p>Our Dramatic Society, "Prosvjeta", will not stop at that, but will continue to try, like our comrades in Europe to establish a workingmen's theater, for the purpose of showing on the stage the misery of the working class, and how to guide it to fight for liberation.</p>
