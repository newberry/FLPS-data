   <p>The Croatians of the City of South Chicago, Illinois, assembled at an open mass meeting, are extending to Your Excellency their most cordial greetings and wish to submit to the High Council and Assembly of the League of Nations a plea that the Croatian nation be made the restitution of an independent Croatian state, within the boundaries of its undisputed national and <span class="page-break">2</span>political territory on the basis of self-determination to safeguard world peace.</p>
   <p>In the interest of humanity and the safeguarding right of the subdued peace loving Croatian nation, we demand immediate release of Dr. Matchek, leader of the Croats, who was unjustly accused and sent to the Belgrade prison.</p>
   <p>We specially claim an international investigation of police atrocities and control over dictatorial proceedings of law by which masses of innocent Croats were tortured and killed in prisons.</p>
