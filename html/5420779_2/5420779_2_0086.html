   <p>The whole month of March an election campaign was conducted for the candidates for the mayoralty of the city of Chicago. The cost of this campaign was over one million dollars, according to capitalistic newspapers.</p>
   <p>The political parties had the backing of different companies. Money was spent freely. Judging by the amount of writing and advertising, each citizen of the city of Chicago received several pounds of paper printed with campaign literature.</p>
   <p>If each of the candidates were as his campaign literature pictures him, all of them would be angels. But it is sufficient to read what each candidate says of his opponent to get the impression that they are all alike. Each of them is in the service of "special interests," and not in the service of the people and the city.</p>
   <p>All of the candidates did not spare trouble to pick up the smallest flaws and throw them in the lap of their opponents.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The candidates were Thompson, the mayor; Schweitzer, a twice-not-elected candidate, and State's Attorney Hoyne, for whom all great capitalistic newspapers worked in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This election proved that the capitalistic press does not govern the capitalistic reader in every problem, because the citizens elected just that candidate who was assaulted hardest by the capitalist press.</p>
   <p>If a man went by chance to one of the Thompson's meetings, he could hear how Schweitzer is in the service of one or another capitalist or exploiter, how Hoyne was the mainspring in the ruin of a great teachers' organization in Chicago. Whoever went to a meeting of the two others, could hear nice things about Mayor Thompson. Personal habits and religion were not spared. Never before has a most indecent campaign been conducted. After election everything was forgotten and quiet.</p>
   <p>Every day before the election, the boosters for all three candidates gave assurances that their own candidates would win by a majority of 100,000 <span class="page-break">3</span>votes. All were "sure," though they knew that only one could be elected and not three.</p>
   <p>Now the balance is made between work and costs.</p>
   <p>Also the Croatian papers did their bit. They collected a few dollars for advertisements. These are paid, and it does not matter who was elected.</p>
   <p>A bitter struggle was on, but today we see "the nice American treat," there is no more animosity. All appreciate the re-elected mayor with the same sincerity as if their own candidate was elected. This fact is little complimentary for the voters. It shows that the election is a joke or business. All the extreme merits or faults of their candidates have not to be taken seriously.</p>
   <p>The sanctity of a majority seems doubtful when we see how an election campaign is conducted and how the numerical majority is reached. But the <span class="page-break">4</span>moral exists that the elected must be recognized in full. That means that people are content with the worst, if the majority decides so.</p>
   <p>Much money was spent, much energy used, many false statements made, many people were misled. All that was done in order that everything may remain as it was before, regardless of the person that was elected. All the candidates were branches of the same tree. For that reason it makes no difference, of course, to the people, who is elected.</p>
