   <p>Chicago Dramatic Society "Nada" will present stage play "Gypsy," depicting Croatian peasant life in native country.</p>
   <p>Five lodges of the Croatian Fraternal Union in South Chicago have joined hands in sponsoring a gala entertainment for Sunday, April 4, which promises to be the outstanding event of the season. Fully realizing that a much greater success can be attained by a joint, rather than an individual undertaking, these lodges hope to pack the large and commodious Croatian Hall on this particular occasion.</p>
   <p>To achieve the greatest moral and material success, a program is being arranged which in itself will prove to be a treat for all. The committee has invited Brother William Boyd - Boich, vice-president of the C. F. U., to deliver the principal address, which is awaited with great interest, not only because he occupies a high office in our organization, but also because of his accomplishments as a member of the State Senate of Ohio.</p>
   <p>Another great attraction will be the remarkable stage play, "Gypsy" (Ciganin), depicting peasant life in Croatia by the well known Chicago dramatic club Nada.</p>
   <p>Since it is the desire of the committee that our younger generation should see this unusual play, we take this opportunity to say a few words about the drama "Gypsy": The Gypsies have lived in the Balkan countries from time immemorial. Being true children of nature, they have great talent for adapting themselves to various local surroundings, without, however, being ever assimilated. Thus through centuries they have been able to retain their identity and the peculiar characteristics of their race.</p>
   <p>The leading character of the play is the exceedingly sympathetic old Gypsy blacksmith, Zivko, somewhat comical in his extreme earnestness and simplicity, but bright and witty, thoroughly educated in the school of hard experience.</p>
   
   <p>With his musically gifted son Petko, and his beautiful daughter Ruzica, he is the real representative of the Gypsy race. He loves his children deeply and, contrary to the general conception of the Gypsy moral code, he has brought them up as virtuous, upright and obedient children.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, both children fall in love with members not of their race, and this custom-forbidden love furnishes a genuine theme and a very complicated plot for this play.</p>
   <p>But this is not only a play about Gypsies. It is even more so a play about the picturesque peasant life in an old country village, with all its venerable, century-old customs and traditions. Seeing this play, young American-Croatians can learn more about the real old country life than they have ever learned from all the stories told them by their parents. Besides there will be our national costumes, our national songs, tamburica orchestra, and the inevitable Kolo dance. In all, about thirty people appear in "Gypsy."</p>
   <p>See this play and it will help you understand your parents. How often have you complained that your elders do not understand you. But do you understand them, and would you take the trouble to learn to understand them? This play is an intimate portrayal of the country of your parents. See how difficult it must have been for them to adapt themselves to your world, and you will not be too stern in your criticism of them.</p>
   <p>Come and bring your American friends and you will not be ashamed, for Nada's players are old veterans of the stage, who will make you feel proud of your Croatian nationality and your Croatian art.</p>
