   <p>We call attention of our comrades and correspondents strictly to adhere to the following rules:</p>
   <p>1. The article written has to be short.</p>
   <p>2. What is written must be true, proven facts.</p>
   <p>3. Write on one side of the paper with ink.</p>
   <p>4. Write about what is of general interest. What will benefit our movement.</p>
   <p>5. Avoid personal digressions, hate and expressions not fit for a newspaper.</p>
   <p>6. Comrades who are not able to write about local news should undertake to write propagandistic articles or articles on socialist doctrines.</p>
   <p>Special attention of comrades is called to rule 6. There are comrades who want to become immediately writers or teachers of socialism. They send in letters without any value, which cannot be printed. Many times there are between such comrades and the editors long-drawn misunderstandings. Such things are disagreeable and should be avoided.</p>
   <p>It is not easy to write articles or teach others if the writer himself is not versed well about what he writes.</p>
   
   <p>Comrades must read more, study life and our movement, think deeply. It is much easier to write about local happenings or working conditions than doctrinary articles about socialism.</p>
   <p>Many of our comrades send in articles too long to be published in our paper with limited space. To abbreviate these articles, to correct so many errors takes considerable time.</p>
   <p>All correspondents must know that they do not write for their glory, but for the benefit of our movement and to promote the ideals of socialism.</p>
