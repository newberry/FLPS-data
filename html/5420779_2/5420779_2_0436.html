   <p>This number of Znanje we publish on four pages, because our office is closed since last Saturday.</p>
   <p>Comrades Kutuzovic and Zikic were arrested.</p>
   <p>In so far as these persecutions are expressions of autocratic will and have no legal foundation whatsoever, we hope to be able to continue with our regular work editing the paper, as well as the sale of books. For that reason readers may send subscriptions for the paper or orders for books.</p>
   <p>We are taking all measures to secure the regular publication. The shortage of reading space in this number we will try to make up, so the readers will not miss very much.</p>
   <p>Comrades, subscribers, workers! You stood by your paper always. This paper <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>gave you mental food. The duty calls on you now, in this decisive moment, not to leave the ranks in a magnificent battle for human rights and better civilization.</p>
