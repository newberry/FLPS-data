   <p>Lovers of music and singing will have an opportunity on April 14 to attend a concert at Pilsen Sokol Hall, 1814 South Ashland Avenue, given by the well known singer Pasko Alujevic.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alujevic has studied abroad of late, and will show our public what he has accomplished with untiring work and constant rehearsals.</p>
   <p>The majority of our audiences remember him as a promising singer when he was seen on the stage with singing clubs, but since he devoted full time to training and cultivating his voice he has not been seen by our public.</p>
   <p>His natural personality and voice helped him in his success. Last season he was engaged by the Chicago Civic Opera, where he sang in leading roles. After the season he traveled a few weeks with the Festival Opera Company, and recently returned to Chicago where he decided to give a <span class="page-break">2</span>concert to our public.</p>
