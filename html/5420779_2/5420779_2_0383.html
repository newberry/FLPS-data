   <p>We are honored to announce the opening of the information bureau which created a quick connection between Jugoslav newspapers.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this first Jugoslav newspaper office in the United States is to give telegraphic information of economic, political, cultural and social character to the immigrant press, especially to the Jugoslav newspapers. The establishment of cable connections with the new offices gives quick information which serves the needs of the Jugoslav papers in America and the old country. Reports are released to the immigrant press in weekly bulletins or by wire.</p>
   <p>The advertising department receives representatives from immigrant and old country press (cultural, newspaper, and economic reviews) to increase circulation and advertising.</p>
   <p>The information department issues information of economic, cultural and legal character in the United States and Jugoslavia. For Jugoslav Press Advertising and Information Bureau: Andrew Kobal, Marian Pfeifer.</p>
