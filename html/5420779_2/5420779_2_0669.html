   <p>The Association for the Support of Croatian Orphans is calling a public meeting in the Croatian Sokol Hall, 1903 S. Racine Avenue. The meeting will begin at 3 P. M.</p>
   <p>Speakers: T. Cuckovic, S. Zinic, and L. Borzic.</p>
   <p>Subject for discussion: How the Croatian orphanage ought to function.</p>
   <p>The general Jugoslav public is hereby invited, especially those brothers and sisters who are interested in our orphanage question. The Croatian orphanage is a responsibility, not only of the Croatian Fraternal Union ranks, but of the public at large. The Chicago colony has not yet forgotten the controversy between the C. F. U. and the orphans' association. From the time the C. F. U. took the orphanage under its control, many things have changed and the functioning of the orphanage is not what it originally was intended to be. Therefore, brothers and sisters, come to this meeting and learn the present position of the association for support of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Croatian orphanage.</p>
   <p>You will know then how to instruct your delegates. Soon there will be a meeting at the C. F. U. convention, where the orphanage question will be thoroughly discussed.</p>
   <p>Everybody welcome.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
