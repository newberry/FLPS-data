   <p>The day of July 4 is celebrated all over the United States as the day of American independence. About 150 years ago the American colonists began a struggle against the English king and through that struggle they gained their freedom from Great Britain.</p>
   <p>Patriotism and chauvinism are still extolled today, but we see a picture of American liberty different from the one which historians reveal to us. The difference in America in the time of Washington and in the time of a Roosevelt, Coolidge, or Wilson is great. It represents the difference between capitalism in its cradle and on its deathbed. The American colonists took the land away from the Indians and introduced slavery. A rich class developed, consisting of slave holders, merchants, and bourgeoisie. The workers were exploited, but the English king took great sums in taxes. That was the real reason for the conflict with the British.</p>

   <p>After the American liberation these slave holders and merchants adopted a constitution framed by themselves: the working class did not have any part in it and does not benefit from it.</p>
   <p>It was an important fact that Washington decided not to meddle with foreign alliances. That gave America an opportunity for unlimited development. Factories were built, mines opened, forests cut down, and railroads constructed. Hired slaves came from all over the world to perform the necessary hard work. On the blood and bones of immigrant workers our powerful and great America was built.</p>
   <p>The political power was in the hands of the slave and landholders of the South. This fact grieved the Northern capitalists, for they had hired the South's personal slaves. As soon as the North was sufficiently strong, the Civil War started, presumably for the liberation of the Negroes. There is no doubt that the Negroes of today, even after the war which was fought for their liberation, are maltreated and oppressed economically and socially. That is a known truth.</p>

   <p>Then capitalism got a much better start, and America became the richest country in the world.</p>
   <p>The structure of America began to change rapidly from the liberal democracy of Jefferson to an imperial monarchy under the title of a republic. The vast American territories became too narrow for the mighty American industries. She was forced out of her borders into the world market. Whole nations on the Pacific coast came under America's sway. In 1898 she came to war with Spain for the domination of Cuba and was victorious. The American sugar magnates were then given a free field in Cuba.</p>
   <p>The World War found America a great imperialistic state with the autocratic power of American bankers. From that date this nation became an imperialistic power of the first class. The army was enlarged steadily, and a navy was built up. America put under her wings not only small peoples of the Pacific coast but also great nations of Europe like Austria, Germany, Turkey, China, etc. Of course, they are not conquered by American imperialism, but they fall <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>under the rule of American bankers.</p>
   <p>The more America becomes a great imperialistic power, the greater the danger of a war between her, England, and Japan for world supremacy.</p>
   <p>If the working class will not block the machinations of the bourgeoisie, then we will again have the opportunity to shed our blood in the interests of world imperialism--above all, in the interests of American bankers. The question must be settled. Who will run the world? Imperialistic America or Great Britain?</p>
   <p>We live in a time of great historical struggles never before seen in the annals of humanity. In these great historical events we have to perform a great role. It is not sufficient for us merely to be passive onlookers. We must be active participants in these struggles.</p>
   <p>We must bear in mind the fact that if we do not want to join the working class <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>in its struggle for liberation from slavery, we will be drawn into the struggle for maintaining the capitalistic system. The working class must decide whether to aid the crooked policies of international bankers or the common struggle for final liberation.</p>
