   <p>Celebration will be held September 1st, 1924 (Labor Day) on their farm in Des Plaines, Illinois. Nearly all Croatian benevolent and cultural lodges, also the youth organizations and representatives of our organizations that donated toward erecting of our orphanage or rather the home for our poor and needy children in America will take part.</p>
   <p>It was decided at the last meeting, that Sunday before the celebration we will have a parade with the decorated autos and a band. Our lodges, merchants and individuals will be notified. All auto owners are asked to kindly report to the secretary, so that entertaining committee will know how many cars there will be at its disposal.</p>
