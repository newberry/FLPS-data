   <p>On November 20, 1892 our first lodge was organzed in Chicago, Illinois. In November of this year we will celebrate the thirty-fifth anniversary. The first year the lodge was independent, had its own by-laws and emblems - gold and silk. They named the lodge "Crvenikriz" (Red Cross), and it had the distinction of being the first Croatian benevolent society.</p>
   <p>Later the lodge joined the Czech-Slovak Union, as the Croatian National Union did not exist at that time. But when the National Croatian Union was organized, the question came up to transfer it into the Union. Following a regular procedure and after a reasonable amount of discussion, the "Crveni Kriz" joined the National Croatian Union as unit 103. Some of the members that joined the young Croatian organization, also returned their membership into the Czecho-Slovak Union. Some members were in both unions, others in only one, and difficulties followed that could not be overcome, so members of Czech Union split with us, maintained their No. 22, and divided the work equally.</p>
   <p>Saturday, November 26th of this year, the "Red Cross" will celebrate its thirty-fifth year of existence in the National Croatian Hall at 18th Street and Racine Avenue. With this we invite all our lodges and clubs to attend and raise our celebration to the level becoming Croatians.</p>
