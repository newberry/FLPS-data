   <p>"Foreigner!" - that is the expression used by "free" Americans for every worker coming from the old country. This name sticks to him for over twenty years, as long as he does not master the English language correctly.</p>
   <p>The expression "foreigner" has for the American the same meaning as the word "barbarian" had for the Greeks.</p>
   <p>"Foreigner," a savage expression indeed, accepted in the vocabulary of "civilized" Americans.</p>
   <p>But let us see what do these "foreigners" do for America. Could America exist without them? From statistics of the year 1911 we see that "foreigners" work and produce:</p>
   <p>Eighty-five per cent of all packed and conserved meat, besides working a great number of slaughter houses.</p>
   <p>Seven-tenths of workers in mines.</p>
   <p>Seventy-nine per cent of all work connected with wool.</p>
