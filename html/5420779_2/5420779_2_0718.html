   <p>Recently the Croatian dollar-patriots were engaged in a tremendous campaing throughout our lodges and clubs in the name of non-political Croatian national consciousness (which we will describe more in detail), Serbian dollar-patriots are also in our intensive drive for the Privrednik. (Croatian Radisa and Serbian Privednik are the respective people's organizations established for the purpose of taking care of the orphans of the World War to provide food, clothing and education for stranded children.)</p>
   <p>On several occasions we have proved and will expose in the future that Hrvatski Radisa is nothing, but an agency to sell youth to cheap large Croatian manufacturers. On the other hand, what Serbian Privrednik is, the following letter from one of their students proves:</p>
   <p>"As an apprentice of Privrednik I hate the institution. Privrednik is not doing a thing to stop the exploitation of youth, much less to improve the position of students and their conditions in existence and education.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>If any apprentice complains to the supervisor or committee against the master and demands an intervention, he is told: 'Well, you are an apprentice. That is your lot, shut up and stand him until you grow up.' Privrednik is raising a very thin class of qualified workers, out of which they intend to make enemies of the working class. Therefore, Privrednik may be called the central for skilfully molding fascists from the workers' ranks. That is the principal aim of Privrednik. It was plain to me when they came to us with this question: How may a student be a valuable orthodox Serb? Then they teach the student to answer thus: A valuable orthodox Serb must obey his master, must always pray before he goes to bed, go to church on Sunday, congratulate his master on his birthday and kiss his local priest's hand. And above all, a valuable orthodox Serb must never oppose his master's wishes.</p>
   <p>"Recently, idiotic circulars were sent to Privrednik students, here is one: It is understood that no sensible person will quit his position - regardless of how bad, - before he secures another and better one. It is disgraceful for a young person to be unemployed (bum), bums get into questionable society, violence and eventually ruination. Be a man, keep your job, watch <span class="page-break">3</span>your company, avoid unscrupulous liars, bums and lazy failures, or you will, sooner or later, suffer because of them.</p>
   <p>'Be nice to your masters, and when you leave don't forget them, but write to them, especially on their birthday send them a card.'</p>
   <p>According to the above, Privrednik is educating the youth to be future strike breakers, who will not hinder the healthy development of our home industry. My advice to every apprentice would be, if anybody from Privrednik tries to influence them, tell them: 'To devil with Privrednik, down with them! Long live independent syndicates!'"</p>
   <p>(Signed) Revolutionary Apprentice.</p>
   <p>The article from the apprentice is very accurate and fits Hrvatski Radisa with this difference, that Radisa's idea of being valuable is that he must be a good Catholic Croat, while Privrednik appeals to the orthodox Serbian.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>On this occasion we appeal to our working people to be careful, watch that false propaganda, don't lead them in strike breaking, especially now. There is a contest in this propaganda, therefore we must say to the gentlemen: Neither the Hrvatski Radisa nor Srbski Privrednik, but labor unions and youth workers' organizations.</p>
   <p>Translator's note: Both Hrvatski Radisa and Srbski Privrednik have branches in all large colonies. There are several in Chicago, thousands of dollars were collected here and sent to the old country for the upkeep of this humanitarian institution until it became corrupted.</p>
