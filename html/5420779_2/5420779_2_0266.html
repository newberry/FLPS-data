   <p>The wishes of some members of the dramatic club Nada and the Jugoslav Educational Association to have a singing chorus in their midst were realized last Monday, 20th inst., when in their club rooms, in the presence of a large number of members, new and old, there was laid the foundations of a new singing club.</p>
   <p>That day they elected the officers and named the club which will be called Sloga (unity).</p>
   <p>Even if there are many strong singing clubs in the city there is always ample room for more new ones, and that way develop the cultural work of our colony to a higher degree so we could compare with bigger and smaller national groups of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Instruction and rehearsals will be held every Friday at 8 P. M. in Nada's club rooms, with Mr. Muha, a teacher. For further information write to the secretary, Mr. Sivko Radnovic.</p>
