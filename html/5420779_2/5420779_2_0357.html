   <p>Every year the Croatian singing choir "Zora" has entertained our public with a grand annual program.</p>
   <p>This year the masquerade dance will be held Saturday evening Feb. 13 in Pilsen Sokol Hall, 1814 S. Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>Where ever one goes the discussion about the preparation is heard for this grand event, how some individuals and some groups will appear in the original costumes. Judging by their preparations, this time they will have the most beautiful and best masquerade dance they ever had before, and there is no wonder. They will give fifteen big prizes to the five most original costumes -- groups and individuals.</p>
   <p>The famous KOLUDER orchestra will entertain with their music, expecially those that enjoy dance; while others that wish refreshments will be served well. All in general will pleasantly observe the beauty of the colorful event.</p>
   <p>So as not to miss this joy of the season, keep in mind February 13th in Pilsen Sokol hall.</p>
