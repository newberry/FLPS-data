   <p>In America there are about 800,000 Jugoslavs. Of them the greater part are hired workers who came to America from villages.</p>
   <p>Most of them came to America in anticipation of being able after a certain time to return to their homeland and continue their primitive life as before. In the interim the misery, taxes and assessments which drew them from their homeland grew larger. On the other hand, the development of great industries in this country held the immigrants back from returning home. Restriction of immigration and bad conditions at home, as well as a forced Americanization, are also reasons why the immigrants stayed in this country.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav newcomers to America, without a knowledge of the life, language and customs of the land, encountered great difficulties. They were exploited, put to the most dangerous work, under the worst working conditions and lowest wages, what also is the case today.</p>
   <p>While the American-born workers knew the customs and language and found at least some protection in their trade unions, even state authorities gave them some attention. The Jugoslav workers were deprived of all that and compelled to take care of themselves in some mutual way.</p>
   <p>In small groups at first, later in great numbers, in their settlements they formed clubs, associations and organizations of immigrants. The main purpose of such organized units was to help the immigrant. Later on such clubs, associations and organizations were consolidated and developed in benevolent aid organizations.</p>
   <p>With more immigrant workers arriving there also came members of small bourgeoisie, a few intellectuals and clergy. The purpose of their coming was not work, but business, connivance and speculation and to live on the workers. Little by little this kind of immigrant was augmented by newcomers who became small proprietors, merchants and tradesmen. A separate, distinct group, of which the attitude was inimical toward the working class. This element invaded the benevolent organizations, where most of the workers were represented. Then they succeeded in wresting control of the organizations for themselves over the members' heads. As there are different political currents in the old country, they developed also among the immigrants here. Wo we see benevolent associations of immigrants divided into political groups.</p>
   <p>With the development of a Socialist and workers' movement in Europe, the Socialist agitation reached America and spread among Jugoslavs.</p>
   <p>The working class was not easily accessible to Socialist teachings because of the old patriarchic spirit left from feudal times and later influenced by the clergy and downcast intellectuals. Just the same in benevolent organizations it came to a clash between the working class, reactionary and nationalist elements. This clash was most intensive during the war. Many Socialist leaders instead of remaining true to the Socialist cause and its principles, brought Socialists from other lands who became traitors to the proletarian cause.</p>
   <p>The Russian revolution brought, as in many other things, great changes here. The working masses were for revolution. They thought that the unions and benevolent associations were for reaction and they had to be destroyed.</p>
   <p>After the victory of the Russian revolution and the establishment of the Communistic Internationale, the Jugoslav workers' movement became a Communist movement, accepting little by little the tactics, aims, mode of work and the spirit of the Cominterne, under the slogan: "With the masses."</p>
   
   <p>Reactionaries around the former Austro-Hungarian throne were disappointed by the downfall of this throne. Some of them worked for the creation of a new Jugoslavia. They were also disappointed because not one of the promises made to them was fulfilled. Contrary to the system, they became more reactionary, with just a new lord. Some became drunk with the victories of Serbian monarchists and expected a better economic life, but in vain. Hopes and expectations of all were destroyed. For that reason these cheated elements are accessible for a Communistic movement now.</p>
   <p>In the last few years, among the workers of America, a movement was introduced from Europe, of which the leader is Stephen Radio. Its members are disappointed reactionaries as well as Socialists who do not believe in a revolutionary movement of the masses.</p>
   <p>Taking into account all of what has been said, the Committee of the Jugoslav Section of the Labor Party of America came to the conclusion that (1) The benevolent organizations, according to the majority of their members, are workingmen's organizations; and associations; (2) That in these organizations prevails the spirit and thoughts of small bourgeoisie, because their members think that such organizations and societies are an ample defence against capitalism; (3) In politics such organizations and societies support the politics of the capitalistic class, with the slogan that politics are excluded from benevolent organizations. In fact, they exclude any other except their own reactionary politics.</p>
   <p>To the facts stated above the committee of the Jugoslav Section of the Labor Party of America replies:</p>
   <p>(a) Members of the Labor Party shall attempt to gain confidence among the benevolent organizations, so that these organizations will serve the interests of the labor movement. The most conscious fighters, the Communists, must appear in the first ranks for the protection of the workers' rights and their economic as well as political interests.</p>
   <p>(b) The duty of the progressive labor bloc is to free benevolent organizations of reactionary influences for the creation of a Labor Party as a party of the whole working class of America.</p>
   <p>(c) The slogan "no politics" in benevolent associations must be changed for class consciousness and the struggle for liberation of the working class.</p>
   <p>(d) Because of so many victims who belong to the working classes, benevolent organizations and associations must join the International Workers' Aid, to bring their share for the working class.</p>
