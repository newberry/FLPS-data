   <p>The Croatian Workers' Educational and Political Club in Chicago started a movement to come to the assistance of the needy unemployed. Last year they sponsored an entertainment that brought forty dollars net profit. Out of this little fund we have already helped a few unemployed workers, account of which was already given.</p>
   <p>There was $5.80 left, which sum the club donated to A. Subotic, the carpenter with a large family who has been out of work for almost a year.</p>
