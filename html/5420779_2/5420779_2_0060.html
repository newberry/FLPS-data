   <p>The Central Committee of Croatian Workers Educational and Political Federation in Chicago intends in the very near future to call representatives of Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian and Bulgarian socialist organizations to the conference, where a way should be found and plans made to form the Jugoslav Socialist Federation of America.</p>
   <p>The Federation would have a socio-political object, but in its inner economic circle would create a nucleus for one large cooperative print shop.</p>
   <p>In this print shop all of Jugoslav socialist newspapers, stationery, and booklets would be printed. In other words, the economic side of the Federation would be reflected in its print shop which would be purely commercial in its scope.</p>
   <p>As we understand the plans will be made by special committee elected at the meeting, when the agreement is made amongst the representatives, who first have to settle the question of the Jugoslav Federation of America. Two members of each nationality will be elected to the committee.</p>
   <p>When all that is done the by-laws will be printed and an executive board elected.</p>
