   <p>Hayes, Postmaster General of the United States, issued his decision finally in regard to some Socialist papers, and took an opportunity to express himself on what he thinks about censure or free press in general.</p>
   <p>During the war the newspaper Liberator of New York lost its second class matter privilege. This privilege was restored to Liberator and the postmaster ordered 11,000 dollars refunded, which was overpaid for postage.</p>
   <p>The former Postmaster General, Burleson, became the head censor of the press in America and his orders were followed to the point by postmasters and their employees. Of course, we do not blame Mr. Burleson for his <span class="page-break">2</span>hard head, he was supported by the espionage act, according to which every postmaster was empowered to hold a newspaper if he considered its contents against the government or immoral.</p>
   <p>When a law is indefinite there must be ill will and wrong doing by certain officials, as it was during wartime until today.</p>
   <p>The censorship was very strict and unjustified. Especially foreign language papers felt this lawlessness.</p>
   <p>In the post offices very often were employed ignorant officials who did not know languages and yet it was sufficient that such ignorant postal officials would say that some of the copies of a paper are "dangerous." The paper was suppressed and not mailed, awaiting directions from Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Postmaster General Hayes, in accord with President Harding, says that <span class="page-break">3</span>all which has happened was unjust, arbitrary and damaging. He is of the opinion that a newspaper, if it is proven to be revolutionary, advocating violence or criminal acts, must be suppressed, but before that is done, according to law, those responsible must stand trial, the same way as any other person before he can be punished.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hayes does not believe in a "bureaucratic treatment" of newspapers. He knows that such liberty will be often abused, but that seems much better than to discredit the respect for our land and its "liberal institutions."</p>
   <p>The capitalistic Chicago Daily News and Herald and Examiner approve highly the opinion of Postmaster General Hayes. Such statements of capitalist newspapers are very characteristic. We are sure these same papers would approve Mr. Hayes' opinion if he were for the worst of <span class="page-break">4</span>censorship. They did so during the Democratic administration.</p>
   <p>Under the Wilson administration they approved censorship and oppression of any kind. These newspapers were for any measure of the government, which limited liberty and thought.</p>
   <p>It is to see if the government wants really to restore freedom of the papers and speech, as we are to expect it, according to the statements of our Postmaster General.</p>
