   <p>The independent Croatian benevolent lodge "Batstvo" (Brotherhood) has purchased a building known as the National Hall, and will dedicate it to the use of all Jugoslavs. It will be known as the National Croatian Center.</p>
   <p>There are few Croatians who did not visit this hall in the past, because it is centrally located in our West Side colony and because of it it was more often used by Croatian cultural and benevolent groups than any other hall of its size.</p>
   <p>Our West Side colony did not have a large-sized hall in their hands in which all our activities could be accommodated. Lodge "Bratstvo," without shareholders, undertook to buy the hall, which will serve all our clubs and lodges. This is the first and only lodge to realize that ideal to serve and honor the whole Croatian colony in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>We therefore recommend and offer it to all Slavic organizations of the West Side of Chicago for their use.</p>
   <p>A new stage is being erected and we have smaller rooms for clubs, meetings, lectures, house parties and the like.</p>
   <p>At the same time we are announcing the opening celebration, which will take place Sunday, Oct. 23, at our hall, 1800-02 S. Racine Avenue.</p>
   <p>A select program and a pleasant time is in store for all. "Zora" will sing a few selections, as well as Mr. Babin, who will sing a tenor solo.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers there will be some Chicago aldermen and various Croatian leaders. M. Skvorc's orchestra and a string orchestra will furnish the music.</p>
