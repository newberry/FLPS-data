   <p>The annual meeting of the Greek Catholic parish was held last Sunday in St. Peter and Paul Church Hall, at 30th and Central Park Avenue, in Chicago.</p>
   <p>At that meeting, among other progressive things, the Gregorian calendar has been adopted. Our thanks to the brothers of Eastern faith who made a real step ahead in spite of the arguing and conniving back in the old country. A real solidarity of our three branches of the same people, and although we have differences in our religions, the fact that we have the same calendar and the old-Slavic language in the Catholic and in the Eastern Church, will bring us closer to acknowledge and understand Jugoslavia as a United Kingdom.</p>
   <p>According to the news from Jugoslavia, it will not be long before the Glagolica (old-Slavic) language is used in all Catholic churches. May God speed it up. The quicker the better.</p>

   <p>The above reasons are sufficient to make every parent realize the value in sending their children to the meetings. Our youth branch 17 has about two hundred members; about one third of that number should attend meetings. If they do this, we could make it interesting for them. We could arrange entertainments, give lectures, etc. All this, I think, could be done only if parents cooperate and send their children to meetings.</p>
