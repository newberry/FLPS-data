   <p>November 11th is the fifth Anniversary of the Armistice between America and her allies and the Central Powers.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslavs of the United States may, on this day, with pride point out to an action, started on that day which was honorably accomplished to the satisfaction of all those who participated in it.</p>
   <p>It is a known fact that the world forgets easily. Things good or bad have the same fate. We have had bad undertakings aplenty, but we had successful ones also. The most successful of our undertakings was the Jugoslav Relief Action which was sponsored on the day of Armistice, 1918, in Denver, Colorado, by two men; Walter Predovich and the late Peter Mladineo.</p>
   <p>This undertaking among our people was the first one, which once started, was finished honestly and successfully.</p>
   <p>This enterprise can serve as an example for other similar.</p>
   <p>Great sacrifices were necessary. One of the original organizers Peter Mladineo succumbed under the strain of work. But before he died he saw his efforts crowned with success in spite of obstacles, in spite of suspicion and efforts to hamper this great humane action.</p>
   <p>At the time of greatest need in the home country, when parents, brothers and sisters and relatives turned to America and expected help, when among political upheaval, there was neither time nor will to take care of the suffering poor, the Jugoslav Relief sent 1,774 boxes valued at a quarter of a million dollars, filled with food, clothing and other supplies to the fatherland.</p>
   <p>Testimony of official persons gives credit for the value of this action for moral and material support. All money was disbursed by May 16, 1921, from that date the Jugoslav Relief ceased to exist.</p>
   <p>But its aim and purpose were honestly fulfilled. Its name belongs to history, so that our people will not forget those who participated in this most needed, most honorable performed and most successfully accomplished action.</p>
