   <p>MEMORIAL BOOK FIFTH ANNIVERSARY 1929-1934 CROATIAN WOMEN'S CLUB "HRVATSKA ZENA" SUNDAY,</p>
   <p>APRIL 29, 1934</p>
   <p>FIVE YEAR ACTIVITIES OF THE CROATIAN WOMEN'S CLUB "HRVATSKA ZENA," BRANCH 1, CHICAGO</p>
   
   <p>The Croatian Women's Club, "Hrvatska Zena," Branch 1, was organized January 27, 1929. At the first meeting seven patriotic Croatian ladies came together to organize the first branch of "Hrvatska Zena" in the United States, following the call of the central office of the organization in their homeland, Croatia, at the city of Zagreb.</p>
   <p>To the committee were elected: Klara Skvorc, presldent; Agate Gjurak, vice-president; Rose Cesar, secretary, and Borislava Absac, treasurer.</p>
   <p>After its organization, by-laws for the club were drawn up and work started. The foundation of this work is to create sociability among Croatian women. To be interested in national and feminine activities, in humanitarian fields, in health preservation, enlightenment of the Croatian people, betterment of their economic life, and earning capabilities. Finally, to induce members of the club to become citizens of the United States.</p>
   
   <p>The club has to attend funerals of its members and decorate their graves on certain occasions.</p>
   <p>The first and most important duty of a Croatian woman must be to encourage patriotic feelings and charity toward the poor, not only in this country but also in the native homeland, which looks forward to our help with great expectations.</p>
   <p>At their second monthly meeting these patriotic Croatian women and mothers decided that, as a women's club, their first step must be to make a pilgrimage to the Children's Home of the Croatian Fraternal Union at Desplaines, Illinois, where they left presents of toys, books and candies for the children.</p>
   <p>The club "Hrvatska Zena" helped the central office at Zagreb to improve the graves of the Croatian martyrs who fell in the demonstrations at Zagreb, twenty-seven in number, on December 5, 1918 and June 20, 1928. They were just common people, but by their death, as a sacrifice for their nation, they became great.</p>
   <p>Their everlasting memory was secured by erecting a single monument for all at the cemetery Mirogoj at Zagreb, Croatia. This monument was built with the modest help of the club "Hrvatska Zena" of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The club "Hrvatska Zena," Branch 1, gives help in money and supplies to poor families, makes donations to the Croatian church and school, to the Children's Home; makes visits to the sick and distressed and brings help whenever possible. During this unforgettable crisis many families received clothing, shoes and groceries from the club "Hrvatsa Zena."</p>
   <p>At Christmas and Easter the poor in Croatia are not forgotten. They receive at least a small amount of money. The club "Hrvatska Zena"</p>
   
   <p>brought through its members theatrical performances of patriotic value to the stage, thus showing the patriotic feeling of its members for the Croatian homeland.</p>
   <p>The club "Hrvatska Zena" encourages its members to prefer their national Croatian embroideries, their colors and styles and work on them. Because of this at the International Exhibition of Embroideries held at the Hotel La Salle in Chicago, the exhibited articles of the club's members received first prizes.</p>
   <p>The club arranges picnics and excursions in summer; teas and musicales in winter. At the meetings refreshments are served. In conversation many forgotten Croatian words are brought to mind, and love and longing for the old native Croatian country is restored.</p>
   <p>The good example of the "Hrvatska Zena" branch one. of Chicago, was followed by many Croatian settlements throughout the United States, where additional branches were established. Each branch is working independently according to the by-laws, but the leader for all is the pride of Croatia, the central office of the "Hrvatska Zena" at the Croatian capital, Zagreb, the center of Croatian culture.</p>
   <p>The work of the central office reflects the true character of the Croatian women.</p>
   <p>In connection with its fifth anniversary the Croatian women's club "Hrvatska Zena" Branch 1 of Chicago, called the first convention of all Croatian women's clubs' branches in America for the first of May, 1934. At that convention means will be found and ways adopted to (discover) what to do to secure a better future of all the branches of the Croatian women's clubs "Hrvatska Zena" throughout the United States.</p>
