   <p>Croats began coming more than fifty years ago to the section of the city known as South Chicago. In 1902, a Slovene priest, Father John Plevnik, made his way to South Chicago with the intention of organizing a parish of Slovenes and building a church, but he did not succeed.</p>
   <p>In February 1903, the Reverend John Kranjec came to South Chicago and began organizing Slovenes and Croats into one parish, the St. George Parish. A plot of ground for a church building was bought on the corner of Ewing Avenue and 96th Street, and the church was dedicated June 17, 1904, by Archbishop J. E. Quigley.</p>
   <p>The new parish prospered for many years, but finally the parishioners became split into two hostile groups; the Slovenes and the Croats. The latter, who were in the majority, complained that the Croatian parishioners were being neglected by the priest, a Slovene. On April 28, 1912, a committee was selected to appeal to the Bishop to send a Croatian priest to the parish. The Bishop advised the Croats to build their own church and assured them that he would get them a priest. And on Christmas, 1912, the Croats of South Chicago did have a Croat priest, Reverend Father Soric, to celebrate Mass. From that time on, many of the leading Croatians of South Chicago became interested in having a church of their own and a Croat priest. They succeeded in getting the Reverend Ivan A. Stipanovich, under whose leadership funds were collected and a new church built. The Daily Calumet of December 24, 1913 wrote the following:</p>
   <p>"The new Croatian Church on 96th Street and Exchange Avenue will have its first service Christmas Eve, at 12 midnight. The Reverend Father I. A. Stipanovich, pastor of the congregation, is happily engaged with his people in decorating and preparing his church for the first Mass, which they are so gladly awaiting. Although this young pastor has been in this country only one year, in this short time he has made great progress, together with his countrymen and leaders of the Croatian people of South Chicago, toward uplifting and educating his people by building up their school and church.</p>
   <p>"We sincerely wish him every success and increase, as we do every other good work in South Chicago."</p>
   <p>The first Mass was read in the new church on Christmas Eve, 1912. The cornerstone was laid August 31, 1913, and the church was dedicated by Archbishop Quigley on May 17, 1914.</p>
