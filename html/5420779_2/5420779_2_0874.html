   <p>The struggle long lasted whether illiterate immigrants should be admitted to this country or not. In other times this circumstance was not considered at all. The capitalists needed workers, which this country was not able to supply. In those times they were compelled to favor immigration and the most important thing for the immigrant was his ability to perform the heaviest work.</p>
   <p>Today the labor market is overcrowded. There are plenty of immigrants as well as American workers. Immigrants work at the heaviest tasks, but you can also find Americans.</p>
   <p>The problem of unemployment is getting bigger and becomes dangerous for peace and order.</p>
   <p>The bourgeoisie struggles against immigration now. It does not know better and never will.</p>

   <p>Last year Congress passed a law for restriction of immigration. The Senate passed the law with a great majority - 64 against 7. President Wilson vetoed the part of that law which restricts immigration to illiterates, January 31. The President's veto was defeated by a vote of 286 against 106 votes. The veto will be defeated also in the Senate and restriction will become law.</p>
   <p>This law is the incarnation of the thoughtlessness and idiocy of the governing class.</p>
   <p>People who do not know to read and write in general are not worse than other people. On the contrary these people are better, more industrious, less bad and more moral than "intelligent" people who are in private and public positions, and who live from others' labors.</p>
   <p>The illiterates, we can boldly say, built this republic, created its wealth, position and power. A great deal of thanks goes to the illiterate immigrants of Europe for the fact that America is the greatest land on earth.</p>

   <p>And now such people are dangerous and superfluous for America. They will not be admitted from now on, but the conditions will go on in the United States under which millions of illiterates will be counted.</p>
   <p>Another shame will be added to Ellis Island and other ports of entry, a sign: "Entrance to Illiterates Forbidden."</p>
