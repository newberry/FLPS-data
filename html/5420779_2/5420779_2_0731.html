   <p>The European war opened the door for begging in America. It looks as if American dollars will dry many a European tear.</p>
   <p>For example, in New York they collected for the American Red Cross, $293,-627; the German Aid Fund collected $150,699; the Belgian, $246,997; the Fund of the Prince of Wales, $64,516; the Fund for the American Hospital at Paris collected $108,136.</p>
   <p>More money was collected also by different nationalities in America.</p>
   <p>America has thousands of unemployed persons today and nobody helps them. Here is money collected and sent to Europe, where hundreds of thousands of dollars are thrown away with the purpose to kill each other and devastate the land.</p>
   <p>Today anything may happen. Any absurdity is taken seriously.</p>
