   <p>Miss Mary Bartelme, for Judge of Circuit Court:</p>
   <p>The problem of girls who get in contact with our Juvenile Court is one which affects greatly the future of our Nation.</p>
   <p>These girls are our future wives and mothers. All of them are not bad. None of them is beyond salvation. All of them are worthy to be saved. But the average persons are not able to reform them. They do not want to open their hearts to everybody, but only to sympathetic and understanding women.</p>
   <p>Such a sympathetic and understanding woman is Miss Bartelme.</p>
   <p>For ten years, as Assistant Judge of the Juvenile Court, Miss Bartelme did guide these girls from wrong to right paths. Now she is a candidate for Judge of the Circuit Court, for the vacated position. She will not take the place of a man. She will remain in the Juvenile Court, in the same function but as an elected and not an appointed judge. We recommend her as a real woman for a position which belongs to a Woman.</p>
