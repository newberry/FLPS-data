   <p>Attention is being called to the workers of Chicago and members of our organization in particular, that it was unanimously voted to participate in the International Workers' Picnic, sponsored by the Socialist Party, Sunday, Aug. 15, in the Spachman's Grove.</p>
   <p>Our singing choir "Sloboda" will sing and the orchestra "Sloga" will furnish the music.</p>
   <p>Among other interesting activities there will be a foot race, gymnastics, and free dance.</p>
   <p>Admission fee is 25 cents, children free.</p>
   <p>The profit from the picnic is for the support of the Daily Socialist, whose editor will be the speaker at the picnic. The whole group will meet at the Lodge Hall, 606 S. Center Avenue, at 1 P. M. The members may meet there, and from there we will proceed to the grove.</p>
