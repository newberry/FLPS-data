   <p>Why did we emigrate? During the last decades thousands of Jugoslav workers left their native soil and went all over the world.</p>
   <p>The life of our workers is just as the life of the workers in other nations: a life of misery, pain and sufferings.</p>
   <p>Jugoslav lands are mostly agricultural. The farm worker has a hard life, so hard that he himself is not able to discover his heavy burden.</p>
   <p>Summer is gone, autumn approaches and the farmer with wife and children gathers the harvest, preparing for a cold, long winter. Before the harvest is finished comes the tax collector. If the farmer has no cash he takes away most of the farmer's harvest.</p>

   <p>Taxes, assessments and other expenses which were paid by small landowners, low wages and long hours of work in city or village, as well as the failure of small tradesmen to bear the competition of great industry, were the main causes of emigration.</p>
   <p>These were whips which lashed the body and soul of the farmer and worker. These whips in the form of taxes drove away farmers and workers from their native home.</p>
   <p>Hard life drove us to seek better fortunes here in America. But what is the life of a working man in America? When we borrowed money for the passage to America, on 40 to 50% interest, we mortgaged our honor and properties of our relatives to repay the debts.</p>
   <p>Departing for America we thought of going to a country of liberty as the agents told us. But there is no trace of liberty in America for a working man.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Not knowing the language, eager to obtain work, to earn money, to repay the debts, we were ready to work for low wages under any conditions.</p>
   <p>Many of us became sick, spent our money on doctors and medicines. Many lost their limbs, many their lives; some lost hope to return home and repay the debts.</p>
   <p>Waiting the return of better times for years, many became loiterers, bums, gamblers, thieves. Their hopes of a better future were cheated; they became greater misers.</p>
   <p>Such a life of our workers in America compelled us to do something to overcome those ills. First we started to organize in benevolent organizations, to have material help in case of sickness, to give relatives a death benefit in case of our death. But such associations are not of help in case of unemployment. For that reason we joined different workers' unions, of which the purpose is to shorten working time and raise wages.</p>

   <p>More far-seeing workers joined political parties to change the present system and to create more agreeable conditions of life.</p>
