   <p>In the National Croatian Society's 15th convention, held in the city of Detroit, Michigan, a resolution was adopted to pay out of the national fund to the Croatian orphanage the sum of $5,000, as a present for the laying of the corner stone.</p>
   <p>Resolution for support of the Croatian orphanage: The 15th Convention of the N. C. S. recognizes the association's efforts to support a Croatian orphanage in America, with the seat in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>For that reason that association moved its operation for welfare of the orphanage out of Chicago, and because of that it is misunderstood in other places. It is thereby concluded that the Association for the Support of a Croatian Orphanage in America in the future will limit its operations to the city of Chicago and its immediate vicinity.</p>
   <p>It is further recommended that in other places where our people live, <span class="page-break">\2</span>a similar action should start, and devote time and work toward raising and supporting Croatian orphanages in America.</p>
   <p>Members of the National Croatian Society are continuously contributing regular monthly assessment toward the Orphan's Fund.</p>
