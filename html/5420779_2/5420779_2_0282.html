   <p>Fifteen years ago the Croatian singing club "Zora" initiated a movement to organize here in America a federation of all Croatian singing clubs. It looked as if conditions were not favorable at that time, so the idea had to wait for better times. Now everything is favorable, our singing clubs are developed; it is very easy to do now what fifteen or even ten years ago was practically impossible.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of 1912 "Zora" asked for the cooperation of other clubs and received answers from Dr. A. Starcevic, from Milwaukee, and "Hrvatska Vila," from Pueblo, Colo. That which fifteen years ago two clubs were willing to accept, twenty can accept today.</p>
   <p>Sunday, Nov. 20, "Zora" will celebrate its 25th anniversary. Monday it will hold a conference with representatives of various clubs which will attend the celebration, and make plans as to how soon we could organize into sections of singing clubs belonging to the Federation of Singing Clubs in Zagreb, Jugoslavia.</p>
   
   <p>We need not mention what part our singing clubs play in our Jugoslav life nor how much more they can contribute when they are grouped into large sections and under strong leadership.</p>
   <p>"Zora" has been a member of the Federation of Croatian Singing Clubs in Zagreb, Jugoslavia, since 1909, and has benefited by it very much, but to organize in America into sections will help all.</p>
   <p>F. Silaj, "Zora's" Secretary.</p>
