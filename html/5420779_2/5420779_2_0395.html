   <p>A short while ago a campaign was started for the Radnik and directing instructions were sent to all party sections as to how they may proceed to help pull Radnik out of the present crisis. When the Chicago section thrashed out this question it elected a committee to make plans for a successful campaign.</p>
   <p>The committee arranged the plans and called on the members of the Chicago fraction to submit a plan which divides the city into various colonies, and assigned a group of comrades to start work in their districts. They also called subscribers and sympathizers to a gathering where they were asked to volunteer for agitation.</p>
   <p>The Wentworth colony has already acted. Many were present at the gathering. Comrade Bosuric explained the part which the labor press is playing in contemporary class society, and the only way through which workers can realize and learn their class duty and educate and prepare themselves for the eventual struggle which is approaching.</p>

   <p>The comrade also touched on the part which the workers' press played in ex-monarchist Russia, where Pravda was the spark of that volcanic outburst of 1917. It buried tsarism forever and established the power of the peasants and workers over one sixth of the globe. It founded the basis of the Soviet revolution which follows the policy of the Russian Bolsheviks, tore down the old and corrupt order, and built a new one. That is communism under which there will be no exploitation.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the comrade's meeting it was called to order. All comrades volunteered to work; they will agitate in pairs. A long and constructive discussion followed and it was decided that a banquet would be given on May 19 to the one receiving the largest number of subscriptions.</p>
   <p>I might mention that during the discussion great interest was shown in Radnik. Workers realize the importance of the labor press. Here is one example: When we spoke about premiums and prizes for those qualifying in the three-month drive for subscriptions, some declined the premiums and offered them toward <span class="page-break">\3</span>the spreading of class consciousness among workers. The greatest premium, if we succeed in multiplying the number of workers, is to share our ideals so that we may build a revolutionary movement.</p>
   <p>The results are being heard. While I am writing these lines we are expecting large returns in the near future.</p>
