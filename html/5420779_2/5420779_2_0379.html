   <p>This is the first issue of Znanje, the continuation of the previous Novi Svijet, which enters its 12th year.</p>
   <p>We believe that because of the change, many of our readers will be surprised, but for the members of the Jugoslav Educational Association it is not news.</p>
   <p>The discussion among the members of the Association and friends of educational work has been recently in favor of a periodical such as Znanje, which contributed so much toward enlightening our people while it was the official organ of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation.</p>
   <p>War and post war circumstances brought mighty changes which had an especially detrimental effect on the labor movement in general; the <span class="page-break">2</span>movement of the Jugoslav immigrant suffered likewise.</p>
   <p>Regardless of how difficult were the material, mental and moral circumstances through which they had to go in spite of disappointments in movements which no longer offered them the development possible before and from which they expected more than they received, somehow a favorable impression was left in their heart toward Znanje.</p>
   <p>Our purpose is not to resurect the late Znanje to return to that which is gone; which was then contemporary today would be out of date, would not respond to new circumstances.</p>
   <p>We could not do that because in the first place the late Znanje, after all, was an organ of a political organization which we left because we found that it did not measure up to our ideals and had fooled us in our hopes and expectations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The labor movement was always considered by us as an anti-war movement.</p>
   <p>Because of the stand taken against war, the authorities destroyed our Radnicka Straza, and we were forced to start another newspaper. Only one number of Novi Misli (New Thought) was printed in Chicago, and the whole issue of many thousands found its way into the Chicago Post Office's basement, in spite of the fact that there was no anti-war material in it. The authorities found "revolting" thoughts in it and the paper was condemned in its inception.</p>
   <p>In the beginning Znanje was occupied principally with educational problems, literature, advices, various cultural information, philosophy, economics and sociology. All this was printed with great care so that it did not come in conflict with postal regulations. But later, when publication of material concerning war was allowed, and still later when the censorship was lifted, Znanje was largely occupied with daily occurrences of a political and social nature.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Then new difficulties began. Some men in the organization got the revolutionary fever and missinterpreted the condition as revolution in America; nobody needs any more education, any knowledge, but to prepare to receive the revolution. If anyone made the most reasonable opposition to that hysteria, they would immediately be declared traitors and counter-revolutionary; which we were amply called when we left them and started Novi Svijet and later organized the Jugoslav Educational Association.</p>
   <p>Now, according to the resolution passed by members at conference and previously adopted by the central committee of the Association, with this issue the name of Novi Svijet is changed into Znanje (Knowledge).</p>
