   <p>One of the greatest and wisest arguments against woman's vote is the assertion that women not only are unable to rule society's affairs, but what is more important is that if women get the vote it will mean destruction of home and family.</p>
   <p>"Woman's place is at home," say the conservatives and villains who want to exploit women.</p>
   <p>But what an irony! They say woman's place is at home with her family. But where is her family? Seventy per cent of women have neither home nor family. How can they tend to family or home if they have none?</p>
   <p>The capitalist production drove the greater part of women from their homes, mainly the young girls. The exploitation is so terrible that most of the girls cannot marry because workers are not able to support a family. These girls receive very small wages generally and are compelled to go wrong, to earn means for their support.</p>
   
   <p>Many women live in homes not their own. That is not a "home" but just some place to live from pure necessity.</p>
   <p>Thousands of women live in mortgaged homes which are not real homes. If it is said that woman must stay at home with a family, why not go farther and guarantee to women a real home?</p>
   <p>However, the gentlemen bosses will never do it. They make the women work for their profit. In their hands is the machinery of the government with the desire to keep women from politics under all circumstances.</p>
   <p>Woman will not be free until she takes an active part in politics, until she takes control over affairs of government into her own hands. That is possible only if she gets the right to vote. This right does not exclude the possibility that a woman is or becomes a good mother and sister, a good housekeeper and educator of our children. All this she can achieve only then, if at the same time she is a good citizen.</p>
