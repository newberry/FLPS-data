   <p>All the progressive peoples of Europe condemned those in power in Hungary and their leader Khuen Herdervary for the suspension of constitutional rights in Croatia and Slavonia.</p>
   <p>In consequence of the activity of our Croatian people here in the United States, protest meetings were held in many places where a number of our hard-working compatriots live to give vent to the bitterness felt over the oppression of our people in Croatia.</p>
   <p>As may be seen from the paragraph above, in Hungary as well in Croatia the struggle for the people's rights does not cease, but has just begun. The Central Committee of the National Croatian Union is to be congratulated on its decision to donate the sum of $3,000 to help the national struggle in their homeland Croatia.</p>
