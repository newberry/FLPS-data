   <p>One of our oldest financial institutions in Chicago, established by our immigrants and known as The First Croatian Building and Loan Association, will celebrate its 25th anniversary in the National Hall, at 1802 South Racine Avenue.</p>
   <p>A very choice program is being arranged. Our best forces, clubs and individuals, will participate. Prominent personalities of the state and the city will speak. A banquet will be given after the program. As this is the first such celebration ever held in Chicago and in all America among our people, the members and the committee of the Association expect a large crowd to turn out. Those wishing to make reservations for the banquet should address their correspondence to Mr. F. Halaus, 1803 South Throop Street, or phone Canal 4066.</p>
