   <p>Croatian and Serbian patriotism in America has two main currents.</p>
   <p>One section of the Serbians and Croatians is for fantastic Jugoslavia; the other section, mostly Dalmatians, sympathizes with the "beloved king" and with the heroes in the old country.</p>
   <p>It is hard to tell who are worse, those of the first faction or those of the second. One party glorifies the old idiot Francis Joseph; the other does the same for the Russian Czar, the Serbian government, and King Peter.</p>
   <p>Let us see how they announce their meetings. There are large placards in big print announcing a great personage and speaker from Jugoslovia, etc. The people are called to a public meeting. At the meeting there is no freedom of speech for any opponent, so that they are able to pass "unanimously" everything in the form of expressions of reverence for the various monarchs and governments.</p>
   
   <p>A few miserable newspapers like Hrvatska Zastava (Croatian Flag) in Chicago print articles full of praise for the "great fighters" for Jugoslavia, who are for the most part men of limited ability.</p>
   <p>A quite average doctor became at once one of the "biggest fighters" for Jugoslavia, a man who cannot speak ten sentences correctly or write one original article; he repeats like a parrot what other "patriots" say and write in Europe.</p>
   <p>The Hrvatska Zastava has begun to praise and recommend Biankini, his wife, its publisher Weber, the black-robed Velimirovic, and many other charlatans and agents of various rulers who come to this country to destroy what remnants of common sense which are still left in our exploited and harassed people after their struggle for their daily bread. The other papers are not much better than Hrvatska Zastava.</p>
   <p>Biankini has become the central figure in Croatian and Jugoslav life in America, a figure which is the incarnation of imbecility and brazenness, incapable of useful work. All at once all reactionaries, all ignoramuses, and all those without conscience have become "great". All have become friends of the working people, orators, writers, lecturers, freethinkers. After the meetings they go to fine luxurious hotels, where banquets are held. Toasts are drunk, and with glasses full of wine, they open their mouths and declare "never-ending love" for the Serbian, Croatian, and Slovenian people.</p>
   <p>Many of the papers become so loathsome and brazen that you do not want to read them on account of such cretinous hypocrisy, flattery, servility, and adulation of patriotic do-nothings and parasites. They do need slaves! They have lived on them. They want to live thus eternally. They need medals, praise from the Russian Czar, from the Serbian King, from President Wilson. They need advertising. They want to be "famous" men!</p>
   <p>They are able to do it. The resistance of the people is weak. The people, overworked, have no time to read or to think with their own heads. The people run like sheep after those persons who lie most glibly, who praise themselves, and who have little if any conscience.</p>
   <p>We say to the corrupt patriots, to the unsavory clergy, to the undignified newspapermen, to the black-robed monks, to the gravediggers of national consciousness and liberty:</p>
   <p>"Rob the people! Cheat them, you brazen creatures! Today is yours. Now is the time to impress deeper in the people's souls esteem for monarchy, love for the rich, obedience to the powerful. Forward," rabid reactionaries and egotists! The madness which has taken possession of the whole world gives you a special right. The European shambles has destroyed all civilization, all morality--you have no reason to abstain from your nefarious work!</p>
   <p>"But be it known that the storm of darkness and barbarism will disappear. Life will tear the foundations from your errors and your sinister designs. If these people do not come to their senses, their progeny will. You will live in their memory as the abominable apparitions of retrogression, the standard-bearers of absurdity, and the enemies of civilization."</p>
