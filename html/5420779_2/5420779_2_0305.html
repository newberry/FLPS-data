   <p>There are lively times in the Singing Society "Sloboda." There are twenty members by now -- twenty working people who want with their song to awaken the working class. They learn diligently, there is great harmony among them.</p>
   <p>We hope that the Singing Society "Sloboda" will fulfill her purpose and be of great benefit to the Croatian people and to the working class.</p>
   <p>We wish that all workingmen join this society.</p>
