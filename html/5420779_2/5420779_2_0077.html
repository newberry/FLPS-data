   <p>The Secretary of our Jugoslav Socialist Federation received a letter from Ljubljana--from Etbin Kristan, Socialist Leader--in which Kristan announces that he will arrive in America for sure by the end of August. Comrade Kristan comes to start a tour of lectures sponsored by the Jugoslav Socialist Federation.</p>
   <p>Since it is only three months before Kristan's arrival, this short time has to be used for agitation, if we want his lectures and meetings to be of the greatest benefit to our struggle.</p>
   <p>The locals of the Federation may get information from the Secretary. Do not delay. This year is one of great events, of big fights. Strikes are going on everywhere. The Presidential election is near. Such times have <span class="page-break">2</span>to be used for our biggest Socialist campaign.</p>
   <p>We have to help our ranks enlarge our press. The journey of Mr. Kristan is made for this purpose.</p>
   <p>We must not be unprepared; we must be ready!</p>
