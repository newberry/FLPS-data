   <p>The military authorities declared clearly that they will disregard petitions of conscientious objectors who ask for exemption from military service.</p>
   <p>The law states that all those will be exempted who are members of religious and other organizations, which are against military service and the killing of humans.</p>
   <p>On this ground all members of the Socialist Party in America must be freed from military service. This party always had paragraphs in its program which accentuated our opposition to war and murder, against military service and war credits.</p>
   <p>Thousands of Socialists handed in their petitions to be freed from military service on ground of this law. But not one petition was granted. That is unjust.</p>

   <p>The Socialists are opponents of the capitalistic system and private properties, which are the causes of war. If they oppose the causes they oppose the consequences also.</p>
   <p>The Socialists oppose the principle of "an eye for an eye." The Socialists support the principle, "Don't kill!" Socialists will fight anything that is low, unjust and bad in society. They struggle for a society in which all will work, but enjoy the fruits of their work equally.</p>
   <p>The Socialists were and are opponents of secret diplomacy, of czars and kaisers, of society's robbers and drones.</p>
   <p>They are not a bit to blame for wars. They abhor the play of diplomats, in which the best sons of humanity perish, in which great riches are destroyed, in which humans become beasts, in which civilization submits to brutal force and beastly instincts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Cultural, moral, humanitarian and most noble arguments speak in favor of Socialism and it is the greatest tyranny and injustice to force them to do something against which they struggle and struggled, against what their conscience, their education and most sacred human interests revolt.</p>
