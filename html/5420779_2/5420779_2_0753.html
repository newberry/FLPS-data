   <p>Representatives of various of our cultural and benevolent groups held a conference April 21st for the purpose of making plans, concerning the legislation aimed against foreigners in this country. A temporary committee of eight was elected, with instructions to call a mass meeting for American citizens of Jugoslav extraction so that all together could take necessary steps against such bills. In first place there is the bill in congress now, according to which admission of our immigrants would be based on the number of entrances in the year of 1890, which would curtail our peoples chances of coming here as our immigration of 1890 was very small, and the new law would reduce our quote to about twenty admissions. Another bill in congress is to stop all foreign language newspapers. A third bill calls for registration of all aliens who are not American citizens.</p>
   <p>There are similar bills, which may become law, as in the past many such laws were enacted, if aliens themselves, rather American citizens don't start section to prevent it.</p>
   <p>Against those laws is the whole worker's press in America, there are also free thinking organizations who are willing to aid us in the struggle. Before all it is necessary that the foreign born come forth supporting their countrymen.</p>
