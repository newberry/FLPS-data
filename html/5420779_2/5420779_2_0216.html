   <p>Man was not born to live alone. Man needs companionship. Man alone was not able to defend himself against wild animals or against the elements of nature. He established a family. Several families formed a tribe, and several tribes a nation. Man alone can do hardly anything well. One makes tools, the other uses them in cultivating soil, to give us bread and clothes, the third one builds dwellings to give us shelter, the fourth makes all kinds of articles in a factory necessary for life, etc. This mutual activity created all the necessities and luxuries of life.</p>
   <p>While it is true that today's progress is the work of mutual activity, it is also true that all men do not equally enjoy its results. This injustice brought about many movements aiming to right that injustice. Time only can tell if the collective movement on which our building and loan association is founded is just an unsuccessful experiment or a solid foundation for the economical liberation of humanity.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The idea of collectivism originated when man helped his neighbor to build a home, to cultivate his fields or helped him with other necessary work. That must have been at the dawn of civilization.</p>
   <p>The cooperative or collective movement started in England at the end of the 18th century, when the weavers of Rochdale organized the first cooperative.</p>
   <p>From that movement developed a mighty cooperative movement to which twenty-five million people belonged.</p>
   <p>Here in America we have many successful cooperatives. Fruit growers in California and Florida, farmers' cooperatives in Minneseta, Michigan, Texas, etc., fisheries on the coasts of both oceans, gardening cooperatives on the Atlantic coast. In most of these cooperatives you will find Croatians.</p>
   <p>To this chain of collective and cooperative activities belong also the building and loan associations.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>What are those associations?</p>
   <p>The shortest definition is: the building and loan associations are financial institutions founded on a cooperative basis. Under the control of the state, their aim is to help the members to own their own home and to pay for it under the easiest terms.</p>
   <p>In the building and loan associations the members save collectively and loan money to their fellow members from their realized savings. The profit derived from such business is equally divided among the members. The business is conducted collectively for a common profit. Like other cooperative enterprises the building and loan associations appeared around the year 1798.</p>
   <p>In America the first building and loan association was established at Frankfort, Pa., which town is today a suburb of Philadelphia.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The associations are united in a league under the name United States League of Local Building and Loan Associations.</p>
   <p>What is the difference between a building and loan association established on a cooperative foundation and between financial institutions organized on another principles?</p>
   <p>In capitalistic financial institutions the control and management are in the hands of the few. You may have some shares, but you have no vote. In the building and lean association each member, even with the smallest investment, has a vote. Not only that, but he may also participate in discussions and has the right to elect and to be elected an officer or director of the association.</p>
   <p>In capitalistic institutions the depositor is a dead letter, without significance without value, while in cooperative associations he is a live unit, which acts and takes part in all the proceedings.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The depositor possesses voice and power, which in capitalistic institutions only privileged persons have, especially those who command large investments.</p>
   <p>Our Croatian people who came to this country from villages, where the cooperative idea is strongly implanted, did not pay much attention to this kind of economic organization for many reasons of which the first one is our lack of understanding of business in general and the second one is our lack of great business ability.</p>
   <p>How could a peasant coming from a village have these abilities? But after a short while our Croatian grasped those things of which he was ignorant for lack of early schooling. He saw what other nationalities were doing, and so he did the same thing.</p>
   <p>Little by little in denser Croatian settlements appeared Croatian institutions and foremost among them the First Croatian Building and Loan Association of Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>In normal times while men are working regularly they deposit their membership dues in the loan association. The other members accept loans on which they pay interest, which in turn is paid out to the depositors as dividends. The association, taking money from one member and loaning it to another member is nothing else but an intermediary between parties. The money is not left with the association but only certain financial papers remain there as a guarantee that the deposited money will be returned with interest. As long as people are working everything runs smoothly. But when employment fails the members are few, the deposits and payments occur seldom and the association must limit loans and repayments to depositors.</p>
   <p>The First Croatian Building and Loan Association acted at the start of the financial crisis as befitted the situation. It was saved and that is of the greatest importance. And yet, as far as the conditions did allow the association helped, however modestly, its depositors.</p>
   <p>In the modest but careful operations of today, this association waits for the <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>opportunity, like a ship to lift anchors. The association survived. We must be grateful for that.</p>

   <p>History of the First Croatian Building and Loan Association in Chicago. The present board of directors of the First Croatian Building and Loan Association offers a memorial book of this national Croatian institution, of its work and activity during the 25 years of its existence.</p>
   <p>This book shows the causes which led to organize this association and how it was developed and its influence on the life of our Croatian people in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>It is also our wish that this book should become an interpreter of the present conditions of this institution as well as of its activities in the past. To show of what benefit it has been to our people, which in turn will serve as a true guide for further work.</p>
   <p>The Starting Point</p>
   <p>One day, 1910, three friends came together by chance - Tomo Lackovic, Mike Staresinic, and Josip Mlaker. Their conversation turned to our social life, which was very active in those times. Charitable and cultural societies were springing up among Croatian immigrants. Although there was social progress, a void was left. There was not one banking institution to take care of the small savings of our Croatian workers, to teach them to save, to keep their money for times of need, and to help others by their savings.</p>
   <p>These three friends felt the need of such an institution. They decided then and there to establish such an institution. They set a plan and made the necessary preparations for the establishment of the first Croatian building and loan association.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Thoughts were put into action. The first meeting was called for the 10th of May, 1910, at the residence of Simun Lackevic, 1819 S. Fisk Street. On this occasion Tom Lackovic explained the necessity for the Croatians in Chicago to organize a financial institution and made the motion to establish the First Creatian Building and Loan Association, Chicago, Illinois. This motion was seconded with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cyril R. Jandus, a notary public, had the application for a charter ready. The application was signed by Tomo Lackovic, Mike Staresinic, Janko Mulig, Ivan Bozic, Petar Hergeg, Aleksa Braje and Simun Lackovic, who are charter members.</p>
   <p>With this act was laid the foundation for the first Croatian building and loan association. The next meeting was held at the same address on May 16th, 1910, at which meeting were present Mike Staresinic, Josip Mlaker, Ivan Bozic, Inocent Miller, Jankolovrencic, Simun Lackovic, and Tomo Lackovic, who became the first members, upon the declaration of Tomo Lackevic. After the registration of the new members Tomo Lackovic was instructed to start, and it was <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>resolved that as soon as one hundred shares were subscribed the first public meeting would be called and officers and directors would be elected.</p>
   <p>The first public meeting was held June 20, 1910, at the same address. On request of Tomo Lackovic, C. R. Jandus explained to the assembly the by-laws, also the law according to which the association had to function. At the same time the purpose of the institution was explained as well as the duties of the members, directors and officers.</p>
   <p>The first officers elected that day were as follows: Juraj Soic, president; Andro Pozgaj, vice-president; Mike Staresinic, secretary; Tomo Lackovic, treasurer; Anton Vidicek and Josip Mlaker, assistant secretaries; F. J. Kovacevic and Simun Lackovic, assistant directors; Dragutin Miskatovic, Josip Malker and Anton Vidicek, trustees; C. R. Jandus, notary public and attorney.</p>
   <p>The assembly voted to put the secretary and treasurer under bond. The officers declared that they would work without pay except the secretary, who will receive one dollar per week. It was resolved to hold meetings each Wednesday evening at 1819 S. Fisk Street, at the same place and time business is conducted today.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>All above named members, officers and directors of the First Croatian Building and Loan Association are considered as pioneers of this first Croatian enterprise. They spent much time and labor among our people, visiting their homes or locals in order to convince the Croatians that they should save. It was a thorny path at the beginning. This small crowd of determined men we have to thank for the existence of this Croatian institution.</p>
   <p>From this short presentation of facts we see that the Association was established in the home of its present treasurer, Simun Lackovic, its faithful servant from its inception until today.</p>
   <p>Activities and Work of the Board</p>
   <p>Each beginning is hard, especially that of an institution to which our people were not accustomed. The beginning was made more difficult because there were men who out of ignorance or of suspicion spread fears among the people, saying that for such an enterprise we lacked experienced men.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>The administration surmounted these difficulties and invested its own money to gain the confidence of the people.</p>
   <p>By such action the officers and directors won the trust of the people in the association.</p>
   <p>A junior section was established. Parents paid for their children fifty cents per week. Also a so-called class "C" was formed. The member paid at once $75 and received a share of $100 par value. If the money was withdrawn before maturity the depositor received 4% interest.</p>
   <p>Affiliations</p>
   <p>After the first difficulties the First Croatian Building and Loan Association was successful. Its membership increased by granting loans in small instalments for building or purchasing of homes.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>To enlarge its business the association decided in April, 1912, to establish representative offices in Croatian settlements around Chicago and vicinity. Such an office was first established in South Chicago, June 26, 1912, at George Lalic, later on, this office was taken over by Frank Radocaj, 9627 Commercial Avenue.</p>
   <p>In 1913 another branch office was established among brother Dalmatians at 2344 Wentworth Avenue. A third branch was opened in 1916 in North Chicago, 1102 Sheridan Road. This branch was opened at the request of Croatians of that section. For the same reason a branch was opened at Lyons, Ill. The fifth branch office was established at 5943 S. Justine St. Thus the business of the association was spread over all the Croatian settlements in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The previously mentioned class "C" was not a success, therefore class "D" was introduced, on which $100 was to be invested at once, bearing interest every six months.</p>
   <p>On September 25, 1922, a class "AA" was introduced, payments extending for three and a half years. Both innovations were very successful.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>The association bought from the government bonds and war stamps totaling $1,083.80. The bonds were redeemed by the government in 1922, the war stamps in 1923.</p>
   <p>Acceptance by the people</p>
   <p>Our first Croatian Building and loan association was accepted by the people as a real national institution. Numerous letters expressed their good wishes at our 25th anniversary. Not only private persons but also societies became members and invested money in the association, giving, by so doing, their own members an example.</p>
   <p>Through small deposits the members were possessors after some time of larger sums of money, which enabled them to enter business independently or to buy their own home. By the accumulation of small deposits the association was able to grant loans in small installments, thus promoting self-assistance. Figures show that mortgage loans were granted to the amount of $4,100,000. This means that the Creatian people owned that amount and many came to own their own homes. The books also show that $3,800,000 were withdrawn. This generous amount was the result of small saving deposits; their owners avoided <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>by these proceedings to become public charges or to depend from their friends and relatives.</p>
   <p>From the first 500 shares the association had thus become a great business institution.</p>
   <p>But also somber days did come with the arrival of the depression. The value of real estate dropped. The First Croatian Building and Loan Association and its members were hit hardest through this devaluation. Although many financial institutions went bankrupt the First Croatian Building and Loan Association weathered the storm and awaited better times.</p>
   <p>In these days of grief the management tries means and ways to help the members to save their homes and savings. Many homes were saved. They would have been auctioned off under other circumstances. The association has fulfilled its duty during the most trying times for our Croatian immigrants.</p>
   <p>We must stress these facts to encourage our people not to lose heart, but to <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>rally around their own institution and to save the First Croatian Building and Loan Association for themselves and their compatriots. By chance the 25th anniversary occurs during these hard times. But the First Croatian Building and Loan Association has overcome all the difficulties.</p>
   <p>Conclusion</p>
   <p>It can be seen from our statements that the First Croatian Building and Loan Association did not limit its activity just to the city of Chicago, but extended its business beyond the city limits. Also, it did not just collect deposits but made loans, too, making it possible for many to become owners of their own homes.</p>
   <p>The junior section numbers now a few hundred members. By such a procedure the parents have taught their children to save instead of squandering the money.</p>
   <p>It is remarkable that of 12,600 building and loan associations in this country and 966 of them in the state of Illinois, not one went bankrupt or closed its doors. In this hard depression the business of such institutions is badly <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>obstructed. Claims are not paid in time, but everybody gets his money surely if slowly.</p>
   <p>Retarded payments are due to the fact that debtors are not able to meet their installments regularly because of unemployment. Retarded payments are not the fault of the management as many believe.</p>
   <p>The First Croatian Building and Loan Association operates according to the State laws. Each member of the board is bonded. This association is a member of the U. S. League, State of Illinois League, Cook County and Czecho-Slovak League, also of the Federal Home Loan Bank and as such it is under state supervision.</p>
