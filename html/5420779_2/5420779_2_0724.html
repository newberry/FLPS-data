   <p>An appeal is hereby made to our people in Chicago and vicinity to gather at a massmeeting to be held May 15, at 2 P. M., in National Sokol Hall, 1905 S. Racine Avenue. The speakers will be M. Krasic and M. Goreta, and the question for consideration will be the consequences of the flood and earthquake in Jugoslavia and our duty towards it.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav government does not intend to take the necessary steps to allay hunger and suffering, which predominates in the whole country, but resorts instead to the age old tactics of police and suppression, while the surplus which was gained by the sweat and suffering of the people is used to build more fortifications and army barracks, so they can continue to suppress the people's miseries and sufferings with those means.</p>
   <p>We are forced for these reasons to speak publicly, so that people may learn the true conditions prevailing in the kingdom of the Serb-Croats and Slovenes.</p>
