   <p>Sunday, July 2, in Chicago, the third Jugoslav Socialist Federation's congress convened. After a short formal conference on Saturday evening, regular work started Sunday morning.</p>
   <p>Circumstances did not allow this congress to assemble sooner. Now in serious times its assemblage is of more importance.</p>
   <p>Two important moments have to be marked at present: the World War and the American-Mexican rift. The whole world is dragged into the whirl of this question. Even the Socialist parties are unable to go over these happenings without pointing out that causes which create such crises in the world.</p>
   <p>The congress convened for four days. It was a complete success and finished its tasks in perfect harmony.</p>
   <p>Minutes of the successive meetings will be published later on. At present we bring a survey of the first day.</p>
