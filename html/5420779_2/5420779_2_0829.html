   <p>Not so long ago we printed a very interesting story about an unpleasant experience had by our friend Hrvat Tome Bedrana, who had been assaulted by the priest.</p>
   <p>This particular case is interesting for one reason: It proves the well known fact that there is no connection between church religion and the so called God's servants or priests.</p>
   <p>In our best opinion the clergy cannot be considered as anything better than a business profession, the same as doctors, engineers, etc.</p>
   <p>As we know, all professional people, in order to practice their profession and make a living, must have certain qualifications, and our opinion is that the same principles should be applied for clergy requirements.</p>
   <p>Representatives of other than clerical professions do not pretend to <span class="page-break">\2</span>seek more glory than to be useful to their community, which pays for their service. But it is entirely different with priests, ministers, etc., who not only claim their rights for being paid but more than that, they claim also to be of a higher class, and as such entitled to a higher standard of living or service remuneration.</p>
   <p>In their opinion, being God's representatives, they must enjoy better life and higher pay. Claiming their close relationship with God, they are trying hard to expand their influence upon the people's soul, mind, political, business and domestic life, and very soon we would not be able to find a single branch of the people's life that will not be affected by the clergy's powerful domination.</p>
   <p>In order to keep their dictatorship the clergy did not overlook the possibilities of an outbreak or insurrection, and for that reason they are using all kinds of stratagems.</p>
   <p>This is a type of punishment widely used by the clergy. In many places priests are organizing so called Sunday schools. Constant absence from such schools is considered as a great sin and will bring the name of <span class="page-break">\3</span>boy or girl into the Black Book, and will bring complete refusal by the priest to perform marriage ceremonies when time arrives for such occasion.</p>
   <p>So, as we can understand, it is not the mutual feeling of interested parties that counts in marriage, but the most important thing that will be considered is the complete obedience to rules and regulations set up by certain priests.</p>
   <p>So, as we can see clearly, the clergy in their desire for domination are using religion as a cover and in that respect they are going so far that there is no corner or place in the people's life where their influence cannot be found.</p>
   <p>The civil government may see it necessary to request confession in the crime already committed, but the priests insist on confession of something which people hold in their minds only.</p>
   <p>Trying hard to conquer their dominion, the clergy in many cases or on many occasions, are compelled to seek or use government power or <span class="page-break">\4</span>force. They feel justified to use such power or force in cases of insurrection or outbreak against their influence. Great numbers of our people paid already with heavy fines for their resistance to "holy" influence, or are being branded as "broadminded."</p>
   <p>In prison cells you may easily discover occupants victimized by such "holiness." Accusation by a priest of someone being an unruly sheep of his flock, is punished severely and such person might find himself behind the iron bars for the rest of his natural life.</p>
   <p>It is a well known fact that the clergy use to rule parishioners by "fear," and there seemed to be no limit of using this powerful means.</p>
   <p>The keynote of the clergy opinion about people is also known and can be easily described as follows: All people, except the clergy, of course, belong to the low class and their share is to have a great dose of punishment. They must be ruled with a strong arm in order to be kept as God fearing people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>And those priests claim that they are the best friends of the people.</p>
   <p>Our clergy here in America also is trying to transplant the same rules and regulations as they did it in the old country, but we are happy to notice that they are not lucky in their efforts to get the same fruit.</p>
   <p>People here are educated in liberty and are getting tired of the clergy's influence that rules with a strong arm, and the resistance of the people brought a lot of grief to the God's servants already.</p>
   <p>The real cause of the people's resistance is of financial nature; people grow tired of being supporters of the clergy, and as a result they do not care for church as they used to.</p>
   <p>People got practical. They simply refuse to pay for something they consider as worthless, as they consider the clergy service, and do not agree that such services are absolutely necessary for their welfare.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>We sincerely believe that times will arrive soon when priests will change their opinion of being superiors and will be forced to make themselves useful, or they will have to go away.</p>
   <p>People can see clearly that the clergy has been living their easy life too long and must do something that will entitle them to financial support from the people.</p>
   <p>Also the people of today are constantly losing their former admiration for God, on account of man's accomplishments, which brought him God's equality.</p>
   <p>These things must be sooner or later recognized by the stupid clergy if they want to live with people.</p>
