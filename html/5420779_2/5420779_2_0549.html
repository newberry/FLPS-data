   <p>Regardless in what part of the United States you live, now is your chance to learn the English language free of charge. The first thousand of our countrymen that ask for the course will receive 100 lessons which is a full course. The lessons will be corrected and they will receive the same attention and credit as one that pays for his course, which otherwise costs $10. We are doing this with the intention of awakening the ambition of our people to learn how to read, write and speak English.</p>
   <p>If you wish to accept this offer write to us at once, or you may be late.</p>
