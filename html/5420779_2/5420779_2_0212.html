   <p>Dr. Soskor, a Serbian student of dentistry had been a member of the Jugoslav Volunteer Legion during the World War. After the armistice he completed his studies and started to practice in Chicago in 1919. By 1922 he had a large practice at 31st Street and Wentworth Avenue. At about this time an ex-priest, Mr. B. Milosevic came from Europe with the hope of starting a movement for a national church. For this movement some sort of periodical was necessary and this publication called for financial backing, which Mr. Milosevic lacked. Young Dr. Soskor was easily persuaded to come to his assistance and a partnership was formed to publish a monthly magazine named Novirod. This magazine, ably edited, was so educational and high class that it did not find enough readers in the colony, as the majority of the Croatians were not used to reading about psychology and philosophy.</p>
   <p>Dr. Soskor, seeing that his venture was not going to be profitable, withdrew his support and terminated the partnership. Dr. Soskor's enthusiasm for fresh adventures carried him to Hollywood in 1928 where he wrote a play and wished to direct it himself, but after a year's time and effort he found the movies <span class="page-break">2</span>hard to crash and returned to Chicago. He can never forget his embarrassment when one producer, upon interviewing him, remarked, - "What does a dentist know about directing a play?"</p>
   <p>Dr. Soskor, politically a bold Jugoslav, is an admirer of President Roosevelt.</p>
