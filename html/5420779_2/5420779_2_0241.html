   <p>The Croatian singing society Hrvatska hereby announces a spring concert on Sunday, April 25, 1937, at the Bohemian-American Hall, 1440 W. 18th St., Chicago.</p>
   <p>Everyone is familiar with Hrvatska's past performances and we are quite sure they were never dull. As in the past our organization is working very hard to prepare selections to be rendered by the mixed ladies and men's chorus. Mr. Stjepan Pipic, our well known director, has chosen a group of new numbers for this concert, so we feel quite sure that you will enjoy every bit of it.</p>
   <p>The concert will start at 2 P. M. sharp. Dancing will start at 7:30 P. M., featuring the well-known orchestra Johnnie and his Merrymakers.</p>
   <p>New club members will be accepted after the concert. Rehearsals are held at Holy Trinity Church, 1850 S. Throop St., Chicago, between 8 and 10 P. M. every Friday.</p>
