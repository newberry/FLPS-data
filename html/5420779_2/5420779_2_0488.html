   <p>Hrvatska Zastava was selected as the official organ of the Greek-Catholic Church. This very progressive parish proved with this act that they are good patriots in heart as well as in mind.</p>
   <p>The progress that brothers of Greek-Catholic faith are making in any undertaking is a sure guarantee that they will do much in honor of the Catholic religion, and with understanding and cooperation with other brothers will see that the colony on the West Side of Chicago gets its church in the near future. In that we will support brothers of Greek-Catholic faith not only as their church organ but as a national herald of all Croats, regardless of their faith.</p>
