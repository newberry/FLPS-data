   <p>On July 3 at 8 A.M. the congress was called to order by authority of the interim committee for the convocation of the assembly. The delegates were greeted by Comrade Milar Glumac. The following were elected: Tomo Besenich, of Allegheny, Pennslyvania, president; Ivan Masten (Croatian) and Frank Petrich (Slovenian), secretaries. Twenty-eight delegates were present, of four different Jugoslav nationalities, Slovenian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and Croatian.</p>
   <p>Comrade D. Ekonomoff spoke on "The Immigration of Jugoslavs and Their Status in America". The cause of the large immigration of Jugoslavs in America is economic and political oppression in their native land. They emigrate to find their daily bread. But coming to America, these immigrants are abused; their position is worse than that of other immigrants of various nationalities. Therefore, the speaker stated, a Jugoslav socialist union is necessary in order that the Jugoslav proletarians of this country may be able to fight against American capitalism.</p>
