   <p>A few days ago in one of our hospitals died Proka Jovkic, a poet. Our public knows him from his patriotic poems of recent years which appeared in the paper Pijemont.</p>
   <p>But that is not all what Proka Jovkic gave to us, that is not the main thing.</p>
   <p>The most important, the most beautiful of his writings is a collection of poems published under the penname of Hector Zucni (Hector, the embittered).</p>
   <p>Those were the poems of a rebellious worker who felt upon his own shoulders the exploitation of rough modern capitalism in America. His poetry was not of a very refined kind, but there was in it temperament, poetical force, and revolutionary spirit.</p>
   <p>They were the first unskillful accords of a worker-poet who promised to develop into a Socialist bard. Later on life made him tame and less rebellious.</p>

   <p>According to a certain psychological law a man living away from his Fatherland, even if not influenced by tradition, has a strange yearning for his country. Conditions in the Fatherland of today appear more lovable if you stay far away than if you right there......</p>
   <p>When Proka Jovkic came to Belgrade, he fell for the Jugoslav ideology. He became her poet; sincere, not artful; out of exaltation and not for gain.</p>
   <p>And yet.....such as he was, he was, not able to give all that what was in him.</p>
   <p>Proka Jovkic -- the stock yard worker from the "jungle" so nicely portrayed by the great Socialist writer Upton Sinclair -- Proka Jovkic, as the stock yard worker...... stands high above Proka Jovkic, the Belgrade University student and patriotic poet of renown.</p>
   <p>In later years he himself recognized and felt that little by little he approached socialism. He was preparing to gather material and ideas for a <span class="page-break">\3</span>book about the life of immigrants in America.</p>
   <p>Before death came to him in his last agony when the vision about a person's life is most clear, he sent an orderly to our editor's office with the message that Hector Zucni - Hector the embittered - and not Proka Jovkic, is just drinking the last cupful of the gall of life.</p>
