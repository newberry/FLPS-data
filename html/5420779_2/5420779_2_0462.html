   <p>Comrades! On our regular meeting of the Central Committee of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation, hold November 8th, it was reported by the committee of the press that since recently very few subscriptions are coming in for the paper Narodni Glas (People's Voice). For that reason that paper is in debt.</p>
   <p>Comrades! The Narodni Glas is our Jugoslav Socialist newspaper like any other. With the progress of our movement among Serbian workers the general Socialist movement is helped. For that reason we have to agitate for all our papers.</p>
   <p>Where there are not enough Serbians the soliciting for Narodni Glas has to be done by Croatians and Slovenians. Serbian comrades must observe this principle toward our Croatian organ.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>It is necessary to help the Narodni Glas. Our whole federation is responsible for it, because the paper is a weapon for our movement.</p>
   <p>The main thing remains: to get subscribers!</p>
   <p>Comrades! You are requested to help the newspaper by subscriptions and additional help.</p>
   <p>For the Central Committee.</p>
   <p>Filip Godina, President.</p>
   <p>I. Susnar, Secretary.</p>
