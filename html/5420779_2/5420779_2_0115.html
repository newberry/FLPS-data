   <p>It is known to our readers that laws in America are made by Congress. They do not become valid before they are signed by the President. Even then they are not considered valid until the Supreme Court declares whether or not they are in accord with the Constitution of the United States. If the court declares the law to be against the Constitution, that law is without any value.</p>
   <p>Last year Congress passed a law about an eight-hour working day for railroad workers. Against that law were the railroad companies and other capitalists. Today that law is before the Supreme Court, and any day a decision is expected.</p>
   <p>Recently Senator Robert Owen, from Oklahoma, expressed himself saying: "It would be greatly inconsiderate to have the Supreme Court make a law void, which law was passed by Congress."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Mr. Owen said that before the League for National Popular Government. After him spoke Judge Wanamaker, who said: "On one side are 400,000 workers, on the other side, 15,000,000,000 dollars worth of capital. Congress passed the law, which is in danger now."</p>
   <p>He added that the "adoration of our Constitution must stop."</p>
   <p>Mr. Own accentuated the fact of how ridiculous and thoughtless it is that nine judges - sometimes only five (a majority) - control the work of 531 Congressional members, men elected by the people, who swore to work in accord with the Constitution. They must know better the constitutionality of the law passed than the nine judges.</p>
   <p>Very seldom has it been spoken against the Supreme Court's power in such an open manner. It was written against, but that was done by Socialists.</p>
   <p>Today we see opposition even in official circles. Here are legislators opposing the monarchical power of the Supreme Court.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>There is not one state in the world where the court has such power as in the United States of America.</p>
   <p>In all constitutional states the parliament is the highest legislative body, which decrees the actions of the state and regulates even the courts. In this country it is the countrary. Here a court of nine members is above parliament. For that reason in Socialist literature America is considered similar to a monarchic state. The difference is: in a monarchy one man governs, in America, nine.</p>
   <p>We are not happy about such a constitution, such laws, and such a republic which values old institutions more than the interests of human society.</p>
