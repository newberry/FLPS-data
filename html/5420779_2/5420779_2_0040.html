   <p>Twenty-two years are gone since the workers of this country first started to celebrate Labor Day. It was in 1885-86 when the movement started to introduce an eight-hour working day. In the beginning Labor Day was not celebrated as a legal holiday. The unionized workers simply decided for themselves that on the first Monday of September they will stop work, to show not only their will but also their power to do so, to enforce the eight-hour day.</p>
   <p>In the course of time many changes occurred. Labor Day is not what it was before. To appear friends of labor the capitalists made Labor Day a legal holiday and by that robbed the Day of his sharp demonstrations of parades. The befooled workers were led by the political capitalistic speculators and parties. The consequence of all this was that any workers' movement is persecuted, the courts and authorities suppress strikes and organizing of workers -- and call it a conspiracy because the political powers are misused.</p>
