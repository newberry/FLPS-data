   <p>Last Sunday was the first day that "Narodni Glas", the Serbian workers paper, came to life. After a few months of constant work among Serbians in Chicago, they succeeded in establishing another Jugoslav paper that will represent the ideal and the struggle of the working class.</p>
   <p>Narodni Glas is established by workers, edited by the workers and recommended to workers. Of the comrades surrounding Radnicka Straza we ask: Try with all your might and help the youngest pioneer in the Jugoslav Socialist Move, also help to spread it among the Serbian workers. Narodni Glas is issued every second Thursday (subscription $1.00 yearly). Address "Narodni Glas," 2350 Clyborne Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
