   <p>The paper Radnicka Straza is too small. We want more reading about Socialism; we need a stronger press; our fight needs sharper weapons.</p>
   <p>Such expressions reach us from all sides. That is a good and excellent sign.</p>
   <p>Last year there was talk about enlarging our newspaper Radnicka Straza and to that end a conference was called, but the delegates were not able to push a resolution. There were no funds and no persons to fill the tasks required by the paper, but the conference gave powers to the central committee to enlarge the paper within the shortest time possible.</p>
   <p>One year elapsed after the conference and nothing was done to make the paper bigger.</p>
   <p>The central committee considered the issue but did not decide on anything practical. The same evil that batters that workingmen's press all over battered us -- the evil of poverty. That evil will follow us as long as we will be poor and outlawed, as long as we do not reach our goal.</p>
   <p>The way to the goal is a constant struggle, full of thorns. The fight costs sacrifices and cares. Above all we need arms for our fight, arms which nobody will or is able to give us. We have to forge them ourselves. We do not need knives and revolvers, rifles and bayonets; our weapons are the workingmen's press and books. The question now is about the press, since without it this <span class="page-break">\2</span>movement of the workers would never have started. The workers would have remained in heavier chains; the voice of our protest would not have been heard.</p>
   <p>The press awakened a hundred thousand million of workers. The socialist press enlarged the idea of our fight by gathering the weak and oppressed and making them strong through being united in organizations.</p>
   <p>Today, when we no longer are weak and feeble, there is no stronger and greater movement than that of that of the workers.</p>
   <p>We arrived at many improvements all over the world and we recognize our value and our strength through the press.</p>
   <p>We know also that we are becoming stronger. The workers' cause progresses. In the end, we will win the complete victory of our liberation through the leadership of our press, which makes us fit for the struggle, which is our solace, lifts us up, enlightens us, animates us.</p>
   <p>All that is clear to us as well as to the comrades from other places who complain that Radnicka Straza is a paper too small for those who clamor "more reading matter, give our movement stronger arms."</p>
   <p>Three last meetings were held by the central committee to consider the enlargement of our press. The central committe resolved to print, starting with Christmas, a montyly magazine, Svijetlo (Light), which will appear on the first Monday of each month. The readers of Radnicka Straza will receive the magazine free. Long live our press. The "Light" will appear! Long live the revolutionary, the liberating socialism.</p>
