   <p>The Central Committee decided to call a sepcial meeting for Saturday, October 31st, to pass resolutions on two very important questions, namely:</p>
   <p>1. Must the Radnicka Straza (Working men's Guard) become a weekly?</p>
   <p>2. Is it necessary to have a printing shop of our own?</p>
   <p>At the meeting were assembled all comrades from Chicago, which shows that the importance of the questions is understood.</p>
   <p>Mr. Glumac-Jurisic gave a short report in the name of the Central Committee about the progress of our socialistic movement. An awakening goes through the country and the movement can not be stopped. We need a well edited newspaper. For that reason the Radnicka Straza must become a weekly paper. After the report followed a short discussion. The vote was unanimous to publish a weekly starting January first, as well as to own a print shop. The press is the wings of our labor movement and its mightest weapon. The more readers we have the more co-workers we have and the stronger is our fight.</p>
