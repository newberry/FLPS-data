   <p>The Croatian singing society "Gundulic" is giving a spring concert Sunday, April 24, in the Croatian Hall, 9618 Commercial Avenue.</p>
   <p>This concert will be one of the best ever given in our colony with a very select program. Other clubs will participate and also a few soloists.</p>
   <p>Those who attended our fall concert, will remember how successful it was and will surely come again this year. We are happy to state that we had a net profit of $850, and our February masquerade dance surpassed all expectations. Members are very grateful to the public that supported them in their activities, and are anticipating the same support in the future and in return will do all in their power to satisfy all with their program.</p>
