   <p>As always, the Croatian Singing Society "Zora" not only wants to satisfy the public it wants to surprise us. This time "Zora" will bring on the stage a mixed chorus. The male chorus as a special feature will sing the "Military Chorus" from Faust, in English. The other speciality on the program will be a duet sung by Mr. Chrzanowski and Miss Strmich taken from our national opera "Zrinjski." Mr. Chrzanowski is not only "Zora's" conductor but also an opera singer of note. It will be for the first time that our public is able to enjoy his good and cultured voice.</p>
   <p>Our young, attractive Miss Strmich is known to our public as a good singer. "Zora's" concert will be given Sunday, May 2nd, at Pilsen Sokol Hall. All lovers of song and music in Chicago are expected to attend.</p>
