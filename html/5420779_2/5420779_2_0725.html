   <p>The above is the name of a newly organized association for the defense and help of the victims of the white terror.</p>
   <p>Many times we called attention to the atrocities of the white terror in all lands, especially in Jugoslavia, because our people in America are concerned about it.</p>
   <p>We greet the new association with all our heart, in its aim to help the victims of the white terror.</p>
   <p>Here we bring the proclamation of the Jugoslav workers' defense. It reads: Bear brothers and sisters! The workers and poor farmers of the world are exposed to persecutions, maltreatments, even death, because they dare lift their voices for more liberty, more bread, more working hours and better conditions for living. Capitalist stupidity caused half a million workers and farmers to be jailed and held in prisons and dungeons. The number of persons beaten and killed amounts to one hundred thousand. Let us recall the <span class="page-break">2</span>thousands and thousands who have fallen victims in the space of a few years, to the monarchistic-white guards of the reigning class of Jugoslavia. All of them call for help and wring their gnarled hands toward us across the ocean. Can we refuse help? No, never. It is our duty to help our martyred brethren, nos with words only, but with deeds!</p>
   <p>For this reason, we organized the "Jugoslav Workers' Defense", the purpose of which is to help morally and materially all the victims of white terror in Jugoslavia and their families.</p>
   <p>The committee of the "Jugoslav Workers' Defense" announces that said organization is non-political. It is just a benevolent association of workers for workers, who suffer from persecutions of the capitalistic classes. It will help all the victims of the white terror regardless of their political affiliations.</p>
   <p>Temporary address: "Jugoslav Workers' Defense", 1806 Racine Avenue, Chicago, Ill. President: Magde Rajkovic; Treasurer: Mary Mrnjec; Organizer: Matt Goreta.</p>
