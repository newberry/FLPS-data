   <p>Because I abdicate as editor of the Radnicka Straza and leave that position entirely, I want to thank those comrades who supported me in my work.</p>
   <p>Going from Chicago, I wish to say good-bye to those whom I did not see. I wish great success in further Socialist work to all.</p>
   <p>Please do not send letters concerning the newspaper to my address.</p>
   <p>Vladimir Bornemissa.</p>
