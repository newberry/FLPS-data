   <p>The Croatian Sokol on the west side of Chicago is having its thirty-third annual display with elaborate and amusing programs in the Pilsen Sokol Hall, 1814 S. Ashland avenue, Sunday, May 27 at 3 P. M.</p>
   <p>Because this public performance serves as an example to our children for further sokol work, it is necessary for every one in our colony to be present at this performance.</p>
   <p>In that way the youth will get the recognition from its elders, and that is an important part of these displays, when both sexes of our youth perform in large groups, and so beautifully coordinate in executing difficult movements.</p>
