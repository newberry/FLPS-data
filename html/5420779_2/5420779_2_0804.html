   <p>Adopted at Convention of Jugoslav Educational Federation on 2nd and 3rd September - 1928 at Detroit, Michigan.</p>
   <p>Stand- of the Jugoslav Educational Federation in regard of the Croatian Fraternal Union and her Organ.</p>
   <p>The Convention is of the opinion that the Croatian Fraternal Union is in the first place a benevolent institution and then a centre of a cultural movement among Croatians.</p>
   <p>For that reason, there is no place in that union for political or partisan propaganda of which the main purpose is to help the members in case of sickness or accident.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The official organ of that Union has to keep within bounds described above and not to mix in politics or religion.</p>
   <p>Resolution of the Committee on the Press. After listening to suggestions made by the delegates of different organizations during the discussion over the Press the committee recommends the official organ;</p>
   <p>1). To devote as much space as possible to matters referring to the Croatian Fraternal Union,</p>
   <p>2). To keep up the level of scientific and educational articles as at present.</p>
   <p>3). To bring up in the light of criticism social errors and blunders from past and present.</p>
   <p>4). To defend class interests of hired labor, to help the class struggle through Unions, through strikes and other activities of the masses.</p>
   <p>5). To enlarge the official organ, if possible. Regarding the widening of cultural circles by the way of books and circulars the committee recommends the distribution of more books of recent publications and to start the printing of new books.</p>

   <p>The Jugoslav Educational Federation and other organizations.</p>
   <p>Taking into consideration invitations of the committee of the Proletarian Party, of the committee of the Jugoslav Socialist Union, of the Jugoslav Section of the Labor Party of America that our Jugoslav Educational Federation join those Organizations with the purpose of some cooperation - either permanent or temporary in special questions, as is the case with the Croatian Fraternal Union, our Federation after due consideration resolved at the Convention:</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav Educational Federation, as a non-political, cultural organization stands firmly by its program and resolution; to help by word and pen, materially and morally - whenever possible - all sincere attempts of all organized and un-organized workers to get better living conditions and also to repel the attacks of their adversaries on their organizations. But the Jugoslav Educational Federation has no intention of cooperating either formally or actually with anyone of the above-mentioned organizations.</p>

   <p>The Organ of the Jugoslav Educational-Organization.</p>
   <p>The Convention considers the press as the best medium to convey education to the working people.</p>
   <p>A good, informative, and scientific press opens to its readers new views, entices them to think deeply over different natural and social problems, economic questions, political and social life. The Jugoslav Educational Federation has for its chief aim the enlightenment of our people in this country and, always see to it that its official organ writes of said topics.</p>
   <p>The convention recognizes that the official organ followed its duties of enlightenment of the people and helped in great measure to disseminate modern thoughts and scientific principles regarding the better understanding of human life.</p>
   <p>The convention wants the Official Organ to continue in the same manner as before <span class="page-break">\5</span>The convention condemns the murder of Croatian Representatives in the Parliament at Belgrade, which murder must be considered as the result of the general rotteness of political life in Jugoslavija, and of the desire of the Serbian ruling classes to create a greater Serbia, instead of a Jugoslav Federation, with equal rights for all nationalities who compose the present day Jugoslavija.</p>
   <p>Because such crimes and tragedies must not be repeated the Jugoslav Educational Federation, though a non-political organization, approves of the deliberations and movement of peasants and workers in the Balkans who have been fighting for years for a complete freedom of each of the nationalities in the Balkans and their joining of a Union or Federation of those peoples. - -</p>
