   <p>A mass meeting was held here Saturday, January 16, in the large Croatian Workers' Hall. The mass meeting is significant and will be beneficial to us. There were a few speakers and all urged more education, better unions and a united struggle.</p>
   <p>With his plain, assuring and sincere speaking, special attention was commanded by Mr. I. Susnjar, organizer for the United Mine Workers, from Canada. He was on his way to the miners' convention in Indianapolis, Ind., and stopped in Chicago three days. He was acclaimed at the meeting.</p>
   <p>The report about working conditions in Canada was summed up as follows: The condition of the working people is the same all over: they are oppressed everywhere, their rights are taken away. Therefore, love among workers is international and their struggle is the same.</p>
   <p>This workingmen's meeting and council ended with the singing of the Workers' Toast, sung by the singing choir "Sloboda."</p>
