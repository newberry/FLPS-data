   <p>Municipal Judge Goodnow spoke at a meeting recently about the causes of the downfall of girls. Judge Goodnow expressed the belief that there are two things which cause the downfall of women: betrayal by men promising marriage and drunkenness.</p>
   <p>From two hundred cases which were examined it was established that 77 girls fell by betrayal by their lowers; of 20, the downfall was caused by their own drunkenness; 19, because they wanted nice clothes; 15, on account of lack of friendship and parental care. For one girl the cause remains unsolved. The majority of these lost women were American-born. The greater part of them left school before the age of 14. Only a few of them attended high school. Most of them were working girls at very low wages.</p>
   <p>All causes for which girls fall down may be construed into one general cause, which is: Want and misery.</p>
