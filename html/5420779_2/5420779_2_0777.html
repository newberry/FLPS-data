   <p>It seems that for all the wrongs which torture the world in its social unrest foreigners are to blame in this country.</p>
   <p>If there is a strike, it is the work of foreigners or of foreign agitators. If there is an explosion somewhere, of which the origin cannot be explained, this occurrence is blamed on foreigners. It looks as if the foreigners in America were not here for any purpose but to create chaos and disturbance.</p>
   <p>This situation is becoming unbearable for foreign workers, and they are eager to leave this country.</p>
   <p>On the other hand the foreigners are apparently treated well....to be better exploited.</p>
   <p>This has happened to most foreigners in America. Most of them came from countries, where they were treated brutally by the officials of bureaucratic <span class="page-break">\2</span>governments. They had to take their hats off and bend their backs before any one who had the humblest official position.</p>
   <p>This humiliation was a crying shame, not only for the people but also for the whole country from which they came--the more so because they were pictured as heroes in their national poetry and as saviors of culture. It is easy to believe that our workers were agreeably touched by the fact that they will not be humiliated in America by having to be servile to officials. If they were hard driven at work--they attributed that to the necessities of American life, or to their ignorance of the language. However, they agreed they were treated better here than in their own country.</p>
   <p>This was the principal reason why our workers kept away from any movement to better their condition. They were astonished to find workers in America who wanted a change for the better. Such fighting workers were called malcontents, unruly persons, socialists, and the like. As long as they could call the foreman by his first name, they thought that everything was all right; whatever the foreman said must go.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But conditions changed. In the foreigner one saw an enemy because America was at war with his country. America wanted to make patriots out of foreign workers overnight. But patriotism may be roused [only] in a man, who has something to be proud of, some property. The hired worker does not possess anything; he cannot feel like a property-owner who lives well. Overnight they wanted to make rich and poor alike in thought, word, and deed. They failed.</p>
   <p>As was to be expected the foreign workers remained cool toward this patriotic propaganda, though many workers, out of fear, declared themselves first-class patriots. As soon as one part of the foreign workers was considered patriotic, wrath was roused against those who remained calm and were not swayed by artificial sentiment.</p>
   <p>The propaganda against foreign workers is in full swing today. In the lead for it is the American Legion. The legionnaires are armed. They usurp the right to arrest people, to disband meetings of foreign workers, to demolish business places, to destroy libraries, and to commit other acts of violence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The effect of all this is contrary to what America wants to do for the foreigners by preparing schools to teach them Americanization and the meaning of the American constitution.</p>
   <p>On the one side they try to make citizens of the foreigners through education, and on the other side the Legion tries it by violence. The result will be that foreigners will hasten to leave America.</p>
   <p>The authorities are against all foreigners who disapprove of conditions in America. If the workers are dissatisfied, we must look for the cause of that dissatisfaction, but not brand them "foreigners" and seek to jail, lynch, or deport them.</p>
   <p>It is well known that in all heavy industries foreigners are employed. From Gary some eight thousand Jugoslav workers have left for home on account of the steel strike and the bad treatment received from employers. All over the world it will be said that foreigners are fleeing America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>That is not the way to treat foreign workers--assault them, jail them, beat them up, break up their organizations--that does not lead to anything. That is not the way to make good Americans. On the contrary, that will give a bad reputation to America.</p>
   <p>America must devote more time to social questions to maintain better order; it should not turn over the fate of the country to a chauvinistic Legion.</p>
