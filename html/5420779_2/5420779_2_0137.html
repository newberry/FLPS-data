   <p>To prevent the United States from falling into the same catastrophe as did the whole of Europe today, the American people must work to clip the wings of militarism in the army and the navy and to end the secret machinations of diplomats.</p>
   <p>Each election has to be a forceful protest against war, against war armaments and international dollar diplomacy. Not one voter should vote for a man, who will not promise to work against militarism and capitalistic imperialism.</p>
   <p>No paper must be aided or read, which glorifies war crimes as "honor and glory" and supports such crimes by inflaming hatred among nations.</p>
   <p>The present situation in Europe is a good school for everybody. All what happens there is the work of capitalism and militarism.</p>
   <p>If the military power in Europe were not organized on such a scale, could such a slaughter be perpetrated there, creating unemployment, misery hunger and sorrow?</p>
   
   <p>Workers, if you do not want to go through sufferings, which your brethren live through in Europe do not allow America to become a military land, put at the head of the countrymen who will put down any attempt, to make militarism the law and deciding factor of this land. -</p>
