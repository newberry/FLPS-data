   <p>The well-known daughter of our Croatian colony, Miss Gloria Strmic, will again visit Debroit, Michigan.</p>
   <p>Miss Strmic intends after a few months of preparation to leave her home for Italy to study. Before leaving she will give several concerts, the first to be in Detroit. The concert will be held Sunday November 11 in Workers Auditorium, 1343 E. Ferry St. Miss Strmic is attending the Chicago Conservatory of Music where she attained considerable success. Her voice is a lyric soprano. When she sang for the first time, in Detroit, last year, she was enthusiastically acclaimed. We are expecting satisfactory attendance, but it is desirable that the cultural artistic, and political clubs extend their support and cooperation to assure her greatest success.</p>
   <p>We are thanking all in advance and await their hearty support.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
