   <p>Officially it became known that the authorities have given permission for the consolidation of the Croatian unions; the National Croatian Union and Croatian Union of Illinois, and the Benevolent Society of St. Joseph.</p>
   <p>The consolidation was announced by the following communication:</p>
   <p>State of Illinois</p>
   <p>Department of Trade and Commerce</p>
   <p>Springfield, Ill., Nov. 6, 1925.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vinko Solich, Secretary of the Croatian Union of the United States 1012 Peralta St., N. S. Pittsburg, Pa.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: For reasons expressed in the opinion of your chief counsel and upon the decision of the director of this department, the consolidation of the Croatian unions was granted. These are: Croatian Union of Illinois, National Croatian Union, Pittsburg, Pa.; and St. Joseph National Croatian Benevolent Association, Kansas City, Kansas. The certificate of approval was sent to your respective departments.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>Alex J. Johnson</p>

   <p>When this announcement was officially confirmed, a busy time began in the offices of this organization. In a short time, a new supreme board must take over the new consolidated Croatian fraternal union.</p>
   <p>The members awaited the consolidation anxiously. The law obstacles were removed at last. Heartily we greet the consolidation. That is the first step in the progressing unification of our people.</p>
