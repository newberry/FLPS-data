   <p>In the Chicago suburb, North Riverside, Illinois, lives Mr. Samuel S. Hascek, who was recently elected mayor by a big majority.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hascek was elected twice before to that office, but only for short periods, while this time he will occupy that chair from 2 to 4 years.</p>
   <p>There are only three Croatian families in North Riverside, but he gained the sympathy of the Czechs and other nationalities for his good qualities.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hascek was born in Aljnus, Croatia, and came to America before the war. He was a member of the Socialist Party for a long time and also member of I.W.W. He was elected mayor on a non-partisan ballot which he organized with a few of his friends. Hascek is a good friend of labor because he is a worker himself.</p>
   <p>We are happy to announce that Mr. Hascek is our friend and a subscriber to Znanje.</p>
