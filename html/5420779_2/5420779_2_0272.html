   <p>We hereby announce that we have organized a new singing club named Hrvatska (Croatia).</p>
   <p>The club's activity will be only cultural. It will not mix in politics. Hrvatska holds rehearsals every last Friday of the month in the Howell Neighborhood House, 1831 S. Racine avenue, at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>A very good executive board has been installed and is acting in that capacity.</p>
   <p>The teacher if Prof. Ivan Horvat.</p>
   <p>All sympathizers willing to join us can report to the secretary, Adam Andres, 1123 W. 19th street, Chicago.</p>
