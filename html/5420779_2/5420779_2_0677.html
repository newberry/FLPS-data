   <p>The Association for Aid to the Croatian Orphanage is arranging a concert, February 20, 1927, in the New American Hall, 1436-40 W. 18th Street.</p>
   <p>The program starts at 2 P. M.</p>
   <p>Invited are all Croatian and Jugoslav organizations and the public in general to attend this entertainment as much as possible. The program will be rich and very choice.</p>
   <p>With this we ask all other organizations not to prepare their own entertainments on that date, as we want all to help us, since the proceeds of the concert are for a much needed fund in the new Children's Home.</p>
