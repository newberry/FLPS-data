   <p>The United States Postal authorities started to stop practically the entire edition from being mailed, so the subscribers could not receive their papers. There were complaints from all sides. We were accused of deliberate neglect in mailing. Of course, this was done by our antagonists, but the Press Committee concluded that it is useless to publish a paper which is kept at the post office and does not reach the readers. That led to the decision to stop publication with the edition of Radnicka Straza (Workingmen's Guard) and start to publish Znanje (Knowledge).</p>
   <p>In this same way many newspapers were suppressed among them the well known International Socialist Review published in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Socialist Party worked directly and indirectly to have working men united along economical lines. Today the necessity has arisen to do more for the economical progress of workers. The party will do much for said purpose after this situation is corrected, being much disturbed by the events and persecutions lately.</p>
   
   <p>Today our party has thousands of members and sympathizers who will be a nucleus around which a great economic movement will be formed.</p>
   <p>For this purpose our party has no recipes or medicines, but there is a weapon which is education.</p>
   <p>Great social movements are not accomplished overnight by phrases but by long educational work, solidarity of interested social groups, persistence and self-sacrifice</p>
   <p>We must not care in what light we are presented by our antagonists who, by calumnies and false concern about our party, try to bring discord, disagreement and confusion among us. By that they expect to gain benefits for themselves.</p>
