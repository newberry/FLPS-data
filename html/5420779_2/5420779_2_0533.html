   <p>Last Sunday was the first time that Jugoslavs took an active part on the air, over station WGES in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The young and energetic member of our colony, George Marchan, succeeded in getting a convenient time on that station.</p>
   <p>Who will give his efforts so that the program "Jugoslav Hour" continues as a permanent program on station WGES? According to Mr. Marchan's statement the "Jugoslav Hour" will be held every Sunday, from 9 to 9:30 A. M. Our best representatives will be presented on the program - such as singers and other musical artists.</p>
   <p>He appeals to our people who own radios to tune in WGES every Sunday morning, between 9 and 9:30.</p>
   <p>Listeners wishing to have certain songs or compositions played for them, may call by telephone or write to station WGES, stating their request. Also those that like our program will please write to the station or to Mr. Marchan.</p>
