   <p>It was reported to the central committee of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation that comrade Milan Glumac (former editor of Radnicka Straza, who on account of bad health is living in California) is also in great financial need.</p>
   <p>About the work in behalf of our federation done by Mr. Glumac, we hardly have to write, that is well known to all comrades.</p>
   <p>The central committee appeals to comrades to make contributions to help comrade Glumac. All money has to be sent to the Federation's secretary, 111 North Market street.</p>
