   <p>Thousands of Croatians of the greater Calumet District, many of them in native costume, are expected to participate in a Croatian Day program in the East Side Forest Preserve, 114th and Avenue D, Sunday, August 24th, 1934.</p>
   <p>The affair, one of many being held by Croatian groups in many sections of the country, is under the sponsorship of the Sacred Heart Croatian Catholic church, 96th street and Escanaba avenue.</p>
   <p>A parade through the south side streets will open the program early Sunday morning. Men, women and children in native costumes will march to the forest preserves site for an open-air mass at 11 o'clock.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Spiro Andrijanich, pastor of the Sacred Heart church, assisted by the clergy of other Chicago Croatian churches, will officiate, while sacred music will be furnished by the "Velebit" Singing Society under the direction of John Horvat.</p>
   <p>Preparations have been made to entertain the largest Croatian gathering since the dedication of the Sacred Heart church, twenty-one years ago.</p>
   <p>One ton of barbecued lamb, besides other typical native dishes, will be on the menu.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers scheduled are Mayor Kelly, Congressman P. H. Moynihan, Alderman Wm. A. Rowan, and Croatian leaders. Many singing societies, among them the Stephen Radic choir of Indiana Habor, the Croatian Singing Society and the Dalmatian Singers Union of Pittsburg, will take part in the program.</p>
   <p>Following this program, which will be augmented with games, contests, wrestling and boxing bouts and community singing, the picnickers at the end of the day will transfer their activities to the Croatian auditorium, 96th Street and Commercial Avenue, for the remainder of the night.</p>
   <p>Peter Rupcich assisted by a large committee of prominent Croatians, is general chairman of the affair.</p>
