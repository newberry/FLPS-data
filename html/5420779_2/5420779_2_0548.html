   <p>As in past years, the Jugoslav Socialist Educational and Political Federation will arrange a three-months course in the elements of reading and writing. Bearing the caption "The Open-Eyed Are Blind When They Cannot Read And Write," pamphlets are being distributed which point out that: "Illiterates can easily be cheated by anybody"; "Illiterates find it more difficult to learn English"; "Illiterates cannot get good jobs".</p>
   <p>Tell those of your friends who are illiterate that the School for Illiterates will open Saturday, November 19. You may learn to read and write Croatian in Room 3 of the [Dvorak] park clubhouse, 20th Street between May and Fisk Streets, each Monday and Saturday from 8 to 10 P.M. Enroll at the Workers Reading Room, 1830 South Centre Avenue.</p>
