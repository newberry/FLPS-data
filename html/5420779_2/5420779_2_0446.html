   <p>In another column we are announcing that a new law was passed and signed by the President, a new law directed against all newspapers which write against war or the government policies.</p>
   <p>Any newspaper which transgresses the law will be suppressed instantly. There are no hopes that anything can be done regarding this matter. The law was passed and must be obeyed; the authorities will not tolerate any spite work.</p>
   <p>According to that law our paper, too, will be compelled to translate all articles which are against war and the activities of the government. Even if we translate such articles we cannot escape the censor. Our articles would be condemned and the paper suppressed.</p>
   <p>At a meeting on October 8 the Press Committee resolved that our paper must cease writing against war as long as this law is in force. Instead <span class="page-break">\2</span>our editors will bring scientific articles, stories, articles on economy, sociology, geography, philosophy, etc. They will do their best to give the readers wholesome socialistic and educational reading.</p>
   <p>Because our Press Committee resolved that our readers must not think that we are for war or that we compromised with the government. No! But because the law forbids writing against war, we will not do it; however, we will not write in favor of war or war policies, not even under the highest pressure. We will bring war news and write about the activities of the government, but we will leave our readers to comment on them.</p>
   <p>We will not write against war, but our readers, comrades and sympathizers must know that our silence is from force. That silence is a protest against what is happening to the working class of the world.</p>
   <p>Comrades, readers, workers! Help us from now on as you did before to lead this hard struggle, that even under this severe censorship we may <span class="page-break">\3</span>cultivate truth and international socialism to subdue ignorance and to preach liberal ideas about the workers' movement.</p>
   <p>Work for Radnicka Straza. Work for Socialism, for a better system of society!</p>
