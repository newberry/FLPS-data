   <p>The singing chorus of the workers' dramatic society Sloboda announces its first concert to be given on September 12, at the Croatian Hall, South Chicago, Ill. The workers' dramatic society has entertained on previous occasions. The members have now decided to gladden your hearts with songs of liberty, which will waken you from deep slumber, refresh your hearts with song, and arouse in you that fighting spirit which will lead to the liberation of oppressed humanity. The new singing chorus was created for the purpose of inspiring men and women.</p>
