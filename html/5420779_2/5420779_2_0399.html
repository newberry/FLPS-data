   <p>The material sent in by workers correspondents can be divided into three distinct categories:</p>
   <p>1. News; 2. Special articles about happenings in labor and revolutionary movements; 3. Articles which explain the nature and progress of workers struggles.</p>
   <p>News: (1) Conditions for employment.</p>
   <p>a. Factory news; introduction and effects of speed-up systems.</p>
   <p>b. Tyranny of factory overseers.</p>
   <p>c. Wages, working hours, opportunity for employment. (The utmost accuracy is necessary in these matters.)</p>
   <p>(2) News from class struggles</p>
   <p>a. Strikes, closing of factories, election campaigns.</p>
   <p>b. Actions of city, county, state, and federal authorities. Court actions, injunctions, laws against workers, use of police, army, and special means of oppression.</p>

   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>(7) Party's activities</p>
   <p>a. Work of Communist cells in industrial establishments, factions in unions, cooperatives, among farmers, etc.</p>
   <p>Writing of news.</p>
   <p>Put the most important things in the first paragraph. In the first paragraph the questions must be answered: What, where, when, and why? Speaking of news, this rule must not be broken.</p>
   <p>2. Always use short sentences. This method gives an article force, it is read more easily.</p>
   <p>a. Be accurate. Learn to find out what is important and accentuate that part of the news.</p>
   <p>3. Do not make long explanations.</p>
   <p>4. Five hundred words or less for a common news item is sufficient. The <span class="page-break">\4</span>best news writers bring short news.</p>
   <p>5. Technical items:</p>
   <p>a. Write on one side of the paper</p>
   <p>b. If possible use typewriter (double space).</p>
   <p>c. If longhand is used, leave an inch margin.</p>
   <p>d. Number sheets. On the first page write title of article.</p>
   <p>e. Write "news" on left, lower corner.</p>
   <p>f. Write subtitles, if article is over 200 words.</p>
   <p>g. Paragraphs are indicated by a capital L.</p>
   <p>Articles, explanations analysis.</p>
   <p>These articles must be a connection between news and explanation. Try to begin with a sentence which will attract the attention of the reader. Write as you would talk to one or two workers, to whom you want to tell facts. The structure of this type of article must be:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>1. Premise</p>
   <p>An accurate description of general situation and what you want to say</p>
   <p>2. Expose facts and their explanation.</p>
   <p>3. Then bring forth your conclusion.</p>
   <p>General Articles about the Struggle and Its Progress.</p>
   <p>This kind of article must rest on several news items. The purpose of such articles is to connect different struggles with the general class struggle and Communist program.</p>
   <p>The facts must be clear and there must be a sufficient number of them to preclude the accusation that conclusions were drawn from a few facts only.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Such articles must show a full knowledge of conditions under which workers strive.</p>
   <p>The difference between the reactionary, reformistic, and communistic tactics must be clear.</p>
   <p>News from Working Places and Factories.</p>
   <p>The main news for the communist press is news about workers' conditions in industries.</p>
   <p>The modern industry created of work a deadly penalty for the workers, which penalty the working class has to pay for the right to live. Under the existing conditions, workers in industries sweat and suffer.</p>
   <p>News in the communist press must reveal what the workers think about the gigantic corporations, who direct their lives; about the brutal system which is crushing them more pitilessly than expensive machinery. What do <span class="page-break">\7</span>workers think about the company's welfare systems, hospitals and speedy settlement of injuries? What do they think about police, spies, courts, strike breakers, detectives, and the whole machinery of oppression organized and owned by capitalists?</p>
   <p>To get such information you must be a working man. When you write you become a workers' correspondent.</p>
   <p>The main thing is to have something to say. Say that, and then stop.</p>
   <p>Do not repeat revolutionary phrases. Because it may happen that when you really need them you have exhausted them.</p>
   <p>The exposure of real facts brings better results than repeating slogans.</p>
   <p>A final statement: the duties of a workers' correspondent are very important and of great responsibility.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Workers who read these articles will judge the press and party by them.</p>
   <p>Our press must be accurate, for that reason just as our program is. In the full knowledge of their responsibility, the workers' correspondents must do their best to make the party organ popular and by that means build a communist press for the masses.</p>
