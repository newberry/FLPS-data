   <p>We reported already how the Legislators in Washington are preparing again a law, to make immigration harder. President Wilson not only does not object to that, but is in favor of it. In the last election campaign it was announced, how Wilson in one of his historical writings expressed himself very contemptuously about the immigrants in general and especially about Slavs, Italians and Greeks, to all of whom he preferred even Chinese. Before the election he tried to smooth these statements, but he is more open now when elections are far away. His hatred toward the poor immigrants the "patriotic" Wilson showed also by addressing to the Commissioner of immigration Williams, a very flattering letter on account of his proper handling of immigrants, while it is known - that Williams treatment of immigrants was to say mildly shameful. Williams deported many without any reason, while others he held at Ellis Island pending a long drawn investigation. Ellis Island received the nickname of "the devil's island". All this was done to frighten Europe's poor to immigrate. Such a man is lauded by President Wilson!</p>
