   <p>Attention, comrades in Chicago! Because of being overburdened with agitation and organization work in Chicago, little time was left for a neglected but very useful field which, if cultivated properly, yields good fruit. That is, we have a few educational lectures to which we will devote more attention in the future.</p>
   <p>In connection with the lectures, it will be wise to have a question period so that those who do not benefit fully can ask questions and thereby develop a discussion beneficial to all.</p>
   <p>A lecture, "Workers' Education," which was announced before, was postponed because of the lecturer's illness and will be given Sunday, March 21, at 9 P. M.</p>
   <p>The public is invited and all are welcome.</p>
