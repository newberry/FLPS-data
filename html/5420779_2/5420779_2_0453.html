   <p>The Jugoslav Socialist Branch No. 6 at Chicago adopted at its monthly meeting, April 21, a resolution in which to express dissatisfaction for the writings of Proletarec, the Slovenian organ of the Socialist Federation.</p>
   <p>This branch condemns the writings of that paper in support of the Allies and the war, which stands in opposition to the principles of international Socialism and with all resolutions made at different international Socialist congresses and the convention of the Socialist Party of America.</p>
   <p>The Branch considers that it is impossible to remain in contact with the editors of said newspaper, and with all those who are of the same opinion with them, because everyone of them changes the idea of Socialism into a means of international slaughter. The Branch calls upon all Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian Socialist branches to explain their views concerning this matter and to take appropriate steps, to make impossible this warlike current in our ranks. We must act against the guilty ones according to the principles of the party and Socialist discipline.</p>
