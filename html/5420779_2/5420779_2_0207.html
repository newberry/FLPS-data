   <p>The Chicago Branch (No.1) of "Croatian Unity" has arranged three lectures at Chicago so far. The last one on Sunday June 1st. The attendance of that lecture was miserable, according to the statement of the president of this "Branch". The scant attendance may be attributed to whatever reason one cares to, I will not try to explore that. The lectures was Dr.Biankini. The theme of the lecture: The Rebirth and Ideals of a Nation. Whoever tried to guess the nature of the lecture from the announced title must have been mistaken. Under "rebirth" Dr. Biankini understands progressive ideas of the modern social life; legislation, hygiene etc. The "Ideals of a Nation" are to him the same, that school "philosophers" taught for centuries and centuries. It was to be expected that the honorable Doctor was going to speak about new Ideals, which are moving the world. But we must not forget that the lecture was held by the "branch" of the "Croatian Unity" which is noted for its backwardness.</p>
   <p>Let us hear more details:Dr.Biankini proved with statistics that there are more of our people from Croatia, Dalmatia, Istria, Bosnia and Hercegovina in America than it is believed. On may count in the United States over one million people of our blood?</p>

   <p>We are not so few, but we are without influence, because we're not organized. Besides, our people are one of the most neglectful ones. One of its first shortcomings is the habit of settling in dirty sections around factories where there is no sun, air, nor light. The wives of our workmen take 10 to 15 men as "boarders" work for them from dawn to sunset. Overburdened with work, they are not able to devote much time to cleanliness. These conditions are the reason for such maladies as diphteria, tuberculosis, and trachoma, which prevail among our people here. Because their mothers have to work so hard the children cannot develop as they should from the start in their mother's womb. When they are born they do not have the necessary care, so it is not surprising that the mortality of children in our communities is terribly high. A nation, which wants to continue as a nation and to progress as such, must be healthy. Now the lecturer mentioned of modern legislations in some states, where there are strict health rules, maternity aid, etc.</p>
   <p>Never did I expect, the honorable doctor to mention those causes,, why our people live in such bad conditions, exactly as we socialists know them to be. Neither did I expect, that he was going to propose the same remedies as we Socialists do.</p>
   <p>But at the same time I never expected the honorable Doctor to say what he really said: A shortcoming of our people to settle in unclean streets around the factories, that spouses of workers keep a great number of boarders and are overburdened with work.</p>

   <p>That is what Dr.Biankini says. But the question is, are these shortcomings the fault of our people or is that not hard, unavoidable necessity, because otherwise the worker could not live whether in time of unemployment or during the preparation for "rainy" days. Dr.Biankini mentioned frequently the social question, the social relations. But we can not be satisfied with such superficial explanations of the most tragic social consequences.</p>
   <p>If Dr.Biankini had conceded, that the people are not to blame, for the miserable living conditions of our people in America, but the economic conditions which are characteristic and are the sequence of our social structure of today, he would have been forced also to do something against all that; he should have said the condition must be altered or changed from the ground up - completely as we Socialists do demand it. To do so he should be a Socialist. But he is not a socialist - he is a bourgeois and a member of "the Croatian Unity". For that reason he is satisfied to propose, as a remedy against evils from which our people suffer; the progressive legislation as in foreign lands, and to recommend hygienic rules and fewer but healthier children. But to call for a fight against the cause of all social evils, against the capitalistic system - he is far, far away from that. Alas! The purpose of "The Croatian Unity" is not to teach to fight but to stullify the brains, to make them stupid and through verbal confusion to make them incapable for thoughts and life.....</p>
   <p>It is not enough - continued Dr.Biankini that the people are physically well <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and materially strong, but they should be strong of soul and mind. They must have ideals, they must cultivate certain virtues. He counted seven of them: character, audacity, justice and so forth, in the end; religion. Without religion a nation can not exist and then added in conclusion; a man without faith in God is a beast.</p>
   <p>"They say - the doctor continued - that science progressed so far, that it is not necessary to dispute about God anymore. But I, as a man of science, was confirmed by science in my belief in God".</p>
   <p>I was astounded when Dr. Biankini said, that a man without religion was a beast. Then all the philosophers, starting with Democritas, throughout the centuries up to the present time must have been beasts. Were savants, like Renan, Strauss, Feuerbach beasts they who studied religion more than anyone else? No they were not, the same as people who have religion are not beasts. Doctor! I think you did not know what you are talking about: God forgive you!</p>
   <p>About Rev. Relich, who as the president of the "branch" closed the lecture. I do not want to say much. I want only to mention that he repeated the lecturer's assertions about religion, man and beast, adding that all those are "felons, robbers and miscreants" who divert people from religion and their priests".</p>
   <p>Now, I wish somebody would prove that "The Croatian Unity" is not in the service of black reaction, as it was pointed out by Radnicka Straza last year.</p>
