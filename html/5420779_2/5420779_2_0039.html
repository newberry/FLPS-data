   <p>How many socialist votes will there be in 1908? Will there be ONE MILLION? It should be one million of votes. That would raise an alarm thru the world. One million votes of socialists would cause fear in the hearts of our oppressors in America. One million of workers' votes would force Congress and those in power to hasten the "unsolved workers' question," to bring and enact laws from which the people will benefit. One million votes will force the capitalists to be more human with their workers, because they will fear that after the first million will other millions follow at the next election.</p>
   <p>A million of socialist votes will prohibit obstructing of strikes with army and terror. A million of votes will awaken the other workers. Workers, be prepared. Propagate! Gather new comrades at the coming elections, give your vote to workers, to Candidates of the Socialist Party Debs and Hanford.</p>
