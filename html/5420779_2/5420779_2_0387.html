   <p>In Radnik (Worker) there appeared in the issue of January 21, 1930 an article with the above-mentioned title full of empty phrases and bitterness, but without any tangible proof except pointing the finger at the Communist party as the world savior.</p>
   <p>Yes, if such educators, as are found around Radnik, were in charge of all education, then knowledge will not end war but extend it into eternity.</p>
   <p>We always contended and affirm today that the mind with the help of education, will predominate above passion and stupidity, and with that make mankind worthy of itself, not an idiot exploited by those connected with Radnik.</p>
   <p>Education is the power which gives a tool to the slaves of the world to throw off their backs the pack of exploitation. All those that ever had a taste of education believe in it and trust it. And one that learned his ABC only yesterday doesn't realize the value of it, nor can he profit by it and least of all feed it to others.</p>
   <p>To sit in the office and chew the same thing over from day to day, curse and slander your opposition, or make terrifying statements is not enough, because <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the editor's office is required to produce sensible articles. The only exception is the Radnik, where there is neither brains nor sense. What does one need education for, then?. It is enough to know some things from science known as phraseology and dirtology(mud slinging). Otherwise the head may be full of straw.</p>
   <p>These spiritual paupers learned,like most fanatical believers have, the law by the name Marx - not his teaching or theories, as they don't understand them - to sanctify Lenin's name, yell unceasingly about Semitism and the Communist party for it is the only party,they say, that will "save humanity." That is all they know.</p>
   <p>The word "party" alone - as they practice and understand it - is a symbol of unsolidarity and discord in labor forces. It will remain as such so long as the individual groups of intellectual weaklings - under the disguise of products of great minds - will earn their bread by fooling the masses.</p>
   <p>To judge the Radnik by its writing one would believe them that Radnik is actually guided by a group of earnest fighters and able men. Although those <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>that know their emptiness know very well that they are uncouth, rude people, plain bread-fighters, who offer the whole word to their sympathizers and the products of their mind is so small that they haven't even a pair of pants of their own which is little wonder as the gods of their party either are not able or don't want to pay them more.</p>
   <p>If the Communist party is the world savior why don't it first save the Radnik's editing staff of foolishness? Or is it enough that it saved them from the factory and the shovel?</p>
   <p>Working people! Do enrich yourselves with knowledge and clear your mind with education! Don't believe false prophets who eat their bread at your expense and offer you, as a prize, the dark stupidity and religious heaven of scorn, rudeness, and unnecessary bloodshed.</p>
