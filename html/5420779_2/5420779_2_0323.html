   <p>The Croatian singing clubs "Preradovic," from Gary, Ind.; "Jadran," of Chicago, and "Velebit," from South Chicago decided to combine to present the classic play "Hrvatska Trilogija." The undertaking is quite heavy, but the cooperative work and enthusiasm of the members promise that the work begun will be successfully finished.</p>
   <p>The first meeting of delegates of the respective clubs was held in the National Hall, Gary, Ind. A central committee was elected, the duty of which is to arrange the whole technical end of this event. Professor Ivan Horvat will lead the musical part of it.</p>
   <p>The details will be announced from time to time. In today's meeting plans were made to have "Hrvatska Trilogija" played three times, that is, once in each club's home town. The first time, September 4, 1927, in the Chicago Sokol Hall, 2341 S. Kedzie Ave.; the second, September 18, 1927, in the Croatian Hall, Gary, Ind.; and the third in the Croatian Hall, South Chicago.</p>
