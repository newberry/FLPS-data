   <p>Many years ago a few of us in Chicago conceived the idea of establishing an institution where our orphaned children might be sheltered and cared for.</p>
   <p>On this basis the association for the support of Croatian destitute children in America was founded. The intention of this association was to support these children by means of various contributions. But after several years our biggest benevolent organization, the Croatian Fraternal Union, extended its support to the association so that the desired goal could be reached sooner.</p>
   <p>We worked industriously on all sides, contented that our dreams were materializing, not suspecting disruption. When the C. F. U. took everything in its own hands we thought that, if ever, now it must go ahead smoothly. The association was eliminated and the C. F. U. with its president, the famous Chicago "master," Mr. Cazolic, had a free hand.</p>

   <p>After reading recent correspondence from various sources and persons the heart breaks to hear and see that some children, after being subjected to maltreatment, were told they must also pay if they wish to remain in the orphanage. Why is this done and what is the meaning, why do the members pay their monthly assessment when unfortunate widows must pay only to be abused and humiliated?</p>
   <p>We have thousands of children in America who should be taken care of, they should be considered first. Why take those unable to pay and why assess those unable and poor. Every child in Desplaines knows there is something wrong somewhere. We have six buildings and a school, and in Villa Detroit (name of one building), one Swedish lady reigns alone. Four of the buildings are empty and have had not fire in them all winter, walls are cracked and crumbling, while thousands of our children throughout America are hungry and freezing. What do they intend to do with these buildings? Do they want the elements to destroy them unused?</p>
   <p>The president and officials seem disinterested. The C. F. U. convention <span class="page-break">\3</span>is approaching and we will discuss this question. The building must be filled with the children and if there are not enough children, we have old folks, old members, that have been ruined under this system and must sell pencils on the streets for a living.</p>
