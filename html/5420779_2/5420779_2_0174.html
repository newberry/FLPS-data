   <p>In 1586 Raleigh founded a colony on Roanoke Island, whose inhabitants disappeared leaving no trace except "Croatan" carved on a tree. It can be conjectured that a Croatian ship calling at this first permanent settlement in America left its imprint on the tree, or even salvaged the entire settlement from the destruction that was taking place, and hurriedly left only the name of their ship, the Croatan, on the tree, as a guide, but that it met destruction either by the elements or some other way later, as no trace was ever found of the colonists in question.</p>
