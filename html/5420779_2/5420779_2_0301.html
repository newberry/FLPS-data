   <p>The Croatian singing club "Mladost," (The Youth), is giving its first concert in Pilsen Hall, 26th Street and Albany Avenue.</p>
   <p>As this is the first presentation of the club 'Youth' before our public, we may mention in short the purpose of this club in this part of the city in which a large number of our people live.</p>
   <p>The West Side Croatian colony has "Zora," "Sokol," "Vitez," and "Sviezou"; they have school and church, all in one small section, but we, here in Lawndale district, have no school, no church, nothing educational for our children, so we organized this club and, after four months of work, are coming before the public with this concert, the purpose of which is not to make money at their expense. The work of "Mladost" is dedicated to the national progress and education of our people. In that spirit we have a right to the cooperation and support of all Croats and their organizations.</p>
