   <p>A Jugoslav immigrant, who was deported after he came to the United States illegally, told the immigration commissioner the following sad story:</p>
   <p>"A few of us went to France to work, but a crooked agent told people to go to Cuba or Mexico, from where it is easy to come to America. I telegraphed for money. The money arrived, and we went to Mexico. Looking for work in vain, we met another crooked agent in Monterey, Mexico. He asked for $100 to bring us safely to the United States. We telegraphed for money again. When the money arrived we went to Juarez. In the evening, At nine o'clock, we were ready to cross the river. There we met three Mexicans and were robbed by them. They forced us to cross the river, so as not to report the robbery in Mexico. That is the way we came to the United States, without a penny.</p>
   <p>"Next evening we came to El Paso. The same night, after walking ten <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>miles, we were caught and arrested, brought back to E1 Paso, from there to New Orleans and New York.</p>
   <p>My partner spent $400 and I spent $550. For that money I could have traveled like a gentleman to America, if I had used the legal way.</p>
   <p>"Now it is my only wish to be deported to Jugoslavia, where my family suffers."</p>
