   <p>This year is very profitable for fishes, ravens and wolves; likewise for our patriotic leaders.</p>
   <p>Never did a year abound with as many "funds" as the year 1914. All these funds are for the people (?). That is at least what their organizers say. But alas the names of these funds sound as if the funds collected are not for the working class. We have; "National Defense"; "Jugoslav Defense";"Serbian Red Cross"; "Croatian Red Cross"; "National Fund" and recently "Jugoslav Students' Fund".</p>
   <p>This is the youngest patriotic baby only 10-12 days old. Its father is a professor of "experimental"pedagogy - may be demagogy - at New York.</p>
   <p>We do not doubt his good intentions. But we have to ask just the same; who will benefit from these patriotic funds? Do you think the Croatian or Serbian laborer? Not at all. The name says it is a fund for students. That means that students will receive help to finish school and then climb on the backs of poor working people and manage them like the rest of the bureacrats do in Europe.</p>
   <p>Just such gentlemen are to blame for our people fleeing their fatherland to make their living here and suffer from cold and hunger in time of unemployment.</p>
   <p>Is it wise that workers in America support such students' funds? Will they not in this manner keep in school their future exploiters and society's hangers on?</p>
   <p>No, the working class has its funds. They are the economic and political organizations of which the Socialist Party is composed where International Socialism is taught. The Socialist Party is the only political party which is fighting for the salvation of the working class. Only through Socialism will parasites of society perish and equality reign among peoples.</p>
