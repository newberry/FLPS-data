   <p>To the Jugoslav Brothers - Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.</p>
   <p>Honorable Reader:</p>
   <p>Long ago I intended to compile a general view of the work, efforts and sacrifices, offered by our Yugoslav immigrants in the United States, as well as all over the world, in that great struggle of liberation, unification, and final creation of our National State - Yugoslavia. I did not have in mind to write a pragmatic History of the Yugoslav Movement, but as an eye witness and colaborator to assemble the main items, covenants and documents, to give them to future historians as a base for those who will write of the events, which happened to our great allies in these times, events which are connected with the struggles and sacrifices of heroic Serbia, the martyrlike sufferings of the Yugoslav people in the former Austro-Hungarian empire. Also with special regard for the work of the leaders and national intellectuals assembled in the Yugoslav Committee at London, in the Yugoslav National Defence in South America, in the Yugoslav National Committee,in the United States, and in the Yugoslav National Council in Washington.</p>
   <p>I wanted clearly to show not only the work of the leaders or single persons, but the visible, active cooperation of the immigrant himself; his organizations, societies and corporations, through which he did lead, assisted by our patriotic press, an uneven and hard struggle, against part of our people, which part was poisoned by foreign propaganda, that part of our people, which went wrong following <span class="page-break">\2</span>unscrupulous leaders, became against their own will a tool in the hands of our enemies.</p>
   <p>It was my wish to show the sacrifices of blood made by the volunteers, material sacrifices in money, help and offerings to the sufferers in the Fatherland and the wounded on the fields of battle, all of which was given on the part of a conscious and united Yugoslav Nation composed of three names (i.e. Nationalities)</p>
   <p>I wanted to point out the personal frictions, the intellectual leadership, the diplomatic efforts and work, but what is of most importance the great number and active help of our people who are immigrants, these the leaders could appeal to and point them out as a living part of our Fatherland, as people, who did have the right and could speak and determine their fate and their national destiny. - in those times, when the majority of the people could not do so in their own Fatherland.</p>
   <p>To envisage and to distribute, all that took much time. By this time, of course, the material did grow, a material which must be used for a background of events, for those who want impartially to judge and to comprehend that spirit which existed in the immigrants. Without that comprehension and understanding it is impossible to know the part which our immigrant played in the great war, to the admiration of all those, who did have occassion to see him and to know him better. A part by which he laid a cornerstone in the building of his Fatherland, but also his part in the upbuilding of the world's civilization. Because he became connected in his fight with greatly advanced people, sponsors of sublime ideals.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>This work, as a contribution to history will not be complete neither will it be perfect. The younger generation has to complete that, which was left out. The main thing is that the furrow was started, the foundation was laid to show the events of great and exceptional times, which times we did not miss, we participated in them in the name of our whole nation.</p>
   <p>My wish was to demonstrate to future generations here, how their fathers loved their country and made sacrifices for her. So they will be able to be proud of the successes and moral achievements before their American countrymen, with whom, in those great days they united their fate under an immortal leader.</p>
   <p>It is further my wish that in the Fatherland these memories will create a new love for the poor immigrants here, who did not shirk their affections and these memories may be a talisman to the coming generation for all time.</p>
   <p>I did not want to write with bitterness,but I could not deny the flow of historical truths. If as a human being I have erred on the objectivity of arguments or have mistakenly judged facts or persons in the light of proof of today, that must be corrected by persons more able than I.</p>
   <p>The main thing is, that before all is forgotten, from present day sources, and from fresh memories, to form a skeleton, on which to build and perfect.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In as much as our immigrants for the most part resided in the United States and were here in great numbers, our own actions as well the main events took place on America's soil, where the immigrant from the start found hospitality, freedom of movement and of action, all of us whether citizen, or not, became partners in America's and our own destiny, fighters and victors. Partakers of America's moral greatness.</p>
   <p>Because we saw in the great President Wilson not only our leader but also the Yugoslav protector and spokesman, not in word but in deed, a special section of the book is dedicated to him, therefore the book as a synthesis of that epoch will bear the title:</p>
   <p>"The American Yugoslavs and President W.Wilson" with the following sub-sections;</p>
   <p>The American Army and Navy Yugoslavs.</p>
   <p>Yugoslav Volunteers all over the World.</p>

   <p>Due to the amount of material and the way the book was planned from the start, said book will be voluminous, it will have about 1,300 pages heavily bound, therefore the publishing expenses will be great. The price of the book will be higher than book prices are in general.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Because such books are kept as sources of information and consultation as well as mementos, the number of their readers is limited. The price will be $10.00, two volumes; 1,200,000 words, For that reason it is necessary to know in advance how many books will be printed, so all those, who are willing to subscribe are requested to send their orders, with their correct address and with the above named amount of $10.00 to the undersigned.</p>
