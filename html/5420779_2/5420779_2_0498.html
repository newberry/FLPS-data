   <p>This book was lately published by the Jugoslav Workers' Library, 2741 W. 22nd street, Chicago, Illinois. The price of the book is twenty-five cents.</p>
   <p>The authorship of the book is not indicated, but at the end of the book is an inscription which reads, "Group of National Revolutionary Croatians."</p>
   <p>The book is to the point, and in a very easy style so that anybody can understand it. The writer knows Croatian history very well, and especially, the history of Jugoslavia since its creation - and he presents the existing anti-national regime very colorfully and with unusual persuasion, pointing out the way which the deprived Croatian people should take in order to arrive at their goal: liberty.</p>
