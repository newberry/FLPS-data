   <p>Several years have gone by since our singing chorus has had a radio program. Through the efforts of our director of singing, Mr. Stephen T. Pipich, we again have a scheduled program on the radio. This time, however, our program is limited to fifteen minutes.</p>
   <p>We shall broadcast on radio station WLS on Saturday, June 5. The time of the broadcast is 10:30 to 10:45 A. M.</p>
   <p>The chorus has worked hard on its numbers and feel deserving of this broadcast.</p>
   <p>The numbers we are going to sing are as follows: "Medley of Croatian Songs," "Life is a Song," "Guards of the Evening," "Long, Long Ago," and "My Mother."</p>
   <p>We hope that all our Croatian friends and members will be listening <span class="page-break">2</span>to our fifteen-minute broadcast.</p>
   <p>At this time of the year our eighth grade pupils of the Croatian Children's Home School are concentrating on graduation. As it is customary, the pupils have planned a graduation program. The number to be graduated is nine: four girls and five boys.</p>
   <p>The eighth grade pupils, together with students of the lower grades, are working on numbers which they will present on graduation day. A grade school teacher is instructing her tap-dancing class for a special number in which Anna Vori is to be featured. This alone will be an outstanding number, not mentioning the scene when our graduates will step upon the stage in their graduation clothes to receive their diplomas.</p>
   <p>The graduation is to take place in our gymnasium at 2:30 P. M. on the afternoon of Sunday, June 6. There will be no charge for admission and everybody is more than welcome.</p>
