   <p>The works produced by great and world renowned artist, Mr. I. Mestrovic are shown now at the Chicago Arts Institute Michigan Avenue and Adams Street.</p>
   <p>Large numbers of our people are visiting the exhibits daily, but there would have been more, if it were properly announced in all our newspapers, disregarding political news of the paper. Here we must realize that the work of art, is not owned by any party, but in some way its ownership is shared by our whole nation.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, it is the duty of all of us, to take advantage of this opportunity and see greatest works of our gifted countryman. Even if there were high admission to pay we would profit by it. Since the admission is free let's all go to this exhibition. This is a rare chance for our people, we should use this opportunity. Over 80 statues are exhibited, the exhibition will be open until the 4th of June, the hours are 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. every day. A banquet in honor of Mr. Mestrovic was given in Hotel LaSalle. Prepared by Jugoslav consul in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Since the consul has not the addresses of all of our prominent people it was impossible to call all of them separately. Thereby many did not know about this banquet. If the Jugoslav consul had announced in Novi Svijet, read largely in Chicago and vicinity, many more would have come.</p>
   <p>I take this opportunity to welcome our great artist M. Ivan Mestrovic.</p>
