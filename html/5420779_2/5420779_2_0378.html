   <p>About three years ago Novi Svijet (now Znanje) was sold to the owner of the press in which it was printed, Mr. Joseph Walley, for the debt of $4,000 and because of economic pressure, the association could not print the paper any longer. Now the new owner feels that the association could take the paper back while all debts are settled and we are going ahead with a clean slate. One condition is reserved by Mr. Walley, and that is that the association must issue the paper regularly or return it to him.</p>
   <p>This condition is a sort of a moral force which will cause all members to put their shoulders to the wheel and proceed with the paper.</p>
   <p>Znanje has no debts at present nor any financial obligation to anybody. Its only obligation is to continue with its cultural and educational part as it did in the past.</p>
