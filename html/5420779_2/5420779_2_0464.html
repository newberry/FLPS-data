   <p>In a recent number of Narodni Glas we could read about the very bad financial situation of that newspaper.</p>
   <p>It was the wish of all the comrades and subscribers to convert that paper into a weekly.</p>
   <p>When the paper became a weekly, comrades and friends of Narodni Glas forgot that it was necessary to support and keep up the paper.</p>
   <p>Now the expenses for Narodni Glas are twice as big as before, while the income is the same as it was when the paper appeared semi-monthly.</p>
   <p>The weekly expenses are around sixty dollars, while lately very few subscriptions or help are coming in. If this is continued, the possibility is not remote that the publication of Narodni Glas must cease.</p>
   <p>We must not allow that! That would be a shame for our whole Jugoslav Socialist movement.</p>
   <p>Narodni Glas is necessary for agitation in the United States among Serbian workers. We must not fall down with Narodni Glas. It is the duty of each Jugoslav Socialist to agitate for Narodni Glas. The Croatian comrades when working for Radnicka Straza must not forget Narodni Glas and get subscriptions for that paper. They must do the same when they are among the Serbian working men.</p>
   
   <p>This applies to the Slovenians as well to the Serbians. When soliciting for Narodni Glas do not forget Radnicka Straza and Proletareo.</p>
   <p>That will be real socialistic solidarity for a great success.</p>
   <p>Forward all! For our press!</p>
