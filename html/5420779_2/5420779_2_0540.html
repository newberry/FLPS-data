   <p>The Jugoslav Educational Association is opening a school where the correct principles of grammar and rhetoric will be taught. Classes will be held every Wednesday evening at 7:30. We hereby invite all our members, as well as all other Jugoslavs anxious to improve their knowledge of grammar and rhetoric, to attend this school. There have been many requests for such a class, and here, at last, is an opportunity that no one anxious to increase his mind should overlook. G. Kutuzovic will serve as instructor.</p>
   <p>At the same time, the Association will arrange classes in English, which Professor F. Preveden will conduct. Those wishing to attend the English classes should report on the evening of June 16 at 7:30. They will then learn what evening in the week English will be taught.</p>
