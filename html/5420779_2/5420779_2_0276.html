   <p>The ladies singing club, Jugoslavia, is giving a concert, Sunday, November 25th, in the Masonic Temple, corner 23 St. and Millard Ave., to celebrate ten years of club life.</p>
   <p>Members are doing everything possible to make this event most successful and worthy of the tenth anniversary. It is praiseworthy that this club has survived at all as it has depended entirely on its membership, and the income from occasional programs! This convinces us of what could be accomplished by collective effort with honest cooperation and able management.</p>
   <p>The program which will be announced, next week, is very interesting. Therefore, all our people should give us their support.</p>
   <p>(Signed,) Committee.</p>
