   <p>At the luncheon of the editors and publishers of foreign language newspapers and the Community Press, held at the Stevens Hotel last Thursday, wholehearted approval was expressed and the publishers tendered their support to Mr. Robert J. Dunham, president of the Chicago Park District in his efforts to secure sufficient funds so that the Park System could properly function.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dunham, who is one of Chicago's most outstanding citizens and serves the Park District without pay, presented many facts and figures why the amount asked should be granted and made a strong appeal in behalf of the common people who patronize the parks, its many recreation centers, and educational facilities.</p>
   <p>The reduction in the tax levy will naturally hamper the service and enjoyments that millions of people get from the various activities which</p>

   <p>come under the Park District, Mr. Dunham and other speakers asserted. M. George T. Donoughue and Mr. V. K. Brown also made interesting talks. Mr. Brown stated that an attendance of over 51,000,000 participated in the uses of the many park facilities last year, and much larger attendance was expected this year.</p>
   <p>Several of the publishers expressed regrets that Governor Horner and some of the members of the Legislature were inclined to cut the park pegged tax levy from its last year appropriation $9,000,000 to $7,6000,000. They pointed out that Chicago's parks are poor men's gardens and recreation havens, which serve the best interests of our thickly populated city. The parks furnish our young people places for wholesome recreation and education, thereby building characters and keeping our younger generation away from bad influences which are productive of crime, they said.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Lindrup pointed out that there are other places where cuts can be made and thought it unwise to take it out on the poor by <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>penalizing the Park District. "Chicago's parks, small parks, playgrounds, field houses with its many activities bring untold joy and pleasure to the millions of Chicago citizens and to other millions form near and far who come here to enjoy our fine parks and beaches," he said.</p>
   <p>Peter S. Lambros made an earnest plea in behalf of the parks and complimented Mr. Dunham on his fine work in the interests of the people of Chicago. He said: "Every citizen of Chicago should use his or her influence with the Legislature not to cut the tax levy and cripple the Park System because our parks are the finest in the world and they are the best salesmen we could have to sell the greatness of Chicago to other people of this country and the world."</p>
   <p>From the expressions voiced at the meeting it was plain to see that the public will favor the continuance of the fine service the parks are giving and that no reductions in that service would be advisable.</p>

   <p>It certainly would not be fair to the Chicago taxpayer to reduce any of the splendid facilities that the parks furnish to our people.</p>
