   <p>Because our rivals, who are at present on the other side of the barricades in the class struggle, wanted to show that the declaration of the executive committee of the Jugoslav Section in the Labor Party was not the stand of the party as a whole or communistic, therefore the whole committee of the Jugoslav Section of the Labor Party, at its regular meeting held Sept. 23, 1923, issued this declaration:</p>
   <p>The whole committee of the Jugoslav section, American Labor Party, is in full accord with, and supports the stand taken by the executive committee against Novi Svijet. It also considers that the committee not only has a right (to assume such attitude) but it is its duty (to do so).</p>
   <p>The stand of the executive committee is not a stand of any individual, it is the stand of the whole party.</p>
   <p>The welfare of our movement demanded that when the editors of Novi Svijet began to misinterpret Communism, our executive committee (should) unmask them. If it did not do that it would (not) have defended the basis of Communism.</p>
   <p>We therefore congratulate our executive committee and editors for their revolutionary stand in this controversy, and our opponents, being without any basic principle, had to resort to mud slinging. The committee only put them in the position where the mask was taken off their faces and now they stand unmasked so that all can see their purpose and aim.</p>
   <p>Some of editor Kristan's followers left the movement and remained with Cvetkov and Kutuzovic led the movement in America; now they are pushed out. This we must emphatically state, neither Cvetkov nor Kutuzovic was ever a leader of the Communist movement but they, against their own belief, followed (along) from purely bureaucratic, meal-ticket reasons.</p>
   <p>When they say that their purpose is the workers' education, they are simply not telling the truth, because the executive committee intended to start a communistic educational paper under the leadership of the Communist party, they opposed it saying that such a paper is unnecessary. Well, that shows their sincerity.</p>
   <p>Now we are advising our members not to allow (these) two renegades and political aspirants without any principles to start a disagreement in the party.</p>
   <p>Forward with active work for the emancipation of the workers from capitalism and their servants. The whole committee of Jugoslav Section, American Labor Party.</p>
   <p>(Unanimously accepted).</p>
