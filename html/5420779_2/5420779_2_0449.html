   <p>The press committee of Radnicka Straza resolved at its meeting on the 21st of this month, to sue in court persons and newspapers who write that our paper serves the interests of Germany.</p>
   <p>Also all persons will be sued who libel the employees of Radnicka Straza with names such as kaiserist, agents of Germany, mercenaries of Austria and Germany, or similar names.</p>
   <p>The press committee does not have hopes that civil courts will help the Socialists, especially not in these times, but this committee cannot find any other means to end those libelous accusations in which not even their writers believe. These libels poison our people and instigate the hate of working men against us. It is all done to throw dirt on us, to stir the working masses against us, to hurt us morally and materially. The Press Committee will watch carefully what is said or written in this matter to answer to these libels vigorously.</p>
