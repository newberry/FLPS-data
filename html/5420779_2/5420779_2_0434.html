   <p>Some of our newspapers in America brought news from Belgrade papers that the Jugoslav government has forbidden the entry of our paper Znanje into Jugoslavia.</p>
   <p>We ourselves read such news in one of the Belgrade papers. Another paper at Belgrade makes fun of the government, which forbids that Znanje (Knowledge) enter the Jugoslav borders, where Knowledge seems to be so necessary.</p>
   <p>A few days ago we received a letter from a "reading club" in Jugoslavia, which informs us that they have read a few numbers of Znanje and are very much pleased with its writings.</p>
   <p>They implore some kind person in America to subscribe the paper for the club as they are not able to do so.</p>
