   <p>The central committee decided to call a special meeting for Saturday, Oct. 31, to pass resolutions on two very important questions, that is, (1) Must the Radnicka Straza (Workingmen's Guard) become a weekly? (2) Is it necessary to have a print shop of our own?</p>
   <p>At the meeting were assembled all comrades from Chicago, which shows that the importance of the question is understood.</p>
   <p>Mr. Glumac-Jurisic gave a short report in the name of the central committee about the progress of our Socialist movement. An awakening goes through the country and the movement cannot be stopped. We need a well edited newspaper, for that reason the Radnicka Straza must become a weekly paper. After the report followed a short discussion. The vote was unanimous to publish a weekly, starting January 1st, as well as to own a print shop. The press is the wings of our labor movement and its mightiest weapon. The more readers we have, the more co-workers we have, the stronger is our fight.</p>
