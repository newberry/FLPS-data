   <p>Friday, October 29, a third lecture will be given in the Jugoslav Educational Association Hall, 1345 W. 18th Street, under the auspices of "Slobdona Govornica."</p>
   <p>Mr. Loyen, representing the Jugoslav section of the Communist Party in America, will speak on the subject of the Proletarian Party and the part it plays in capitalist society.</p>
   <p>All Jugoslavs are cordially invited. There will be no admission charges.</p>
   <p>The last two lectures sponsored by Free Rostrum were attended beyond all expectations. Here is hoping that this one will receive as good a response.</p>
