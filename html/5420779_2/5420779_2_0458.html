   <p>Comrades:</p>
   <p>In a few days you will receive voting tickets for the union of our two newspapers, Radnicka Straza (Workingmen's Guard), and Narodni Glas (The Voice of the People), into one paper.</p>
   <p>We endeavored to edit both papers,as well and at as little expense as possible.</p>
   <p>Radnicka Straza stands well financially but Narodni Glas fell down on subscriptions from day to day, especially since February on account of the unemployment.</p>
   <p>The Narodni Glas, while not being financially in very bad shape, is not prospering. Our efforts are divided on different points. Our Editor as well as many other comrades are not able to leave Chicago for propaganda purposes and our movement is getting a setback, that may act unfavorably on other Comrades.</p>
   <p>On the other hand as things are now, we have to have two managements, we print both papers in different shops and both papers cost $4. per year. All these are unnecessary expenses - that is clear.</p>
   <p>Comrades, when going out to work for our cause you have to propagate two papers the same language printed in two different alphabets. We, Comrades, are able to do it better, cheaper, more rationally and successfully, if we edit just one paper, using both Alphabets - Latin and Cyrilic. That way we would give to our members in America - Croatians and Serbians, only one paper for $2. in which they would read all that they read in two papers before at the rate of $4. per year.</p>
   <p>We hope to be able to offer to our Comrades, as well as other readers, the best Jugoslav Socialist newspaper. With only one paper we will be able to gather to our ranks all intelligent workers in America, we will do away with animosity and mistakes nurtured among Croatians and Serbians artificially.</p>
   <p>We will try to show that Serbians and Croatian are one nation. The differences between them were created by different political adventurers and speculators, whose slogan was, - divide and then divide and govern!</p>
   <p>We are accentuated, by the motive of practical action for success in our cause. For us exists the duty, in first place, to work for our ideals.</p>
   <p>Also the Jugoslav bourgeoisie tends toward a unity, at least a cultural unity, of the Croatian and Serbian nationalities. We Socialists not only preach such a unity, but we must be active in the realization of such a unity.</p>
   <p>In the solution of this question must be taken into account the animosity and dislike against the Latin or the Cyrilic alphabet. Both alphabets can be mastered by Croatians and Serbians easily.</p>
   <p>Who does not want to master one or the other is not forced to do so.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation of America resolved to give the question of uniting both papers in one, deliberation, and present a solution to the members.</p>
   <p>The Resolution reads; the Radnicka Straza and Narodni Glas will be edited under one name as Radnicka Straza, appearing weekly on eight pages. On six of the pages the Latin alphabet will be used, on two pages the cyrilic. The latin and cyrilic columns will not be mixed. The cyrilic pages will appear as a separate section.</p>
   <p>If we will act together, in a short time, we will become a power in this country on which can depend not only our members but Comrades of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Comrades! Help to realize that, which we had to do long ago, unite all our forces, tighten our ranks, throw the torch of Socialism in to the remotest corners where live, work and suffer Jugoslavs.</p>
