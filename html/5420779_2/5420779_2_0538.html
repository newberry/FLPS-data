   <p>The Jugoslav Educational Association is again, as in other years, sponsoring a school offering two five-month courses: one for illiterates, and the other for those who want to learn English. The instructor is the well-known Frank Preveden, professor of philology at Loyola. The first class will be held January 17, at 8 P. M., in the clubroom at 1345 West 18th Street. Those wishing to take advantage of this opportunity are urged to enroll on that date.</p>
   <p>We know that there are many women who are anxious for more education. The present opportunity, we should like to point out, is open to them as well as to men.</p>
   <p>We repeat: the course will continue for five months. You can learn much in that time.</p>
