   <p>Because of the bad economic conditions it was impossible to issue Novi Svijet for the last two months. In the meantime, the central committee of the Jugoslav Educational Association negotiated to find a ways and means to continue issuing the paper.</p>
   <p>The ultimate result of the negotiation was confirmed at the Jugoslav Educational Association's conference, held on the 4th and 5th of this month, by which the Novi Svijet is ceded to the printing press, which in the future will take care of its publication and responsibilities.</p>
   <p>This step was taken when there was no other way out. The Jugoslav Educational Association could not continue the ownership of Novi Svijet any longer. The new owners agreed to write in about the same style as in the past. They will also send the paper to all subscribers on time.</p>
   
   <p>Novi Svijet still remains the organ of the Jugoslave Educational Federation, and will print articles concerning the work of the federation and the association.</p>
   <p>The members of the federation, sympathizers, and subscribers are invited to cooperate with the new management, as they did with previous ones, and the new management promises to reciprocate.</p>
   <p>Members of the association and subscribers who received books and calendars to sell from the previous management, will in the future give account to the secretary of the association, as the library is still in our hands.</p>
   <p>Money for new subscriptions shall be sent to Novi Svijet, 1462 N. Halsted street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Central Committee of the Jugoslav Educational Association.</p>
