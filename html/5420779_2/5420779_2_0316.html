   <p>On May the 6th the workers' dramatic club Sloboda had its spring entertainment and presented a play, "Seocka Svadba" (peasants wedding). It was successful beyond expectation. A large share of this success, however, was due to the Radnik, which advertised the entertainment. In appreciation of their good work, members of the club Sloboda, at their regular meeting held May the 14th, unanimously voted to contribute a sum of $25 to the Radnik Fund and because members of the club have always supported Radnik and wish it to be among the first in this campaign. To further show our appreciation to Radnik the club has decided to give a banquet on May 29; all proceeds to go to Radnik's fund. The committee will later announce further details of the banquet.</p>
