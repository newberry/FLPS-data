   <p>South Chicago and vicinity celebrated on August 26th their Croatian Day. By vicinity it is understood greater Chicago and neighboring towns, such as Gary, Hammond, Whiting, Indiana Harbor, and others.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge advertised the celebration in the press and over the radio.</p>
   <p>Many protested against the celebration of a Croatian Day. Handbills were distributed by some of the "class-conscious" fighters for workingmen's rights. These leaflets were written after the school of Marx, Lenin and Radek, pointing out the Croatian Day to be an assault on your pocket and mind.</p>
   <p>But that was of little effect. Those who considered themselves Croatians came to the celebration.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge had not only much work, but also great responsibilities. Our enemies worked full speed and bad weather also had to be taken into account. A failure of the celebration might have caused great expense, which would have had to be borne by the Croatian church and school, just for the profit of whom the celebration was intended.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the courage of the committee, the consideration of our Croatian merchant, Mr. John Radosevic, and of the Gambrinus Brewery, the preparations progressed in the hope that the Croatian people would respond, making the celebration a moral and financial success.</p>
   <p>The Croatian Day of South Chicago will remain in our memory, and it will also caution those who hope that the Croatian people forget or leave their religion and nationality.</p>
   <p>At the entrance of the picnic grounds at Egger's Grove stood a sign, "Welcome to the Croatian Day." In the middle of the forest, on a small hill, a church altar was built, decorated with American and Croatian flags.</p>
   
   <p>The celebration started with a parade from the Croatian Catholic church through the loop of South Chicago, to Mackinaw Avenue. In the parade participated the school children (boys and girls), forty members of the Croatian Ladies' Club Branch No. 1, Chicago, in national costumes, with flying colors. Then came members of societies of the Croatian Fraternal Union, the Catholic Croatian Union, and other independent organizations. Thousands of people, when the parade disbanded, proceeded in buses, trucks, automobiles and street cars to the picnic. It was estimated that 10,000 were present at the mass, which started at 10 A. M., at which officiated Rev. S. Andrijanic, assisted by Rev. B. Jerkovic and Rev. B. Bilandic.</p>
   <p>During mass the Croatian Singing Society Velebit rendered holy songs under the direction of Prof. Ivan Horvat. The sermon was given by Rev. Jerkovic. He spoke about the attacks made against the church and against the Croats. The hearers applauded, forgetting that this sermon was a part of the mass. This proves that the people adhere to their Roman-Catholic church and their Croatian nationality.</p>
   
   <p>After mass a lunch of barbecued lamb was served. There were many speakers, among them Alderman W. Rowan of the 10th ward. He praised the Croatians highly for their love of religion and their love of their old homeland.</p>
   <p>The last speaker was Dr. Jelic. He pictured the conditions in Croatia. The population of that country is ripe for revolution against their government and they expect help from the Croatian immigrants.</p>
   <p>The success of the first Croatian Day assures more of them in the coming years.</p>
