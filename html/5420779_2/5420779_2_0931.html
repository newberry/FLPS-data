   <p>Today enmity is a common apparition. Hate exists not only between different nationalities but also between members of the same nationality.</p>
   <p>The cause for hate is to be found in the difference of material as well as mental interests of people of different classes in the same state; even of members in the same family.</p>
   <p>The Socialists in Serbia and Croatia were the first to advocate unity and brotherhood of both nationalities.</p>
   <p>But they did not base such brotherhood on similarity of race and language. They supported the existence of brotherhood on the general Socialist philosophy, that the workers and poor inhabitants of a state are enslaved, that they have the same interests, that their salvation rests only in a powerful organization of all international proletarians and in the introduction of socialism.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>While the Socialists were persecuted in those countries as enemies of the Fatherland the governing classes used all means to inflame hate between the Croatian and Serbian population.</p>
   <p>There exists in Croatia a political party whose sole purpose is to oppose Serbians as well as any other nationality.</p>
   <p>For any evil, which happened in the country, the governing class blamed the "Jews," "Hungarians," "Serbians," etc. But these governing classes avoided showing that they were the real enemies of the people.</p>
   <p>The population had been told that their misfortune was caused by other nationalities and that they should not blame the king, ministers, aristocracy, bureaucracy and the army. In this manner every Croat was educated and similarly every Serbian. Especially from the time when Serbia became an independent state and had intentions of gaining Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Austrian government and bureaucracy presented Serbia to the Croatian people as the archenemy of the throne as well as of the Croatians themselves.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Until a few years ago everyone who dared to talk about the brotherhood and friendship of Croatians and Serbians in the old country was considered a traitor. In America it was not much better. The old traditional hate remained in Croatian and Serbian workers. This hate did not break out in activity, but both nationalities kept away from each other.</p>
   <p>When the socialist Jugoslav agitation started in this country, then the more intelligent workers came to the conclusion that here does not exist any reason for both nationalities to hate each other, to be strangers to each other.</p>
   <p>Here it is quite clear: that they are slaves on the same level, that they have one and the same boss in the factory, in the shop, in the mine.</p>
   <p>Here the Socialists started to preach unity of all Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian and Bulgarian workers to join in one federation, because all these nationalities speak one language, with dialects, which is understandable to all Slavs.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The Socialists organized the Jugoslav Socialist Federation, which has over 2,000 members today, owns two newspapers which spread socialism among Jugoslav workers in over one hundred towns and settlements.</p>
   <p>When our federation adopted its by-laws and took its official Jugoslav title, then appeared many newspapermen - Croatians and Serbians - who claimed and complained that the Socialists try to stifle the national feeling of each separate nationality.</p>
   <p>Now these same newspapermen use the word "Jugoslav" for Serbians, Croats and Slovenes (letting out the Bulgars) because the Serbian and Bulgar governments are at odds on account of war spoils.</p>
   <p>The patriotic current for the unity of Jugoslavs gained in strength during the European war, and reached its crest last March, after the arrival of a man from Croatia, Potocnjak, who induced a few people to work for the brotherhood of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.</p>
   <p>The unity of all the Jugoslavs in one state except the Bulgarians is asked.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>It seems that this state will be under the control of Serbia, or it will become that of which the Serbian bourgeoisie dreams, a greater Serbia.</p>
   <p>From the other side we hear openly that this Jugoslavia will have the friendliest connections with Russia. Sponsors of such a Jugoslavia send telegrams of greeting to King Peter, minister Pasic and to the Serbian army. That means that these will be a great factor in future Jugoslavia, for which priests, monks, doctors, attorneys, saloonkeepers, expelled officials are now working. All of these persons who never did have or expect to have now equal opportunities with the Croatian or Serbian people. They all expect fat positions in the future Jugoslavia. Many of them wait for recognition and medals from the Serbian king and the Serbian government.</p>
   <p>Evidently it is the aim of the propagandists of future Jugoslavia to unite three nationalities into one state, bourgeois and capitalistic, where the people will become greater slaves than the working class of America.</p>
   <p>The king, the ministers, clergy, lawyers, all so-called patriots will remain at the head of the future state. They will get high positions and <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>oppress that same people whose interests they want to unite with the unite with the interests of their exploiters.</p>
   <p>Our patriots have only one method of establishing Jugoslavia and that is war which is criminal; war to help official Serbia, Russia and their allies.</p>
   <p>According to natural laws each crime bears another, each injustice is followed by a new one. Out of war never will come a Jugoslavia which will truly guarantee liberty to all her people.</p>
   <p>Such a Jugoslav Union would appear quite differently if it were the result of a struggle by all the Jugoslav nationalities as they are, if such a Jugoslavia would have as her foundation cultural development and intelligence.</p>
   <p>At present we do not see here how the Serbian and Croatian people at home can even dream of a unity as a result of this war;on the contrary.</p>
   <p>There is exasperation and misery. The old hate became stronger on <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>account of the conflict of Croatian and Servian armies on the battlefields and inimical agitation by Serbian and Austrian authorities.</p>
   <p>The true and only possible brotherhood between the Croatian and Serbian people will be accomplished by the consciousness of the working class and poor peasantry of both nationalities. For such a solution only the Socialists stand today.</p>
   <p>Socialism must not only unite the Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian and Bulgarian people but all the oppressed nations all over the world.</p>
   <p>There is no other way. The only way is Socialism, which will create permanent brotherhood between all peoples; because only Socialism can break the difference of interests in society of today.</p>
