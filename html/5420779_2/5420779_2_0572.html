   <p>Thursday, June 26, a course will be started to instruct our comrades in four lectures about their behavior in labor unions. These lectures will be held by Comrade Arne Swabek, district organizer.</p>
   <p>The importance of these lectures is easily understood. The comrades will learn what their rights are in the unions and how they are able to use these rights in spite of the reactionary bureaucracy.</p>
   <p>To Comrade Swabek such questions are well known. He has had much experience in the American trade movement. He was in many important and characteristic fights of this movement.</p>
   <p>He is a member of the Painters' Union and editor of the Progressive Building Trade Union Worker.</p>
   <p>The lectures are free to everyone and under the sponsorship of the Labor party. Address: Technical School, 1902 West Division Street, Chicago. Start at 8 P. M.</p>
