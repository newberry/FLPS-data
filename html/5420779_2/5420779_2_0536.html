   <p>As time progresses the students will bring to each meeting better written and more concrete news. When the students master the writing of news clearly, they will take up the writing of editorials and articles for propaganda and agitation.</p>
   <p>Lessons will be given in grammar which is necessary for comrades, who are not advanced in the English language.</p>
   <p>It is most desirable that many of our comrades attend this school for correspondents, not only to know how to write news from factories, but also to learn the English language, which is necessary for organized workers.</p>
   <p>For the whole course the fee is one dollar. There is no excuse for more comrades not joining this class, and trying to become able workers' correspondents.</p>
