   <p>Last Sunday February 21 the Jugoslav educational association gave a grand entertainment with a program of speaking and drama and dance in the Croatian Hall in South Chicago. The Kezele orchestra from Joliet, Illinois, played for the dance and between the acts.</p>
   <p>Right in the beginning I must admit that a large attendance was not expected this time. One of the reasons is because of the Lent. Many of our countrymen otherwise craving for wholesome entertainment are still under the influence of the church and religion and somehow abstain from plays and entertainment during the religious season. The extra large attendance surprised all the members and many sympathizers. The surprise was more noticed because the Catholic priests were talking from the pulpit against this entertainment urging the people not to go and commit a "sin."</p>
   <p>Now I don't know exactly whether it was because of this forbidding and condemning the entertainment, or some other reason, but the people were curious and the largest crowd came to see the play, hear the speech and enjoy the evening.</p>

   <p>Early in the evening all the seats in the large hall were taken, the gallery and the aisles were packed. At 7:30 P. M. Mr. Ivosevic opened the program and suggested that all be quiet during the speaking and the play. Then he introduced Mr. T. Cvetkov, editor of Novi Svijet, who in short outlined "The Emancipation of Balkan people."</p>
   <p>Mr. Cvetkov in the short time of thirty-five minutes briefly outlined the recent history of the Balkan, when they fought among themselves, their suffering and the price they paid.</p>
   <p>Asked if there is a way out the speaker outlined one way: that is, for all workers and farmers of the Balkan States to organize, agree on a Federation of the Balkan and get rid of their exploiters. The Balkan people are not alone in this struggle, and they would receive moral support from millions of workers and farmers of the world.</p>
   <p>The well-known group "Nada" from Chicago played right after the speech.</p>
   <p>The play was acclaimed by all and one could see the gratification in the audience. There were many From Gary, Whiting, Hammond and other surrounding towns. After the play all must have felt reborn because they realized deep in their hearts that at best killing and massacring brothers can only serve <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>as a disgrace to society and civilization.</p>
   <p>Comments were heard from many level-headed people openly praising the Jugoslav Educational Association which sponsors this kind of educational entertainment. It is hoped that even those whom the priests forbade to come were not disappointed.</p>
