   <p>When Kutuzovic and Cretkov started their non-party paper association from N. Pittsburgh (and) asked the party central committee if they could work for that paper, the central committee of the federation ordered its members not to work for that paper. The party answered and we are printing the letter below, considering that our members are in the clear with Novi Svijet.</p>
   <p>Since some of our members think that our answer was not justified and that the party was not notified in the matter we submit the letter from the central executive committee of the Workers' Party of America National office, Chicago, Ill.</p>
