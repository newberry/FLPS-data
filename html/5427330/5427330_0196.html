   <p>A newspaperman's first duty is to give the Filipino public at large accurate and unbiased news reports.</p>
   <p>The equality of all men before the law should be observed. Newspapermen should not be swayed by political, social, economic, radical or religious prejudice.</p>
   <p>News accounts dealing with persons accused of crime should be in such form as not to mislead or prejudice public opinion.</p>
   <p>Sources of confidential information should not be revealed.</p>
   <p>The Guild should work against suppression of news by privileged persons or groups, including advertisers, commercial power and friends of newspapermen.</p>
