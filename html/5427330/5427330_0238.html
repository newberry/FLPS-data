   <p>For years we have studied how the Filipino Golfers of the City of Chicago and other parts of the States can drive a stfaight long ball. Do we need to acquire a perfect swing to drive a limitless yardage, or are we too weak to carry on the "Drive"?</p>
   <p>There are many things to be mentioned about the game of golf. But before everything else, the Filipino Golf Association desires the continued success of the Filipino Golfer, the Association relies upon the golfer, and wishes the Filipino Golfer to rely upon the Filipino Golf Association.</p>
   <p>This is not a campaign of any sort, but we are trying to find and help the Filipino Golfer, who likes, and is interested in the game, the shortest way to enjoyment of the sport.</p>
   <p>We would like to write a few facts about the past. "The increasing interest in the game of golf among Filipinos of the City of Chicago and other parts of the country, has assumed such proportions and made desirable the organization of the Filipino Golf Association. It is the primary function of the Association to stimulate "Golf-mindedness", the practice in honesty, competition, and sportmanship, which virtues are indispensable <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the game. Such measures will no doubt, help a great deal in the elevation of the standard among the Filipino Golfers; as an avenue of social contact, and better understanding, and also to distinguish our capacity and ability in the game, the F.G.A. promotes tournaments. If the very need for one justifies the foundation of an Athletic Association in this country, then the claim for prominence of the Filipino G.A. is readily supported by an obvious and indisputable excuse for being- la raison d'etre."</p>
   <p>Shall a Golf Association exist without golfers? Here are the names of the Golfers who help in the organization of the F.G.A. in the year 1932: Jose Aviar, Arciaga, Pedro Avecilla, P. Balais, Banda. C. Banez Cobacha, Cruz, P. Dalangin, DeFino, Rafael DeLeon, Del Rosario, Felipe, Gorospo, E. Hadinero, S. Jaramilia, A. Joven, D. Karganilla, John Lacson, Regino Llapitan, P. Lacson, P. Manaois, B. Olivera, Paul Pafades, S. Ponce, C. Quintos, N. Rabanes, B. Ragaza, Frank Revita, Pio Raiz, Ramon Rivera, Silverio Sol, Seminiano, Sison, Tamada and T. Urian. We doubt that they were all in the same fairway with the other members of the Association; perhaps some were out of bound on the left side; in hazards not to be able to recover; stymied by short time of play, or by the depression; trapped in those white faces on the fairway; or were some of these members like lost ball? As a general rule, lost balls can be replaced, so is a lost member. But we are hoping to make a good recovery this year "1936"</p>
