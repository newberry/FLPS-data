   <p>To us, the Filipinos, Commonwealth day is the beginning of a new hope toward the attainment of our future Philippine Republic. Therefore, the anniversary celebration of our Commonwealth must be observed by us because it re-awakens memories of the many struggles and sacrifices by our people to gain freedom, for the Philippines, and to encourage us to prepare ourselves for the task of a free government of Filipinos, by the Filipinos, and for the Filipinos.</p>
