   <p>After a tempestuous meeting held last Sunday at the Filipino Community Center, the Filipino Association of Chicago, Inc., adopted the "Popularity Queen Contest" although the house at first repudiated J. M. Lorenzana's Social Committee program of "no commercialization" of beauty queens this year, and unanimously approved Jimmy Valete's motion which was the "penny-a-vote scheme."</p>
   <p>Motion Approved</p>
   <p>Rufino Pascua, vice-president, who presided at that time in the absence of President Francisco Gonzales, was petitioned to vacate his chair when Gonzales arrived. Pascua was in favor, apparently, to the motion of Valete's but Gonzales was not. When Pascua was ousted from the chair the assembly reconsidered the motion and approved the "popularity contest."</p>
   <p>"We are no longer babies," Pascua shouted and as a result he tore up the minutes of the meeting.</p>
