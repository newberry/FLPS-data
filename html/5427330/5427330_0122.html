   <p>The Filipino women are striving to be cultured--cultured, not in the sense that they have mastered the fine arts, but cultured in the sense that they have mastered the fine art of living. This type of cultured person does not necessarily require a string of degrees from colleges and universities. Just what are the qualities the Filipino women are striving to acquire? First of all, she is striving to be creative, whether it be in beholding the sunset or the sunrise, whether it be reading a book or magazine, or whether it be living among her fellowmen. What does she attempt to create? It might be a painting. It might be a book. It might be an idea. It might be a new social order. Whatever it is, her personality develops, becoming fuller and richer.</p>
   
   <p>She has the sense of unity--unity of ideals and purposes, of integration; of personality; unity of life; oneness with God and fellowmen. Now humanity claims her love and loyalty. She loves God and her fellowmen genuinely. This is the dynamic power in life. This is the flame that gives her life warmth and glow. This is the divine fire that purges her of unkindness, of pride, of wrath, of selfishness, and of vulgarity. This is the clear magic glass through which she looks so she can see something good in the bad, something beautiful in the ugly, and something divine in mankind.</p>
   <p>She is in quest not only of beauty and goodness, but also of truth. In her quest, Agnosticism and Scepticism may go along. Reason and Intuition are her indespensable guides. Mysticism is one of her main highways. She re-evaluates, re-defines, and re-clarifies her purposes, ideals and beliefs, especially in her quiet hour with God.</p>
   <p>Lastly, she has equanimity, serenity. She has trust and faith in the living God who is working for the Supreme Good. She believes in this friendly universe, in the natural laws supporting her strivings and aspirations. The tempest of life may disturb the surface of her life but within she remains calm and serene.</p>
   
   <p>In brief, the Filipino women are seeking abundant life, not only for themselves, but for all. Being lovers of the home and conscious of the fact that the home is the fundamental unit of society, they prepare themselves to be fine homemakers. They learn the fine art of living, the art of home-making, the fine art of being a wife, or of being a comrade to their husband, and the fine art of motherhood. Then, too, they believe that they owe the community the bigger home.</p>
   <p>Filipino women have been preparing themselves for different professions such as education, medicine, law, dentistry, pharmacy, etc., ignoring only those that require heavy manual labor. They have entered almost all fields of human endeavor, not as competitors of men, but as co-workers with men to make the community more homelike.</p>
   <p>These are the aspirations of the Filipino women, which I believe are also the aspirations of other women from all parts of the world. Personally, I believe that your aspirations--you American women--are no less than these. Yes! I can see all the world, hand in hand, and shoulder to shoulder, building a fairer world where love, joy, and peace reign.</p>
