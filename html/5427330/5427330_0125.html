   <p>Are the Filipinos in America making good? How do they impress other Americans with whom they come in touch? How do they compare with other foreign peoples who come to make permanent or temporary homes under the Stars and Stripes?</p>
   <p>These are questions that a native born American who has had some contacts with them during the last year will endeavor to answer truthfully.</p>
   <p>In the first place, the vast majority of Americans know little about them. Five thousand in a population of over three millions is like a few drops of water added to Lake Michigan. Then, their appearance as distinguished from the Japanese and Chinese to nearly all Americans does not definitely identify them. Another reason why they are not brought conspicuously before the Americans is that they are law abiding. You never hear of them being arrested for fighting, robbery and murder.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>They are peaceful residents, hard workers, earnest students, and they go about their business tasks and their studies quietly, unostentatiously and with the gentlemanly manners that seem innate to them.</p>
   <p>But those Americans who have associated with them, and especially those welfare, settlement and religious workers who show they are interested in their progress, have very pleasant impressions on the character, manners and dispositions of the Filipino men sojourning or permanently settled in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Before I knew even one of them, I felt a respect for them as I saw them pass on the street neatly dressed.</p>
   <p>When I got to know them through the Filipino Center on North La Salle Street, where I was invited to lecture on art and travel subjects with stereopticon slides, I found they had other admirable qualities. I found there also two of the most helpful appreciative minds that young men eight thousand miles from home in a foreign land could possibly have to give them courage and wise direction in the difficult art of living and making a living.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Miss Lucille Windett, a university woman and teacher of art, has brought before Filipino groups some of the most cultured and envisioned experts in the city to open up art and other subjects to their inquiring minds. For six months an average of four speakers and teachers a week have been brought by Miss Windett to come to the Filipino Community Center without recompense to teach the things that are vital to the social and economic problems.</p>
   <p>The other invaluable guide and mentor is the able Director of the Filipino Community Center, Mr. Antonio A. Gonzales, whom the Associated Filipino Press properly evaluates as the "greatest Filipino social worker in America today, and as such he deserves to be citizen No. 1 of the community".</p>
   <p>What impresses me as most remarkable in the scores of Filipinos I have been in touch with, is the determination to improve their minds, not only in order to make a better living, but to inculcate true appreciation of the finer things in life and in the beauty in things around us. I am of the opinion that the Filipinos are more earnest in this search than the average young American.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Culture - that refinement we get from high minded artists and serious books, and that has nothing to do with making money, but that enriches life whether we are poor or well-to-do, this is the goal toward which so many of these young men are aiming. They have chosen a good objective. Money may be lost, but love of beautiful things, appreciation of a noble book and sympathy with all efforts to live in, will remain through the whole span of life, a never failing source of enjoyment.</p>
   <p>The open-mindedness of the Filipinos excites my admiration. I have found no bigots, no narrow minded partisans among them. They weigh this or that system of philosophy or art and religion, and appropriate that which seems to them to be the best.</p>
   <p>The feeling of Americans like myself is that we want to do a little something to show them that the United States does not want to exploit them. Big hearted Americans want to show them the Christ spirit, to love and help thy neighbor and to oppress them in no way. The world has no other example where a controling nation has said to a dependency, "remain with us or go on as an independent <span class="page-break">\5</span>government and you have our best wishes". America has sent the best teachers and administrators to the Philippine Islands and its hope and expectation is that the Islands will become beacon lights of learning and gentle arts of peace to the millions of the Asiatic continent and the islands of the sea.</p>
   <p>The Filipino young men in our midst love self-expression. They practice public speaking and debate, train themselves in parliamentary law, and many of them are fluent writers for their newspaper press. This denotes that they have a high degree of social consciousness and it is hoped by their well-wishers that when, and if they decide to paddle their own canoe as a race, they will use these national characteristics for the welfare of their country, rather than to waste their time in wordy and fruitless harangues that accomplish nothing. Who can tell how many leaders are being developed in this intellectual center who are destined to be the directors and councilors of a greater and more influential Filipino nation?</p>
