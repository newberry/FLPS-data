   <p>It is quite unfortunate that the "Publisher" of the "sheet" in which the article appeared is an American who admits he knows the Filipinos slightly. He further admits he does not know much about the politics of the Filipinos in Chicago. In plain truth, he does not yet understand the salient characteristics and traits of the Filipino elements. His interest in that publication, he said, was purely for humanitarian reasons. Neither did he know the real motives behind the editorial which was published twice.</p>
   <p>We wonder if he really knows the real meaning of the word - Publisher - and what "volume" really mean to the public. Does it mean that the paper has been appearing for fourteen years, when, in fact, it has only appeared twice? He is in the practice of medicine. Although quite very busy in his clinic, he finds time to write articles on medicine, as a hobby, and these articles are being published serially in an Oriental publication for Orientals whose "patronage," no doubt, he <span class="page-break">2</span>would like to get. He seemed not to be aware of the fact that, as Publisher, he would be held responsible for all that appears in the publication. The Publisher is responsible in the intricate relationship that exists between himself, irresponsible workers, and writers. He must know and understand his duties and responsibilities. In the above case the Publisher should have known that one of the writers in his newspaper was a "defeated applicant for the directorship of the Center."</p>
   <p>For his true information, we wish him to know that the Filipino Community in Chicago is composed of intelligent Filipinos, educated in American universities and colleges, grateful individuals who also know their individual or group responsibility. They are conscious of their duties towards their benefactors and the members of the Board. If the Publisher does not know that, if he does not yet know the real make-up of the Filipino Community, and if he is still ignorant of the sensitive characteristics of the Filipino race, then it is time now for him to marshall and call up the members of his staff to come to a meeting, and <span class="page-break">3</span>for them to device a good policy so as to publish only accurate news and unbiased articles conducive to the general good of the race, which it claims to represent. Furthermore, he should see to it that writers in such a "sheet" must be men who know the real value of newspaper work and the sacred mission of the press. That it owes to its reading public the publication of facts. Men in this particular calling should know that! They must know what they are doing and what they are writing about. They must be responsible men, broadminded, who know how to sacrifice a personal grudge for good principle, how to gather facts rather than distort them, and, lastly, they must possess the ability to interpret and to discuss issues justly. The Filipinos in Chicago are people with pride! They should not be foolish, careless or make unnecessary misrepresentations, thus suffering the humiliation before the American public, especially before the American benefactors who hold for them the best of admiration, the warmest of regard, and the highest of personal esteem.</p>
