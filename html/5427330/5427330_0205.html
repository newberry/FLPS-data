   <p>A year ago across the widest ocean,</p>
   <p>An infant Nation was reborn in peace;</p>
   <p>She may yet try her wings so young and tender</p>
   <p>Like little birds among the jungle trees.</p>
   <p>On Commonwealth Day, citizens speak truly</p>
   <p>Of burning love of country still unbound;</p>
   <p>Again the people's hearts are filled with joy at</p>
   <p>their homes, abroad--whenever they are found!</p>
   <p>Because great brains and might alone determine</p>
   <p>A Nation's role of future destiny,</p>
   <p>America's child of Democracy must</p>
   <p>Grow strong and struggle for her liberty.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Let sonny-boys become the lion-soldiers</p>
   <p>For Liberty unfurls her flag above;</p>
   <p>World Politics is jungle ruled by Nature</p>
   <p>The Nation can't survive by laws of love!</p>
   <p>Young Commonwealth! forward with gallant soldiers,</p>
   <p>With power of pen and steel, with human blood!</p>
   <p>America's Achievement of Man's Freedom,</p>
   <p>Democracy's Experiment, trust God!</p>
   <p>Sweet Occidental Gift to Orientals</p>
   <p>Great brilliant Lighthouse of Liberty,</p>
   <p>Forever to the World, flash lightning--ideals!</p>
   <p>Thy cause is with the World's Democracy!</p>
   <p>By Philip V. Vera Cruz.</p>
