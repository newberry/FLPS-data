   <p>The Community Center was founded by Americans and Filipinos in order to uplift the welfare of the Filipinos in the city, socially and educationally. It is the only foundation of its kind that through its instrumentality has gained the confidence of the American public and thus, recognized us as a group of intelligent people, individually and collectively.</p>
   <p>The Community Center furnished medical aid, employment, room and board to the needy and destitute. The Community Center is like a glass show case where the public can look through it concerning the life and culture of the Filipinos. Since we are being represented by the Center organization, we must, therefore, render our cooperation in order to maintain the institution because it has done a lot for the benefit of the Filipino people.</p>
