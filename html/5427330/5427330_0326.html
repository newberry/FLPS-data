   <p>Winter is gone, Spring is here! It is the loveliest and the most joyous season of the year. Spring dances or spring frolics are coming!</p>
   <p>A glance at the Filipino social calendar will convince you instantly that we are interested in social affairs. This is verified by the fact that the boosters of the approaching dances are Filipino clubs in the local community. We, Filipinos love music, songs, melodies and frolics of all kinds.</p>
   <p>Tonight, March 22nd, the La Union Association of Chicago will hold its Spring dance, featuring fun, jokes and songs. The club guarantees real entertainment and satisfaction for all. Just walk with her down to the Forester Hall, 1016 N. Dearborn and tell her that you can drink cocktails and dance in the "Cocktail waltz."</p>
   <p>A week from tonight we will be in the beautiful and spacious ball room of the Sherman Hotel. The Filipino Circle of Hines have selected this famous spot in the loop for its inaugural dance. There is always something in a new club.</p>
   
   <p>Do not miss this one. Remember March 29th. Tell your friends about it.</p>
   <p>On the following Sunday, April 5, another dance will be given at the Morrison Hotel. Filipino Clubs have continually patronized the Palmer House, LaSalle Hotel, Majestic Hotel, and the Midland Club, when giving dances.</p>
   <p>We invite all of our friends, Americans and Filipinos, alike, to these dances.</p>
