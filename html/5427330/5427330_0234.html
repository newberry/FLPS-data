   <p>In the last issue of the Oriental Press, I introduced the Filipino Golf Club of Chicago with some remarks about the skills of some of its members. Those who read my article are perhaps wondering why I did not mention any of its aims.</p>
   <p>The fact that this Club is now more than four years old and is widely known among the athletes at large, I took it for granted that it was unnecessary to mention its objectives. But I realize that it is very essential to let the public know why the Filipino Golf Club was organized.</p>
   <p>Due to the growing enthusiasm of the Filipinos in this branch of athletic activity, the organizers of the Club felt that some days rigid competition will exist among our boys, therefore, the Filipino Golf Club of Chicago should be well organized. We intended to create friendship, to promote social understanding, and to render tournaments of different sorts in order to make the game of golf more interesting. We have emphasized sportsmanship, honesty, and punctuality, which are the prerequisites of a real golfer. As far as the accomplishment of these aims are concerned, I am proud to say that the Club is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>very successful. The officers never receive any complaint of any kind, because the winner of every tournament receives his prize.</p>
   <p>There can be no club in the city of Chicago that is more sincere than the Filipino Golf Club. A non-member remarks that the Golf Club is like one of the other Filipino clubs in Chicago, and in the fulfillment of its promises, is far from being true. If this impression has been keeping golfers from joining the Club, I want to invite them to investigate what has been done by the Club during the four years of its existence; and if they find any instance where the Club did not redeem its promises, they can stay out. However, if they find us honorable, I wish to invite them to join the Filipino Golf Club so that they too can share the honor and pride enjoyed by the Filipino Golf Club during the four years of its existence.</p>
   <p>I want to emphasize, however, that all Filipinos who can play golf or want to play golf are invited to join the Club. I am sure that as a golfer, you will find much fun and competition at our Club. It costs only $1.00 to join the Club and this dollar is payable at the "tee" during the Club's first tournament in June. Imagine the advantages derived from that membership fee. You have a chance to compete for the beautiful Quintas Trophy, the Diana Lacson Trophy, and the Williams' Trophy, which are being offered for inter-club competition. These are not all, there are other prizes.</p>

   <p>Imagine the thrills you get for playing at some of the most beautiful golf courses in the world like the Cage Hills, the Hickory Hills and Sportman Park.</p>
