   <p>9. To safeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of justice, freedom, and democracy. 10. To consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by our devotion to mutual helpfulness.</p>
   <p>These are the commandments which every legionaire is under solemn obligation to live up to. They are not identical with the ten that Moses of old handed down to his people, but are just as important to us. Take a glance at the introduction of the above preamble once more. It says: "For God and country--". Note that God comes first and country comes next.</p>
   <p>Do you realize the seriousness of the obligations imposed upon each veteran once he becomes a member of this national organization? I am taking the first of the ten objectives for a brief discussion. "To uphold and defend the constitution of the United States of America."</p>
   <p>Once a veteran becomes a legionaire he becomes a defender of the constitution of the United States of America. He does this with his life and honor at stake for the constitution of the United States of America, the Magna Carta, of Great America, that has in its pages, in black and white, the undiluted spirit of the American principles of Democracy.</p>

   <p>This Great Charter of American Liberties assures us of our rights, (yours and mine), and everybody else's rights,--the right to live, the right to be happy, the right to be free, and the right to pursue our goal in life. This is a great objective.</p>
   <p>Let me take another objective: "To preserve the memories and incidents of our associations in the Great War."</p>
   <p>What are these memories and incidents? Imagine a few hundred men winning a battle in the face of seeming defeat. Some of them white, some of them black, and some of them brown. Perhaps they are Italians, Americans, Greeks, Filipinos, or Africans. They all face death. They faced hundreds of machine guns. These machine guns were aimed straight at them, yet they plodded on. Some were left behind dying, some were picked up by comrades to be attended to after the battle. These men, regardless of their differences in race, suffered the same agony, the same hardships, and they shared each other's joys and sorrows. They all knew that Germany's lead knew no race distinction, and they also knew that they were all subject to the deadly effect of this lead. Upon these memorable incidents, the Legion's fourth objective was set forth.</p>

   <p>Tomas Claudio Post enjoys the same privileges that the other posts enjoy. Our representatives meet the representatives of these posts on the same ground. They are our official delegates to different meetings and conventions. And the delegates are our countrymen. They represent us at various activities of the Legion, such as the monthly or regular meeting of the Sixth District Legionaires, the regular meeting of the Cook County councils, the annual convention of the department of Illinois. American Legion, and at some civic and semi-civic organizations in the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is certain that by means of good representations of a Filipino organization such as the Tomas Claudio Post, we will, in time, win the confidence and respect of other people of the city. We, as a people, or as a Filipino nation, can well be proud of our international relations with others. But we must be known by means of good work and this can be done only by the united effort of all Filipino veterans of the World War. Tomas Claudio Post is paving the way. Tomas Claudio Post needs your support. We need your moral support for this Post to live and not merely exist.</p>
