   <p>The Filipinos in Chicago still possess their sense of openmindedness, especially when one of their national celebrations is under way.</p>
   <p>The spirit of openmindedness prevails among the Filipinos in New York, Los Angeles, and in many principal cities throughout the United States where Filipinos have occasion to honor their greatest hero, Dr. Jose Rizal.</p>
   <p>Rizal Day Queens were elected in many Filipino communities throughout America. There is a prevalence of a sane openmindedness among the Filipinos in America. But there are a few rugged individuals, who, in spite of this, cherish a prejudice against candidates or queens slated from other nationalities than the Filipino. Thanks, that after election of the queens, there spiteful spirit crumbles.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday, with the exception of "Miss Philippines", the Filipino in this city expressed their friendly confidence and openmindedness by electing as queen, a few American beauties, whom they have found friendly.</p>

   <p>The spirit of these candidates is fairly understood. They are always willing to lend a helping hand to our local problems. This should be borne in mind and be well understood by all Filipinos, including the few who whisper in dark corners.</p>
   <p>Dr. Jose Rizal himself, whose memory we dearly and fondly honor, was married to one who was not of his own race. In him was borne and manifested a great spirit of sane openmindedness and sane internationalism, which is regrettably found wanting among the squawkers who are always criticizing the idea of electing, for Rizal Day queens, some hard working American girls.</p>
