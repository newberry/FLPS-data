   <p>Well, that's that! Our Philippines are now our Philippines, thanks to the invaluable help of the powerful interests of Washington D. C. lobbyists who saw more profits for themselves by cutting off Philippine trade competitions on sugar, copra and hemo, through giving us our longed-for emancipation. Truly, it is not an ill wind that blew us this great good. For now the Penoys (Filipinos) have the chance to show to this sophisticated world, that, as a nation, they have grown up into maturity and therefore, deserve to be let alone to develop self dependence and gain full citizenship in the commonwealth of the world.</p>
   <p>Of course, some of our American friends, and even some of our people, are afraid of our future. I was afraid of it myself, for some time, although I have always been a disinterested devotee of Philippine liberation. I was afraid that Japan would make of us a second Manchukuo. But <span class="page-break">\2</span>the nightmare faded away in the light of the New Day.</p>
   <p>What if there are dangers? We should not be afraid to take a chance. It's the people who dare that get somewhere. It's better to have dared and lost than never have dared at all. But we won't get lost. Moreover, we are not yet free.</p>
   <p>Once upon a time, the Filipinos were a daring people. The Spanish conquerors and missionaries have left us their legacy of undaunted daring and courage.</p>
   <p>The sons of Columbia have again re-affirmed by word and deed, what daring and courage could make of a man. Can you blame Juan de la Cruz, (Filipinos in general) then if he, too, would dare to emulate his great teachers?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We are rather fortunate in that our geographical position makes us a sort of Switzerland of the Orient.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt in my mind that we are going to be able to stand on our feet unaided. We were practically like that for years. But our doting Uncle Sam, who had become fond of us, hates to see us flounder and get hurt, so he kept on nursing us a little longer, until some of his own children who grew jealous of his fondness for our welfare, said to him:</p>
   <p>"Dad, old boy, let Juan go take care of himself. He is old enough, you know. He has been pestering you to let him live his own life his own way, anyway. You have been neglecting our well-being for his well-being for years, don't you see?"</p>
   <p>Good old Uncle Sam, with moist eyes, said: "But I will have to stand by him for ten years time so he will be perfectly strong to take care of himself against high pressure salesman, strong arm bullies and scheming fortune hunters," which is a perfectly wise and humane thing to do, despite Sakdalist and Aguinaldist (Aguinaldo) opinion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>For after those ten years it is for us to decide whether we prefer complete independence or, if we see fit, to remain under the protecting folds of the mighty Star Spangled Banner.</p>
   <p>If we may judge the future by the results of this epoch-making elections, don Juan de la Cruz is on his way to obtain his degree of bachelor of Political Science in the great University of the world and is eligible to join the Fraternity of Nations as a regular member therein. The course is ten years, though.</p>
