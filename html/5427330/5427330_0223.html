   <p>The Filipino Association of Chicago held a meeting last Sunday afternoon, August fourth, at the Community Center. The object of the meeting, according to the presiding Chairman, Mr. Valete, was to call the attention of all Provincial presidents of organizations to consider the centralization of all Filipino groups.</p>
   <p>In spite of the absence of the majority of Club presidents, the forum was conducted in order. After the form, President Maglaya took the chair and, before opening the business meeting, he warned deliquent members not to participate in the debate. Maglaya's warning was counteracted by our inventor and surgeon, Doctor Duerme, that the ruling will automatically bar everybody in that group, Maglaya included, because no one in that crowd had paid his dues for the year 1935.</p>
