   <p>On Sunday, March 25th, members of the Epworth League of the Englewood Methodist Church were guests of the Filipino Center. They were in attendance at both the Sunday School hour and the church service and were deeply impressed by the serious note of the questions asked the speaker; question bearing on the subject of war and its relation to the church.</p>
   <p>After these servises Rev. Laxamana and Mr. Gonzales escorted the visitors to the gayly decorated social room where they immediately caught the festive spirit of their hosts. The first part of the evening was spent in playing games and learning to know each other. Then stunts were performed by three different groups. Rev. Laxamana prepared a varied and interesting program consisting of several numbers by the Filipino stringed ensemble, and vocal selections sung by Mr. Frank Gordon. Then, to the delight of the whole group, refreshments were served and a delicious birthday cake was cut in honor of the birthdays of three members.</p>
   <p>At nine o'clock, "Good-night Ladies" was sung and the guests departed for home with a new and different attitude toward Filipinos.</p>
   <p>The companionship was enjoyed and a bond of friendship was made between the two groups which should prove lasting. More affairs of this sort should be sponsored in the future in order that better relations might be maintained between American and Filipino young people.</p>
