   <p>The Associated Filipino Oriental Press is a marvelous newspaper because it brings the Oriental and the American people in closer contact with each other. It helps to overcome distinctions of color, race, or creed and also creates a better understanding between the United States and the Orient. It gives the American people a better knowledge of the Filipinos.</p>
   <p>The paper is an unbiased political one. Its motive is to "promote friendliness and goodwill." With this motive in mind, the paper is and will be a success. This paper gives the news of the day from an unselfish point of view.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, I wish the Associated Filipino Oriental Press continued success throughout the coming year.</p>
