   <p>The Rev. Francisco S. Galvez of Knox Memorial Church of Manila is one of the Filipinos delegates to the International Missionary Council Conference which will be held at Northfield, Mass., on the first week of next month. The pastor stopped at Chicago for three days to see some friends from home. Dr. Wade C. Barclay of the Board of Education of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who was once a Missionary in the Islands, was really the man who responsible in making it possible for our delegate to stay at Chicago for a few days.</p>
