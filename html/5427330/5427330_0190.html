   <p>The Filipinos are enjoying themselves these days. Just last week the Filipino Postal Employees brought many of our boys with them to Calumet Park for a picnic. They had contests in indoor-baseball, volley-ball, and many different games. The group was divided into two teams: the first was the "Married Team", and the second was the "Single Team." In both indoor-baseball and volley-ball, the "Married Team" won. The girls which were divided into American and Filipino teams aroused more spectators than anything else during the day. The Filipinos won.</p>
   <p>The crowd cheered and jeered while watching the participants in the group games. Banana eating, smoking, and sac-leg contests for men were sources of great delight. The beautiful damsels cheered for their favorites until the end.</p>
   <p>The Booster's Club had their Banquet and Dance at the Palmer House, Room 10, last Sunday. There was not the large crowd which was expected. It was <span class="page-break">\2</span>probably due to the intense heat all the day. However, the crowd had a lot of fun; and they were kept in good spirits with their motto: "Boost your people and country."</p>
   <p>The Ilocos Nortenean Association is having their Third Annual Summer Frolic tonight at Foresters Hall, 1016 North Dearborn Street. A big gathering is expected to attend because the gentlemen are bringing their beautiful girlfriends for the Beauty Contest of Miss Ilocos Nortenean for 1935.</p>
