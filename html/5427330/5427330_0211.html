   <p>The several attempts by Dr. F. I. Aguila, resident physician of the Community Center, to secure a moving picture film pertaining to health problems, have induced Dr. J. Jirk, Director of the department of health in Springfield, Ill. to choose the Filipino Community Center as the official outlet for film releases. These film releases officially commenced last Sunday, Dec. 9, at the Filipino Chapel, Chicago.</p>
   <p>The first showing was the Four-Real story, "Deferred Payments," a story that deeply impressed all present. It was so effective, that the consensus of opinion pointed out the fact that releases of such character will be considered the best means of acquainting the youth with ravages of certain social diseases.</p>
   <p>In addition to the class on "Disease" which conducted by Dr. F. I. Aguila, at 8:00 P.M., every Friday, film releases which are due from Washington, D.C. and New York City, will be shown to the public without charge whatsoever. Everybody is invited. Everybody owes it to himself, or herself, to be healthy.</p>
