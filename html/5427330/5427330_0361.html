   <p>A blow to the unity of the Filipino Community of Chicago was inflicted on Dec. 29th when the Filipino Association, Inc., the only legal national organization of Filipinos in this city, and the Associated Clubs organization, under the guise of Filipinos of Chicago, celebrated separately on the same night the 39th anniversary of the death of Dr. Jose Rizal, the Filipino martyr and hero.</p>
   <p>The F. A. C. drew approximately 400 banqueters and 500 ball dancers, overshadowing by far the attendance of the Associated Clubs affair.</p>
   <p>Statements coming from commentators were to the effect that the affair of the F. A. C. was more dignified and had the genuine spirit of Rizalism, in contrast to the lack of such a spirit in the affair of the other group.</p>
