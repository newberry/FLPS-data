   <p>Our stand! The Rizal Day controversy is settled, as far as the Big V Club is concerned. The Brain Trusts of the two clubs, the F. A. C., and the Associated Clubs, met last Dec. 2nd, and discussed the most conflicting issues of the day. There were, of course, divergence of opinions, but they were altogether mitigated to make room for a wiser and firmer stand. In short, the clubs went on record to take a side.</p>
   <p>The Associated Clubs was and is the unanimous choice. The Big V can not ignore a sane principle. The Big V can not afford to become awkward by coquettishly playing the role of a neutral. This is a dangerous game and the club can not be won and coerced by beauty, charm and smiles, coming from tyro political gamblers.</p>
   <p>Neutrality is a fine procedure. In some instances it silences an issue; but in most cases it tends to divide, if not crush, the goal of socio-political <span class="page-break">2</span>conduct. For, on the one hand, it brings sympathy, and, on the other, it creates apathy. The club can not follow this trend of thought. It is fickle; it is "kiddish"; it is irresponsible.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore evident that the Big V Club is pursuing the cause of true and determined leadership. But this is not its goal. It is merely the means to awaken a part of the masses who blindly rallied to the support of unreasonably emotional "Big Shots".</p>
   <p>Our stand is on the table; it is solid; it is firm. The genuine spirit of Big V diplomacy is "friendship for a national cause".</p>
