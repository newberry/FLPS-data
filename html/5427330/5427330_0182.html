   <p>The Alpha Gamma Fraternity feted a farewell dance and program on Sunday Aug. 25 for Jose Delgado, a loyal member, who is going home very soon.</p>
   <p>Mariano Galban and Nemesio Salazar of Northwestern University were mostly resposible for the success of the occasion.</p>
   <p>The program was very interesting. Ernesto Illustre delivered the welcome address. Miss Loraine Youp'1 sang a song and Nemesio Salazar sang also a native song. Galban acted as a toastmaster of the evening. Domingo T. Duga, the chief of the Board of Directors of the Big V. Clubhouse where the occasion was held, spoke also on behalf of their institution.</p>
