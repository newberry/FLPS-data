   <p>The Lake Geneva Fellowship of Races met last Thursday evening at the First Bohemian Church at 1109 W. 19th Place. Before the opening of the program, there was folk dancing led by Miss Beulah Tullar of Downers Grove, Illinois. Then the meeting began with a hymn. The church choir of fourteen young people, directed by Mrs. C. Sefl sang with great inspiration. Angela Yaniz, a Mexican damsel, sang a vocal sole in Spanish. The principal speaker, Rev. J. Erwin spoke on "Racial Interpretation of History", <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ing it with humors that transformed faces into wholesome smiles.</p>
   <p>In closing, Miss Miller played a piano selection which was very much applauded. There were 34 people of different nationalities in attendance. This organization is created particularly for the purpose of solving racial problems arising from time to time.</p>
