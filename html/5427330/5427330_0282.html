   <p>Few people ever thought of 70 W. Oak St. as a residential place for Chicago Filipinos. Operated by Mrs. Louise Berg, it is a real home for the Filipinos in Chicago. I also think of it as my second home. My heart and thought are "wrapped up" in this home which is mostly occupied by Filipino tenants.</p>
   <p>It is a real home with facilities that make us, who are thousands of miles away from our dear homes, really feel at home in it.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Berg and her children have become lovers of the Filipino Community. They always take part in Filipino undertakings and activities. They have a warm heart for all Filipinos. They have been dealing with Filipinos for a long time. Over forty Filipinos now room with Mrs. Berg.</p>
