   <p>Saturday evening, May 9, the Nueva Viscaya Association of Chicago tendered a welcome dinner to Mr. X. Villanueva, who just came from the Islands. He is a former member. Everybody seemed happy to see him. He advised all his countrymen to go home so that they may render a better service to their mother country rather than stay here in America.</p>
