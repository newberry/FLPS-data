   <p>Filipino youths, of Chicago, who are members of the class under Miss Flora Diaz, will be greatly benefited by the course of lecture given under her direction. Every Wednesday evening serious minded groups of students will gather to discuss perplexing problems of youth, such as, Courtship: Improper and Proper Ways of Courtship; Abundant Life; Love; and other important subjects.</p>
   <p>Among the serious students, pondering pensively over the topics above every Wednesday night, are: A.A. Gonzales, Gen. Director of the Filipino Community Center; Rev. Laxamana, Church Minister; R. Barretto, E. Ilustre, Attorney Calderon and F. A. Lopez.</p>
