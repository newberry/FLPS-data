   <p>The prosperity of any country depends largely upon economic security of the people. A country which has a home for its family; a school for educating its constituency; and a government within the limit of the people to support, is indeed a prosperous and peaceful country. The people are happy, obedient, peaceful and law-abiding.</p>
   <p>We are expecting this condition in our country. We desire it because it makes life exist, and it re-enforces the sympathy, loyalty and support of the people in their country.</p>
   <p>At first our people were enjoying this condition of existence. It was the time when no western influence had crept into the Philippines. The coming of Spain, America, and other foreign elements in our native land has changed our mode of life. These invaders were human as we are. They coveted what our people coveted, and since they know more of the material value of land, gold, and property than our people, the ultimate result was that they got most of the riches of our soil.</p>
   <p>The present picture of the economic situation of our country is a material evidence of the case. The Hacienda farm question, the big privately owned corporation and the Sakdalista uprising, are direct results of man's greed, However, we are now living in a new era and we are hoping that law, the chief guardian of our rights, will solve our problems and restore to us our economic status, Recent cases that were decided by the Philippine Supreme Court show this trend. We hope that law, rather than men, will always prevail in our government.</p>
