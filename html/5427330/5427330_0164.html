   <p>In the election, which was held at Mr. and Mrs. F.P. Alayu's apartment, 5548 Ellis Ave., Dec. 14, 1935, the Association has over-powered the president's constitutional authority. Women members are exempted from paying fees and dues which are some of the prerequisites to hold any of the elective offices. After a stormy debate, the president, Mr. F.P. Alayu, consented to the popular demand of the suffragists under their "unwritten laws". As a result Mrs. Tobias B. Guisatao was nominated and was elected secretary by a landslide over her opponents. Mrs. Francisco P. Alayu, was elected Chairman of the Welfare Committee; Mr. Florentino Ravelo was also elected president.</p>
