   <p>It is quite a marvel to herald that two years ago, the United States arranged to quit buying cocoanut oil mainly from the Philippines, because this great continent was confident enough to supply its own need of oil and fat from its own production. But statistics show that last year, America bought 50% more cocoanut oil than the year 1934.</p>
   <p>American soap makers and consumers have learned that soap can be manufactured by using the cotton-seed oil and other kinds of fats, but the quality never surpassed the soap that is made out of cocoanut oil.</p>
   <p>United States Congress tried to curb the importation of Philippine by laying a 3% exise tax on every pound imported. The money collected from the tax is kept in the treasury and is not spent by the U. S. government, instead it is to be sent back to the Philippines to improve this great industry. Now there are at least $30,000,000 saved in the treasury of America. America's action to curb on buying cocoanut oil is a blessing to the Philippines and the Filipinos. Cocoanut oil is a superior product among the industries of the world.</p>

   <p>America manufacturers are trying to take off the three cent tax in order that they can buy the oil cheaper, but their movement has never materilized. Philippine cocoanut oil is an invaluable contribution to the soap industries of the world.</p>
