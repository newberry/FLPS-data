   <p>The longer a Filipino stays in the United States, the more bitter he becomes. He is bitter against the environment in which he lives, bitter against the world, and, worst of all, bitter against himself. The longer he stays here the poorer his sense of value becomes. If these observations are correct, then his coming to the United States is a detriment! We cannot say whether he is to blame entirely. He is forced to go thru experiences which he never dreamed of doing under the ordinary circumstances in the Philippines. He is forced to associate with the wrong class of people of his own race. He has to live and, therefore, has to work, and more often than not, he has to resign himself to the domain of the kitchen, the garden, and the ranch--they are the only places that seem to welcome him. He complains of racial snobbery even in school. He is segregated in many theatres. He is banned in many barbershops. He is not welcome in some restaurants. He is looked down with playful contempt anywhere. No wonder if he grows bitter with the years and contemplates vengeance on the Americans in the Philippines when he returns home.</p>
   <p>This is only one side of the picture. There are many of our boys who have <span class="page-break">\2</span>made friendships with the best Americans during their stay here and have, therefore, become enriched in their experiences. The usual complaint that the Americans in the Philippines are treated with hospitality and consideration while the Filipinos here receive just the opposite is, in the majority of cases, true. But, after all, our characters are revealed in the way we rise above unseemly situations, in the way we form friendships in an unfriendly environment. Many times the fault lies in us, because we expect too much. A little jolt now and then, a little slight here and there, sets us aflare with indignation--and the result is, we lose control of ourselves and therefore of the situation!</p>
   <p>There are many Americans who are good just as there are many Filipinos at home who are good. In fact, this can be said of any other people. And we cannot forget the friendship formed under the glow of college days. We cannot forget the American mothers who stood by us when we are sick and many times hopeless. We cannot forget our American professors who are very helpful and friendly to us. We cannot forget the Christian American families who helped us to find work, who were kind to us and solicitous about our welfare. We cannot forget the Christian Ministers and Christian People who helped us to bear our <span class="page-break">\3</span>problems by their sincere friendliness. No, we cannot forget these! These are the things that live even long after we have returned to our homes.</p>
   <p>There are many of these friendships here if we simply try to seek them sincerely and patiently. It is only a matter of approach and understanding, of making allowances for the ways, outlooks, and manners that are different from ours. Then, too, it is a matter of showing to these people that we are worthy of their friendship. How can we make friends and know the better class of Americans if we confine our association with our own people who often are not of the class that we will choose to go with under normal conditions in our own country? How can we know the right Americans, if we seek the places where the lights are red and enjoy the pleasures that feed the flesh and starve the mind and soul?</p>
   <p>Our stay in America will prove, either as a detriment, or a benefit, depending upon our choice of association. Whether we go home as an asset or as a liability depends upon the kind of contacts we make here. We hope we will not be like the educated Filipino who despises everything American because he was ill-treated when he was here. We do hope we will be like the other educated Filipino whose character was made stronger, richer and more beautiful because he chose to know the right Americans while he was here. There is no use for bitterness, nor disillusionment. We make or unmake ourselves by our attitudes.</p>
