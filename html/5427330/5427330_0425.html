   <p>Countrymen, Your Country Has Need of You!</p>
   <p>Countrymen return to your country!</p>
   <p>Do not become so engrossed in America that you forget the urgent need of the land of your birth.</p>
   <p>Learn here - acquire wisdom in the ways of man, then go back and teach your people as you have been taught. Do not stay here and selfishly enjoy the luxuries of this country when your homeland needs your help so badly.</p>
   <p>Progress there has been slower than here. Who should improve a country but its own people? Certainly you wouldn't let your homeland blunder on in its slow way when you are so well equipped to aid it! You are an asset to America but a necessity to the Orient!</p>
   <p>Is it fair that some of your people live in ignorance, bad health and poverty while you bask in the land of plenty? Should you not share yours with those <span class="page-break">\2</span>less fortunate than you?</p>
   <p>Students and countrymen let this be your challenge! Learn here to teach there - and you will be the happier.</p>
