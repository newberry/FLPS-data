   <p>The concensus of opinion among the American delegates who were present when President Manuel Quezon was inaugurated as the chief executive of the Philippine Commonwealth Government revealed that the Philippines is treasured by the Americans.</p>
   <p>Among the American representatives who witnessed Manuel Quezon, "The George Washington of the Philippines," installed in the highest office of his country were leading authorities on government, law and science, journalists, and outstanding writers of American newspapers and periodicals. These great men, what have they to say about the Philippine Freedom? If it were not too late they would certainly blindfold President Roosevelt to sign the blank paper instead of scribbling his signature on the Independence Bill.</p>
   
   <p>An excerpt from one of these authorities is an evidence of the American sentiment and attitude toward the Philippines! "Surrender of the Phillippine Islands will go down in history as the greatest economic folly by the United States. These 6,000 Islands in the Philippine group composed the richest undeveloped spot left in the world."</p>
   <p>The American public has never taken seriously the importance of the Far East and its people until the Commonwealth Government was granted to the Philippines. Why is it that these opinions against the Independence of the Islands bubble in the ocean of political circles after the Commonwealth Government was placed in the hands of the people during the transition period? Was it neglect upon the part of the American public, or was it just a catch to wake up the sleeping people?</p>
   <p>Senator Gibson wrote: "By withdrawing from the Philippines we are giving up the key to trade in the East and we are striking a blow at our own manufacturers. We are giving up an area that some day will be producing more gold than Alaska. We are stepping out of the picture and leaving it for Japanese exploitation." The pleasant condition of the Philippines at the present time under the Government is on its way to perfection, due to the activities and efforts of the ablest Filipino leaders who believed in autonomy and independence. We are visualizing a great prospect for our beloved Motherland, basing our outlook upon the American authority in politics.</p>
   <p>Senator Gibson further wrote: "It may interest Americans to know that the Philippines will soon become the oil-producing center of the Far East." American private and public opinions, concerning the people of the Far East, is now being oriented by the diverting influence of the Filipino communities in the Eastern and Western world.</p>
   <p>Mr. Snell said: "We have surrendered the Pearl of the Pacific for a gesture of sentiment; a sentiment that will in the end prove unavailing so far as Philippine Independence is concerned, for we have simply given the Island Empire in name only and for a brief period." Does the statement convey an idea that we will never attain our highest national desires and aspirations? That we will never become the first nation under the Republic from the givernment in the Far East? And that we shall be denied the enjoyment of life, liberty, and justice under the free and independent Philippines?</p>
   <p>The Philippine Republic is on our hands. It is up to us to keep on maulding its present foundation in order to maintain the stability of our government and to preserve our ideals and culture as liberty-loving, peaceful and united people of the Philippine Republic.</p>
