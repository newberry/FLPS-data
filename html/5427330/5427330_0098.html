   <p>Filipinos sometimes misjudge the Americans. They form unfounded notions and create bad impressions upon their benefactors. Without due consideration and trial they believe they are beaten, because they think they are discriminated against. Consequently they glorify their present predicaments.</p>
   <p>Discrimination is found everywhere among races, social groups, and classes. Seek your own level and you will find no prejudice.</p>
   <p>The Oranio case exemplifies this opinion. Recently, Oranio, a Filipino, in self-defense shot one white fellow and he was acquitted. In business and social contact take the Filipino economist, Villamin. For other professionals take the Filipino doctors and insurance men. Most of their patients and customers are white people.</p>
