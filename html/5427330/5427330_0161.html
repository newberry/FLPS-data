   <p>Plans to make the Philippine Islands "invasion proof" with a fleet of tiny high speed fighting craft and a relatively large but fast moving army reserve were revealed tonight by Maj. Gen. Douglas Mc Arthur, former United States Army chief of staff and now Military Advisor to President Quezon.</p>
   <p>"When the Philippines become an independent republic after 1945," he said, "there will be an offshore patrol of 50 to 100 small defense ships capable of moving 50 to 60 miles an hour, 400,000 trained reserves, and a 250 plane air force and a comparatively small standing army."</p>
   <p>"In thirty years," he added, "there will be 1,200,000 army reserves."</p>

   <p>Eight Million for Defense</p>
   <p>"As we go along," McArthur said, "we shall collect supplies and equipment for this army, guaranteeing that the reserves can go into action within a short time, fully equipped for field duty.</p>
   <p>"With leadership such as is afforded by President Quezon, these islands will become a great nation and the gateway to the far east. Their natural position will make them easy to defend and invasion costly.</p>
   <p>"We have eight million to spend during the ten year period for military defense. That means economy, but I am confident we can erect a defense that will discourage the invader."</p>
   <p>McArthur said the small boat plan would develop eight years hence and produce results two years thereafter. He said the tiny fighting vessels will carry crews of eight men each and will have two torpedo tubes each.</p>

   <p>Claims Value Has Been Proven</p>
   <p>"The value of these ships already has been proven," he continued. "Their speed makes them a difficult target. With air forces cooperating with this fleet, no admiral would rish his ships to invade the Philippine waters. We can get 15 of these crafts at a cost of one submarine.</p>
   <p>"We shall get the air fleet within the last two years of the transition period. In the meantime, we are developing air field personnel."</p>
   <p>McArthur said if the islands followed the general defense plan "the Philippines can rest in perfect security."</p>
   <p>"It would take a half million men, ten billion dollars, tremendous casualties, and three years' time successfully to invade the Philippines," he added.</p>
