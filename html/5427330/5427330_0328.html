   <p>The Nueva Vizcayan Dance at the Sherman Hotel, last Sunday, was an outstanding and orderly affair. The Filipino College Orchestra members, in white short cut uniforms, in contrast with the beautifully decorated Louis XVI Ballroom, were the bright stars of the evening.</p>
   <p>There is no other Filipino Clubs yet that employed two orchestras to entertain its guests so splendidly. That is the reason why the Philippine Messenger expresses its most sincere appreciation to the untiring effort of every member, especially to the President and Chairman in putting the affair over.</p>
   <p>The address by Mr. C. Ravelo, president, expressing the main purpose of the club to carry on the thought that is embodied in the Constitution, and to co-operate with every Filipino club in the city and to promote good will with the American people, was very inspiring.</p>
   <p>Another interesting feature of the occasion was the auction of a bouquet of which the winner became the Miss Nueva Vizcaya.</p>
