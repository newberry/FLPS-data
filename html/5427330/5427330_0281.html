   <p>The members of the Filipino Community Center's staff last Sunday met and discussed this year's budget which was set at the $1,500 mark.</p>
   <p>Director Antonio A. Gonzales was informed by the members of the board that for every dollar he could raise from the Filipino groups, the board, composed of prominent Americans, would give two dollars.</p>
   <p>Under this condition, the integrity and ability of the Center's director and the members of his cabinet, added to the abilities of the many influential leaders of other Filipino groups in Chicago, this year's budget of the Center will be easily met. The Center's Staff, by all means, must meet the budget.</p>
