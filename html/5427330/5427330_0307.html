   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Your headline article of September 15, 1936, entitled "F.A.C. $500 Still Missing," surprised me almost at the point of exhaustion and nervous breakdown! It is shocking how some people could be so pretentiously ignorant! They wanted to know where the $500 F.A.C's money was hidden! I would like to suggest not to look for it anymore for there "ain't no such animal!" One would think that a certain "few", as they called it, pocketed the "missing $500" during the previous administration and nonchalantly called it a perfect steal.</p>
   <p>It is futile for me to explain the psychological reactions of those members and friends of the F.A.C. Inc., who did not know the exact situation of the Association's treasury. I have definite knowledge from former members and <span class="page-break">2</span>friends of the F.A.C, attitude and the reason why they never cared to belong to that organization is that it's a crooked organization. I am writing this open letter for the benefit of those who did not know the facts of the case and the explanation about the "missing $500."</p>
   <p>The truth of the matter is that at the close of that ill-fated, eventful, sensational, royal election day, April 19, 1936, when four hired police-men had to give a helping hand in the recounting of the ballots, the Membership Committee, in the presence of the electoral board members handed me the total receipts of the 336 membership fees amounting to $504, minus the expenditure incurred in the election which was $63, making the net cash balance $441 and not $500, out of this sum other expenses and debts of the F.A.C. Inc., were paid, amounting to $51.15. Now, by mere process of subtraction, one will find that the cash on hand would be ($441-$51.15) $389.85. The F.A.C. Inc., had at that time $3.95 in the bank; adding this to $389.85, we should have, and did have $393.80; and again, may I repeat not the sum of the "missing $500." One will probably notice that I did not itemize the <span class="page-break">3</span>various expenditures, I purposely avoided that, for the simple reason that the report of those expenditures is the property of the F.A.C., Inc., and unless, I am duly authorized by the said Association to devulge its private affairs and undertakings, to do so would not only be unethical but may also be illegal.</p>
   <p>Now, one would wonder, "what became of the $393.80?" Well, it was on one bright early morning, May 5, 1936, at which time the sun was able to dry the dewdrops on the tops of the Loop skyscrapers, when the president, and the treasurer of the short-lived administration and myself hurriedly went to the First National Bank of Chicago. To be able to withdraw, one must have the signatures of Mr. German Maglaya, and Mrs. J.O Abriam, the president and treasurer, respectively, of the May to July administration.</p>
   <p>On June 7, 1936, came the inaugural dance, expenses had to be incurred for its preparations and more expenses were incurred when it terminated. The outgo having been much greater than the income, red ink had to be used in entering it on the debit side of the Profit and Loss account.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Making the "red" much "redder." Previous debts of the F.A.C. to Mr. I. Yumul and Mr. F. Ravelo were, either fully or partially paid. The result was according to Mrs. Abriam's report, that $172 is still resting peacefully in one of the safety vaults of the First National Bank.</p>
   <p>To demand $550 from the previous administration officials by the present administration, no court would sustain such a demand in the light of the facts I above enumerated. The possible reimbursement that the officials of the previous administration may have to make would be those expenditures incurred in the inauguration, if, and only if the Court should rule that they must be reimbursed. In the event, the Court rules otherwise, the present administration had to be satisfied with $172.</p>
   <p>And, before concluding, permit me to add as a matter of suggestion to some people, to refrain from unnecessary insinuations that some "few" had <span class="page-break">5</span>done away with something, for they might, unwittingly, include some innocent persons. For, after all, no certain individual or certain group has a monopoly of the Court, you know.</p>
