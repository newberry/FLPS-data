   <p>Far, far across the Pacific Ocean, there lies an island unsubdued by Spain and unconquered even by the deadliest weapons of America. It is the second largest island of the Philippines, potentially rich in natural resources. It is the promising rudder of our national ship under the Philippine Commonwealth. It is Mindanao.</p>
   <p>Luzon and Mindanao comprise the North and South extremities of the archipelago, respectively. Naturally, Mindanao is worthy of your attention. It is high time now for us to realize the development of Mindanao so we can be proud of its progress. But what can we do, being far away from our Motherland? Through the instrumentality of a society, we can strive to achieve greater things, by doing small things in a great way.</p>

   <p>At present, we Filipinos from Mindanao, who are now in Chicago, are socially represented under the name of Mindanao Fraternity, organized under the basic human principle, love of mankind and country. It is our inspired aspiration to raise the curtain of the emancipated Philippines.</p>
