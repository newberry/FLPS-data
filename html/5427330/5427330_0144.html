   <p>Independence is on the way!</p>
   <p>Are we preparing ourselves to meet our emblem of power, honor, justice and brotherhood with great interest and solemn salute? If so, are we organizing ourselves for a better and more prosperous Philippines? What do you say of the Sakdalistas who are being branded as communists?</p>
   <p>We are glad to say that our government is democratic. Article III of the Charter of the future Philippine Republic embodies the Bill of Rights. Among them are the rights of protection of life, property, free speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble. In short, this article of our Constitution protects our human liberties.</p>

   <p>The Sakdalistas believe in the strength and benefit derived from an organization and so they formed themselves as a group with principles conforming to our government. To fight against excessive taxation and to oppose a commonwealth form of government are the two outstanding objectives of their organization. Briefly stated the Sakdalistas is a group which was organized with higher Filipino idealism.</p>
   <p>If you know more of the basic principles of the association upon which they are brought together you would not brand them as communist.</p>
