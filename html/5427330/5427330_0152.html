   <p>Important officials of the Filipino Association of Chicago, Inc., are jointly summoned by the Municipal Court of Chicago for a breach of contract. The plaintiff, Francisco Lopez, the editor and publisher of the Filipino Associated Press, had alleged in his declaration that he suffered a loss to the amount of $200 for the breach of the agreement he obtained from Francisco Gonsalez, president; Julio Lorezana, social chairman; and Felisberto Villar, independent chairman, joint defendants to the suit. The signed contract gave to the plaintiff the authority of managing the Rizal day queen contest, which the members did not ratify in the last meeting of the organization.</p>
