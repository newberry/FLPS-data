   <p>The petty jealousies, among ourselves, toward our leaders created some gossip regarding the administration of the United Pangasinanes of Chicago. Each one of these busy bodies is claim to uphold high aims and clamoringly defending the constitution of our club. Our body-politics is dividing us to more party groups; the losing party is flatly opposing the lofty ideas and ideals of our elected president whose outstanding platform is to keep the United Pangasinanes ahead. We must be proud of him wholeheartedly. He is directing us to go forward, to work co-operatively and harmoniously so that we may materialize the constructive policies of the New Deal. That is grand. Let us stand by the New Deal which is for Unity and Prosperity.</p>
   <p>To pull together and stand into one body is the firm policy of our President, Mr. Francisco Gonsalez. He believes in sportmanship. Manfully, he safely manages the affairs of our club amidst quarrelsome friends. Why cannot we follow the footsteps of our disinterested, and farsighted President?</p>
