   <p>Since its inception in the year 1931, the Filipino Community Center has continued its social and welfare activities. Credit is due to the Director and his family and his associates in carrying on intelligently the work and mission of the Filipino Community Center.</p>
   <p>But let us not overlook the role played by the founder and financier of the Community Center, Rev. Jose Deseo and Dr. Hilario Moncado, respectively,---"Sins may be forgiven thee but no God will ever forgive those who break the commandments of gratitude.</p>
   <p>We who are aware and who appreciate the conveniences offered by the Filipino Community Center, express through this medium, our sentiments of gratitude to the members of the Board of Directors, the Chicago Church Federation, and the many American friends who unselfishly render their spiritual guidance.</p>
   <p>Lest we forget, credit for the existence of the institution should be accorded to the spirit of good-will and friendliness of its sponsor, the world's foremost social worker, the late Jane Addams of Chicago.</p>
