   <p>Meet the 1934 Rizal Day orator of the F.A.C., Mr. Mariano Cejavo, a forceful speaker. F.A.C. contest judges unanimously picked him as "Number 1 public speaker". When interviewed "orador" (orator) Cejavo said that this is his third time that he has entered into oratorical contests. Unlike others, who, at the face of defeat, become lukewarm and jelly fish, Cejavo's previous defeats only strengthened his moral stamina giving him courage and patience, and as a result he came out victorious in the recent contest. His piece will be published in our current edition.</p>
