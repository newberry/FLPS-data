   <p>If ever there were need in the world for American leadership in peace-promoting policies and amiable example that need is with us today. We remain a mighty symbol of war-opposing statecraft and unselfish international relations. The question is, can we engender a force for peace strong enough to counterbalance the mischief that is brewing in so many other parts of the world?</p>
   <p>The journeys of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull to South American countries during the momentous conference at Buenos Aires are a significant exemplification of our national hopes and aspirations. We conceive of an American hemisphere so dynamically dedicated to peace and economic amity that it may serve not only to destroy any chance of conflict <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>on this side of the Atlantic, but also to point the way to the rest of the world in terms of enlightened progress without recourse to the second.</p>
   <p>The devils of war are busy with their brew of death in Europe and Asia. The pre-1914 line-up of nations in frictional alliances has again taken form. Dictatorships are grimly intent upon preserving their power and extending their influence at any cost. Land-hungry peoples are crying for expansion and conquest. Nations, smarting under the burdens of war-bred treaties and the mortification of impeded progress, are willing of obtaining some of the spoils and prestige of victory.</p>
   <p>It is not an encouraging picture. The only encouragement is the poverty of the nations most inclined to conflict, but even that might not survive a real or fancied grievance or a sudden unfortunate turn of events. Even at the cost of nation-wide misery, some of these nations are now expanding their armaments to greater and greater strength. When their devil's brew is ready, it will be fatefully served.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Meanwhile we can be proud that the American nations are keeping their own houses in order and thereby making more and more effective the lesson that we hope the world might heed. We preach peace, and we practice it.</p>
