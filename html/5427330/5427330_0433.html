   <p>For the first time in many years 5,500 Filipinos in Chicago are united for a national celebration. Other Philippine organizations throughout the United States contemplated elaborate Commonwealth Inauguration programs. The Filipino Association and the Associated Clubs, in Chicago, united their efforts to stage an inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth here on Sunday, November 3, at the Sherman Hotel, in the form of a banquet and dance.</p>
   <p>The Hon. Michael Igoe, present United States District Attorney of Illinois and formerly representative at large to the United States Congress will be the guest speaker at the banquet. Igoe was one of those who supported the Tydings-McDuffie Act which provides for the independence of the Philippines after a ten year transition period. It is expected that the District Attorney, a sympathizer of the Filipino cause, will give a hint as to the future policies of the United States toward the Philippines.</p>
