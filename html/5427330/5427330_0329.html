   <p>The Filipino Community of Chicago will hold its Third Annual Benefit Dance, at the Majestic Hotel, Sunday, February 9. The center is noted for such events that are above the ordinary, and patrons and guests can always be assured of a delightful time.</p>
   <p>The Center, under Director Antonio A. Gonsalez, is always laboring to make Filipinos respected members of Chicago's citizenry. Every affair that the Center undertook in the past had been aimed to raise the respect of the Filipino in the estimation of the American public, and these affairs have always been outstanding social events of the season.</p>
   <p>Back of this Annual Dance is the desire to increase the institution's usefulness to the public it serves. Proceeds of the social affairs of this organization are always used to meet community needs. Part of the proceeds will go towards the purchase of an oil painting of the hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, and of the greatest living Filipino leader today, President Manuel L. Quezon.</p>
   
   <p>The remainder will go towards general expense to improve and increase the facilities of the organization, in order to meet the growing needs of the community and for that matter the Center's doors swing wide open to welcome any group, Filipino or American, that can make use of the facilities at its command.</p>
   <p>Domingo T. Duga, the insurance man, is making the affair worth something to some lucky individual. There is a $1,000 insurance policy prize for the individual whose luck may shine that evening. This, plus the enjoyment offered, makes the evening memorable.</p>
