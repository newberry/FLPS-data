   <p>A dependent nation cannot be master of her destiny. Being restricted by a sovereign power, a country is absolutely handicapped in natural prosperity.</p>
   <p>The Commonwealth preliminary to our Republic, will render us an opportunity to solve our intricate, domestic and foreign problems.</p>
   <p>It is my sincere hope that Congress will not amend the law that professes to grant us our coveted Independence immediately after the transition period.</p>
