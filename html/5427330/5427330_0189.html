   <p>The 212 Club sponsored a twilight picnic last Wednesday evening at the Clarendon Beach. This was the second picnic the club held this year. The first picnic took place last July 14th. The group decided to meet at 212 West Locust Street, at 5 P.M. It was quite windy and chilly during the later part of the evening.</p>
   <p>Among those who attended were: Rev. F. Laxamana, the sponsor of the club; Mrs. Shull, the chairwoman of the club; Mrs. Aguila, Mrs. Castillo, Mr. Capiz, and Dr. Vega.</p>
   <p>Fire wood was soon gathered and a fire was started to preserve the comfort of the group and most all stayed until twelve midnight.</p>
