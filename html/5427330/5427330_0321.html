   <p>Recently the House of Representative of the United States had enacted into law Bill No. 6466 which provided for the sending of certain Filipinos to their homes.</p>
   <p>The object of the law is probably to help destitute Filipinos. But just how the law will be received remains to be seen. Section 2 of the said act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to contract boats for those who will apply for their passage home. Since the said act does not provide for any specific amount for the carrying out of the good intention of the sponsors of the law, it appears that the Department of Labor has absolute control of funds in the treasury for the above purpose. We only hope that taxpayers will see to it that such money will be really used for the above purpose only.</p>
   <p>The disadvantage of the law is in the provision of section 4, which prohibits any Filipino that have been benefited from this law to come back to this country. This is contrary to civil rights as specified in that sacred-document, the Magna Carta.</p>
   <p>On the whole the law is beneficial to any destitute Filipino and to this country, especially nowadays that we have so many unemployed. It will help in eleminating criminals, who are not all raised to be disastrous to our social welfare but are forced by their present economic conditions.</p>
