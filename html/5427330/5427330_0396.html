   <p>The Evangelistic Institute group of 15 spirited young people rendered a very impressive program led by Mr. M.W. Northfelt, last Sunday afternoon, at the Filipino Community Church, in which Rev. F. Laxamana is the Pastor. The program consisted of a trio of Misses E. Miller, M. Drake and I. Gallagher; stirring testimonies by Misses L. Jessop, M. Ford, M. Philby and G. Patterson; solo by Mr. H. Haines and cellophone music by Miss Plebbis. Their visit was really a great inspiration to every one present, and a spiritual upliftment to some depressed souls. Mrs. R. Romero was all smiles when she heard her pretty niece recite a thrilling testimony for the Lord.</p>
   <p>After the service, the congregation moved to the Social Hall for social "get-together," and the ladies of the church served tea and cookies.</p>
