   <p>The Filipino Circle of Hines, which is supposedly an exclusive club, inaugurated its second dance at the popular Louis XVI Ballroom in the Sherman Hotel last Sunday, with the great intention of displaying an affair of an entirely different character. Because of announcements made through invitations, tickets, newspapers, local as well as continental, people were anxious to see the real outcome of the undertaking. There was lots of fund and enjoyment all right; but so many were utterly disappointed when it turned out to be just another affair. In all dances whether sponsored by small or big clubs, there was always a choice of Miss so-and-so. Estelle Vulin was the chosen Miss Hines Circle for 1936. In her honor she was given a spring dress. Margie Cokos, as the best-dressed girl for the evening, was presented a bouquet of flowers. Tony Datu was considered the best-dressed man.</p>
   <p>For the door prizes; the first prize, a glittering purse, was won by lucky Gladys Espiritu, while the second was received by D.M. Clarin.</p>
