   <p>Poppy Day was a wonderful success. The cooperation that the girls rendered by selling poppies for the Claudio Post 509, was a good turn. Next year all the wives of Filipinos should take part in selling poppies, for this money collected is for a good cause. The Filipino Post took in two hundred dollars and thirty-six cents, this year. "Poppy Day" was more successful financially than last. Next year I am sure we can do better, with the aid of Mr. Jose Leonidas and Mr. B. Ayson.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Ayson, Mr. Jose Leonidas and many others made selling poppies a pleasure.</p>
