   <p>On July fourteenth, Mariano Maramba, twice defeated candidate for the Presidency of the United Pangasinanes, and several others, tried to call a special meeting of the U.P.C., to make a resolution, to impeach the present Chief Executive of the association, but their request was ruled out by provisions in the Constitution and By-Laws. Juan Abriam defended their side but achieved nothing. Her Majesty, Queen Selma Meyers, was among those who opposed them, and Rativo eloquently shouted that the organization of those who wanted to impeach the present chief executive must have been the work of a mastermind.</p>
   <p>Since those who called for a special meeting were technically ruled out by the Constitution, it was agreed to run the group into a caucus meeting. Jorge Frianeza, Mariano Maramba, and Francisco Bernardo were the sponsors of the impeachment idea.</p>
   <p>Frianeza forgot to maintain dignity when he contended that the Pangasinan head was uneducated, and very ignorant of Robert's Rules of Order. Maramba dealt principally on the failure of the President to sign motions passed by the assembly.</p>
   
   <p>The defenders of the president were two outstanding leaders in the community both of which have been elected several times to important offices in the association since its formation. Mariano Espano spoke of the history of the commotion which led to the making of the resolution, while Jose B. Totaan, the most radical thinker of the group (the Editor of this paper) and a legal student of the John Marshall School, spoke very powerfully, analyzing every section of the resolution. He said that the initiators of the resolution were dictatorial men themselves, that they had no faith at all in the appointed officers and they never did give credit to what these officers have already done for the club.</p>
