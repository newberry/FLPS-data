   <p>Today is Memorial Day. Our flags are hoisted, our Army and Navy men are parading in our streets, our orators on the stage are eulogizing brave soldiers who fell in the battlefields, and our people are laying wreaths on the graves of our heroes. All these are dedications to the memory of the dead. It is a day of consecration on our part with the toil, suffering and heroism of every soldier who sacrificed his life under the banner for which he fought. He fought valiantly in every contest, because he wanted our country to be supreme and freed from dis-union, injustice, oppression and corruption, and he surrendered his sacred life with the hope that we have the devotion to preserve peace and order among ourselves.</p>
   <p>These are also the noble aims of our patriots, and they deserve to ennoble our lives with the same spirit that Memorial Day stands for, namely, the unity and preservation of the Republic.</p>
