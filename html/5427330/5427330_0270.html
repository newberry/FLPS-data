   <p>"Does the Filipino want the Filipino Community Center? If so, what program does he wish it to provide? What support can be expected of him?"</p>
   <p>These were the three major question asked by Walter Templeton, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Center, in a recent heated discussion held at the Central Y.M.C.A. here.</p>
   <p>Mr. Templeton and three of his associate board members,Warren Thompson, Publicity Chairman; Stuart D. Krohn, Attorney; and Mrs. Gauge R. Wilson, one of the founders, called the meeting to determine whether or not the Center was needed and if so, whether the Filipinos would support it. In his introductory speech, the Chairman stated that the Center is a great expense to maintain. Money, he said, was taken away from other worthy enterprises for this purpose, but if it <span class="page-break">2</span>is not needed and if it is not supported, he felt it was unfair to continue, since there are so many other worthwhile undertakings waiting to be projected. The members of the board want to know, he further stated, the Filipino sentiments toward the Center.</p>
   <p>IS CENTER WANTED?</p>
   <p>"Do the Filipinos of Chicago want the Center such as it is today, or as it might be?" Mr. Templeton asked the group. "What do you feel its program should be, or what specific advantages do you think it should provide? Do you favor additional social activity? If we can develop such a program as you may suggest, what support can we expect from the Filipino group?"</p>
   <p>The group was urged to offer whatever comments they had. In answer to this <span class="page-break">3</span>challenge, the Reverend Tierra, guest pastor of the Filipino Community Center Church, said:</p>
   <p>"There is no doubt that the Center is needed. There are many clubs in the city, but the Center is the only place where all Filipinos can gather without sectionalism. It gives religion to the people which no other organization does. Because of the interest you Americans have shown in strengthening the Center, it gives encouragement and pride to face the rest of the world."</p>
   <p>CENTER BADLY NEEDED.</p>
   <p>Rustico de Guzman, president of the Katipunan Party of the F.A.C., felt that the Filipino Association of Chicago would not support the Center for a very definite reason. He felt however that the Center was badly needed in this city.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"I am speaking on the behalf of the Zambales Club of Chicago, and I am one hundred per cent for the Filipino Community Center, whoever may be in charge." Dr. Francisco M. Duerme, President of the Zambales Club, stated. "I only hope that more jobs in the Center and bigger pay may be given to the Filipinos so that they can best show their support."</p>
   <p>Julio Lorenzana, Ex-president of the F.A.C., suggested that the Filipino Center should be free from the politics of the city. "It should be the welfare department of all the provincial clubs in this city," he said. He advised the adopting of musical, religious singing, social and religious activities. People crave educational talks, he added.</p>
   <p>"I am for the Center one hundred per cent, but I suggest that the pool hall be <span class="page-break">5</span>abolished entirely", Jarge Frianeza, one of the leaders of the Filipino Junior Assembly, said. "It does not provide the right atmosphere. It is a disgrace to see a poolroom wide open especially on Sundays, directly across from the Moody Bible Institute, where people go to commune with God. I also think the Center should provide occasional lectures."</p>
   <p>"It is hard for Filipinos to get work," he added, "Therefore, I think, an employment department should be run. The Center lacks a homelike atmosphere. Why couldn't we start a club, which would provide books, lectures, and comfortable chairs? We could charge the members five dollars as annual dues. If we got one hundred members, that would amount to over one thousand dollars a year."</p>
   <p>Mr. Templeton interceded, "A thousand dollars would go a long way, further than the Filipinos have yet gone."</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Mr. Frianeza explained that the proposed club would be apart from the Center. It was not decided just how this would affect the non-members.</p>
   <p>Francisco A. Lopez, publisher of the Associated Filipino and Oriental Press, wondered why the Filipinos could not give a part of what they spend on social functions to the Center. Other suggestions are: A department for women; the combining of all the Filipinos' organizations in the city under the Center; offering courses in psychology; developing a children's department; and introducing athletics.</p>
   <p>CANNOT ACT IMMEDIATELY.</p>
   <p>"Since these are just suggestions," the chairman concluded, "we cannot expect to carry each one out. However, those that the board consider most practical <span class="page-break">7</span>and possible, we will undertake. Do not expect us to do this immediately, however, but gradually we shall make the Center as you wish. We have a different outlook upon the situation after this talk with you, and we now realize that you, speaking for your groups, want the Center. If the Filipinos do not give it their support, it cannot exist."</p>
