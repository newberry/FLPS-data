   <p>The Zambales Club, Inc., had invited Mayor Kelly of Chicago as a guest for the Quezon-Osmena victory dance which was held last Sunday at the Midland Club. But due to the pressure of duties, the Mayor instead sent to Hon. Carl H. Lundouist to represent him. The guest stressed the fact that Chicago is a great city, which is composed of a mass of races of which the Filipino people are a part. He was praised and cheered several times by the audience, especially when he emphatically voiced the Mayor's best wishes for the brightest future of Quezon-Osmena Administration.</p>
