   <p>Mr. Duga, President of the Big V. Club and district manager of the Ohio State Life Insurance Co., in spite of the depression, has, this year, written insurance business to the extent of $291,187. As in the past, Mr. Duga has again demonstrated his ability in this line of business to his superiors in his company. This entitles him to a reserved seat in the Ohio State Life Insurance Underwriter's Convention, to be held next month in Columbus Ohio.</p>
