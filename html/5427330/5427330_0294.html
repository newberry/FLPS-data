   <p>In 1932 The Pangasinan Association of Chicago was united becoming the United Pangasinanes of Chicago, Inc. What does it mean? What is its significance? First, the United Pangasinanes of Chicago Inc., have been placed on a level of higer social morality clothed with an atmosphere of voluntary cooperation; second, social consciousness has been developed and is growing among the members; third, some of the difficulties of the members were remedied through collective action by the faithful members.</p>
   <p>Let us stand for the spirit of 1932. Let us put all our members on a higher level of social morality. Let us put faith in our hearts and in our individual consciousness. If the individual member of the United Pangasinanes Club is a rational being, and if the United Pangasinanes is an institution created by human beings, it will have weaknesses: (1) From 1932 to 1933 we donated more than $40.00 for the deceased outside our group, and for the unemployed, yet we have entirely forgotten our own sons and daughters. (2) Since the foundation of the United Pangasinanes of Chicago, Inc., we have appropriated money every year for the expenditures of all the departments, yet we failed to appropriate even $1.00 for milk for the sons and daughters of our members. Is that just?</p>
   <p>Members of the United Pangasinanes: Let us be kind to our sons and daughters by giving them something that is worth while to remember, something that gives them vigor so that they will become strong men and women in the future. In the last regular meeting of the United Pangasinanes of Chicago, Inc., I introduced a resolution to provide for the withdrawal of $58.00 for milk for the sons and daughters of our members. The resolution was discussed, and it was tabled for the next regular meeting. I expressed my sympathy in the name of the children of our members, but some of the so-called leaders opposed me. The first opponent of the resolution said that it would be an insult to our parents if the United Pangasinanes Club should give them $2.00 each for milk. The second opponent of the resolution said that such a proposal was unconstitutional; and the third argument was expressed in such a way as to change the entire character of the resolution. May God help the Children! Let us not be fooled by these leaders.</p>
   
   <p>Let us be open-minded, let us solve our problems with pure hearts and deeper thinking. When we appropriate money for the deceased, and for the unemployed, although they were not members of our club, nobody said that it was an "insult" to their parents. When we withdrew money from the Treasury of the club for prizes, not one of these leaders said that it was an "insult" to the parents. If the members of the United Pangasinanes are rational beings, and if the United Pangasinanes Club is an organization of men of high-moral character, then the United Pangasinanes Club has the right to provide the children support, build their moral structure, and it should perform its duty toward its children.</p>
   <p>Friends, do not forget our unification in 1932; remember the spirit of 1932; bear in mind that the United Pangasinanes was organized for a good reason and for a high purpose: "TO PROMOTE OUR COMMON WELFARE," etc. There is a time to keep silence, and a time to speak. Now, it is the time for me to speak for the welfare of the children of our members, who have worked hard under the sun and in the rain for the support of the United Pangasinanes Club of Chicago, Inc. Dear Leaders, do not make a movement which tends to lose the interest and confidence of every one.</p>
   
   <p>If you cannot build a monument for your children give them charity if you please. "And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and though I have faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." If you are free from the law and free from moral obligation and moral responsibility you are nothing.</p>
   <p>The Filipinos were the first Christian people in the Orient. President Wilson said, "The only way your powers can become great is by exerting them outside the circle of your narrow, special, selfish interest." No man is a true Christian who does not think constantly of how he can assist his friends, how he can enlighten mankind, how he can make virtue the rule of conduct in the circle in which he lives.</p>
