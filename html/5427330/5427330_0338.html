   <p>Sherman Hotel, Chicago, June 16, (Special to the Associated Filipino Press). The heavy rain and strong wind did not dampen the ardent enthusiasm of the Filipino population in Chicago and their many friends. They arrived by the car loads just the same. Taxis and privately owned cars filled up with energetic young Filipinos and their charming lady friends immaculately dressed, arrived early and late. Quite a job for the Sherman Hotel door men and the elevator operators. It was the night of the International Dinner held under the auspices of the Filipino Community Center.</p>
