   <p>In Chicago, a young Filipino who is practically managing the dining room in an institution, with several workers under him, sneers at the lack of ambition in his countrymen who are content to work as carpenters in furniture shops or to set up small barber shops, restaurants, cafeterias, and pool rooms for their own countrymen. In the same city, a Filipino journalist, with a steady job on a large daily paper, complains that in the local business houses Filipino clerks, even when they have graduated from schools of commerce, are not admitted to the better jobs; and that many who have educationally qualified themselves for a profession have to engage in domestic and club employments.</p>
