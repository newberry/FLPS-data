   <p>The formation of the Philippine Commonwealth has created many hazardous problems for a Filipino in the United States. Day by day he notices that the "father and son" affinity of Philippine and the United States is being slowly swayed into a "stronger" relation. No longer can a Filipino feel that he is in His guardian's home. Little by little the fatherly love of the United States is being turned into contempt.</p>
   <p>Reports from the Post Office Department of Uncle Sam, tells us that a Filipino can no longer apply for a position in that department and they are even trying their best to eradicate those that have been employed there for a number of years. This case is also identical to our information from the Navy Department. And again, the only privilege of being able to practice law in some of the states in the Union, is being critically discussed, and it seems that the favorably opinion is on the negative side. Ever since the Filipinos, except those that served in the Army or Navy, cannot become a citizen of the United States, yet a white alien can be.</p>
   <p>These are brought to light, a reminder and incentive to see that the Filipino's rights and privileges are being slowly trodden. There's no possible alternative but to fight and demand that not until a Filipino will not owe allegiance to the United States will he stop thinking that he should be and must be treated and protected as he used to be, before enactment and formation of the Philippine Commonwealth Government.</p>
   <p>This is a challenge to all Filipinos who possess merit and means in this country, that instead of fighting one another they must unite into one body and fight as one body against those demanding to curtail their prerogatives.</p>
