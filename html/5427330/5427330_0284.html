   <p>"A Grand Opening"</p>
   <p>By J. P. Bravo.</p>
   <p>The warming party for the opening of the Big V Clubhouse last Sunday, July the fourteenth, was well attended. The three story building, which was decorated with the best furniture, was packed with guests. The recreation hall was filled with billiard and table tennis players and interested spectators; the dining room was crowded with diners; the exhibition hall was loaded with curious lookers of Philippine goods, and the dance hall was at its height with music and fun till parting hour.</p>
   <p>The program aroused the interest of the guests. Mr. McCann of the Chicago Post Office and Mrs. Montezon sang a duet; Miss Caroll Moreno showed talent in her tap dancing; Attorney George Killenger, a corporation lawyer and the attorney of the Big V Clubhouse, delivered a short talk and emphasized the need of a Clubhouse for social contact and social development of the Filipino. He wished the Big V Club members a successful future; Philip J. Kieffer, President of the International Executive Association of America, spoke also on the hospitality of Filipinos. After the short program was finished, dancing was continued.</p>
