   <p>The Japanese along the Pacific Coast have some troubles, too, although not as many as the Filipinos. One which is bothering Japanese leaders at present is that caused by the passing of the Exclusion Act.</p>
   <p>Congress passed the Act while approximately 40,000 Japanese were at home visiting. Many of these people have businesses along the Coast. They cannot return although they have been trying to ever since. Mr. Quido, an able Japanese lawyer and an American citizen, with the cooperation of other Japanese leaders are trying to see whether or not they could influence members of Congress to press a law allowing these individuals to come back. Although the odds against such possibility are tremendous, they have hope that Congress will relent - which might also result in a strengthening of closer international relationship between the great powers of the Pacific. Mr. Quido is also hoping that all Japanese who served in the United States navy will be allowed to become citizens of the United States - which might be probable.</p>

   <p>Japanese leaders, possibly to strengthen this cause, are trying to raise a question, why the Filipinos are allowed to enter the United States since the Philippines are within the boundaries specified in the Exclusion Act. However, the Philippines are not yet independent, they still owe their allegiance to the United States, and anything can happen with the ten years transition period. In 1946, there might not be another Mr. Roosevelt, and the Philippines might go back to the old Philippine Islands Possession of the United States, so good friends and neighbors, have nothing to worry about in such a quota.</p>
