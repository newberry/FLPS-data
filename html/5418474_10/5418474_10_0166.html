   <p>Senator Horace Waite asked that the message of the Governor of Illinois should be printed not only in English but also in German. The decision of the new State Constitution that all official documents should be published in English is taken word for word from the old Constitution.</p>
   <p>Now under the old Constitution, all the official documents were also published in German. Sufficient proof that this was not considered as being in violation of the Constitution.</p>
   <p>Of the seven state senators from Cook County, the American senators, Williamson, Waite and Dew, voted for the publication of official documents in foreign languages, while Senators Reynolds and Thompson and the Irish, McGrath and Kehoe, voted against it.</p>
