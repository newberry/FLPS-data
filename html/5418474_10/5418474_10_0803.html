   <p>The purpose and aims of the Central-Unions of the German-American Military Organizations consist in fostering fellowship among the members, in cultivating the German language and German customs, and in arranging German public festivals. We repudiate the accusation that we are chiefly concerned about the German Emperor or Bismarck.</p>
   <p>The Central Union consists at this time of 13 military organizations. It has merited the recognition of all German-Americans in Chicago. Since they enjoy the good will of the German population, they should undertake things which are of profound interest to the Germans in Chicago. We should have an annual "German Day," which would, undoubtedly, receive the support of all Germans in Chicago and in the state of Illinois.</p>
