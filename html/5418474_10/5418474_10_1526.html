   <p>The new and beautiful church of the Evangelical St. Paul's Congregation, at the corner of Orchard Street and Kemper's Place, has been dedicated yesterday to its noble purpose in an appropriate and up-ligting manner. It was a day of honor for the faithful congregation whose self-sacrifices had made the erection of a house of worship possible. It is a worthy monument of German aspirations and power of faith.</p>
