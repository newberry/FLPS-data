   <p>At the second meeting of the Missouri Synod's Illinois district, Professor Krauss from St. Louis held a lecture about "Israel in the Desert". Pastor Kohn, President of the Mission Committee, gave a report about the gratifying progress of the work, in the Illinois district. Upon recommendation of the board, to deliberate about the separation of the district, the Synod resolved unanimously, for reasons set forth by the committee, to act upon the division of the district into three parts: South, Middle, and Northern Illinois. A committee was elected to confer about all questions pertaining to the division and to report to the Synod.</p>
