   <p>that period of strife, and thus we find a large contingent emigrating to America, and particularly to the then thriving, rapidly growing Chicago.</p>
   <p>In 1874, Joseph Schlenker, the present honorary president of the Club, called upon all comrades at arms to help found a veterans club, and twenty-one former soldiers of the war of 1866 [Austro-German War] and 1870-71, [Franco-German War,] presented themselves at the "Old Quincy No. 9," a hostelry owned by Felix Schanz, which was the favorite meeting place of Chicago's Germans. Here it was that the German Veterans' Club originated. At the first session, it was decided that not only veterans, but anyone who wore the Kaiser's uniform [soldiers and officers who did not participate in wars. Translator] should be eligible.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>On December twentieth, five additional members entered the ranks, among them John J. Corleis, honorary member who still lives.</p>
   <p>Of the original founders, only J. Schlenker is alive. At the general session in 1924, when preparations were considered for the present festival, he was elected honorary president for life.</p>
   <p>It soon became apparent that the tree was planted in fertile soil. After a short time, the membership increased, which proved of benefit to the treasury. From a modest capital of thirty dollars, the fund grew to large proportions. The Club's quarters at Felix Schanz's soon proved inadequate, and it became necessary to move to Kaltenbach's hall, 55 North Clark Street. After a short time, even this location could not cope with the increasing demand for additional space, and after several changes of address, the Club finally found permanent <span class="page-break">\4</span>quarters at the Lincoln Turner Hall.</p>
   <p>In 1916 there were 331 members, but the World War period brought about a considerable decrease in membership. Thus in 1917 only 269 members were registered and this number shrank to a mere 241 in 1918. In recent years new veterans, soldiers of the World War, came to our shores, and this increased the membership list by a hundred and fifty.</p>
   <p>The young founders longed for a beautiful flag, and understandable yearning, but the funds could not quite cope with the situation, and therefore a petition was sent to the former Emperor Wilhelm I. But the answer and pretty present proved a protracted proposition. Great was their joy however, when in December, 1876, the erstwhile German consul brought the welcome news that the Kaiser had acceded to their wish. On December third a festive dedication was proclaimed and Chicago's larger clubs came in full numbers. Even today this emblem is regarded as a precious relic <span class="page-break">\5</span>which is still preserved in the Club's banner repository.</p>
   <p>The Deutsche Kriegerverein of Chicago [German Veterans Club] soon became known throughout America, and wherever German war veterans or soldiers met, new clubs were organized after the pattern of the Chicago association. In order to unite all these clubs into a single group, the German Veterans' Alliance of North America was formed, and many organizations of the West and Northwest became affiliated with it. The greater affinity thus provided was strengthened by reciprocal visits and correspondence.</p>
   <p>The old records give accounts of extensive festivities. One of especial splendor was the silver jubilee celebration of August 14-15, 1899, at the North Side Turner Hall. It was at this festival, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Club that the <span class="page-break">\6</span>former president J. Schlenker received the Crown Medal, Fourth Class, from Emperor Wilhelm II, and the Fredric Medal, Second Class, from the King of Wuertemberg, both decorations being presented by the German consul, a significant honor for the entire Club.</p>
   <p>A singing section was also contemplated and finally organized. Today it boasts of forty-two singers.</p>
   <p>Member Visits Bismarck</p>
   <p>On April 1, 1895, the Club celebrated the 80th birthday of Bismarck, the "Iron Chancellor." A resolution was passed nominating the Fuerst [Bismarck's German title. Tr.] as honorary member, and the former president of the Association, Joseph Schlenker, was requested to give the diploma personally to the Iron Chancellor. And so <span class="page-break">\7</span>Schlenker, as well as Club members and their families, left for Germany, where the American visitors were most cordially received.</p>
   <p>During the fall parade, when the Berlin troops marched on the Tempelhof Field, the Americans were given a place of honor, the Kaiser welcoming the German veterans from America in a hearty manner.</p>
   <p>Then followed the memorable reception in Friedrichsruhe [Fredric's Rest], where the visitors met the aged Chancellor, Fuerst Bismarck, and the dedicatory services at the Kaiser Wilhelm-Gedaechtniskirche [Memorial Church] in Berlin, and finally, the historical jubilee plays of the Leipzig military clubs. These had been produced before, but were repeated in honor of the American guests. All these incidents have been indelibly impressed in the minds of the participants. The Club is in possession of a handwritten, autographed note, signed by its honorary member Fuerst Otto von Bismarck, which is also carefully <span class="page-break">\8</span>preserved as a cherished memento.</p>
   <p>In the Service of Brotherly Love</p>
   <p>In the beginning of the World War, the Club functioned almost entirely in the field of benevolence, collecting donations for the Red Cross. During the terrible post war period, the Club was instrumental in filling many a little stomach and mitigating considerable sorrow and distress.</p>
   <p>As time progressed, many members were nominated to honorary ranks in recognition of their valuable work for the Club. Among the still living, we list the following: Herr Heinrich Krukenberg, of Nurenberg; Mayor Sauerborn, of Montabauer; Mr. Adam Ortseifen, of Chicago; Comrade Joseph Schlenker, founder and honorary president of the Cluh; John D. Corleis, co-founder; Count Johann von Bernstorf, former German <span class="page-break">\9</span>ambassador in Washington; Horace Brand, of Chicago; Comrade O.K. Wille, Royal Music director, leader of the Tsingtau [China] Band #3; etc. [Twelve names are listed. Translator.]</p>
   <p>The festivities in connection with the Club's golden jubilee also combine the thirtieth anniversary of the German Veterans Alliance's delegation of North America.</p>
   <p>Through the courtesy of Wilhelm Schmidt, president of the Riverview Park Company, one of the oldest regular, as well as honorary, members of the Club, the festival committee was given all necessary space gratuitously. The festival Committee of the Central Alliance of our local military clubs, which is responsible for the arrangements of the Alliance's festival, as well as the Festival Committee of the Veterans Club, which celebrates its golden anniversary, co-operate in their work, and therefore a splendid celebration may be expected.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>The only founder of the German Veterans Club still living is Joseph Schlenker. Regardless of his advanced age, he is still very active in club affairs, and as a sequence to the golden jubilee he has been nominated honorary president for the remainder of his declining years.</p>
   <p>In memory of this exceptional festival, golden club-emblems have been designed and will be given to all members. An artistically and highly embellished complete history of the Club has been published, the work of George Meyer, secretary of long standing. He also functions in the same official capacity for the German Veterans Alliance of North America. Extensive illustrations and much interesting matter about the Club's early struggles are presented in the book.</p>
