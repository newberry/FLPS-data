   <p>About ten or twelve weeks ago I read a short article in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, a reprint of the Philadelphia Democrat, about this interesting subject which, in a broad sense, encompasses the future of the entire American nation. Some of the basic elements were but briefly described. It was stated on the strength of the census of 1880, which accredits us with a population of fifty million people, that the following nationalities comprise the total: Anglo-Saxons, about 12,500,000; Celts, 15,250,000; Germans, 13,500,000; Dutch and Scandinavians, 1,000,000; those of mixed nationality, 8,000,000. This shows that the Irish are most numerous here, followed by the Germans and Anglo-Saxons. Thus, if the majority were the predominating feature, we would then have to regard America as an Irish and German nation rather than one of Anglo-Saxon <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>origin. But the simple, logical inference is that the various old European peoples are actually fashioning an entirely new nationality--the Americans--and in the process one finds the most varied and remarkable mixtures, combinations, involvements and developments. Thus, the Anglo-Saxons combine with the Celts, then with the Germans; and, in turn, the Celts with the Germans oppose the Anglo-Saxons. The latter occurs mostly because of a more liberal attitude in religious matters and life in general. In politics the powerful, decisive spirit of the Anglo-Saxons asserts its leadership and manifests itself in public affairs--seeking followers and votes among the Celts and, at times, the Germans. Most of the credit for the improvement of our social life by popularizing music and singing, as well as the moderate, jovial, and respectable attitudes toward life, goes to the Germans, who seek followers among the Anglo-Saxons and Celts.</p>
   <p>In a similar manner, though based on different figures, any number of predictions have been made regarding the eventual physiognomic development of the American <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>people. In giving the following observations I shall not rely on figures, because they are not reliable--at least not at present--when mixed nationals are concerned; however, I shall try to make a few contributions which may serve at a later time when a more thorough search into the question becomes an issue--that is, to what extent we are able to foretell the future appearance (physiognomy) of the American people.</p>
   <p>First of all, one should realize that there exists no definite plan for the development of a more or less homogeneous nationality consisting of various inhabitants living under one form of government, and that there are no special conditions which are irrefutable, aside from the association of such peoples for centuries, involving suffering and fighting for mutual interests. There need be no common understanding, that is, concurrence in religious dogmas and political convictions, nor does the same language or origin play a predominant part, as long as linguistic expressions are comprehensible and within the realm of the same race, because Negroes or Caucasians and Mongols cannot be <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>converted into a uniform nationality within a thousand years. However, Switzerland and even our own country already show that certain positive characteristics, recognizable in their main trend, can be established--proving that a definite, identifiable nationality can develop irrespective of fundamentally divergent religious creeds and political views, and regardless of a different language or descent. In the formation of such a unified, definite nationality, a long period of historical developing elapsed, which involved dangers averted by mutual assistance; generally recognized interests affecting all; tremendous conflicts in which the majority was embroiled before they were brought to a happy conclusion; and participation by the intelligent as well as by the wealthy part of our population in endeavors to protect the acquired lands against extraneous enemies and internal attempts at secession. The "brotherly affection," concerning which so much nonsense has been written, had practically nothing to do with the formation of this great nation, particularly in its later phases. Brotherly sentiment between South Carolinians and Yankees, or Germans and Irish, is hardly feasible in the United States; yet, <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>one can readily realize that all contributed their share--according to capacity and sentiment--in fashioning the American nation, and that they supported one another staunchly during intervals of mutual danger.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, insofar as modern cultured nations are concerned, there are the Germans, French, Italians, English, and Americans whose idiosyncracies one can never think of as being so completely absorbed that they may be considered a single family group of millions with resemblances in appearance as well as in character. Thus, one finds that equality before the law, universal franchise, liberality, civil marriage, abolition of provincial constitutions, general penal codes and statutes, the negation of class privileges based on birth, equal weights and measures, and universally adopted administrative principles, help but little; and, even if people are allowed to change their abode within a state at will, it must be remembered that only a negligible fraction moves about, regardless of all conceivable provisions for equalization, including the most rapid as well as the most convenient modes of transportation. Man's tendency to remain <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>rooted to the spot, his sense of being set apart by wealth, education, habit, and tradition continues in undiminished force. No thorough study is necessary to reach such a conclusion. In a rapid journey, for instance, from some point on the southern boundary of Germany [it could be Switzerland or Austria, or both] to Oldenburg, East Prussia or Denmark, or from any part on the southwestern end [France and Switzerland] to Eastern Germany [near Poland] one may readily observe from the facial formation of the people, their body structures, their sentiments and mentality, as well as the deeply ingrained habits and customs, what almost unlimited differences exist among the Germans, regardless of the ineradicable national character of those people. One meets such contrasts as a highly cultured language and a deplorable dialect of the most vulgar variety; smooth, clean-cut countenances or well-groomed beards as against shaggy adornments reminiscent of a pug dog or even the poodle variety; then one perceives thin lips as well as veritably beastlike snouts which just make no sense. Thereupon, follow stylish apparel and ancestral fashion; liberality in religious matters and the other extreme, the almost obsolete superstitions of the backwoods <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>charcoal burners; participation or interest in public affairs on one side, and on the other, an almost complete indifference; and finally on one hand, a life where the intellectual phases predominate presents itself, and, on the other, a sensual life, worthless and blunted in its attitude toward existence.</p>
   <p>Indeed, to this very hour it is true that the unity of the German people (beyond the alliance of the separate states and the recent achievement, a war won as the result of unification), manifests itself in the common trends of the mind, the sentiments and ambitions of the intellectuals; in the honor which a nation bestows upon men like Schiller, Goethe, and Alexander von Humboldt; in the respect accorded to Emperor Wilhelm; and in the concern expressed in Bismarck's moods, rather than in any affection for related Germanic tribes, or In any similarity of customs, moral views, preferences or prejudices to be found in the peoples that make up this nation. Even at present one perceives tremendous differences among members of the same caste; thus, we have the example of the Hannoverian or Prussian aristocracy's feeling ashamed of the Bavarian blue-blooded stock; <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>and thus, a medlar and an orange show more similarity than preachers of Cologne and Ingolstadt or Passau. Yet, regardless of all this, the Germans represent a unified, solid, undivided nation.</p>
   <p>It is also irrefutably shown that a few outstanding characteristics of the mixture--as we recognize it today--will never be entirely obliterated. We know that the longing for liberty asserts itself more prominently in a mixed people than in a nation with a homogeneous population; that the necessity of associating with various nationalities, which proves obnoxious to the older group because of the differing habits and views of the later arrivals, usually results in bringing peace and harmony, because it usually becomes apparent that the most detested factors were only matters of minor importance, and that the superficial peculiarities of the "strangers" did not preclude the possession of dominant virtues and qualities destined to benefit the community. Thus, we find an exchange of knowledge results, while inconsequentials will be eliminated during the labors and fever heat entailed by new conditions. In this manner, for <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>instance, religion has been eliminated from American life as a triviality. Laws were not responsible for this development, which resulted from the mingling of people who subscribed to the most divergent beliefs, and the laws which advocated tolerance were the consequence of worldly views as well as genuine convictions favoring religious liberty. All sects are exclusive, but the demand for political freedom could transcend these boundaries and the supreme law of the land was enabled to enact provisions stipulating noninterference in religious dogmas. I do not believe that the American people can ever be propagandized into becoming fanatical followers of any specific doctrine. In a similar manner, probably by the exclusion of the impossible, some phases of the future character of the American people may be deduced; but one can never progress beyond generalities. The picture, which we form today, with a Yankee or Creole in mind, cannot help us gain an inkling regarding the eventual appearance of our people, since general characteristics do not suffice; and, as definite delineations are required, which can be observed only in the present, one can thereby draw conclusions for the present only.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Naturally, now the question will be asked: Will the Americans ever become such a standardized people that a single illustration could depict the type? To this I can answer: Regardless of the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various districts, one will be able to make such a picture at some future time, just as we, today, produce an illustration of a German, Frenchman, or Italian, although none of these nations consist of similar units, and some of the neighboring residents resemble the people across the boundary rather than their own nationals. From definite lines one can always construct a clear likeness, notwithstanding how manifold such demarkations may be; but when positive indications are lacking then it will be impossible to produce a similarity. However, many considerations lead us to believe that the Americans will merge into a more stable human variety than most of our present racial stocks. The early colonists showed unusual adaptability and ability to become assimilated, and now it appears as if the two strongest immigrant groups of recent times, the Germans and the Irish, show particular interest in being quickly and completely absorbed, which induces them to give but little resistence to the forces <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>of unification.</p>
   <p>As the human race continues in existence more and more light is thrown upon the past; but it seems increasingly difficult to predict the future. Time has swallowed the period known as "yesterday" which has in it but a single possibility, and the events of the past represent reality. This reality may be highly involved, but at least the most brilliant minds can discern the incidents. The future consists of countless possibilities--according to the capacity of an individual's comprehension--and the only probability which will develop into something tangible can, at best, be conjectured only by a comparison with analogous incidents; what actually will occur cannot be ascertained. This is why it is impossible, at this time, to produce a likeness of our eventual Americans--to depict the future, five hundred or a thousand years hence. We know that in the present-day France one may still discern the same types which Caesar found in Gaul; the Belgians and Celts, whose physiological marks of differentiation are classified as roundheaded and longheaded, as dark-and <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>light-haired, as well as blue-eyed, continue in spite of constant mixtures for eighteen centuries; even a reversion to the original form manifests itself occasionally. It is established that the Celtic element in France predominated from the very beginning; but at Caesar's time only a fool could have predicted how the Celts in France would appear when compared with their tribal members in England and Ireland after a lapse of eighteen hundred years. By this same reasoning one may predict what the future American will be like--by declaring that the typical forms of the three largest groups of immigrants, the Anglo-Saxons, the Germans and Irish, will always be recognizable. However, their relative strength, and the more important factor, what effect they will have upon one another, cannot even be guessed with any degree of accuracy. The political instinct, the organizational ability, and the daring aggressiveness --if not ruthlessness--of the Anglo-Saxons may easily be tempered or even eradicated by the more basic moral concepts of the Germans; indeed, the mere numerical superiority of the Irish may at times be considered insurmountable insofar as the nervous activity of the Yankees and the noble sentiments of the <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>Germans are concerned. Still, the picture of Sais becomes more deeply veiled, when the separate characteristic marks are at issue, when these three elements [Irish, English and German] are exposed to further attrition and mixing for another two hundred years.</p>
   <p>No sensible person will attempt to delineate the appearance of our future inhabitants; but, anyone thinking about the subject must perceive the peculiarities of a heterogeneous people, such as ours, as they have been manifested since the beginning--and this period may be any time since the discovery of the new continent. In this original composition one finds the future character of the American people. Let us exclude the Chinese and the Negroes from the composite picture of the American people. I assume that the Chinese will never migrate (or be permitted to come) to this country in such numbers as to influence greatly the character of the population, and that the Negroes--as an entirely different and inferior race--will eventually disappear, or nearly so, before they can imprint a definite mark upon the entire population; although <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>in the South a local type developed. Excepting these two peoples, the population of the United States consists of the Caucasian race, refined to a great degree and capable of the highest mental development with its characteristic mark: a high, almost vertical forehead wherein the entire globe may be reflected within another world of thought and imagination. All branches of the Caucasian race are capable of equal intellectual attainment; some offshoots progressed faster in their entire development, while others excelled in certain phases. Probably by excepting the Slavs one finds that the most erudite and eminent men of all occidental countries--Greeks, Italians, French, English, Danes, Swedes, Swiss, and Germans--reach about the same cultural level; but this involves different epochs, although one or another nation may have had a greater advantage due to a larger population.</p>
   <p>In the United States nearly all people of the white races are furthering the progress of the nation; however, the Anglo-Saxon element has the lead, because of early colonization as well as traits which were particularly suitable for <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>pioneers; besides, a larger number of highly cultured individuals belonged to that group. A reversion to barbarism as it existed in any conceivable race is, therefore, unthinkable here; but it is also impossible to foretell the configuration--the separate lines or shading--of future generations.</p>
   <p>In sketching these problems I purposely omitted all political complications. I have not forgotten that the Americans are usually regarded as a political people and that such a complex [political] may be as important a part of the Anglo-Saxon's nature or religion, as music is a part of the German's creed, or as the preference for the tangible, trivial and temporary is predominantly a part of the Irish. I shall never change my belief that goodness and magnanimity will eventually produce greater accomplishments and be more effective than intelligence and scheming. Good morals are also sensible attitudes, and the most daring, conniving, political machinations will be subdued and controlled by ethics. The triumphs of politics are fleeting and of short duration; but morality celebrates its attainments in the improvement of <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>mankind throughout the centuries. Therefore, I do not doubt, even for an instant, the tremendous effect which the German population is destined to exert upon the composite development of the American people. This influence--more profound than the continuance of the German language or this or that unusual situation in which one is apt to find himself particularly at present--must be ascribed to the struggle for existence; the continued association between millions of members of a cultural people with its deeply rooted moral instincts and Anglo-Saxons of a nervous, chiefly one-sided temperament; and, the short-lived, restrained, mean-spirited Irish population, eking out a livelihood while worrying mostly about food. The Germans are made of too enduring a material to be crushed by the upper and nether millstones of the Anglo-Saxon and Hibernian population. The corners and edges will be rounded off, so that they [the Germans] will fit easily in places into which they formerly could not even squeeze.</p>
   <p>Pure Teutonic blood still flows in the veins of children born here, the descendants of Germans; but this offspring is already a native American, secure from the attritive action of the millstones.</p>
