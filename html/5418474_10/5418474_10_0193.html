   <p>"To the editor of the Sonntagpost.</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"In the name of the Schlesische Verein (Silesian Association) of Chicago permit me to submit to you the translation of a petition addressed to the Senate Committee for Foreign Affairs, protesting against the annexation of Upper Silesia by Poland. Our decision to take this step was prompted by the cablegram of your Berlin representative, which was published September 10 in the Abendpost. This is the first protest of German-American citizens against certain provisions of a peace treaty dictated by hatred and greed for territory. We hope it will also be the last one.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"I beg you to publish the petition in its entirety and remain</p>
   <p>"Yours truly,</p>
   <p>"Fritz Schoepke,</p>
   <p>"President of the Schlesische Verein of Chicago."</p>
   <p>As the first of the organizations of American citizens of German descent, the Schlesische Verein of Chicago has entered a protest against certain provisions of the peace treaty. It is a reaction to the cablegram of our Berlin representative, published in the Abendpost on September 10, in which Upper Silesia, deeply distressed, appealed to the sense of justice of the world at large.</p>
   <p>As we all know, a major part of Silesia is to fall to Poland immediately, according to the terms of the treaty, whereas the future nationality of another part is to be determined by plebiscite.</p>
   <p>The case of Silesia shows most clearly how little consideration is given in the peace treaty to a program point announced at the Paris conference, namely, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>that each country should be ruled in accordance with the wishes of its populace. Just that particular portion, which, according to the decree of the present distributors of territory, is to be incorporated into Poland, is German to the core and has been so for almost nine hundred years.</p>
   <p>From an ethnographical point of view, the incorporation of Silesia into Poland would seem to be as justifiable as a union of Texas with Mexico. A population which for dozens of generations had been German, is nevertheless supposed to swear allegiance, all of a sudden, to the white eagle in the red field. Can we, therefore, be surprised that their hearts cry out in a distress so outraged and so appealing that even the victorious enemies should lend a sympathetic ear and reconsider their apparently inhuman decision?</p>
   <p>The petition, which was submitted to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee by United States Senator Medill McCormick, rightly emphasizes the fact that German-Americans, just like Irish-Americans, Serbian-Americans, Armenian-Americans, Polish-Americans, etc., have the inalienable right to intercede on behalf of their <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>native land. This right has been augmented rather than diminished by the fact that America was Germany's adversary, and that German-Americans, too, have fought against her and have helped the United States to gain victory. German-Americans, more than any others are justified in defending the interests of their old as well as their adopted country and in voicing their protest against measures designed to place almost unsurmountable obstacles in the way of reassumption and maintenance of friendly relations. And this first step on behalf of Silesia should not be the last one.</p>
   <p>The Petition</p>
   <p>"To the Honorable Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate of the United States,</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"American citizens of German descent were among the first citizens of foreign birth to fight America's battles, to contribute to the cost of war, and to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>alleviate the sufferings caused by the gigantic struggle of nations.</p>
   <p>"Motivated by the desire to show their gratitude to their adopted country and to serve the cause of democracy, they trusted implicitly the assurances of the highest officials of the United States that the peace terms to be formulated at the end of the war would be dictated by justice, humaneness, and by the spirit of reconciliation. While fighting for America's cause, citizens of German descent clung to the belief that although defeated, the German people who were driven into the war by an autocratic government would have reason to be grateful to them.</p>
   <p>"But instead of the anticipated peace terms, ambition, greed, and hatred have dictated a treaty which is designed to be the foundation, rather than the end of future wars; a treaty which expresses the mentality of savages, namely, that a defeated enemy has no right to mercy.</p>
   <p>"At a time when the honorable members of your Committee have been ready and <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>willing to listen to intercessions made by American citizens on behalf of Egypt, India, Ireland, and other countries of which they are descendants, may not we, too, American citizens of German extraction, respectfully suggest that you give expression, in some form or manner, to the true American spirit of fairness, and listen to our intercession for the land of our birth, and to the cries of the unfortunate population of Upper Silesia.</p>
   <p>"Although the peace treaty provides that the future nationality of Upper Silesia is to be decided by a plebiscite of the people, other parts of the province, such as Grosswartenberg, Namslau, and Gurauh, have been ceded to Poland without such formality. These districts have been populated almost exclusively by Germans since the year 1163; their soil has been drenched by the blood, the tears, and the sweat of Germans, and even the tombstones in the cemeteries give mute testimony to this fact. A Polish name rarely appears among the many hundreds of names of German sound and origin.</p>
   <p>"Finally, permit us to add that even if Poland should obtain the possession of <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>these territories, Upper Silesia will never prove to be a useful addition to her country.</p>
   <p>"Just like family ties, love of homeland and patriotism will also prove to be irrepressible, in spite of enticements or intimidations. Poland herself gives the best illustration of this notable truth.</p>
   <p>"With the expression of our most sincere respect, we remain,</p>
   <p>"The Schlesische Verein of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Fritz, Schoepke, President,</p>
   <p>"Alfred Schutz, Vice-President,</p>
   <p>"L. Kaplan, Secretary,</p>
   <p>"G. Tinzmann, Treasurer."</p>
