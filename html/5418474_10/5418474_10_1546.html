   <p>The Protestant Lutheran Jerusalem Parish has had a very pleasant development under the newly nominated Pastor, Rev. H. G. Michelmann. Church services are now held regularly each Sunday, at 10 A. M. and 7:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>The newly formed church song club, under the direction of Miss H. Bode, adds much to the beauty of this service.</p>
   <p>The Sunday School lessons are held from 2 to 3 P/M. The new Pastor also has established a German School for Catechism, history of the Bible, reading, writing, and singing, which is held every Saturday.</p>
   <p>During the vacation, the school is open daily. The Collector of the Parish is Wilhelm Schmidt. This church is situated at 101 Burling Street.</p>
