   <p>The Mills Bill providing for compensation for confiscated enemy property struck a reef in Congress and it is doubtful whether it will get off unscathed. Malicious opponents who would like to delay the satisfaction of the rightful owners indefinitely, found out that Congressman Mills and a number of other federal employees are among those who would benefit from the passage of the bill. This revelation has made a great stir, but it is naturally only a means to an end. If every bill which benefits the one who fathers it, or which is useful to a number of individual officials of the Government, were wrong for that reason alone, Congress should never have agreed to increase the salaries of its own members from $7,500 to $10,000. The present members of Congress should have shown restraint and should at least have refused to be reelected, in order to avoid acquiring a bad reputation. They were and still are, however, ready to be reelected time and again without taking offence at the increase in their salaries which they themselves secured.</p>

   <p>Why in the name of heaven should'nt Congressman Mills derive some benefit from the adoption of his own bill, along with a number of other citizens? The bill merely provides for inadequate compensation for losses inflicted by the Government itself upon the firm with which he was associated. Secretary of the Treasury Mellon is reproached for owning stock in five corporations to which the Mixed Claims Commission promised compensation. They too would derive benefit from the adoption of the bill. Such reproaches are not fair. They would be justified only if it could be proved that Mellon acquired the stock in question with this compensation in mind, and in order to derive illegal gains from it--in other words, if he had acted on the basis of information disclosed to him through his office and had acquired that stock for speculative purposes. But no hint of this has been made public as yet. They are content with insinuating such motives between the lines. There is nothing noble about these tactics, but they may serve their purpose and bring about the tabling of the bill.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost has repeatedly pointed out that it does not regard speedy <span class="page-break">\3</span>compensation for these confiscated fortunes as an act of charity or as a voluntary favor but as a discharge of obligations which have been assumed. The confiscation of enemy properties was never recognized by the United States as legally justified. For this reason the confiscation of German property during the war could be looked upon as a matter of temporarily taking over its administration. This had the purpose of preventing that capital from being used against the interests of the United States. With the termination of the war, at any rate after peace was concluded, there were no grounds for further retention of these various capital goods. They should have been returned to their lawful owners right away or at least as soon as an essential agreement was reached between the United States and Germany which settled the question of mutual compensation. That the return (of these properties) has been effected only to a small extent, and is now again being delayed by the use of various devices, by no means increases the trust in Uncle Sam's sense of righteousness. The scandal has lasted long enough and should be eliminated. Uncle Sam's honor is at stake. This cannot be repeated often enough to the Senators and Congressmen.</p>
