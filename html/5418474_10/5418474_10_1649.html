   <p>The German Evangelical-Lutheran Church, located at Humboldt and Byron Avenues, called the Christ Congregation, came to Avondale yesterday, led by their pastor, Rev. Werfelmann, to dedicate their third school, presented to this church by a noble-minded woman. Ministers and members of sister churches were also present. Rev. Reinke delivered the dedicatory sermon. He undertook to make the parents realize their responsibility toward their children and also explained the position of the parochial schools, in contrast to the non-denominational schools in general.</p>
   <p>Although the many visitors who had come to Avondale to take part in the splendid festival, held in the open, belonged to different creeds and churches, and numbered 500 to 600, quietness and order and a friendly spirit of fellowship prevailed.....The school will open October 1st, and will be held by Rev. Werfelman until a new teacher is ordained for this position. The youth at Avondale obtain thereby a new place for their education.........</p>
