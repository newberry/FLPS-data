   <p>Hardly has any of the brave men who founded the St. Michael's Parish, fifty years ago, dreamed that their little, poor church made of logs and boards, would stand up so great and respected after fifty years as it was recognized yesterday. From early morning until late at night an enormous crowd flooded the church, at Cleveland Ave. and Eugenie St., and in the evening the crowd was estimated as over 20,000 people, who wanted to attend the grand fireworks. The procession of the clergy, including Bishop Muldoon, presented an exalting view. At the head marched fifty boys and fifty girls, in white and yellow festival robes, then followed seventy-five mass acolytes, who were followed by the same number of priests. Amidet these walked the Bishop, elaborately robed and with all insignia of his high office. Very impressive was the high mass with its sweet enchanting music - the Kyrie and Gloria of Mozart's 18th Mass; the Credo and Sanctus of Gouned; the Agnus Dei of Haydn's 3rd Mass, which were offered in artistic perfection by the organist, Albert Sieben. Soloists, the sixty members of the chorus, and the orchestra of Thomas musicians, endeavored to offer the best that was in their power to the audience of about 7,500 people. The Bishop was assisted by the Honorary Beacon, Pater Mueller, the highest priest of the parish. As sub-deacons functioned <span class="page-break">2</span>Rev. Adam Hertl of St. Louis, and Joseph A. Beil of Dubuque. Rev. A. Troistorff was master of ceremonies. The festival sermon was held by Rev. Joseph Wissel of Philadelphia. With the singing of the choral "Great God, We Praise Thee," this church service came to a close.</p>
   <p>At eight o'clock in the evening, a Jubilee Concert was given and again the church was overcrowded, and at nine-thirty a grand fireworks program was offered.</p>
