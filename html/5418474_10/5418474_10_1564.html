   <p>Yesterday for the first time, Ex Court preacher Stoecker came publicly forward. He participated yesterday in "Brother Moody's" Evangelist meeting at the Central Music Hall and directed a long speech to the assembled Anglo-Americans in German, which speech was translated by Evangelist Bolt; Stoecker declared that he had for over 20 years the desire to visit America, but as long as he held his position as Court preacher it was impossible to carry it out. But now he wants to speak to his countrymen as a German man about Christian viewpoints.</p>
   <p>Here in America he will have nothing to do with politics or the Jewish question.</p>
