   <p>Under the name of Union Cadets, a number of members of the local Turngemeinde have formed a militia which will be a part of the Sixtieth Regiment. Forty men have already signed. This evening another meeting will be held at Kinzie Hall, and final organization will be effected, officers will be elected, etc. All young men who desire to join the company are requested to be present at this meeting.</p>
   <p>We heartily indorse this military movement and hope that in maneuvering and vaulting the German Union Cadets will eventually be superior to the well-known Zouave Cadets. Of course such activity requires more endurance than that which the "Sunday" and "holiday" militia displayed. Fortunately the latter have just about ceased to exist, and their arms, which have been stored in the basement of the Court House, are a memento mori in a two-fold sense of the expression.</p>
