   <p>Four hundred delegates, representatives of various branches of the German Roman-Catholic Association, were in full activity at the morning session....Mr. J. B Oelkers, of Newark, N. J., the president of the organization, welcomed the members to the convention. Reverend Max Wurst, of Wabasha, Minn., delivered the prayer. Then followed the presentation of Archbishop Quigley and the papal nuncio Msgr. Falconio, of Washington, both of whom welcomed the representatives to the convention, expressing their hopes for a successful outcome....</p>
   <p>Reverend E. J. Vattman, of Winnetka, secretary of the Catholic Colonization Organization, who served for years as an army chaplain of the Federal Government,--now pensioned--reported on the desirability of the existence and work of this association. A letter was then read, the author of which was a highly respected member of the Catholic Church in Texas, which stressed specifically the fact that the Church was an ideal organization for the founding of colonies <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for their co-religionists. Four dignitaries and spiritual leaders of the Catholic Church are at the head of this association, which is incorporated under the laws of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Reverend Ledvina, vice-president and secretary of the society for the dissemination of the Catholic faith, then reported on the activities of his organization. He thus informed the convention that 600 Catholic Missions had been transformed into communities; moreover, a church was erected in each of these communities. Great financial aid towards the furtherance of this work came from a German Catholic, but names of those who had contributed were not disclosed.</p>
   <p>One of the delegates to the convention expressed his consternation as to the manner exhibited by the English press of Chicago, toward the Central Association. Considerable space would have been given by these newspapers to a meeting of nine Socialists of Milwaukee, for instance, but no mention was made of this <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>great German organization. The delegates decided to take action against this treatment by the English press, and therefore, suggested that a special committee take up this matter.</p>
   <p>The afternoon program consisted of reports submitted by the officials of the Association, according to which, 110,460 members are included in the organization. This announcement was made by Mr. John R. Juenemann, of St. Paul, Minn., who functions in the dual role, that of financial secretary and corresponding secretary. He also made it known that $60,481.01, was paid for sick benefits, while $164,942.79, was paid for death benefits.....(A long list of names of various state organizations followed).......</p>
