   <p>Yesterday's meeting of delegates for the German Day celebration turned into a sharp demonstration of protest against the retention of German property [confiscated during the war]. Captain A. P. W. Siebel made a rather long speech in which he pointed out the illegality of the confiscations, and asked the assembled delegates to send as many letters as possible to their Congressmen demanding that they vote for the Mellon Bill. In addition, it was pointed out that various organizations should send resolutions to their representatives and senators.</p>
   <p>The meeting of delegates representing Chicago's Germans likewise decided unanimously to send such a resolution to their senators and representatives. Finally, Vice-President Bruno Knecht again called attention to the importance of addressing as many personal letters as possible to representatives in Congress. Financial Secretary Adolph Gill then passed out copies of a speech <span class="page-break">2</span>delivered on this subject last January by Representative Newton of Missouri, and he recommended wide distribution of the speech.</p>
   <p>The meeting of delegates was well attended in spite of the bad weather. After the meeting was opened by Vice-President Bruno Knecht, the names of the newly admitted organizations and the minutes of the last meeting of the delegates and of several committee and directors' meetings were read by Secretary Fischer. The minutes were approved by the delegates. Mr. Knecht then read an invitation extended by the United Austro-Hungarian Societies to an operetta to be given on April 14 in the Atheneum Theater for the benefit of the Austro-Hungarian Home. The operetta is "Die Fledermaus" (The Bat) by Johann Strauss. The delegates resolved to have the societies they represented attend the performance in as large numbers as possible.</p>
   <p>At this point, Financial Secretary Adolph Gill took the floor and reported <span class="page-break">3</span>on the distribution of the fund of $3,100 for the benefit of the flood victims (in Germany and Austria). The sum of $620 was given to each of the following for distribution among the flood sufferers: the Hochwasserkonto der Deutschen Nothilfe Berlin; the Mayor of Cologne; and Reverend O. Friesenham of Coblenz. The sum of $310 was sent to each of the countries of Rumania and Jugoslavia for the relief of distressed German communities there. Since the time these funds were sent, further contributions have been received and more are expected.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gill made the further announcement that a company which had obtained from the South Park Commission the concession for the sale of programs in Soldiers' Field declared its readiness to take care of the printing and the distribution of a souvenir program of German Day. The program will be sold in the Stadium for ten cents. There are still twelve pages reserved for the press committee for illustrations and articles. Of the net proceeds derived from the sale of the program, one half will go to the fund for the German Day celebration. This proposal was unanimously adopted by the meeting.</p>

   <p>Mr. Knecht later spoke of the parade and informed the audience that, after a discussion with the organizations interested in the matter, historical floats will have to be dispensed with; however, historical tableaux on foot are welcome. Then Captain Siebel took the floor on the same issue and spoke about last year's parade. He expressed the hope that this year there would be a greater participation by turner war and veteran societies than last year. This was promised him by the representatives of these two organizations.</p>
   <p>In addition, the question was raised as to whether a field artillery division will give the usual salute this year in honor of German Day. Mr. Knecht strongly favored it and pointed out that this salute is really a symbol, the greeting of the new home to Chicago's Deutschtum. The proposal was unanimously accepted and referred to the parade committee. Following an exceedingly lively debate as to whether the ladies should take part in the parade, it was agreed to defer a discussion on the matter until next Wednesday's meeting of the parade committee, to which all delegates of women's organizations have been <span class="page-break">5</span>invited, and to have this committee decide the question.</p>
   <p>Subsequently Mr. Kraft announced that the trip of the German turner squads to America is now a certainty. In view of the outstanding athletic performances of these German teams, it will be in the nature of a sensation for German Day when they appear and show their the Stadium.</p>
   <p>Mr. [Leopold] Saltiel of the Illinois Turnbezirk asked whether the assembly of delegates is ready together with the Illinois Turnbezirk to defray the expenses for board and other items of the ten turners.</p>
   <p>Mr. Knecht let it come to a vote: the proposal was unanimously adopted. Secretary Fischer was requested to see to it that a sufficient number of placards are placed in the streetcars of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Then Vice-President Knecht adjourned the meeting until Friday, April 16.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Following are the new organizations who declared their readiness to join:</p>
   <p>Viennese Ladies of the American Aid Bund, Ladies' Society of Gross Park (perhaps Grant Park?), the Platt German Guilds Chicago No. 1, Belmont No. 39, Uhland No. 17, Fritz Reuter No. 4, Mathias Claudius No. 28, and Bavarian American National Association.</p>
