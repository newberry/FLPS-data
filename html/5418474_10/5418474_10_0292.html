   <p>The representative, Mr. Brentano, was interviewed by one of the Chicago Tribune's reporters, anxious to find out about his experience and observations of political life in Washington, and many a thing was disclosed which the Tribune would have preferred not to have heard. For instance, Mr. Brentano does not favor such silver currency as the Tribune demands and hopes for, and the required two thirds majority to set aside an eventual veto by the President in regard to the Bland Bill, is not likely to be found.</p>
   <p>The civil service reform as executed by the President is severly criticized by Mr. Brentano...and also the shortcomings of the foreign department. Appointments are made without considering the abilities of the appointee. Certain regulations as to the requirements of the diplomatic and consular service have been adopted by other civilized countries. A consular aspirant in France must speak at least one foreign language. The same rule exists in Germany but requiring still higher degree of intelligence of a consular aspirant; he has to be a jurist and have passed a State examination. We appoint men to consular positions, with no knowledge of the native language of the country to which they are sent as representatives, occasionally causing us even some enbarrassment. This is also an opportune time to speak of the mean treatment the German-Americans received from the Hayes administration. Not one German-American -with the exception of Mr. Schurz - has received an important appointment, especially in the foreign service the German-Americans are entirely overlooked. Hamilton Fish was disliked as a know-nothing, but Evarts - ? Things are much worse under Hayes and Evarts than they have ever been under Fish. The German-American's importance was always recognized by Grant - but entirely ignored now. This is of course a just complaint of the German-American press. I was very anxious to hear the President's message about civil service reform, but what a disappointment it was!....</p>
   <p>Every word uttered by Mr. Brentano is pure truth...Overlooking the German aspirants is so obvious, that one would feel impelled to consider Mr. Hayes and Mr. Evarts as secret members of the Order of Narivism, which last year nominated him as candidate. Although Mr. Schurz was born in Germany, he surely cannot be considered even by his well wishing admirers as the personification of the German-Americans, thus excluding any other German-Americans from serving his adopted country in an official position. However, this statement should not be misunderstood. We do not mean by this that any German speaking citizen, just because he happened to have been born in Germany, has a right to such office. The better qualified American should always have the preference to the less qualified German. But under the Hayes administration a large number of Americans have been appointed to office, when in many instances the choice of German-American aspirants would have proven much better. Did Mr. Hayes and Mr. Evarts think, that with the appointment of Mr. Schurz, they have done their duty towards the German-Americans?</p>
   <p>As long as Mr. Hayes will not and cannot be re-elected in 1880, and is evidently not interested in the Republican Party's perpetuation, he does not have to force himself to anything which he would rather not do.</p>
