   <p>The Orpheus Men's Choir adhered again to the lovely custom of celebrating Christmas as singers of German songs. Christmas festivities with the Orpheus Choir always have a unique attraction in that they are dedicated chiefly to the children. In spite of the fiercely cold weather, parents and children filled the brilliantly illuminated North Side Turner Hall. Their admiring eyes, beaming with joy, were fixed upon the gigantic Christmas tree, which was magnificently decorated with brilliant lights and ornaments. There was lively music. A number of pieces, rendered by the children in accordance with old customs, created a general interest and a cheerful mood. Two small children distinguished themselves by reciting a poem and singing a song so well that it aroused general hilarity.</p>
   <p>After the children had finished their exercises and their marches, having had Arnold and Pomy as leaders, presents were distributed among them. The greatest enjoyment for them was the plundering of the huge tree; and they did not cease to work until the last piece was captured. Later, the grown-ups had an opportunity to amuse themselves with dance festival.</p>
