   <p>Pastor H. T. Smidt spoke today in the Union of the Congregational Clergymen as Pastor of the German Congregational Christ Parish and stated, that he was against preaching in the German language. According to his views, only the English language should be used especially before the younger generation.</p>
   <p>"I, myself, speak German language,"the pastor regretfully excused himself,"because my parishoners are mostly older persons. The younger German Christians should be Americanized by the use of the English language."</p>
