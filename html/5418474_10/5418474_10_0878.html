   <p>In connection with the election of officers of the Goethe Lodge, No. 26, at the workers hall yesterday afternoon, a concert and play were also on the program. The newly installed officers were: Henry Mueller, President; Robert Kummer, vice-President; E. R. Hoffmann, Secretary; Anton Seis, Secretary of Finances; and Christian Muth, Treasurer. The evening's entertainment consisted of the performance of "The Butcher's Farewell", a play in one act. The role butcher Stelpe was in the hands of William Roseke, and the part of his wife, Amanda, was played by Jean Wormser. Both of the participants exhibited talent and added to the fun of the evening. Next on the program was Miss Clara Barton in the song "Wine, Women and Song", and William Roseker in the solo "A Gallant Husband". Both were loudly applauded. For the final number the lively courtroom scene, "He is Deaf" was chosen, in which Messrs. Roseke and Wormser and Miss Barton participated.</p>
