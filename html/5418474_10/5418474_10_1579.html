   <p>Yesterday the first stone was set for the construction of the new St. Aloysius Church. The dignified ceremony started with a procession along North Avenue, which stopped at the corner of Davis and Le Moyne Street, where the foundation for the new church has been laid. Archbishop Fechan carried out the dedication act, which was followed by the powerful hymn"Veni Creator", sung by the Male Chorus of the congregation. Then Pastor Thiele made a speech and pointed out in glowing words the importance of the day.</p>
   <p>The St. Aloysius Congregation was founded 3 years ago by Pastor Thiele and is now counting more than 600 members.</p>
