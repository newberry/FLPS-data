   <p>Gleamings from the History of St. Luke's</p>
   <p>The congregation was organized to accomodate those members of St. Jacobi Church, Fremont Street and Garfield Avenue, who lived quite a distance north of their house of worship. A parochial school had been erected at Hoyne Avenue and Wellington Street in the year 1881. Several services were held there between 1881 and 1883 by J. E. A. Mueller a student at Concordia Seminary, Springfield, Illinois. In December, 1883, thirty-four voting members of St. Jacobi Church, who lived in the vicinity of the district school, resolved to organize a new church, having received permission from the Mother Church to do so. This St. Luke's was founded on January 20, 1884. The Reverend J. E. A. Mueller was called to the pastorate, and he accepted the call.</p>

   <p>A New Church Erected</p>
   <p>In the same year (1884) the young congregation built a house of worship on the corner of Belmont Avenue and Perry Street. The building was dedicated to the service of the tribune God in October, 1884. However, after only three years this edifice was not large enough to accomodate the growing attendance, so the congregation resolved to enlarge it. The reconstructed building was dedicated in November, 1888. Both the school and the church enjoyed a healthy and rapid growth.</p>
   <p>The Reverend J. E. A. Mueller, who was assisted by his son, the Reverend Fred W. G. Mueller, from 1907 to 1910, died on August 20, 1917. The Reverend Fred Mueller accepted a call to St. John's Church, of Wilmette, Illinois, in 1910. The Reverend J. E. A. Mueller was succeeded by Professor Otto C.A. Boecler, of Concordia Seminary, Springfield, Illinois. In 1925 Professor Boecler was called to a professorship at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Missourri, and was succeeded by Professor Carl J. A. Hoffmann, of Concordia <span class="page-break">\6</span>Seminary, Springfield, Illinois. Professor Hoffmann accepted a call to First Trinity Lutheran Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1927. Then the present pastor, Adalbert R. Kretzmann, who had served St. Luke's as assistant pastor for a short time, entered upon his duties as pastor, and has been very successful in his work.</p>
