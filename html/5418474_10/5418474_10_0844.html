   <p>The veterans of the "German" army held their annual celebration yesterday at the shady Louisenhain. Many members of other German military organizations were present. The entertainments, as well as the attitude and spirit in general were so peaceful, that one could almost forget that those present were sons of Mars, the God of War.</p>
