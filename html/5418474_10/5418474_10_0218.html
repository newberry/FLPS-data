   <p>President Woodrow Wilson</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>In the name of several thousand members, citizens of this republic, we respectfully protest against any diplomatic procedure which could possibly lead the lead the United States into the European war. It is our conviction that ways and means will be found to protect American life and property, and keep our national honor, intact, without giving preference to any of the warring powers, to force conditions upon the other which would rob her of the mightiest weapon she possesses, while, on the other hand, America delivers hundreds of millions of dollars worth of arms to her opponents.</p>
   
   <p>The fight between England and Germany is not our fight. We can and we shall keep aloof. The German-American neither expect nor wish armed aggression against England, but, at the same time, we feel that this country is indebted to the millions of citizens of German descent and not subject them to the terrible choice between fond memories of the old Fatherland and dutiful love for our glorious republic, - which they have always proved in the past.</p>
   <p>German-American National Confederation,</p>
   <p>Ferduiand Walther, president.</p>
