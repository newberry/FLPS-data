   <p>In conformity with a general request of the members of the German military and veteran's associations of Chicago, who will honor us with their presence tonight after congregating at a "Liedertafel," the directorate Haupt-Danner resolved to give Stein and Soehngen's great play once more.</p>
   <p>This may be the final performance of this colossal success, and whoever failed to see it in the past should avail himself of the opportunity to visit the theater to-night.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow there will be presented the operetta "The beautiful Helena," by J. Offenbach, selected by Miss Emilie Schoenfeld for her benefit. [German actors are often given the privilege of selecting a particular play, generally one in which he or she is outstanding, for a benefit performance, the net proceeds of which are given to the actor. Transl.]</p>
   <p>Miss Schoenfeld will play the title role and Director Ullrich Haupt will be in charge of all details. He promises a splendid performance.</p>
   <p>Friday evening there will be a second showing of the insane farce "The Jovial Double Marriage," by Kurt Kraatz.</p>
   <p>If you wish to enjoy a few hours of boundless fun, then by all means see it.</p>
