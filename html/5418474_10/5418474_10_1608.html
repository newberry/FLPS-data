   <p>The old animosity among the Evangelical Association is seemingly revived. About 15 months ago a committee, headed by Mr. W. Goessele, compelled Mr. R. Dubs to resign as Bishop of the church. The dethroned Bishop accepted the position as editor of the "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (German Universal Paper). It is now claimed he has stated in a published article, that Bro. Goessele, rendered his service to the committee for a consideration of a "Judas-reward." It is also stated, that he persuaded Mr. J. C. Klemme to make the church the legal heir to his possessions, thereby committing an unjustifiable neglect against his wife and children.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goessele declares these statements to be false and is suing the fighting Bishop for $8,000 damages.</p>
