   <p>The Evangelical St. Pauls celebrates their 50 year's existence.</p>
   <p>The Evangelical St. Paul's Parish celebrated yesterday, in their beautiful decorated church at LaSalle and Ohio Streets, the festival of their 50 year existence. The pastor of the parish is the well-known able pulpit orator R.A. John. St. Paul's Church can look back to a richly blessed past. During the 50 years of its existence about 20,000 children have been baptized,close to 10,000 couples were married and 6,000 funerals have been held. The sacrifice of the parish members made it possible, that during the past years, considerable sums of money could be divided among the poor, and also could be used for Mission and Synodal purposes. Yesterday's jubilee celebration showed the enthusiastic participation that was offered to the parish from all parts of the Christian population on the occasion of their honor-day. The large church was barely able to hold the great number of guests. The altar was transformed into a grove of palm trees. Beautiful white chrysanthemums and foliage plants adorned the pulpit and the high niche near the altar. The festivities were opened at 10 o'clock with a trombone prelude under the leadership of Mr. W.A. Hauser, and was followed by a festive procession of the elders and officials of the parish, who then took their seats at the altar, Pastor <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Rudolph A. John gave a short inspiring speech and introduced the three speakers of the day,three sons of the parish, the pastors Karl Kurz (Burlington, la.), Fritz Rahn (Niles, Ill.) and Ernst Rahn (Barrington,Ill,). After the singing of a choral, the dedication of a large pulpit painting was carried out by the members of the church council. Same is a creation of the excellent artist-painter Friedrich Magnus Brand, who made an honorable name for himself in Germany. Lack of space does not permit us to take up the description of this wonderful art work, but we can give the assurance that the Church can be proud of this painting. Of deep touching effect was the then following consecration of the three new bells "Faith, Love, Hope" which were presented to the parish by Mrs. Catharina Muehlke. While the bells were ringing the entire congregation rose from their seats. The second part of the morning service was filled by a festival Cantata, which was written by Pastor John and composed by the organist C.A. Weiss. Pastor Karl Kurz gave the festival sermon; it followed a soprano solo by Mrs. Fischer-Dverselen and Pastor Ernst Rahn delivered the jubilee address in which he gave a short survey of the history of the parish: How St. Paul's Church was totally destroyed by the great fire, but was rebuilt within a year's time. At 3 o'clock there was a service for youth by Mr. Hermann Meier, and at the evening service Pastor <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Friedrich Rahn was the speaker. The conclusion of the festival will be held tonight at the Central Music Hall.</p>
