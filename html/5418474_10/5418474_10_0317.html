   <p>Herr R. Michaelis, editor of "Union" demands a motion in Congress against the arms trade, and a vote by name on it, so that in all future no German would vote for a legislator who agrees with the breach of law committed by Grant's cabinet.</p>
   <p>Dr. Von Holst who"receives the most stormy applause ever granted to an erator, lasting for more than five minutes" declares that the Americans have been deceived by the French who quickly changed their firm name from"1'Empire" to "La Republique." Von Holst also denies any "gross infraction of International Law" to have been committed. However,"the highest right can become the greatest injustice." "We demand that the laws are interpreted according to eternal moral principles." But through the administration Washington has become morally guilty, their actions have resulted in good. Sedan only finished Napoleon, but the French people had to be broken. The sending of arms prevented a bad peace.</p>
   <p>Thereupon resolutions are adopted, imputing to the Government legal skulduggery, moral cowardice etc. accusing it of endangering good relations with the most powerful nation of Europe which sided wholeheartedly with the Union during the Civil War. Finally, it is resolved that "we, representing a large part of the population of America" order our representatives Congress to introduce a motion that will prevent further arms sales, and to demand a public vote by name on it.</p>
