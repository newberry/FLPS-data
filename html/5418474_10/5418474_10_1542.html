   <p>The fourth yearly concert of the Men's Chonus of the 1st Evangelical-Lutheran, congregation, which was given yesterday evening, in Brand's Hall can be called a great success. The popular conductor, Mr. Louis Doering, has, on this occasion shown, that he is fully able to bring the chorus under his leadership, to the height of art. Especially deserving of mention among the songs which the Men's Chorus recited was the composition by Mohring: "The Trumpeter on the Katzbach." The beautifully delivered song, was received with tremendous applause, not less impressive were the recitals of the soprano, Miss Jane Gray, the Baritone H. F. Hener, the Tenor, Jacob Benner, also the trio for Flute, cello and Piano, in which Messrs. A. Lehwald, O. Rush and Edward Carstenn proved to be real artists. The piano recitals of F. Luetje and Karl Koebel also met with the public's approval. The net proceeds of this beautiful concert will be used, to erect a worthy monument to the deceased conductor of the men's Chorus, C. G. Schumm.</p>
