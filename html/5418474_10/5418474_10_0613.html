   <p>The Koerner unit of the Steuben Society of America is planning a large gathering for nonmembers on next Sunday, April 6. The purpose of this gathering is to acquaint nonmembers with the aims and aspirations of this association of American citizens of German descent--an organization which is now growing by leaps and bounds. Branches of this organization, which was founded in May 1919, are today found in all States. From Boston to San Diego and Seattle, from the Canadian border to the Rio Grande--in every city the influence of the organization upon public life is a decisive one.</p>
   <p>Every American citizen who is of German extraction, who enjoys a good reputation, and who is imbued with racial pride is acceptable--without regard to religious creed or political party affiliation. All those who seriously desire to secure for American citizens of German extraction that position in national <span class="page-break">\2</span>life to which they are entitled by virtue of their contributions to the upbuilding and development of this great country of ours are welcome as members. May it never again occur that a German name be enough to degrade its bearer to the status of a second-class citizen.</p>
   <p>The Steuben Society regards as the paramount duty of its members the loyal performance of all the duties of a citizen, intimate acquaintance with the ideals of the founders of this republic, and a thorough going study of American history.</p>
   <p>No American of German descent should fail to attend the gathering to be held in the Lincoln Club on Sunday afternoon at 3 P. M.</p>
