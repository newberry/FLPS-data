   <p>How anxious certain elements of our nation are, to limit Immigration, is expressed in various American Newspapers, which are even suggesting a headtax, to be paid by every immigrant coming to the Land of the Free.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt, that such a headtax would not only limit but also suppress almost completely the immigration, as probably very few people from over there could pay their 100 Dollars. Most immigrants are lucky to have saved enough for the transportation expenses and a few spare Dollars for their living, while they look for work.</p>
   <p>A headtax of $100 would eliminate the immigration of hard workers, who are mostly poor and honest. On the other hand, $100 is not a serious expense to crooks and criminals, who know how to earn this amount of money easily over there and in this country.</p>

   <p>We consider the suggested polltax an unfair and unjust weapon against mass-immigration, which has brought this country to its present day level of wealth and prosperity. By all means, any head tax should be fought and rejected by every clearminded, sensible American.</p>
