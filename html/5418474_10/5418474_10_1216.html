   <p>Almost all of those who met last night at the Vorwaerts Turner Hall were Germans, and a large part of them were Turners. They gave homage on this tragic day to the noble martyr-President, Abraham Lincoln.</p>
   <p>The hall was beautifully decorated in conformity with the object of the service, and about eight hundred persons responded to the call of the Turnvereine (Turner Societies) Vorwaerts, National, Bahn-Frei, and Einigkeit.</p>
   <p>The first speaker, a member of the Vorwaerts Turnverein, opened the service with an address in which he enumerated Lincoln's accomplishments and ideal sentiments.</p>
   <p>A magnificent tableau portrayed the most important achievements of the departed President. Its director, the well-known artist, Louis Kindt, was given ample recognition for his work.</p>
