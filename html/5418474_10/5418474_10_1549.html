   <p>The young German Evangelical "Johannes" congregation under its leading pastor, Zimmermann, gave up the old chapel-church at Northpark Avenue and Eugenie Street and moved to the beautiful, large church building of the English Lincoln Park Congregation, which had to sell this picturesque church site at corner Garfield Avenue and Mohawk Street, as most members of the said congregation have moved further North.</p>
   <p>The German congregation has remodelled, decorated and painted its new church.</p>
   <p>New choir-cushions, more carpets and a new pulpit have been provided by the various Societies of the Congregation. The inaugural ceremony is taking place coming Sunday, on which occasion Pastor J. Pister from Cincinnati, will lead the church services. Also Pastor D. Irion from Elmhurst will speak in German to the congregation. The Church-choir will amuse the congregation with several chorus-songs, directed by organist Professor Theo Scheerer, who himself will contribute with a few organ-recitals.</p>
