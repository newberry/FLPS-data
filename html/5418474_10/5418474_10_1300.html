   <p>Under the motto "We shall always be victorious if we stand together", the Middle West district of the Friends of the New Germany Saturday night held its first district convention in the grand ballroom of the Palmer House. It was dedicated to the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the existence of the local district chapter of Chicago. About three thousand persons participated in this twofold celebration which was both a look backward and forward for the movement. The great hall was filled to capacity. The nook in which the bund orchestra, under its director, E. Hennecke, was located, was gaily decorated with German national colors and German flags. On both sides, behind the tables of honor were transparent insignia of the bund. Together with the flag delegations, who throughout the evening were stationed behind the tables reserved for the guests of honor, the rich flag decorations made an imposing picture which contributed to the festive mood.</p>

   <p>The strains of the "March of the Guild", from "Die Meistersinger" resounded solemnly through the hall. The March was masterfully played by the bund orchestra. This was followed by the overture to the opera "Der Freischuetz". This and the military march of Hitler's favorite tune, the "Badeweiler", preceded the parade of flags of all local groups and posts represented. A short signal by the corps of drummers and pipers turned the eyes of all present toward the back entrance, where groups with flags marched in rigid step and were greeted by the standing audience. Behind them came the youth organization of the Chicago local group with their little flag. After the ensigns grouped themselves on both sides of the speakers' grandstand, district leader Fritz Gissibl, as head of the meeting, stepped upon the speaker's platform and opened the convention with a brief talk dealing with the past of the movement and its beginnings in Chicago. His words of welcome were mainly directed to the bund leader, Dr. Hubert Schnuch, to the propaganda leader, Louis Zuhwe of New York, to the bund O. D. (sic) leader, Josef Schuster, <span class="page-break">\3</span>to the German consul general, Dr. Rolf Jaeger, the consul, Dr. Tannenberg and the other staff members of the city's consulate, to a representative of the City of Cleveland, to the president of the citizens' league of Ohio, Herr Almertz, to the president of the German Day Organization, Gustave A. Brand, and to the leaders of the delegation who came from the local groups of New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Columbus, Hamilton, Dayton, Milwaukee, and Hammond, and to a few old champions of the movement. A telegram sent by Mayor Kelly was read, in which he regretted to be unable to participate in the convention because of urgent business.</p>
   <p>Standing, the throng listened to the singing of the National Anthem by Frau Gertrude Clauss-Koehler. Again came Wagnerian motifs (compiled by Urbach) under the title "Nibelungen Flammenzeichen" (blazing signs of the Nibelungs). A solo by the cellist A. Kuehle, accompanied on the piano by Dr. Hermann Klumm, professor of music at De Paul University, received lively applause from the audience. After this the fest leader presented the bund <span class="page-break">\4</span>leader Dr. Huburt Schnuch of New York, who in his remarks, first in English and then in German, pointed out that the bund is interested in uniting the German-Americans, with the purpose of making it the mainstay for the preservation of the friendly relations which exist between America and Germany. Despite the animosities which the bund and its aspirations have recently experienced, he still regards this purpose as immovable. The bund combines affection for the new homeland with pride in German extraction and in everything the German-American owes the country be comes from.</p>
   <p>After another great potpourri of German marches, the consul general, Dr. Rolf Jaeger, took the floor to convey to the audience the salutations of the German people and to congratulate the bund and its future as a champion for an understanding between the new Germany and America. The speech was followed by a solo given by the baritone, Otto Bauer, who sang Schubert's "Staendchen" and, as an encore, Schubert's "Der Neugierige". He was accompanied on the piano <span class="page-break">\5</span>by Dr. Klumm.</p>
   <p>In a spirited German address, the bund press editor, Walter Kappe of New York, described the relations of the German-American with the country of his origin. The German immigrant, he asserted, became an American citizen from deep convictions and he intends to remain so. To give up the struggle, however, for the preservation of German honor is tantamount to faithlessness to one's own mother. If, out of these bund principles, one wants to construe a peril to the state, then he is not a thinking man. In the firm conviction that the bund is on the right path to uniting America's Germans culturally, economically, and politically, he (the speaker) has no mind to capitulate, and is determined to brave the difficulties that are obstructing his progress.</p>
   <p>As a native American who joined the movement, Louis Zahne, the bund propaganda leader, expressed his conviction in a few words that the day will arrive in <span class="page-break">\6</span>which the country's Germans will stop the gap as saviors against communism and reaction. His address was followed by that of the bund O. D. leader, Josef Schuster, who spoke a few words about the organization of the bund.</p>
   <p>Solemnly the first verse of the Deutschland song resounded, sung by the whole throng. The program of the evening was closed with a few musical selections and with the singing of the Horst Wessel song. A festive ball concluded the harmonious celebration.</p>
