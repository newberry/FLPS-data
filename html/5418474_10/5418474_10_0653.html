   <p>At a meeting held yesterday at the Germania Club House, Mrs. Carl Buehl, president,and Mrs. Emil Eitel, secretary, as well as other women present, decided to dedicate their services to the charity festival to be given at the Coliseum during the end of March and up to April 5. At least, they intend to work alternately. It is very desirable now that all, or nearly all, German women's societies co-operate in this work. The net proceeds are destined for the war sufferers of Germany and Austro-Hungary. On Tuesday, Feb. 29, 2:30 P.M., another meeting will be held at the Germania Club House, and it is hoped that many representatives of women's clubs will be there.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Albertine Meixner was elected chairman of the Donation Committee and Mrs. Christian Erickson vice-chairman. The books are available at the office <span class="page-break">2</span>of the Hamburg-American Line, and the German Austro-Hungarian Aid Society, Randolph and La Salle Streets.</p>
