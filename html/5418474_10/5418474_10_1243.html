   <p>(Report on the Peace Celebration runs to about 18,000 words. Only a very abbreviated abstract can be of interest. The Staats-Zeitung estimates the number of people who participated in the parade at 25,000, the number of hourses 11,000, and the cost at $200,000.) "The parade has the importance of a victorious battle against the prejudices and erroneous opinions of the other nationalities."</p>
   <p>Exactly at 4:30 A:M drums and trumpets awakened the sleeping on all sides of the city, and a few minutes later 101 cannon shots - fired by Captain Tobey at Lake Park rang out over the city. The streets were at 6 A:M busier than they are on great holidays at noon. The centers of activities were on North Clark and North Wells Streets. In the German House, the headquarters of the parade committee (North Wells) the historical part of the parade - 500 men and boys - donned its costumes. Punctually at 9:15 the participants in the parade started from there towards the real starting where they arrived at the intended time.</p>
   <p>On the west side the festival marshal and adjutants reported to the Assistant, Peter Hand, at exactly 7 A:M. It was hard work to bring order into the chaos, <span class="page-break">2</span>but against all hope the head of the train started on its way already at 10 o'clock. The route of the march, by the way, was changed at the last moment so that the parade marched past the windows of the Tribune, Staats-Zeitung, Evening Post, Union, Mail and so forth. The police functioned excellently, policemen on horseback having "cleaned up" the streets for the sake of the parade.</p>
   <p>The head of the parade was composed of Police Commissioners Gund (one of the festival marshals), at the left and right of him two police superintendents in gala uniforms. On a fiery grey horse followed Capt. Miller with 20 policemen on horseback, Capt. Hickey with 20 policemen on horseback, and Capt. Fox likewise. Then the leaders of the police and the band of the Great Western Light Guard.</p>
   <p>Then the Festival Marshal, Henry Greenebaum, with a brilliant staff: General-Adjutant Dominick Klutsch, First Assistant Marshal; Peter hand, Second Assistant Marshal: Frank Schweinfurth, Third Assist. Marshal: August Neuhaus, <span class="page-break">3</span>First Assist. General-Adjutant: John Herting, Second Assist: General-Adjutant: Henry Schmehl, and approximately 60 aides de camp. In an open car followed the Festival Organizer, Mr. George Schneider, the Festival orator, Mr. Franz Arnold, the Festival Director, Mr. Otto Lob, and several more cars with members of the arrangements committee.</p>
   <p>The First Division was accompanied by Nitschke's music corps in Prussian uniforms. Then came a squadron of Blue Hussars under Captain Matthieu. In spite of the short time of their organization they were splendidly in trim. Their uniforms were, to put it into few words, genuine and immaculate. The 1st Regiment of the National Guards, under Col. H. Ostermann, started, after long preparations for the first time. It was 400 men strong, of whom 80 wore spiked helmets with the tuft of feathers. One saw that they have an able commander in Col. Leon, because they all kept themselves as straight as if they were parading before old William himself. The German Field Battery of four pieces which then followed, led by Captain V. Reisenegger, looked like well-trained German troops and the same is to be said of the Red Hussars under the Command of Captain Munch. This whole military Division, aroused, especially among the German onlookers, immeasurable enthusiasm.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The 2nd Division belonged entirely to the Lodges. They marched in the following order:</p>
   <p>Marshal of the Division: Col. F. Rollshausen</p>
   <p>Assistants: Otto Fischer, Heinrich Schroder and Jacob</p>
   <p>Button</p>
   <p>The Music Corps</p>
   <p>The Chaldi</p>
   <p>Liberty Lodge No 6</p>
   <p>Order of the Sons of Herrmann</p>
   <p>The Druids - Another Band - The Harugari.</p>
   <p>It is natural that the Lodges impress most by the development of masses, and they showed that they are indeed very numerous. The Sons of Herrmann, who had to leave some of their members to other organization (like all of the societies) appeared about 600 men strong. They count approximately 900 members in Chicago. Their Festival Marshal was Mr. Heinrich Schroder.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The historical part of the parade consisted of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Division. The 3rd Division represented the oldest times of German history. The Marshal was Mr. Henry Kenkel and the Assistants, Gustav Giese, Adolph Muller and Wilhelm Diefenbacher. They were followed by a band, and by Hermann the Cherusean (Herr Heinrich Glade) and Thusnelda(Frau Muller). Then came 40 Teutons on horseback, and 60 on foot in old costumes, flesh colored tricots, bear skins over the saddles and shoulders.</p>
   <p>Then came Barbarossa (Mr. Henry Frick) preceding a band, ten bearers of lances, twelve Hospitallers, completely in mail, with helmets, shields and swords, three Heralds, four Templars, eight Pages etc. He was followed by 33 Princes and Knights in most sumptuous costumes. Still to the same Division belonged a representation of the Age of Inventions. The Illinois Staats-Zeitung presented on two large wagons the most recent development of the art of printing. While on the first carriage type setters were busily at work, on the second a steam press threw steam out of its chimney high into the air. During the parade the press was kept busy printing the Kutschke Song" in six languages, with the music by Otto Lob. A poem by Governor Gustav Koerner was likewise distributed to the public.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Next came 350 shoemakers with two carriages; on the first Hans Sachs, impersonated by Jakob A. Schmidt; on the second Hans von Sagan ( Adam Imhof). Finally the Middle Ages were concluded with a representation of the Peasants' War. In the center six famous knights:</p>

   <p>The Fourth Division pictured the Modern Ages. Fifteen musicians were followed by the Marshal, Wilhelm T. Wallis and his assistants Jacob Thielen, Wilh. Burkhardt and Otto Igel. The Great Elector was preceded by 12 Grenadiers and two officers carrying banners. He was followed by ten Cuirassiers, then Frederic the Great, six Hussars, eight Grenadiers....</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The Free Singing Association represented Handl and Hayden, arranged by Messrs. Philipp Kroech and Henry Baust.</p>
   <p>The "Orpheus " had a magnificent carriage drawn by six horses with colossal Beethoven bust, surrounded by seven beautiful ladies. The whole created by architect Theodor Karl.</p>
   <p>The Germania Male Choir had four cars representing all the roles of the opera. "Freischultz". Arrangement by Messrs. A. Nover and Haarbleicher.</p>
   <p>The Association Humor followed a copy of the Goethe-Schiller monument in Weimar, made by Herr Almendinger. The members dressed as German students. While some of the young fellows had not yet any scars on their faces, others could boast these honor marks of academic life. They were followed by an imposing carriage representing episodes from Schiller's poem, "The Bell",with a gigantic bell. in This car was the contribution of the Illinois Volks-Zeitung. There followed Alexander von Humboldt surrounded by mariners and miners (sent by Mr. Kraschell.</p>
   <p>The Fifth Division represented the age of the Wars of Liberation, headed by <span class="page-break">8</span>24 Turners, the Great Western Band, Division Marshal F. Metske with Assistants Wm. Wischendorff and C. H. Plautz. Then followed four carriages, arranged by Mr. Louis Kindt, representing the Lorelei, the "Watch on the Rhein", a Turn field and "Father Jahn". With this driving and marching a great number of Turners. (Father Jahn was given the motto: "Frisch, froh, frei und tren", a deliberate error, - his slogan having been: "Frisch, fromm, frohlich, frei".)</p>
   <p>Then followed the Kaiser train. First, with splendid horsemensip, the Uhlans led by Col. Hugo Dreyer, and Lieut. Charles Hillscher, then the Imperial carriage drawn by six white horses with two jockeys. His majesty was very faithfully represented by Mr. Saddler. Crown Prince Frederick William was impersonated by Mr. Charles Kemper, the Dollar - Bismarck - pardon me - Bismarck by Herr E. H. Stein (this is a pun the Staats-Zeitung permits itself about one of its most faithful advertisers. Mr. Stein who sold everything in his department store for $1.) Mr. Wilh. Levy as Moltke was stern and silent.</p>
   <p>The 6th Division consisted of 300 veterans of the Union War under Capt. Arthur Erbe. They aroused everywhere enthusiasm. Then followed the Union Veterans Assistance Association, 50 men and a car with six horses, and in an open carriage three veterans of 1812:</p>

   <p>The 7th Division was composed of post-officials and lithographers. On the top of a triumphal arch of one of the carriages sat the famous living post-eagle of Chicago. The profitableness of the art of lithography could be seen from the sumptuousness of the carriages of the lithographers, created by Mr. Louis Kurz. In this division also marched the Chicago Workers' Union, the Social Workers Union ("der sociale Arbeiter-Verein"), the Six Corners Club, the North Chicago Workers Union, the Great Union (workers' aid association), the Sixth Ward's Citizens Club, the Seventh Ward Club, and the South Chicago Workers Club I and II.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>The 8th Division belonged to the beer brewers, coopers and butchers. It was one of the most important inthe parade. Division Marshal: John A. Huck; Assistants K. G. Schmidt, Ferdinand Wheeler, Rudolph Wehrle, Moritz Berg. The brewers counted about 250 men and 23 cars.</p>
   <p>(The extremely numerous poetic attempts on the parade cars may be exemplified by the following quatrain from a beer wagon:</p>
   <p>"Die Manner deutscher Wissenschaft</p>
   <p>Die Liebten stets den Gerstensaft</p>
   <p>Oft uber Buchernund Papier</p>
   <p>Erfrischte sie das braune Bier"</p>
   <p>(German scholars always have loved the barley juice. Often while they were pouring over books and paper they were refreshed by brown beer).</p>
   <p>While the milkmen had rhymed: -</p>
   <span class="page-break">11</span>
   <p>"Die Milch der Frommen Denkungsart</p>
   <p>Die ist bei uns jetzt Futschke,</p>
   <p>Die weil ganz Deutschland einig ward</p>
   <p>Dusch Bismarck und durch Kitschke".</p>
   <p>(The milk of pious thinking is now destroyed, because all Germany became unified through Bismarck and Kitschke)(Kutschke was the author of a humorous poem on Napoleon III.)</p>
   <p>The butchers, 600 men, all on horseback, were led by Festival Marshal Koch, Division Marshal Morris Berg and the Section Marshals Wm. Reinhard, Gottlieb Schlecht and Mr. Wieland.</p>
   <p>At the head rode 12 unusually large butchers with big axes, followed by a band of 12, also on horseback, a committee of 15 all on horseback, and five decorated carriages.</p>
   <p>The 9th Division consisted of the bakers and milkmen. Division Marshal: Timothy Berdia, Assistants: Schnabel, Phil. Schweinfurth, Charles Harm. The <span class="page-break">12</span>bakers were particularly rich in poetical inspiration, declaring in one of their inscriptions the Germans to be "the leaven of spiritual fermentation. They stand in the whole world for progress and instruction".</p>
   <p>The 10th Division: Division Marshal Franz Amberg; Assistants, Heinrich Amberg, Wilh. Gahne, Clemens Hirsch. The cabinet makers were led by their Marshal, T. Biersdorf, on horseback, and his Assistant, Cl. Helmetag.</p>
   <p>The 11th Division: Division Marshal, Ambrose Andre; Assistants, Otto Neff and John Morper.</p>
   <p>This division consisted of masons, stone cutters, chimney sweeps and house-painters. The Feast Marshal of the painters was Mr. H. Kleinofen. On their float, among other branches, portrait painting was represented by Herr Wallerstein, landscape Frank Boche, Fresco Kiersdorf, drawing Wehrmann etc.</p>
   <p>The 12th Division: Division Marshal: Isac Rutishauser - consisted of the Chicago Sharpshooters Guild, with their president, Mr. George Oertel, and their treasurer Mr. S. A. Deschoner.</p>
   <span class="page-break">13</span>
   <p>Then followed the Diana Hunting Club, led by president George Zirngiebel, the wine dealers with four floats arranged by Messrs. Dahinden and Schroeder, the Grutli Association, led by their president, Herr Enderis and his aides de camp General Lieb and Sam Kirchhoff.</p>
   <p>The Grutli Association carried three flags; its own, the Swiss and the Stars and Stripes. On the top of their float was a rhymed inscription: "To celebrate German union, free Swiss are always ready". The German longshoremen came led by Mr. Martin Hessler.</p>
   <p>The 13th Division, including nine cars full with school children and representation of the Germania Fire Insurance Company, Teutonia Life Insurance Company, the German National Bank, the German Savings Bank, and the Germania Bank, was led by Feast Marshal Theo Schintz (Assistants, Carl Wunsche and T. C. Richberg). The Marshal of the 14th, 15th 16th and 17th Divisions were: Jacob Gross, R. Charles Feldkamp, Carl Gindele, L. Wolf.</p>
   <p>Two particularly luxurious floats, representing the city of Paris, were sent by Stein (of the dollar store), a globe, 6 ft. 8 high and costing $600. by Sonne's Book Store.; pyramids of musical instruments on four cars by J. Bauer <span class="page-break">14</span>and Company. Herr Ernst Knabe, of Baltimore, the head of the firm participated in the parade with his private equipage, likewise Herr Julius Bauer. In a car drawn by four horsex one saw the Messrs. H. Eisendrath, C. Knobelsdorff, C. Daegling and C. Hirsch, directors of the Teutonia, the only Life Insurance Company in the west founded and directed by Germans. The officers of the Germania Fire Insurance, the Messrs. F. Jager, S. Florsheim, A. Bauer, B. Lowenthal, Joseph Rollo and F. O. Affeld came in three open barouches.</p>
   <p>A tribune had been erected near the North western wing of the Court House. Invitations had gone out to Governor Korner, Belleville; Fr. Hecker, Lebanon; Carl Schurz; Franz Sigel; Pastor Wagner, Freeport; and Judge T. B. Stallo, Cincinnati. The guests were addressed by Mr. Louis Wahl; in their name answered Mayor Mason. While the 14th Division passed the Court House a rainstorm hit the city, but in an hour and a half the weather had cleared up again.</p>
   <p>The festival place was on the east side, in the so-called "Grove", and was adorned by a triumphal arch of 50 feet high, a tribune on which 1500 people found seats, two dance floors, 15 beer bars, enough tables to seat 10,000 hungry people at a time, thousands of colored lights and 8 calcium flames <span class="page-break">15</span>that made it almost as bright as in broad daylight. The orchestra was directed by Otto Lob. The first address was given by Feast President, Georg Schneider.</p>
   <p>He said, after at length reviewing the history of German unification since Napoleon: "Peace at last prevails - and here, too, in the great Republic, we will forget that we as Germans did not have very numerous and sincere friends. It should have been different...when the dark spirit of slavery dominated the Republic, it was primarily Germans who collaborated with the Anglo-American opponents of slavery and helped to rid the country of the curse....And again a sombre spirit stalks through the country, corruption and immorality raise their Hydra heads. Gigantic monopolies threaten the free development and the well-being of the country. The great cities are honeycombed with corruption, like the Babel on the Seine, and the halls of the legislatures swarm with unscrupulous demagogues. Disinterested patriots look to the closed German phalanx as to the providential saviour. She comes! She comes! And when the battle starts who doubts the overthrow of the lie and the victory of true liberty, of right, and eternal truth? Long live the Republic! Long live united Germany!"</p>
   <p>The next very long speech was made by Herr Frank Arnold: "The titanic struggle <span class="page-break">16</span>between the two most powerful nations of Europe was a fight for world domination between the Germanic and the Romanic element... The world belongs to the Teutons!... Italy, the Netherlands, England, Germany have marched at the head of civilization - France never!... Germany has created a literature before which the French must retreat...Who would today still read Racine or Voltaire?....In painting only a few things in French galleries are above mediocrity. What are the best French painters in comparison with a Cornelius, Kaulbach, Lessing, Schnorr and so on.... We ourselves, at this victory celebration, we will exclaim:.. Here, where freedom, united with education, makes prosperity possible for everybody, here we will show you in the old fatherland the way in political and social development, so that America be always as powerful as Germany, and Germany soon as free as America!"</p>
   <p>The final speech was made by ex-Mayor Rice.</p>
