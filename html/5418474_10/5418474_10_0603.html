   <p>Conforming to an annual custom, the members of the Concordia Male Chorus, their families and friends enjoyed an outing on August 17-18, visiting brother Franz Larwin, at him home, Camp Lake, Wisconsin. Ideal weather prevailed when the singers arrived in Trevor, where the hotel proprietor provided automobiles to continue the journey. About sixty guests were present. At the hostelry Mrs. Larwin served supper, which proved most acceptable and delectable after the long trip.</p>
   <p>The festivities, under President Thuering's leadership, developed into a genial, social affair. The members, directed by C. A. Boehler, sang several selections. Humorous recitations followed, and finally a dance, lasting far beyond the midnight hour.</p>

   <p>Sunday morning, after breakfast, proved a fitting occasion for the song "It is Sunday, the Day of the Lord." And then respite was granted until noon.</p>
   <p>The after dinner period provided an opportunity for more singing, and afterwards the guests enjoyed themselves amid such divers activities as fishing, boating, snipe hunting, etc., throughout the afternoon until it was time to think of home. After an excellent supper, the guests departed for Chicago.</p>
