   <p>The present time, with its many different kinds of revolutionary events and changes of attitude towards old-established conceptions, has not failed to influence the cultural and economic problems of Americans of German extraction. Many German-American societies have suffered severely for lack of cooperation in the serious struggle for the furtherance of German cultural interests. It is obvious, however, that only through a carefully prepared and frank discussion of the problem can a change for the better be brought about.</p>
   <p>Representatives of all German-American societies will be therefore called upon to attend the German-American congress to be held Oct. 27-30, 1932, <span class="page-break">2</span>Since matters of foreign trade with Germany are under the jurisdiction of the German-American Chamber of Commerce in New York, the German-American Conference will limit itself to the solving of the most important problems of culture by means of lectures and speeches.</p>
   <p>The political phase of the problem will be left to the Steuben Society, which will handle all political reports.</p>
   <p>The fact that important leaders have already promised their participation at the Congress, proves the necessity of planned discussions. Invitations to participate will be mailed to all leading German-American societies and German-speaking organizations, political or non-political.</p>
