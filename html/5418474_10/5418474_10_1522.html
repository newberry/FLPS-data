   <p>A dignified, exalted festival is scheduled for tomorrow, when the new church at Austin will be dedicated. Pastor Adolph Bartling, the sympathetic and beloved spiritual leader of the community will be assisted by his colleagues, who hold services at various times of the day.</p>
   <p>Music will be furnished by the Teachers' chorus, and the Church choir. The new edifice is 78 x 47 feet and its corner tower reaches to a height of 100 feet. The interior is solid and decorated in good taste. It was built by the well-known architect Peabody, constructor of the Machinery Hall at the World's Fair, and his partner Beauly. The new organ is the work of H. Barkhoff, installed and constructed by the Church Organ Company of Pomeroy, Ohio. It is to be played for the first time tomorrow. H. W. Austin, organizer of that district, gave four lots for the building site, each 25 x150 feet. The old church proved too small, although it has been enlarged at times; so the parish will undoubtedly be blessed with a constant increase in attendance and progress in its new building.</p>
