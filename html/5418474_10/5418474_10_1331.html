   <p>Their officers come Tuesday to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Next Tuesday at 8 P.M. a meeting will be held in the downstairs hall of the North side Turner Hall of German citizens and delegates of German Associations to welcome the officers of the German National Union. They are coming to Chicago on account of an invitation to explain to the local Germans the objects of the union and to ask them for their cooperation. The principal objects of the Union are: Maintenance and promotion of the German language and the German ways, introduction and preservation of the German language and education in public schools, also of exercises and gymnastics, the proper appreciation of German deeds in this country, and the advocacy of all German interests and defeating all causes hostile to their ideal and material objects. The Union has no political or party objects. The purpose is not to assemble those of German nationality in this country under one flag, or to lead it to one or the other party, but only to be their mouth piece to announce German views and opinions, wherever <span class="page-break">\2</span>needed and give same effective expressions. The Union is not conducted by politicians. The promoter is the professor of German literature at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Marion D. Learned, its President, Dr. Hexamer of Philadelphia, its Secretary, Mr. Adolph Timm of Philadelphia, its Vice President, Professor Marion D. Learned, its Treasurer, the business man Hans Weninger of Philadelphia. The Directors are: Johann Tjarks of Baltimore, H. C. Bloedel of Pittsburgh, C. E.Tienau of New Jersey, Kurt Voelkner of the District of Columbia, Dr. H. A. C. Anderson of New York, Joseph Keller of Indianapolis, Oscar F. Martin of Idaho, Gustav Hallback of Ohio and W. E. Nievstedt of St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>
   <p>Up to the present, membership was limited to the German associations of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, the German Union of the City of New York, a number of associations in West Virginia, several associations in Buffalo, Cleveland, Indianapolis, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and in several towns of the Pacific coast and an association each: One in Chicago and one in Peoria.</p>

   <p>At the convention meeting in Pittsburg the North American Turner Union and all the German associations in Cincinnati have joined as well.</p>
   <p>It is evident, that the Union in truth cannot call itself a National Union, nor can it work effectively to carry through for the best of all matters of interest with such success as would be possible if the whole German nationalities of the West would be their supporters and mandators. The objects of the Union without doubt are very worthy of consideration and for this reason the invitation has been sent to its officers to come to Chicago in connection with the Third National Convention, taking place next week in Indianapolis and to discuss with the local Germans the objects of the Union and the ways and means of achieving them. All Germans of Chicago, especially the boards of the various German Clubs and associations, are heartily invited to the meeting next Tuesday evening.</p>
