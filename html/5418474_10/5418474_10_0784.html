   <p>The Alliance of German Clubs held its first annual session yesterday at the Orpheus Hall, 49 La Salle Street. The attendance was exceptionally large. The president of the association, Jacob Ingenthron, functioned as chairman. The executive committee reported that a questionnaire was submitted to all the principals and superintendents of public schools to ascertain their sentiments on the German language issue. Since these letters were mailed rather recently, shortly before Christmas, only a few replies have been received, but so far they indicate that the teaching staff favors the subject as a school study.</p>
   <p>The report of the German Alliance further shows that the committee intends to offer Christmas prizes to twenty-five students and twenty-five teachers, men or women, attaining the greatest proficiency in German.</p>
   <p>President Ingenthron emphasized that the Alliance has been in existence for only half a year, and considering the success so far attained, its members are justified in being proud, of it, it being regrettable that all German clubs and associations have not as yet become affiliated to it.</p>
   <p>Ingenthron recommended that the Alliance shall work with might and main to combine all German associations and support every faction which insists that corporations pay their just taxes, so that the School Board can obtain the necessary funds to teach German.</p>
   <p>According to the records of the secretary, seventy-four clubs, representing various interests, with the exception of the veterans' associations, are now affiliated, and all dues have been paid. This statement is as of December 3 of last year. Five clubs resigned. They concluded that the Alliance, which professes to be a strictly non-political body, does not adhere definitely to its proclaimed principles.</p>
   <p>Since the Alliance's inception, six monthly meetings of delegates were held and the Executive Board met nine times.</p>
   <p>The treasurer states that he has a surplus of $21.76. Income was $116, and expenditures $94.24. All reports were accepted. The members voted to give the secretary a temporary salary of $30 per year, but considering the large amount of work which he must perform, his emoluments shall be increased later, as soon as the Alliance is financially able to defray the additional expense.</p>
   <p>As the assembly prepared to elect its new leaders, several delegates suggested that in view of the great efficiency shown by the various officials and committees, they should be re-elected by acclamation, and this motion was accepted unanimously. The officers for the current year are Jacob Ingenthron, president; Leopold Saltiel, vice-president; Carl Albin, secretary; and A. Stockhoff, treasurer.</p>
