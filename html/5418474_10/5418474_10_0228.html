   <p>The directors of the German-American National League sent to the German-American and their clubs and organizations the following appeal:</p>
   <p>"The German-American National League has made every honesteffort possible to justly meet all the responsibilities and fulfill all its purposes in every respect. Whoever is somewhat interested in this ideal and opportune movement for the "Germans" in this country must admit, that the mission of the League is praiseworthy and that every "German" should help to make this organization one of the most influential and effective........</p>
   <p>"Let us ask again: Must the "Germans" be ashamed of his mother-tongue or of his great and powerful fatherland? Or has the native German-American any real cause to esteem lightly or to look with contempt upon his ancestors?.....</p>
   <p>We all know that our personal liberty is in danger due to agitations of bigots. Our rights, guaranteed by the constitution have become the playthings of the opponents of a reasonable and humane philosophy of life. Can we be blamed if we attempt to oppose every effort aimed to ultimately limit our guaranteed rights? Never!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>However, nothing has ever been achieved by carelessness and without efforts and sacrifice. Is our cause worth every effort or shall all our traditions perish? The German-American National League extends to us a helping hand. Why should we not do everything possible to defend our cause?</p>
   <p>We have no intention of separating ourselves from other nationalities. All we desire is to give our best to our offspring and thereby fulfill our duties toward our adopted country. The interests of the individual must be subordinated to the well-being of the masses.</p>
   <p>We invite all "German" clubs and societies not yet members of the league to unite with us and send delegates to our convention. Some energetic and clearthinking heads should accept the challenge, to thoroughly arouse the "Germans" to cooperate in this great effort............</p>
