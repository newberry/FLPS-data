   <p>The Entertainment Committee had sent an invitation for their Masquerade Festival also to President Krueger of the South African Boers Republic, who is mentioned so much lately, and received the following personally written reply letter (in low German):</p>
   <p>South African Republic,</p>
   <p>Transvaal, Pretoria,</p>
   <p>December 15, 1895</p>
   <p>Beloved Countrymen! (Belewte Landslue) With really great pleasure I did read the invitation to your Masquerade. It makes me feel warm in my heart to hear from my so distant countrymen.</p>
   <p>My coming if of course out of the question and can't be done at all as we have at present much to do with the foreigners and English land robbers. Of course we shall, if they should come here, be ready for them and we will give them as much as they can stand. With your permission, beloved countrymen, accept my best wishes for success of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>your festival on the 8th of February and let me drink a toast to the welfare of the Club of my countrymen in Chicago. Hoping to hear often again from Chicago.</p>
   <p>S. T. Paul Krueger"</p>
