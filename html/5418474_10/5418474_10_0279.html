   <p>German-American citizens in Chicago have expressed great indignation at what they characterize as the circular of Secretary Evarts respecting American citizens of German birth. Some very vigorous protests on this subject have been received at the State Department. The Illinois Staats Zeitung in making an earnest attack upon this circular of Secretary Evarts, characterizes it as a painful testimonium panpertatis of its author, who, after that, has no right to be regarded "as a statesman, but merely an attorney, and that a most timid and weak one".</p>
   <p>The Staats Zeitung then adds: "Mr. Garfield may congratulate himself that the Evarts letter got into publicity only after the election. If published before, and properly exposed by the German press, it would have cost the Republican Party as many votes as the forged Chinese letter, and that justly too, for it proves that under the presidency of Mr. Hayes <span class="page-break">2</span>notwithstanding the presence in his cabinet of a German-American, the protection of the rights of German-Americans has been a most miserable one. Mr. Evarts has simply left that to the gracious pleasure of the German imperial authorities. If they please to listen to the representation of a troubled German-American, that trouble ceased; if not, what?"</p>
   <p>Inquiry at the State Department today shows that there is a mis-apprehension, both as to what is called the circular and as to the intentions, instructions and practices of the United States Government and the State Department regarding the German-American citizen. Secretary Evarts was absent today, but an official, speaking for him, said that the State Department has in no proper sense issued any such <span class="page-break">3</span>circular, and that this so-called circular is simply a stereotyped form of a letter which has been adopted to save time and clerical force in answering hundreds of letters of similar import. This letter was never intended for publication as a circular. The circumstances under which it was prepared were these: The State Department constantly receives letters from German-Americans about to visit their native country, setting forth the facts of their personal history as regards military service in the old country, and asking whether, in the opinion of the State Department, the authorities of the German province from which the inquirer came would be likely to interfere with him, and, if so, whether the United States, through its diplomatic and consular officers, would interfere to protect him. The State Department formerly attempted to make a specific reply to each inquiry, but the clerical force was inadequate for such purposes as in the main the inquiries covered.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The stereotyped form of reply was adopted, as is the practice in many departments of the government, with respect to different classes of inquiries.</p>
   <p>The United States has no treaties on naturalization with the North German Empire. The treaties now in effect are the Bancroft treaties with Prussia and the other with their autonomy, and interpret treaties and statutes according to their own precedence and in their own way. It happens that these provinces do not give an unfair interpretation of the Bancroft treaties, but that some of them are more severe against Americans in their construction of them than others are. The State Department could not undertake, therefore, in each individual case to decide whether any particular German-American citizen has performed his military duty, or whether he could be technically considered by any German province as a deserter, or what construction any particular province of which he may be a native might place upon the treaties. Accordingly, the State Department sent out in response to private letters the following answer:</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Domestic Circular No. 1.</p>
   <p>Department of State,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.,</p>
   <p>November 1.</p>
   <p>Your letter of the , addressed to , in relation to your status as a naturalized citizen of the United States in the event of your return to your native country, Germany, has been received, and I am directed by the Secretary of State to make reply thereto. Your inquiry belongs to a large class in which the Department of State follows the uniform rule of declining to give an opinion on the merits of the hypothetical case presented. The conditions under which the persons making these inquiries qouted the land of their nativity are so varied and their personal status, not only with respect to military duty but with regard also to their territorial allegiance under the diverse laws of the several states of the German Empire, so incomplete, that it is impossible for this government to say in advance whether questions may or may not be <span class="page-break">6</span>raised by the local authorities under the treaty of naturalization with the North German Union to the consequent molestation of the returning traveler who may be called upon to prove his acquired nationality, and clear himself of the imputation of having offended against the imperial or national law by quitting the country while actually in military service. In practice, however, when a case arises involving a person of German birth not guilty of the commission of a crime under the German law prior to the act of emigration or of desertion from the ranks, who has become naturalized in the United States, and who may revisit Germany peaceably and in the evident character of a law-abiding American citizen, maintaining his acquired citizenship, and evincing a manifest intent to return to the United States and enjoy here the rights and perform the lawful obligations of an American citizen, the protection extended by this government through its representatives abroad is almost always efficacious. If, therefore, you revisit Germany in good faith as American citizen, providing yourself with the full evidence of your acquired nationality, <span class="page-break">7</span>which is furnished by your citizen papers or authenticated copies thereof, and a passport from the Department of State, you may be assured of all proper protection by this government and its representatives; but this Department cannot guarantee you against the possible personal molestation which might ensue should your status be questioned and require justification. For yourfurther information, copies of the existing Convention of Naturalization between the United States and the North German Union, and of the subsequent protocol in relation thereto, are herewith furnished to you. I am your obedient servant, "Assistant Secretary".</p>
   <p>The Department authorities say that, while they cannot prevent the occasional arrests of German-American citizens by some of the local German governments, as soon as such arrest is made known to our diplomatic officers, the latter, acting under the strictest instructions, take immediate steps to secure the release of the citizen if possible, -.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>The efforts seldom fail, and the records show, in fact, that, owing to the persistence of our diplomatic representatives, the treaties are in favor of our citizens, the German government acquiescing. This is done in the cases of all persons holding American passports, unless something is affirmatively shown to indicate that the passports are improperly held.</p>
   <p>It has come to the knowledge of the Department that there are many instances where Germans have come to this country solely for the purpose of availing themselves of the immunities of American naturalization papers as a bar to the performance of military or other duties as native Germans. Cases of this sort have proved very embarrassing to the State Department and great sources of irritation to the German local governments.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Such cases, of course, are indirect violation of the Bancroft treaty. The State Department has within a week succeeded in securing the release of one Viele, who was raised in Alsace, charged with owing military duty. Alsace was not a part of any German province at the time of the negotiations of the Bancroft treaties and it was mentioned that for this reason citizenship in Alsace could not be considered as embraced within the jurisdiction of these treaties, but after the earnest intervention of the State Department the German government yielded the point and the man was released.</p>
   <p>German citizens and others in the west have also recently protested to the State Department against the letter of Consat Beyers, of Zurich, Switzerland, by which he has sought to discourage emigration to this country, and it was stated at the State Department today that the sentiments of Beyers' letter were not approved, but met with the severest disapproval by Secretary Evarts; that Mr. Beyers had been sharply reprimanded for the <span class="page-break">10</span>letter, and that it was only due to the fact that he had an excellent record as a soldier and as a Consul that he was not summarily removed.</p>
   <p>"The policy of the Beyers letter," said a State Department official this evening, "is antagonistic to our government, and, of course, it is not approved by the Department. Mr. Beyers violated a consular regulation in writing a letter of that sort to the newspapers."</p>
