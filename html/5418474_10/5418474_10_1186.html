   <p>Somewhat belated but more animated and enthusiastic because of it, amid generous participation, the Central Association of the German Military Clubs of Chicago and vicinity celebrated the birthday of their former war-lord. Schoenhofen's Hall, at Milwaukee and Ashland Avenue was barely large enough to accomodate the surging crowd, and during the various parade numbers, jubilant enthusiasm manifested itself. This was especially noticeable during the presentation of the flag to"German Reservist Club," in whose care this standard, loaned by Wilhelm II, will remain during the ensuing year. Association President, Martin Gass who gave the flag presentation address, added an extra number. An uniformed division of the recently organized Red Cross Auxiliary Corps, wherein Mr. Gass functions, as major, was present during the festivities and showed how capably they were instructed in military movements. Also the Amazon March presented by the ladies of the Club, wives of the <span class="page-break">2</span>former soldiers, of the army and navy was given adequate commendation.</p>
   <p>Most musical numbers were similarly received. The program contained orchestra selections, choral singing, a duet by Mr. Maja Gloersen-Huitfeld and Mr. Max Bing. The committee on arrangements was confronted with arduous labors but fulfilled them faithfully and without dissenting. Mr. Traub and eight others co-operated.</p>
