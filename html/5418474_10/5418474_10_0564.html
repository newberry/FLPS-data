   <p>The founding of the Affiliated German Group of the City of Chicago, in connection with the planned erection of Wieboldt Hall, construction of which has already begun on the campus of the University of Chicago, has not only in this country, but also in Europe caused great satisfaction and enthusiasm. From Germany, Sweden, Denmark and other countries, cablegrams contain very flattering sentiments and express the hope that this foundation will pave the way to increase a better understanding of the cultural work of the German countries which had such an influence upon the development of America.</p>
   <p>William A. Wieboldt is honorary president and Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, president of the affiliated German group. In a speech made a week ago on the occasion of the festivities, Dr. Schmidt emphasized that the midwest and particularly Chicago, is most suited and most logical for the erection of a museum, in which the millions of people of German extraction could see and observe the <span class="page-break">2</span>way their ancestors lived, produced and contributed to the cultural enrichment of the world.</p>
   <p>In the meantime the individual sub-groups, the Germans as well as Danes, Icelanders, Hollanders, Norwegians and Swedes have started their work with great zeal. Mr. and Mrs. Wieboldt donated the building. Now it is the duty of the different sub-groups to which the best known representatives of those nationalities belong to raise the necessary sums to complete the undertaking, already started.</p>
