   <p>The working program of the State committee for the bi-centennial anniversary of the birth of Washington consists of plans to organize committees of all nationalities which will arrange Washington celebrations inside their own circles, beginning February 22 to Thanksgiving Day, 1932.</p>
   <p>First of all, the main committee appointed a German-American committee for the State of Illinois. This committee consists of the following: Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, honorary chairman; Otto F. Reich, chairman; Michael Girten, vice-chairman; Fred Haake, secretary; and Leopold Neumann, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The task of this German-American State committee will be to form local committees in all larger cities for the purpose of preparing for the celebration; in short, to call into existence a state-wide organization. In Chicago such a committee will also be organized, of which the membership will be announced later.</p>
