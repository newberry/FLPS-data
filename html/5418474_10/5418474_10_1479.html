   <p>The German Evangelical St. John's Church has built a new house of worship on Mofatt Street at the same place where their old building stood. This new church was dedicated yesterday. It is a beautiful building, erected in Goethic style. It holds 700 to 800 people.</p>
   <p>At the dedication services of the forenoon and evening the Rev. Buesser, Lambrecht, and Rahm preached the festival sermons. The organ recital of Professor Stanger, as well as the splendid performances of the choir's, contributed much to the solemnity of the festival and to the edification of the audience. Pastor of the church is Reverend Hugo Stammer. The festival will continue tonight and tomorrow night. There will be a grand organ-concert tonight.</p>
