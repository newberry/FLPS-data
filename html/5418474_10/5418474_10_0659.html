   <p>The Teutonic Sons of America invite you to come to the special performance of the German Theater, Bush Temple, next Monday evening. The proceeds accrue partly to the German Theater and the Red Cross. The popular plays "Lorle" (Little Laura), dialectical and "Dorf und Stadt" (Village and City), by Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer, are on the program. An excellent cast presents the divers characters. It is hoped that the attendance will be large, because the play, intrinsically, is based on the innate sentiment of the people, and has not been given for a long time.</p>
   <p>Particular attention is called to the distribution, free of charge, of the well-known picture of the Emperor, which has a market value of one dollar. It will be given absolutely free to all ticketholders. Prices are the same as usual, $1.00, 75 cents, 50 cents, and 35 cents; box seats $2.</p>
