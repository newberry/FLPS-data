   <p>The honorable fight, which the German Knights of Pythian, in the interest of their mother tongue carried on against the egotistic nativism in their own ranks, has now been decided unfavorably to them. The State Supreme Court, has now denied the justice of their cause, confirmed the decision of the Appellate Court, which rejected the original, favorable opinion of the lower court and therefore banished the use of the German language in the lodges.</p>
   <p>Consequently, the unpleasant fight is now done away with... the knownothing clan has won a dismal victory. As the readers of the Abendpost, undoubtedly remember, the whole fight started, when several lodges declined to permit the use of the German language, in compliance with the commands of the Supreme Lodge. The Waldeck Lodge, did not want, under any circumstances, to submit to this dictum, especially because it saw the right <span class="page-break">2</span>of possession of its members, threatened by the authoritative order of the Grand Lodge; the matter came before the court and Judge Brentano decided in favor of the German Knights of Pythian. The Appellate Court later rejected this decision and the Supreme Court sustained same.</p>
