   <p>It is a wonderful thing to read such a splendid newspaper as the Abendpost. I have gained so much inspiration from Professor Kuehnemann's article on young people in this World War. It read just like a sermon, and I am profoundly grateful to the Abendpost for always giving us the best there is and for telling us the truth. There is no better German paper, and I sincerely regret that the youth of this country understand so little German and often cannot read it at all. The parents are mostly to blame because of their failure to provide their children with a thorough German education. Parents should speak nothing but German to their children, who will learn English soon enough through association [with other people]. The consequences of this faulty education are apparent: we find very few children enroll for German instruction in the public schools, and this in turn is responsible for the fact that German lessons are begun in the fifth grade instead of in the third, as used to be the case when I went to school.</p>
   
   <p>Another result is that in a German church the services have to be conducted in English on one Sunday a month. A local German minister had to submit to the demands of his Young Peoples' Society for services in English against the wishes of the pastor. If the pastors don't submit, they lose their position or else the church remains almost empty, as is now generally the case when the sermon is preached in German. But when English is spoken, the church is crowded. It is a shame that it had to come to this, and I think it is high time that parents should speak German to their children from the very beginning. Other-wise, what reply other than the following can we expect from the coming generation when we mention German to them? "Yes, I am a German-American, but I can't speak German and I can't read it either."</p>
   <p>If this keeps up, it won't be long until the German language will be on its way out in America, as is already the case in the schools and churches.</p>
   <p>I have always been proud of my German, and I have read nothing but German newspapers, although I have been in this country thirty-four years. We have reason to be proud of Germany--a country that will soon be the first in the world.</p>
