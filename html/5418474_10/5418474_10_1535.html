   <p>At the meeting which was held yesterday afternoon, Dr. Schwan, the President of the Missouri-Synod made his report over the financial standing. According to same, the Synod is at present in pecuniary embarrassment, through unwise credit allowances, which, however, can be overcome by economy. To cancel the existing debts, Dr. Schwan recommended to take up collections during the Reformation Festivals. A motion to this effect was made and accepted. Furthermore it was resolved, to induce the Synod, to separate the building-fund from the General money chest. The following congregations were admitted to the Synod league: The Immanuel-congregation in Danville, the Trinity congregation in Geneva, St. Paul's congregation, Chicago Heights, Zions congregation Bunker Hill, St. Petri congregation, Evansville, Immanuels congregation, Broadland, Trinity congregation, Hanson Park.
