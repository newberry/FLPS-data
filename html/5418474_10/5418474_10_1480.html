   <p>Many members of the German Evangelical Churches were assembled last night to celebrate their annual commemoration of the Reformation. Rev. P. Foerster of the Zions Church greeted the audience with a brief address. After prayer the choir of the Bethlehem congregation sang a hymn and an organ solo was rendered with marvelous effect. The congregation then sang a well-known hymn by Martin Luther.</p>
   <p>Rev. G. Fischer of Milwaukee preached the sermon and in a most impressive way he portrayed the life and work of the great German reformer.</p>
