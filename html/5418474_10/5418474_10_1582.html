   <p>At the conference yesterday of the Missouri Synod the following topic came up for discussion and consultation: "The duties of the family and the Church towards our youth and their Christian training." The discussions were based on the following theses, which had been worked out by the Rev. Hoelten of the local Imamuel Church.</p>
   <p>1. It is an old fact and now an almost universal experience that the majority of young people are estranged from God.</p>
   <p>2. We can not blame God for it, but must look elsewhere for the cause.</p>
   <p>3. God ordained or appointed the parents to be his co-workers in the training of youth, and then the church.</p>
   <p>4. Whoever wants to give his children a Christian training, must be a Christian himself.</p>
