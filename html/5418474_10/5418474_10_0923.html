   <p>To the publisher of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>An article under the above caption appeared in the Wednesday issue of your paper, and because a slight misinterpretation of real facts is obvious, I take the liberty to correct the error.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the statutes of the Grand Lodge No. 6, of the B'nai B'rith, the application for the founding of a new branch lodge in any city in which the order is represented, has to receive the consent of all the existing lodges already operating in that city before a permit could be issued. In the case before us, the Chicago lodges of the B'nai B'rith were informed of the proposed additional lodge, and as a result of this, the General Committee of the district received protests from eight of the ten lodges against the issuance of a permit. Thus it becomes plausible that the action of the General Committee was prompted by the decision of the majority members of the lodges.</p>

   <p>With the denial of the charter, this incident would have been closed, had Mr. Greenebaum, the originator of this project, chosen to submit to the will of the plurality, but he declared war on the committee instead. His first step in this direction was to induce those lodges to withdraw their protests, but failed to succeed. He next attempted to win his point through the delegates to the convention. He was only partly successful in this. In view of the fact that the expenses of a lodge remain the same regardless of the number of members, it cannot be expected that under those circumstances a permit for a new lodge should be issued. Therefore, it is imperative that those wishing to become members of the organization abide by the decision and join the lodges already in existence. In avoiding further expenses, the individual membership fees would have a good chance of being decreased.....</p>
   <p>Furthermore, it is also true that the permit for the founding of a new lodge would have been denied applicants of German or English extraction as well.</p>

   <p>The District Grand Lodge No. 6, cooperated thus with the Grand Lodge of the Masons of the State, who do not issue permits for any additional lodges which may be contemplated within Chicago.</p>
