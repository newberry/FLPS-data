   <p>p. 5.. The Luxemburger Independent Club of Chicago has made considerable headway under its present president, John N. Schumacher, and now boasts of 450 members, yesterday held a grand celebration at Fritz's Grove, Clybourn and Webster Avenues, which brought a vast, happy and hilarious crowd.</p>
   <p>A large majority of the club members with their families and friends were there and this congenial mass was augmented by sizeable delegations of the three Luxemburger clubs which now thrive in the northern, western and southern part of our city.</p>
   <p>The customary foot-race, always very popular, could not take place on account of the limited space. The happy, friendly conduct of the assembly, its neighborliness and all that goes with it, was more than a suitable substitute, so that one could well dispense with this physical display of agility. The dancing floor was never vacant, the younger element evidently enjoying the melodious music of Pauler's band. Beer and wine were of excellent quality.</p>
