   <p>Former German Day celebrations have sometimes been beautiful and inspiring, but none can be compared with the one held yesterday afternoon and last night in the Medinah Temple at Cass and Ohio Streets. Various circumstances made yesterday's celebration a special occasion. In the first place the sixtieth anniversary celebration of the German Society was scheduled for the same day. This Society, which, by the way, was founded during the high tide of German immigration, has been a blessing to hundreds of thousands of newly immigrated Germans. Secondly, the European war, with the German Reich struggling for her existence and fighting off aggressor nations all around her, played a big part in making this celebration stand out from previous ones. Not only that most of the speeches had the war as a subject, but hundreds or maybe thousands of people, otherwise indifferent, suddenly remembered that they were of German blood and decided to attend the celebration.</p>
   
   <p>"War has a mighty effect upon the hearts of men," said one of the speakers. "Some people, of whom we would never have expected it, have turned against us; but many others, who hardly remembered that they were of German blood, have realized in this solemn hour that the love for things German was still deeply rooted in their souls. They have become conscious of their German heritage and since we can assume that they will remember it from now on and for the rest of their lives, I can say that we have gained more than we have lost." Looking at the huge crowd everyone knew that the speaker was right.</p>
   <p>Vereinigte Maennerchoere</p>
   <p>At about 2:30 P. M. the celebration was opened by Ballmann's Orchestra playing the march from the opera "Tannhaeuser," followed by the Vereinigte Maennerchoere singing three selections appropriate to the occasion. Mr. Karl Reckzeh was conducting. The first song, Kreutzer's "Das ist der Tag des Herrn" immediately created that solemn atmosphere which is so fitting for a celebration of this kind, while the other two songs, Otto's "Das treue Deutsche Herz" and Kallivoda's "Das Deutsche Lied" gave expression to the profundity of German sentiments and the significance of the German Lied. The audience rewarded the singers and their conductor with rousing applause. And well did they deserve it.</p>
   <p>Judge Girten's Address</p>
   <p>Together with the main speaker of the evening, Professor Dr. Alexander Hohlfeldt, head of the German department of the University of Wisconsin, the president of German Day celebration, Judge Michael F. Girten, appeared on the stage and pointed out the significance of the occasion with a brief opening address.</p>
   <p>"Today, together with the sixtieth anniversary of the German Society," he said, "we are celebrating German Day which was inaugurated ten years ago in order that we German-Americans will always remember the important part which we have played in the development of this country. In former times we have displayed a tendency to forget this. Let us be proud of our German heritage! And at the same time let us direct our attention to the German Society which during the sixty years of its existence has done such boundless good for Germans who were stranded and in distress. How many tears were dried, how much grief was alleviated! How many people did the Society help to gather new hope and encouragement in their struggle for existence, to the benefit of our country. In order to do full justice to the significance of this German Day we have procured as speaker one of the most eminent scientists of the land, a most prominent German-American, Professor Dr. Hohlfeldt, whom I am presenting to you now."</p>
   <p>Professor Hohlfeldt's Speech</p>
   <p>Professor Hohlfeldt spoke about the right of the German-American element to espouse and stand by the German cause even during these critical times. Among other things he said:</p>
   <p>"The limited time, to which I must restrict myself, in consideration of such a manifold program which is in store for you today, does not permit me to dwell exhaustively upon such an important and extensive topic as the German element in America, its achievements in the past and present, its rights and duties during these great times when the events of the past months have dominated our feelings and thoughts completely. Above all I am directing my words to the overwhelming majority of those assembled here, to the German-Americans of the first, second, and third generation, who are still attached by bonds of love to the old country, and who are at the same time loyal American citizens, whose patriotism is as genuine as that of any other group in America. To them, mostly, will I speak, being myself an American citizen of German descent and birth.</p>
   <p>Great Crises Reveal Man's Heart</p>
   <p>"The great crises of life will reveal man's true character. They are our supreme tests and help us recognize our true position in life, where we stand and what we think is worth fighting for. This is true in the life of the individual and in the life of the family. It is true in the life of nations as well. Many, who as they smugly and complacently followed their daily pursuits considered themselves good Germans, may be learning these days, to their utter amazement, that they have only been deceiving themselves and others, that there was in reality nothing German left in them. But how many others are there whom we had considered lukewarm or even lost, who imagined themselves to have given up their German heritage for good only to discover that their German blood was calling to them like that still, small voice of conscience? Some we have lost but many we have gained, and I think we can be satisfied with the new order and spirit which this great world crisis has created for the German element in America. Whoever is joining us now, is doing so wholeheartedly and sincerely, and not merely as a matter of form.</p>
   <p>"But what is the ultimate purpose and significance of this celebration today for those of us American citizens of German descent in whom the German heritage and sentiment is still very much alive, but blended with everlasting loyalty to the new country to which we have vowed allegiance, and even though it isn't the land of our fathers is yet to become the land of our children?</p>
   <p>"It cannot be the ultimate purpose of this celebration to gather the German and German-minded elements of this great metropolis for a few hours of social entertainment. It cannot be the ultimate purpose just to celebrate another German Day as we have done before so often, even if its significance is augmented by the co-celebration of the anniversary of a worth-while German Society which has stood by the Chicago German element in times of need and which we congratulate today on its long record of active charity. Neither can it be the ultimate purpose of this celebration to help alleviate need and distress among our brothers in the old country who are sorely tried by this war.</p>
   
   <p>Hours of Reflection and Meditation</p>
   <p>"Worth while and inspiring as these things may be, they will never suffice by themselves to express the true sentiment that has brought us here together today and which we feel at this moment. When we take stock of ourselves, the experience of this celebration shall mean to us hours of reflection and meditation. Certainly, the welfare of America should mean more to us than that of Germany, and God forbid that these two friendly countries should ever come into an insoluble conflict with each other. But even in that case, with bleeding hearts we would discharge loyally the duties of citizenship which we have assumed. In the present situation, however, the interests of America are in no way in conflict with our own German sentiments."</p>
   <p>Professor Hohlfeldt then tried to explain why we German-Americans were justified and duty-bound to espouse the German cause. According to his arguments there are three primary reasons:</p>
   
   <p>"In the first place, consider America's true position in the concert of nations. America would fail in its destination, if she would turn into a sort of England to a greater or lesser degree. America's mission as a new political and cultural entity which was build up and is still being build up by numerous European elements demands that, beside the English-Irish pattern of life, the German way should also be representative, and have its influence on the American scene.</p>
   <p>"Next to be considered are the value and the volume of German blood and German achievements which have played a part in the past and present life of the Union. The Germans are neither newcomers nor hirelings in this country. Since the founding of Germantown, the 231st anniversary of which we also celebrate today, they have done their full share for their adopted country, be it in peace or in war. This entitles them to their own convictions, opinions, and [German] views of life.</p>
   <p>"Thirdly, there is the amazing display of the ethical forces in the German way of life which we are witnessing in this war. Germany's enemies would have the world believe that the German people have become possessed of mad ambition, greed for territory, and lust for power--that they have become the enemies of universal civilization. But it has long become apparent that just this war, which Germany has to conduct for national self-preservation, has tended to put the high-minded idealism and the strength and wholesomeness of the German character into the foreground. Not only pro-German reporters, but also those of the opposite camp have openly and frankly admitted that scarcely ever before has the world witnessed such a united people so much dignity and poise, such discipline and tolerance towards friends, such love of truth and such self-denial, unshaken in the belief of the justice of their own cause. As long as Germany presents such a picture in her hour of struggle for existence, the world, and above all we German-Americans, have every reason to believe in her cause and to identify ourselves with it. And this is the real and ultimate purpose of this year's German Day celebration."</p>
   <p>To conclude his speech the speaker referred to Carl Schurz, whom our opponents had claimed would not have been found on the side of us German-Americans. In this connection the speaker quoted the utterances of Schurz made during a speech August 20, 1870, at the time of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War:</p>
   <p>"Is it not the duty of every one of us to do our part in helping the good cause along? I am not appealing to your patriotism for the old country, but I do say, how can he who forgets his father and mother ever be a good patriot? The Americans realize that, if we disrespect our homeland, our love for our adopted country cannot be anything but a show and a pretense. Let us remain true and loyal within the boundaries of this land. But that does not mean that we cannot give encouragement and moral support to the fighters over there, that we cannot give comfort to the suffering and aid to the wounded. Let us stand united in this spirit, let not a day pass on which a steamer bound for Europe does not carry the message: Old homeland, the whole world is with you!"</p>
   <p>Professor Hohlfeldt's speech was followed by an orchestral selection of Rossini's "William Tell Overture," whereupon President Girten read a telegram received from Dr. Hexamer, president of the German-American National Bund: "Regret I cannot take part in your celebration but I am with you in spirit stop accept my heartfelt congratulations and convey to all present my German greetings stop."</p>
   <p>The Evening Celebration</p>
   <p>Shortly after eight o'clock the heroic strains of the "Tannhaeuser March" again filled the huge auditorium of the Medinah Temple, thus inaugurating the beginning of the evening's celebration. Automobiles by the hundreds were parked in neighboring streets. The main entrance was crowded with people trying to gain admission, and still more crowds were arriving. The jostling in front of the box office assumed dangerous proportions at times. However, there were still many vacant seats left in the giant auditorium and many hundreds more could have been accommodated and thus would have had a chance to aid the German Society and the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>One of the last to arrive was Governor Dunne with his staff. He was received by Michael F. Girten, president of the German Day committee and conducted to the stage together with Professor Dr. Eugen Kuehnemann of Breslau University....The Governor was briefly introduced to the audience and then took his seat in the special box reserved for him and his gold-braided entourage. The audience paid their respects to the head of the state for coming to this German Day celebration by rising from their seats.</p>
   <p>President Girten then addressed the audience in German, welcoming them and at the same time thanking the German-American National Bund for dedicating this year's German Day to the German Society. After briefly reviewing the Society's useful activities during its existence, Mr. Girten introduced the main speaker of the evening, Professor Dr. Eugene Kuehnemann who was greeted with cheering applause.</p>
   
   <p>Referring to the significance of German Day, Professor Kuehnemann pointed out that the Germans in America celebrated this Day in commemoration of</p>
   <p>German achievements and German work in America. But the greatest and most important job was now confronting them, namely, to oppose and expose those lies and falsehoods disseminated by anti-German sources regarding the causes of this war and the war itself. This point the speaker stressed and repeated again at the conclusion of his talk, with the warning to work for the triumph of truth. He added that in protesting this lying propaganda of the anti-German war reporters, not only Germany's, but America's reputation as well, was involved. The speaker conveyed to the audience the greetings of a Germany"born anew by this war," where he had the opportunity to experience the first weeks of the war and witness the unity of a people unparalleled in history, where all social and religious differences had disappeared and only one will prevailed, namely, to finish this fight for existence victoriously and honorably against a world of enemies. Only when Professor Kuehnemann gave a vivid description of the "reborn" Germany did many listeners sadly realize how little this tremendous drama taking place over there in the old country was really understood over here.</p>
   <p>The speaker then talked about pre-war events, about Belgian atrocities and German militarism. To the German-American who had been reading German newspapers, the Professor's observations proved nothing new, but it was a pleasure just the same to listen to the fascinating words of the speaker who told a vivid story. The way he characterized England's perfidy, the corruptness of Russian army officers, etc., was a true masterpiece of rhetoric. Below we are giving a few excerpts from the speech:</p>
   <p>"What is being enacted today in Germany is the greatest moral [moralisch-moral, ethical, high-minded] spectacle the world has ever witnessed. In Germany, everything is unity and co-operation. Over here there is nothing but confusion. America is at a loss to understand what Germany is fighting for and why she is fighting. Let us suppose that there were one-hundred million Canadians living to the north, the Japanese Navy was dominating the Pacific Ocean, and Mexico and Latin America were continually conniving to seperate the southern states of the Union--then, and then only could America understand what Germany is up against now. Germany is a peaceful nation, but also a proud nation, and as such she intends to maintain her position in this world and not become dependent on anybody's good will. That is why we, relying on our own strength, and with only one ally on our side, are understaking this fight against a whole world of enemies. A defeated Germany would mean the uncurbed domination of Russian barbarism in Europe. It would mean an eventual clash between Russia and England, deciding the ultimate fate of the Old World. It would mean for America an increasing threat by Japan and the British Navy. A victorious Germany on the other hand would mean peace in Europe, unhampered German internal development towards liberty, and would give America a true friend, since the German Navy would obviate Britain's sole domination of the sea.</p>
   <p>Duties of a German-American</p>
   <p>Peace between England and America is one-hundred years old. Peace between Germany and America there has always been. The Germans in America, to prove their true American patriotism in this hour, should for the first time lead their new homeland spiritually by helping America understand the true issues in this holy struggle and by fortifying her against any corrupting influences. To help bring about a true friendship between Germany and America and all German-Americans should pave the way for the coming peace. When we talk about the Germans in America, we are not now concerned with the accomplishments of the Germans during America's past, but only with the potential influence they possess here in America in this fateful hour. Never before did the German element in America face a task of like magnitude. During these months it will be decided whether Germany is to live or to perish, and in a certain sense the existence of the German element all over the world is also affected. The war which has broken out is not only the most gigantic clash of brute, physical forces that has ever been staged, but also a moral struggle of the first degree. Ethical forces and problems are equally involved. But nowhere is the moral aspect of this affair more thoroughly misunderstood than here in America, thanks to the deliberate falsification of issues by the English [language] press. Germany, which in truth is conducting a holy war, is depicted by all means available as a power which, disregarding all justice and inspired by ruthless egotism and barbaric savagery, tramples nations underfoot and aspires to world domination by means of brutal force. Here is the job for German-Americans--to give their new country the right concept of the whole matter and to see to it that America stands on the side of truth and justice.</p>
