   <p>P. 8 A festival has been arranged by the Saxonia Club at Hoerdt's Grove, Corner Clybourn and Belmont Aves. This celebration will compare favorably with any of the summer's festivities. The committee which is in charge of the arrangements, is endeavoring to provide a variety of entertainments and diversions.</p>
   <p>Special attention has been paid to the amusement of the children and a genuine Saxonian bird shooting match has been proposed. That the regular fried sausages will have a place on the program, in conformity to the customs of Saxony, needs hardly be mentioned.</p>
