   <p>Nearly every day we are informed that another German-American society has given up its usual activities; that festivals, many of which serve charitable purposes, have been postponed; that meetings and conventions will not be held while the war lasts. The news is that the German American National Alliance will not hold its regular biennial meeting, which was scheduled, for this year, to be in Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>While we understand the motives which prompt the directors of the various societies to such action, we cannot but regret them. The action will be taken by all enemies of the German-Americans as a proof that their contention that these societies are not American but German is right. It will be considered as an admission of the fact, that the German Empire and the United States are at war, influences them in a way which will be interpreted, of course, to mean that the fate of Germany affects them more than the of their own country. This suspicion must not prevent the German-American societies from pursuing their peaceful and legitimate activities. Should a general voluntary suspension of all festivities be caused by the war, it would only be natural that the German-American societies should follow. Theaters, concerts, dances and other entertainments are going on as usual. We do not want to discuss the question at this juncture whether be right or wrong. We only want to point out that as long as they are not given up by others, the German-American societies should not give them up either, even if they were satisfied that, as a matter of principle, the pleasure life of the country should be suspended on account of the war.</p>
   <p>The only German-American societies, which rightfully suspended their activities, where those which collected funds to help the war sufferers in Germany. It is impossible to assist an enemy of the country even in that purely charitable way. But it is absolutely proper to cultivate the understanding of the German language, to continue athletic exercise, in Turner societies, etc. In time of war, when hatred is so easily produced and misdirected, it is even more necessary to continue activities, such as for instance, those of the German Society in Chicago. Why should it be improper to do what this society did, when it tried to establish a better understanding between the Americans of German and of other descent on the higher plains of literature, art, and science? A proposition to destroy and abolish the German language was made in Canada and was promptly rejected. The Germans studied much more French when the danger of war with France became imminent, and they continue to do so while the war lasts.</p>
   <p>The propaganda for good relations between the United States and Germany was legitimate before the war, and did not become less so when carried on by German American individuals or societies. The propaganda for good relations between fellow citizens of German as well as of all other descent remains legitimate and should be continued by all German-American individuals and societies, even at the risk that they be called to explain, which they will be able to do in any case.</p>
   <p>This refers particularly to the German American National Alliance. Suspicion has distorted the proper view of the objects of this great organization and of the way in which it carried them out. It is an organization absolutely loyal to the United States, accepting only citizens as members and working as hard as possible for the naturalization of every German who comes to this country to stay. To hold its biennial convention this year is still more necessary than ever.</p>
   <p>The course of many German societies has to be laid out. The tremendous task to prevent the straining of relations between fellow citizens within the country has to be undertaken. Over zeal and over zest should be stopped in both directions. We are living here in our house under our flag, and shall continue to do so forever. "Let the consuls see that the commonwealth does not suffer any detriment" as the Romans used to say. The leading men among the German-Americans should see to it that no more be done. No better way is open for them, than the free and clear discussion of objects, ways and means, at a perfectly legitimate convention of a perfectly legitimate organization.</p>
