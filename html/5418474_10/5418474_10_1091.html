   <p>The "Koerner Unit" of the Steuben Society of Chicago" celebrated the birthday of General Friederich von Steuben, who was born September 17th, 1730, in Germany and who died in 1794, in New York.</p>
   <p>After a short speech of welcome, Dr. Michael Singer introduced the speaker of the evening, Professor Dr. Ferdinand Schorill, who gave a sketch of the life and work of the General, and pointed to this high importance to the United States.</p>
   <p>Von Steuben came to America at a time when every thing seemed to be lost, said the speaker, and it was to the immortal merit of the Supreme Commander of the American Armies, George Washington, who at once recognized the talent and genius of the for mer Prussian officer.</p>
   <p>In an unbelievably short time, Von Steuben by his qualifications as general inspector brought order into the chaos, and out of the ruins of the army, he built up an organization which was able to throw off the yoke which English government had imposed upon our country. His name must always be mentioned when those of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>glorious days of the American history are mentioned as with but his genius for organization the Revolutionary War would have been lost for us. This fact was always frankly acknowledged by his contemporaries, but, in the course of years, the majority of the people forgot his merits, and only in recent years has it been possible to bring into prominence, again, the forceful character of this man, who earned his spurs in the seven year old war and who, at the age of thirty-three years, retired from the German Army.</p>
   <p>For the festival, a highly interesting music program also was arranged. The artist trio of Hugo Muenger, Hans Koelbel and Rudolf Wagner, supported by Prof. Alexander Sebold and Richard Wasserman gave the audience several proofs of their skill and received well deserved applause.</p>
