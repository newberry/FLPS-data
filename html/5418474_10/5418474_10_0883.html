   <p>The German Warriors flag inauguration was celebrated last night at Schonhofen's Hall. The splendid inauguration and the following ball were marked by great success. All the members of the Society, which was brought into existence only nine months ago, were present with their families. The hall was beautifully decorated, displaying German and American colors, weapons, and different war emblems. The uniformed members of the Central Band opened the festivities with an inspired march, after which Vice-Commander Chas. Wier extended a warm welcome to the comrades and guests. After a lovely prologue spoken by Miss Clara Seyer, the unrolling of the beautiful flag dedicated by the ladies of the war Veterans Association took place and was accompanied by a thunderous hurrah. Mrs. Maria Westermann presented the flag in the name of the ladies of the Society to Robert Seyer, Commander of the War Veterans Association saying: "No higher honor could have been bestowed on me than to present this flag to the German Warriors Association in the name of the ladies of this Society. The flag a gift of our women, shows what women can do when guided by German unity. The fact is known to every one present at this gathering, that every German is possessed of a wanderlust and of the desire to work and to create; this accounts for the heavy <span class="page-break">2</span>emigration, especially to God's country of North America. This flag represents on one side the American colors, reminding you of your duties as an American citizen towards your adopted country; and if necessary to take up arms and defend and fight for it. The other side represents the German colors, which should remind us that we are Germans, who desire to preserve that German loyalty in their hearts. Mr. Commander of the German War Veterans Association, I herewith present to you, in the name of the ladies of this Association, this flag as a symbol of unity of German men in a foreign country, and it may serve as an inspiration for a closer tie."</p>
   <p>The flag made of heavy silk bears on the right side the American colors and the inscription: German War Veterans Association of Chicago. Organized December 15, 1886. Presented by the ladies of the Society. The four corners of the other side of the flag bear the German coat of arms, with the Society's emblem and incsription: "Mit Gott fur Kaiser and Reich."
