   <p>German businessmen and employees who are desirous of meeting colleagues of their profession may have this opportunity every two weeks by attending the meeting of the society of German businessmen of 1858 (local group of the guild union of employees) - G. D. A.</p>
   <p>This local group has made it its duty to help German businessmen and employees, especially the newly immigrated members of the G. D. A., to seek new means of existence; this was already accomplished very successfully last year.</p>
   <p>But still more could be accomplished, if the German businessmen and employees of the local groups, would join one of the largest unions in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>world, in order to build up a great community in Chicago, because only through mutual assistance is it possible to justify the many demands.</p>
   <p>Besides professional questions, the local groups also arrange all kinds of entertainments for its members. The meetings take place at the Germania Club.</p>
