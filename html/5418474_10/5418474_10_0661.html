   <p>Many German men and women filled the Northside Turn-hall to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of Germany, fully aware of the realization of their illustrious forefathers' dream, and realizing the importance of the present foreboding era which engulfs the Empire and its people, cognizant of the fearful sacrifice which the rebirth of the Nation requires.</p>
   <p>It was appropriate then that this festival should also be combined with the activities of the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society, the association through which Chicago's Germanity proves its sacrificial spirit to the homeland in its best and most approved manner.</p>
   <p>German music and German song, an insight into the activities of the Aid Society, and the gripping words of a gifted speaker, emphasized the spirit of the festival.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>It is gratifying to be a German, said Dr. Hofmann, whereupon he gave a lucid description of present Germany, the emperor and people, who now endure denunciation and slander, even vituperous attacks from adversaries in this land. In connection therewith, he added the admonition not to let the heritage of the Fatherland perish, but to protect it with fervent, religious zeal, and never to lag in our loving efforts towards Germania; to give and give again to ameliorate suffering, as well as to strengthen our own hearts.</p>
   <p>The audience listened spellbound to these words and expressed its approval of the speakers and musicians with prolonged applause.</p>
   <p>Modest but symbolical and fitting decorations graced the hall, in conformity to the festive mood. The entrance was transformed into an archway of German colors, flanked on both sides by two towering pine trees; the stage was ornamented with green foliage; on the rostrum the American and German colors were displayed. At the opening ceremonies, the Festival Committee, members <span class="page-break">3</span>of the Aid Society, and a number of young ladies in the becoming uniform of the Red Cross, were seated on the stage, while Mr. Ferdinand Walther addressed the assembly with a few cordial remarks and casually referred to his past. He was present, one of the godfathers of the German nation so to speak, when he stood before Paris forty-five years ago.</p>
   <p>Thereupon, Miss Elsa Holinger proceeded to the piano, intoning our national song "America," to which the entire audience responded.</p>
   <p>Mr. Charles H. Wacker, president of the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society, was the master of ceremonies.... He thanked the German Americans, the members of the press who assisted the cause, and fittingly introduced Mrs. Brentano as the zealous, enthusiastic, and talented lady who condescends to sing tonight; Miss May Doelling, a pianist; and Pastor Hofmann, a renowned speaker whose address will remain indelibly impressed in your memory,... <span class="page-break">4</span>closing with the words, "We hope to attain that position where we can look with satisfaction upon our attainment in the field of humanitarianism and mercy." After his introductory remarks, Miss Mae Doelling, the Chicago German artist, gave several piano selections. Her reputation reaches far beyond our local confines and requires no further recapitulation here.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Aid Society, Mr. Julius Goldzier, then referred to the general report.</p>
   <p>"A printed statement of our activities is now available to all and therefore I shall not detain you from enjoying tonight's varied program by quoting needless repetition.... Although not fully realizing our expectations, we have no cause to feel ashamed of our proceeds. We are living in an age where billions have become a custom, millions are mere trifles now, and considering that standard, the sums which we have asked for this work of <span class="page-break">5</span>love are small indeed, but they were donated by people who are not blessed with surplus wealth, and this circumstance makes the gifts doubly valuable to us and the eventual recipients; it is genuine philanthropy, a sacrificial spirit for the sake of duty and love.</p>
   <p>"I wish I were blessed with eloquence, so that I might adequately convey to you that overpowering sentiment which pervades me during these momentous times. Across the ocean, uncounted thousands dedicate their lives, their blood, everything, to attain an ideal. And they divest themselves of all earthly possessions, not for profit or for gain, but to bring liberty, happiness, and human respect to future generations, and to assure their heritage for ever. Since the dawn of creation, we have not witnessed a similar display of faith, perseverance, obsequious relinquishment, and patriotism, than has been shown by our brethren. .... Who can estimate the river of blood which flowed in defending the hearth, without thinking of the immeasurable streams of tears shed by our wives? <span class="page-break">6</span>"All the desolate homesteads, how many widows and orphans have we, the number of unfortunate surviving cripples, who knows? Who can realize it all?</p>
   <p>"But we, who have been spared, who have not become a part of the horrors of war, this frightful calamity admonishes us to perform a sacred duty. It is our privilege to interfere, to lessen pain and suffering. We must conform to this epochal period and show a loving memory to those who are enshrouded in the battle.</p>
   <p>"As the war abroad brings wounds, we must endeavor to heal them. We must always consider the widows and fatherless children, forever think of those who lost their health and limbs to preserve the honor and existence of the Fatherland.</p>
   <p>"The Aid Society has now functioned for eighteen months in this quest for love and, with its puny might, tried to bring help to those who needed it most. We have thought of the pitiful prisoners in the Siberian wilderness, <span class="page-break">7</span>and, I believe, you can be proud of it, your society brought their fearful plight to the attention of a gasping world. Now we may hope to save the lives of thousands who would perish otherwise.</p>
   <p>"We have done our utmost to support widows, orphans, cripples, the blind, and others, wherever need was greatest. We are in the field and shall continue as long as necessity requires it.....Our driving force was not mercy, but a sense of duty. What little we provide, we give as a token of gratitude to the place of our birth..... We esteem the land of our choice, we love it, because it is the Nation of our children and their offspring.</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless, there are thousands of golden threads that draw us across the ocean, towards those who are engulfed in the most severe fight this world has ever known. The bands of relationship and sympathy unite us with Germany and its Allies. Even if we proclaim neutrality, honest impartiality, which shall preserve our peace, we have a right to express our sympathy and will <span class="page-break">8</span>defend it, regardless of bribable, rotten politicians and an agitating press.</p>
   <p>"Can we forget the soothing environs where our cradle stood, deny the land where mother's voice first awakened our sense of hearing, and despise the earth that covers the bones of our forefathers? It can only be demanded of those who lack what we Germans possess,--sentiment.</p>
   <p>"It is up to you to support this Society, your association, so that the future history of the World War may contain one golden leaf which proclaims a work of love, mercy, and humaneness equalling the war in magnitude..... Prove yourselves worthy of the momentous time!"</p>
   <p>Mrs. Theodor Brentano, a lady well-known in German society circles, appeared now and was most cordially received. She has often and gladly used her talents in the furtherance of German associations, and delighted the audience with her perfect and artistic performance. Her vocal selections comprised songs of <span class="page-break">9</span>this evening to introduce the German American Fichte, Pastor Julius Hofmann."</p>
   <p>Dr. Hofmann, well remembered from the Schiller Festival of the Schwabenverein, was given a hearty reception. His speech:</p>
   <p>"Festival of the German Friends! It is a joy to live, to be a German; it is a duty and an overpowering ordeal, but let us rejoice in German accomplishments. Among the departed and future generations, we enjoy one privilege: we can envision the transfiguration of the Germanic soul, but our fathers, who so fervently created the unification of Germany, were denied this. We are enabled to witness this magnificent materialization, because we are a part of it, it is in our blood which seethes; their hope is ours, just as the eventual victory will be ours. Former labors are ripening, bearing a fruit our progenitors could not see.</p>
   <p>"Johannes Scherr called the new Germany a patch-work. Who does not know that <span class="page-break">10</span>the creation of the nation was man-made and, therefore, pieced together? In the present, as well as the past, Germany was the "Spirit of the World," a land with a history covering three millenniums; yet it is the most recent nation, a young, virile organism upon whom the others look with respect, esteem, and gratitude.</p>
   <p>"However, our adversaries resorted to two lies. They say the present Germany is not the land of Kant and Goethe, and that they do not hate Germany but Prussia. To this we must object. What made Germany great was not Prussianism, but the Teutonic spirit.</p>
   <p>"This innate sentiment lacked only form, until the Man of Iron and Blood forged it together. [He refers to Count von Bismarck who united a multitude of kingdoms and duchies under an empire, creating thereby a single army. Von Bismarck has often been called "The Iron Chancellor." Transl.]</p>
   <p>"How assiduously the Turners (gymnasts), singers, and poets have labored, <span class="page-break">11</span>but it was a formless ambition, based on ideas.</p>
   <p>"We celebrate today the founding of the Nation, the realization of a dream. It may be a patch-work, but it proved adequate during the present era. It achieved that inner unity, because today all classes .... exclaim, 'I recognize no parties, I am a German.' This the government has accomplished!</p>
   <p>"Germany is a monarchy, yet, it is not; in the same sense as our Nation (United States) has changed its democratic aspect. Commendation and honor to him who studies the World's history in an impartial, intelligent manner, learning from the emperor who said, 'Here I stand, I cannot do otherwise! Later, as he gazed upon the grave of a young soldier, 'I did not rant it! and then averted his tear-dimmed eyes.....</p>
   <p>What a rude awakening; we have lived in a morass of hate without being aware of it. Enemies flattered us to obtain our help, never believing that eventually they must fear us. They intended to destroy Germany, to bring about a retrogression <span class="page-break">12</span>to the year 1848, the period after the wars of liberation, the time of defenselessness, wistful wishing, weakness, famine and want. That is the aim of our enemies.</p>
   <p>Disappointment in America</p>
   <p>"It appears that a secret understanding exists among them and our Government (United States). The new business principle, 'kill the competitor!' is also being announced here. It is regrettable. We believed this was a new land, the abode for a new spiritual development, yet, we lived to see all our protests answered with that cold, inane reply, 'International Law.' We have not advanced beyond the Old World; we must follow the 'International Law.' The dream, that here we found something new and different, is shattered!</p>
   <p>"Conniving England has driven a wedge into the traditional concepts of our American people by alienating the other races from the German-Americans, and <span class="page-break">13</span>thereby subtly created an inner weakness. England induced the President to discover that 'Americans can only be born but not made,' the old 'know nothing' affair; and only among the Germans does the hyphen become a crime. [Referring to German-Americans. Transl.]</p>
   <p>"We cannot protest too much about this discrimination. We do not look for love nor gratitude; we only wish to be unmolested. We did not migrate to these shores because of poverty or distress, which was the motive of other nationals. We bring valuable additions; everyone of us now continues the history of the German past on the American soil, a record of thousands of years. Future generations can judge a people who said to its best element: 'Go hence!'</p>
   <p>Glaring Contrasts</p>
   <p>"The German thought is the thought of the State. The American view concedes the State to be a necessary evil; the German conception regards it as a <span class="page-break">14</span>valuable power for good. German sentiment considers and weighs the whole, whilst our belief here is: Individual privilege..... In Germany, we are fatalistic in life and death.... If we must die so that others might live, well and good.... The State is supreme.....</p>
   <p>"This is the German view. They do not sing 'Tipperary'; their choice is: 'A great Fort is Our Lord'..... It is the fundamental reason for the German victories; the willingness to die and thereby save others, the abolition of the ego..... We must not forget the afflicted...., must show our readiness to help, that our brethren abroad may feel they are not forgotten. .... We must support their morals. Give and give again. The festival was indeed necessary to inculcate this realization, 'not to be satisfied because we have already contributed.....'"</p>
   <p>Collection followed..... "The Sentinels on the Rhein," was sung by all, a fitting finale of the festival.</p>
