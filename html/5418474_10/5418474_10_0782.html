   <p>The Silesian Aid for the Sick gave an entertainment at the North Side Turner Hall yesterday, the success of which may be partly due to the fact that no definite program was arranged and the proceedings were in the hands of the members, who acted on the spur of the moment. The Silesians are known to be a very hospitable people, whose primary ambition consists in pleasing the guests, and so, obviously, a large attendance was assured. The president of the club offered a hearty welcome to all in a few well-chosen words, and then joviality, - ringing beakers, and inspiration, the spark of the gods, - reigned supreme. A number of the members told humorous stories, and the presence of Inspector Max Heidelmeier, who happens to be a Bavarian, but who under given circumstances manages to be an intrinsically pleasant Silesian, because he has many friends among them, did much to evoke a general spirit of comradeship and gayety. When the musicians played tantalizing dance melodies, young and old heeded the call.</p>
   
   <p>The committee which arranged the entertainment in such an exemplary manner consisted of seven officials of the club, headed by Fritz Schoepke, the president.</p>
