   <p>About 2,000 persons, guests of the Soziale Turnverein, celebrated New Year's eve at Mueller's Hall, Sedgewick and North Avenue. The children of the Sunday School performed gymnastic feats, while several other societies contributed to the success by songs and recitals.</p>
   <p>Around 11 o'clock the Christmas celebration started. A giant Christmas tree, which almost reached the ceiling, was lighted. The girls of the gym class received red plush pocket-books as gifts, the boys caps with the letters S. T. B. About 500 more children received candy and fruit.</p>
   <p>During the New Year's tableau the "Marseillaise" was played and enthusiastically sung by all those present.</p>
