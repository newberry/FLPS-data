   <p>Yesterday's Easter festival of the free thinking school Verein of the Northwest Side proved morally strengthening and mentally animating for all visitors young and old.</p>
   <p>After being in existence for four months, the Verein has two hundred children attending the freethinking Sunday school and hopes to acquire its own building in the near future.</p>
   <p>The principle is to give children of the working class a good education in contrast to the so-called Christian education, so as to raise them in the sense of enlightenment.</p>
