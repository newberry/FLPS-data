   <p>Yesterday's social affair was an offering of great refinement but not to the detriment of cordiality. The numerous ladies and gentlemen, the latter in full dress suits, showed a jovial disposition and conversed freely prior to the commencement of the regular festivity. The artistic offerings were given on the somewhat small, but very practically located stage in the dining room. Mrs. Berthold Singer, president of the club, welcomed the guests in her usual cordial, unostentatious manner, announced that Miss Elsa Holinger was indisposed and could not appear that evening to sing as she had promised and that Miss Louise Fisch would take her place with several vocal selections. Miss Fisch, endowed with a sympathetic, well-trained soprano voice, sang excellently. Miss Salman played the piano accompaniment.</p>

   <p>Then followed a one-act comedy by O. E. Hartleben, "The Story of the Missing Button," with Joseph Danner, Ulrich Haupt, W. Schubert, and Mrs. Annie Haupt, all of the German Theater. The performance was a success to judge by the applause.</p>
   <p>During the following intermission, the audience gathered in the large ballroom, where a repast was served. Later Mrs. Justine Wegener, a member of the club, gave a very effective recital entitled "An Executive Session in the Home of Mme. President." The work is her own composition; ninety-nine humorous verses. She sang them, the last lines being repeated by the assembly. A dance concluded the program.</p>
