   <p>The Evangelical Lutheran St. Paul's Church, under the leadership of the eminent pastor, H. Wunder, established 17 years ago an association for its young men, which has played an important factor in the development and strength of the church. It was therefore very appropriate for the members of the church to assemble yesterday in order to dedicate the new home for the Young Men's Association.</p>
   <p>Rev. Wunder explained the purpose and the aim of the association; pointing out that it not only supports and assists poor students with cash, but that all members advance in knowledge and culture due to their contact and the opportunities which the association offers. Church history is studied mutually, as well as music. Important questions and problems are debated among them. Generally, they aspire after growth and maturity physically and mentally. Their mind receives healthy nourishment and are protected against futile and harmful trivalities, The association is a preparatory school for future activities.</p>
   <p>It is teaching the young men how to take care of the affairs of the church, to preside over meetings, to manage the treasury, to make records, and in a general way, to get them accustomed to order and discipline, which is very beneficent for <span class="page-break">\2</span>their future career.</p>
   <p>A diversified program for the entertainment of the guests was carried out after the speech.</p>
