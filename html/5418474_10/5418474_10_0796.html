   <p>John Arndt, former president of The German Veterans Society of Chicago, functioned as marshal, aided by Dr. E. Marheinecke and Louis Morris in the capacity of adjutants. Lively activity developed at Ogden's Grove, after the parade reached its destination. The guest of honor, Dr. Wever, the German Consul, arrived in the early afternoon with the members of the consulate,... and delivered the following address:</p>
   <p>"... Like a father, watching with deep interest the career of his wandering <span class="page-break">2</span>son, so does Kaiser Wilhelm, II, keep interested in those soldiers who once were willing to give their blood and earthly possessions for the good of the country. He is confident that those soldiers who later immigrated to these shores have transferred their devotion to the land of their choice....</p>
   <p>"Your praiseworthy work, in this country, has had the splendid support of the press. Remember, that a good son will also be a good husband. Hold high the honor of your native country, and do not let anybody speak ill of it. Continue to be what you were in the country of your birth, and you can not fail to find happiness in the country of your choice. Be proud of your ancestry, and do not let jealous intrigues destroy your faith in your native land.</p>
   <p>"Thus I salute you, German soldiers of long ago, upon whom America can look with pride and confidence. Yours was a school of hard knocks. Greeting you, I greet my former fellow-countrymen, of whom we, Reich's-Germans say: 'They are a credit to us.'"</p>
   <p>A storm of applause, which lasted for several minutes, was the response to Dr. Wever's speech.... Comrade John Jacob, the oldest member of the German Veterans' Society of Chicago was also a speaker.</p>
