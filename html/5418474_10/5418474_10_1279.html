   <p>Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 P. M. the Independent German-American Woman's Club will celebrate its Christmas festivities in the East Room of the LaSalle Hotel. The members of the club are invited to come to the festival and bring their families along. An additional request is made of the members to bring "something" with them that could be placed beneath the Christmas tree and then serve to fill the baskets which are to be wrapped up and distributed among the needy.</p>
   <p>A special program has been prepared for the festival. Professor George Scherger will deliver a speech about Christmas. The children's choir from Uhlich's orphanage will sing a few songs under the direction of Superintendent Henry W. King. Rose Norman Kloepfel will come on the stage as soloist, and the members of Fischer's orchestra will play Christmas music. At the end, the children are to have a special treat: They will be visited by the yule man, known in America as "Santa Claus," the famous friend of the children.</p>
