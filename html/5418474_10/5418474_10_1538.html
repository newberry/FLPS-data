   <p>The Mission Committee of the Illinois district of the German Lutheran Missouri Synod, consisting of Pastors Hotter and Bartling and Mr. H. C. Zuttermeister, reported in the meeting yesterday, that during the last two years $20,000 have been received for missionary purposes. Of this amount $15,000 were turned over to the general mission fund, and with the rest, the expenses of the mission work in the district were covered.</p>
   <p>A large number of counties have been visited in the south and north, and in the middle of the state new missions were established. In addition to this report, it was resolved, to allow the committee, in the future to send one of its members on a tour of inspection to the Missouri station. The contributions to the building fund, the committee reports, were very moderate lately. President Succop appointed the following committees to probe the conference protocols:</p>
   <p>Northern Illinois Pastors conference: the Pastors Brust, Richland and Hempfing.</p>
   <p>Central Illinois: Pastors conference: the Pastors A. Schuessler, Krebs, <span class="page-break">2</span>and Estel.</p>
   <p>Southern Illinois Pastors conference: the Pastors Mennicke, Sr., Pardick and Hild.</p>
   <p>Northern Illinois Teachers Conference: the teachers Kemnitz and Trettin.</p>
   <p>Southern Illinois Teachers Conference: the teachers Sells, Treiber and Eggers.</p>
   <p>The conference discussions will be continued today. Out of 633 delegates to which the district is entitled, 548 delegates took part. Present were 147 entitled to vote, 69 who have a seat 13 professors, 176 teachers, and 143 representatives of that many congregations. There are missing 12 pastors entitled to vote, 12 who only have a seat, 1 professor, 28 teachers and the representatives of 32 congregations.</p>
   <p>An enjoyable musical program was offered the delegates and many other visitors last evening through the large concert, arranged by the teachers society, in Central Music Hall under the direction of Mr. W. Kunz, on the occasion of the conference.</p>
