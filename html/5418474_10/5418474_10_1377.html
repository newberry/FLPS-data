   <p>Among the most important of the affairs in the World's Fair Grounds is the Lutheran Day, which is to be celebrated by the Lutheran Evangelical Synods of Missouri, Ohio, and other states next Sunday in the stadium at Soldiers' Field.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Lutherische Pastoen-Konferenz (Conference of Lutheran Pastors of Chicago) is in charge of preparations for this celebration, and expects that about 50,000 to 75,000 persons will attend this festival of the Lutheran Church of Greater Chicago, since the churches in this district alone have 100,000 members.</p>
   <p>The festival will begin Sunday, at about 2:30 P.M., with a flag drill by <span class="page-break">2</span>three thousand children under the leadership of L. Abraham. Children from the fourth to the eighth grades of the Lutheran parish schools will take part in the exercises, for which they have drilled industriously for weeks. At the conclusion of the flag drill the children will sing the choral, "Grosser Gott, Wir Loben Dich" (Almighty God, We Praise Thee) under the direction of J. Zitzmann, Oak Park, Illinois.</p>
   <p>In addition, a mass chorus of about four thousand voices, made up of the church choirs of the Lutheran parishes, will sing German hymns and chorals. The musical part of the program is under the direction of Choirmaster Walter Sassmanshausen of the Pilgrim Lutheran Church and Choirmaster J. Schmid of St. James Evangelical Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>The principal speakers of the occasion will be Reverend J. W. Behnken, Houston, Texas, the Second Vice-President of the Synod, and Reverend Erwin Umbach, of Chicago, the International President of the Walther League.</p>
   <p>The Lutheran section of the Hall of Religion will be the center of some <span class="page-break">3</span>celebrations on a smaller scale on this same day.</p>
   <p>Sunday also marks the beginning of the convention of the Walther League, which is to last from July 16 to July 19, and will take place in the Stevens Hotel. Many delegates from all parts of the Synod will meet in Chicago for this convention.</p>
   <p>The Walther League is the youth organization of the Lutheran Church, and like few Lutheran organizations, still preserves the German characteristics bestowed on it by its founder, Carl Ferdinand Walther.</p>
   <p>Today there is a Lutheran laymen's conference in Hotel Morrison, attended by several hundred delegates from all over the country. At a banquet this evening the Reverend Walter A. Meier of Concordia College will be the speaker.</p>
