   <p>Thursday afternoon [November 6, 1919] at a meeting of the executive committee of the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society in the Atlantic Hotel, several important resolutions were adopted. The chairman was Mr. Ferdinand Walther, first vice-president; present were also Messrs. Harry Rubens, Hermann Paepcke, Paul F. Muller, Otto C. Schneider, Dr. Carl Beck, Gustave F. Fischer, Dr. Leopold Neumann, A. D. Weiner, Arthur Hercz, Julius Goldzier, and Mrs. Josie S. Buhl.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rubens reported on the purchase of milk, codliver oil and hospital supplies in New York. The co-operation of the New York committee had made it possible, in spite of great difficulties, to purchase the above-named items in large quantities and at comparatively low prices. But the strike of the longshoremen delayed the shipment of the goods at this time.</p>
   <p>Hope was expressed in New York that this strike would soon come to an end.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Preparations were made to effect an immediate shipment.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chas. H. Wacker reported that he had made arrangements with a large Chicago packing house for ten thousand dollars worth of lard to be shipped from the firm's warehouses in Europe to Berlin. He was given the assurance that the shipment would reach its destination within three days. This lard was to be turned over to the German Red Cross for distribution among the destitute.</p>
   <p>Dr. Lange, who left Vienna in September, and who was attached to the General Hospital during the war, gave the committee a detailed account of the great distress in Vienna and Austria.</p>
   <p>Whereupon it was resolved to make an additional purchase of five thousand dollars worth of lard to be turned over to the Austrian Red Cross in Vienna for distribution.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Furthermore, it was resolved to send another shipment of five thousand dollars worth of lard to the Harz mountain region to help the destitute there.</p>
   <p>The total amount spent by the Aid Society since October 1, for the relief of suffering in Austria and Germany is as follows:</p>
   <p>For the nutrition of children in Austria.......................$10,000</p>
   <p>For milk to Germany.............................................. 10,000</p>
   <p>For lard to Germany............................................... 15,000</p>
   <p>For codliver oil to Germany....................................... 5,000</p>
   <p>For hospital supplies to Germany................................. 5,000</p>
   <p>For lard to Vienna................................................. 5,000</p>
   <p>Grand total: $50,000</p>
   <p>On motion of Dr. Neumann it was resolved that the officers and all those who had contributed and worked for this cause during these many years be <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>tendered the gratitude of the Society for their untiring efforts and sacrifices.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the following resolution was adopted unanimously:</p>
   <p>"The German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society was founded shortly after the outbreak of the World War and continued its mission of love diligently and efficiently until the United States entered the struggle, at which time it naturally was compelled to discontinue its activity.</p>
   <p>"During the former period the Society enjoyed splendid successes, although conditions in Germany were not nearly as bad then as they have been since the end of the War, and consequently the demands made upon the charitable spirit of Chicago cannot be compared with the present urgent need. However, the Society succeeded in collecting seven hundred thousand dollars during that period; and large contributions of clothing, books, and other useful <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>items for war prisoners were made.</p>
   <p>"The directors of our Society thought it advisable not to resume their activities immediately after the Armistice, but to wait until the hatred and resentment fanned by the war had abated. Although perhaps it would have been wiser to have postponed the relief campaign to a later date, the general call of distress from all parts of Germany and Austria was so insistent, that it was resolved to resume the relief work at once. This was done several weeks ago, and during this short time we have collected considerable amounts. We have used this money, together with the funds on hand, for the purchase of milk, lard, hospital supplies, medicine, etc.</p>
   <p>"Several months before we resumed our work, a new aid society under the name of Deutsch-Amerikanische Hilfe (German-American Aid) was founded. The purpose of this organization was also to collect funds for the destitute. This Society appealed particularly to German clubs, and that they <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>found generous response and support can be seen from the gratifying results of their collections.</p>
   <p>"In addition, there are also the aid societies of a more defined, compatriotic [landsmannschaftlichen] character, such as the Austro-Hungarian Aid Society, or the Bavarian Club.</p>
   <p>"The name of our Society, 'German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society,' was appropriate to the situation which prevailed at the time of the outbreak of the War. The dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy--a result of the War--makes this name unsuitable now, and calls for a change in accordance with present conditions.</p>
   <p>"The German-American Aid and our own Society pursue the same objective, and they appeal to the same public. This condition can only cause confusion, especially now, when it is advisable to change the name of our Society.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>"Realizing this condition, an earnest attempt has been made by both Societies to consolidate, either by establishing a new society or by some other means. In spite of strong efforts, these attempts at amalgamation have been unsuccessful. After prolonged negotiations it was found that there were marked differences of opinion impossible to settle, as, for instance: the type of propaganda to be employed; how to procure aid on a large scale; and how to avoid the dangerous obstacles which are still presenting themselves during the present political situation, especially since the peace treaty has not even been ratified. Therefore, a consolidation under present conditions was out of the question; it did not seem to help our cause.</p>
   <p>"But the cause--to help our suffering German men, women, and children living in utter destitution in the old country--is too sacred for any other considerations except to make our work successful now that we have carried the burden for so long. Whereas the new Society will begin its work with new vigor, and to obviate any confusion among the public and to guarantee a smooth functioning of this charitable undertaking; therefore be it <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>"Resolved, That the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society be discontinued for the time being, and leave the field of operations to the association named the "German-American Aid," in the firm hope that this association will prove to be fully equal to the task and the responsibility connected with this noble and beautiful purpose; furthermore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That our Society utilize all funds on hand for the immediate purchase of food and other necessary incidentals.</p>
   <p>"All pledges made to our Society and still outstanding, shall be turned over, upon receipt, to the German-American Aid, and our officers are empowered to effectuate such transfers.</p>
   <p>"After all pending business transactions have been settled, the books of the Society shall be audited by a certified public accountant and the officers are instructed to publish the findings of such an audit.</p>
