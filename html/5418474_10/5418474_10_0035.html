   <p>They are not only remarkable on account of their superior numbers, but mainly because of their national virtue compared with other nationalities.</p>
   <p>During the last seventy-five years over twenty-five million people from foreign countries, have immigrated to the United States. Out of this huge number the Germans surpass any three other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Of the total population of Chicago of 2,500,000 - seven hundred thousand are Germans, of which only immigrants and their direct descendants are counted.</p>
   
   <p>Two million people of German birth and descent live within a radius of 200 miles around Chicago. Chicago draws its resources from the Middle West, from which one person out of seven is either German or of direct German descent.</p>
   <p>Four-fifths of our foreign population are living in the twelve largest cities of our country. The Germans are more numerous in the western states. Two hundred and twenty-five thousand people who live inside the city limits of Chicago, belong to the German nationality, they live in German settlements and speak German; ninety per cent of these people are naturalized and have declared their adherence to American institutions.</p>
   
   <p>Actually, German immigrants, rise upwards to powerful positions of superiority, this also prevails in many states and cities of the Middle West.</p>
   <p>The early German immigration forms an interesting chapter. Around the year 1854, about one and one-half million Germans came to America. Most of these people came from North Germany, later on, many came from the Rhine region......They settled in the middle and north west, consisting of the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.</p>
   <p>The largest part of our immigrants in the middle of the last century consisted of Germanic and Anglo-Saxon elements.</p>
   
   <p>One of the most interesting characteristics of the immigration of strange races is the circumstance, that while the immigrants of different other nationalities remained in the big cities East, the German with their progressive intelligence and responsibility to care for their descendants, traveled West and took possession of the most productive territories of the United States, such as the Mississippi Valley. That explains the reason for the larger German population of Chicago over any other city in the United States.</p>
   <p>If the German population of the United States would be assembled, it would suffice to populate the New England states, and there would be enough left to populate states like Indiana and Kentucky.</p>
   
   <p>The statistics of the Federal Census Bureau are proving, that in accordance with the judgment of the most eminent experts of national economy, the Germans are the best citizens in America, regardless where they are placed. They came to this country to make it their permanent home.</p>
   <p>In nineteen of the large cities of this country, twenty-eight per cent of the German populations are land-owners, while only twenty-one of the the so-called, Americans, are land-owners.</p>
   <p>The fullest significance of the German influence in Chicago is hardly accepted by the English speaking population, the reason for this being the indifference towards important things which concern the welfare of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>As previously mentioned, the German immigrants and their children are forming one-third of the population of Chicago, aside from the thousands of the next generation. Many of these German descendants are forming an important contingent in the better family circles, as well as in the business world. Although this class is acknowledged as American and is completely possessed of the same patriotic sentiment as the others, memories are cherished of the old homeland. The members were born here in Chicago and received their education in the public schools, many of them speak the German language whose beauty has a special charm for them. Prominent men of German descent and of German ways of thinking, are engaged mostly in the study of German literature.</p>
   
   <p>The thinking Chicagoan acknowledges the solidarity of the Germans as a race, and appreciates their value. He knows the Germans as order loving, right minded people, who are a saving, industrious part of the commonwealth, know how to secure influence, and who are the most efficient business men and the most progressive citizens.</p>
