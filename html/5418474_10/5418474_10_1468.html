   <p>The new Lutheran Institute, after the initiation ceremony, was assigned to its destiny. The Institution was built with an expidenture of $80,000.00. The German Lutherans erected this building as a symbol of their thankfulness for the goodness of the Almighty, and also to honor the name of the great reformer, Dr. Martin Luther, whose 400th anniversary of the reformation act, and announcement of the 95th thesis in the Castle Church of Wittenberg, Germany, will be remembered through-out the world.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Steinbach and Worthman were the architects. The interior of the Institute is practically arranged, and is very much approved.</p>
