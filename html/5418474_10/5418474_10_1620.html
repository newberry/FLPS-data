   <p>The annual great Bazaar of the first Evangelical Reformed Congregation, opened last night at the Apollo Hall, Blue Island and 12th Street. The Fair is to be continued today and tomorrow, so many friends and visitors will have an opportunity to contribute their share towards the benefit of the congregation.</p>
   <p>All arrangements are managed by a capable committee, and there also will be a selling contest between two young ladies, Miss Mary Kineger and Miss Emma Rolf.</p>
   <p>Some of the gifts for the raffle are of great value. A great attraction will be an Edison Phonograph. The Fair will wind up tomorrow night with a dance.</p>
   <p>Pastor A. Heinemann, is the preacher of the Congregation, which has its church at 181 Hastings Street.</p>
