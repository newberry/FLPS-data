   <p>If former opponents are attacked by a common enemy, and, therefore, forced to unite against him, a better and a more friendly relationship is established. This holds true for the German-American religious denominations.</p>
   <p>A strictly catholic magazine, America, referring to this glad news, stated: "Such a friendly relationship should prevail everywhere in this country, because German Catholics and Protestants are still threatened by the tyrannical spirit of the Nativists. Experience has taught us in recent years that unity brings victory."</p>
   <p>In view of the common enemy, the America pleads for a continued and friendly understanding between the German-American Catholics and Protestants...."We shall live together in peace as sons of the same mother, Germania, and as citizens of the same country, America; and if the wolves begin to howl again, we shall be ready for mutual defense."</p>
   <p>...We hail these remarks from the Catholic America ... and, although a <span class="page-break">2</span>secular newspaper is not supposed to advise its readers regarding religious affairs, yet we express the desire for, and agree heartily with America that, an uninterrupted friendly understanding between the German Protestants and Catholics of this country should continue to prevail, because upon such a friendly relationship depends the future welfare of the German-Americans.</p>
   <p>It is only just to stress the fact that the position of the German Catholics in this country is far more difficult than that of the German Protestants, because they not only have to fight the American Know-Nothingism, but also the bitter enemies of Germanism within the ranks of their own church. Certain Irish-American Catholic clergymen are just as bitter against German Catholics, as the Hungarian Catholic clergy towards the German Catholics there...</p>
   <p>To refer again to the German Protestants and Catholics in the United States, it may be said, that none of them need to forsake the teachings of their churches. In matters of a worldly nature they should cooperate, especially if it is for their mutual protection against a still threatening enemy, although he has been recently defeated.</p>
