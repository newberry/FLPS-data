   <p>Decorated with medals, orders and diplomas of honor, members of the German Warriors Union went on Sunday to the Reich Gardens. The management of the Festival was taken over by Messrs. Albert Kempt, Paul Grabowski, Fritz Rohr and others. They managed the festival in such a brilliant way that made everyone glad and happy to be there; while, the old warriors each with a foaming glass of beer shouted their "Hoch Hoch's" much to the delight of the people, many spoke of the good old times of the past, also of the dance loving younger generation.</p>
   <p>Old and young past and present, mingled together and enjoyed themselves to their utmost. The old Warriors had a good time and that is all they wanted. And so the festival ended and the Warriors took their departure with the hope that just such another feast would be given soon.</p>
