   <p>Chicago, Ill. Nov. 1, 1906, To the Editor of the "Abendpost:"</p>
   <p>It may be pleasing to the German Evangelical population of Chicago to be reminded that the Evangelical Minister who, during his days of health and strength endeavored to be a help to his fellow citizens, and during the time of illness and death stood at their side, should also render the last honors at the grave. On the occasion of the funeral of Mr. L. Rietzsch (formerly 2949 Farrell St.) who was for many years a member of the Evangelical Congregational German Christus Parish, South Centre Avenue and 31st Place, and who did not belong to any lodge, the minister of this parish was not allowed to speak. It even was forbidden that he say the "Lord's Prayer." Of such an intention no notice was given the day before.when the family bought the cemetery lot. That such things can happen in the name of religious passion in America in the 20th Century, appears highly strange, and that thinking people must lose nearly all respect for the church following such happenings, is not astonishing.</p>
