   <p>St. Peter's parish is one of those religious communities of the city whose circle of activity is situated in a purely German neighborhood, and even today its chief support comes from the German members of its parish. The independent parish was founded in the year 1864 by Pastor Joseph Hartmann of the Evangelical Church of St. Paul, who united the adherents of the Evangelical faith into a new parish which built its own unassuming house of God on Noble Street and Chicago Avenue. Reverend Joseph Schmidt was called to take charge of the young parish. In the following year, he relinguished the office to Reverend Hans Albert. The next year, the pastorate of St. Peter's parish was given to Reverend John Bond. In 1867, a new church structure was needed and built, serving its purpose for the succeeding years. In 1870, Reverend Gotthilf J. Lambrecht was called to the parish. He gave faithful services until the year of his death, 1918, having been quite successful in the service of spreading the faith. In the year 1885, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the Parish School experienced its greatest flowering, and consisted at the time of five grades. The War resulted in complete closing of the school in 1918. In 1893 the parish acquired a new plot of land on Cortez Street, near Hoyne Avenue, where the present church was erected in 1911, following the sale of the old church on Chicago Avenue and Noble Street. In 1877 the parish paper, "Der Hansfreund," was published for the first time. In 1913 Reverend H. E. Lambrecht was named assistant pastor; after the pastor's death he became chief pastor. In 1917 the parish opened a branch of its Sunday School on Central Park Avenue. In accordance with the trend of the time, the church introduced, in 1920, English services on two Sundays of each month. In 1928 the Timothy Mission was united with the Church of St. Peter, receiving the name of St. Peter's Chapel. Rev. G. A. Kienle was installed as assistant pastor of the parish.</p>
   <p>The parish of St. Peter has been, in the seventy years of its existence, a bulwark of the Christian faith, and an important factor in the country's evangelical life. Under the purposeful leadership of Pastor H. E. Lembrecht, the parish will <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>outlive the present distressful times of the church.</p>
   <p>The Evangelical Trinity Parish, Robey Street and Twenty-second Place, is about to celebrate its jubilee, beginning today. It is the fiftieth anniversary of the church. On the occasion of the jubilee there will be special services this morning at 9 for the Sunday School and the children of the parish. The speaker of the occasion will be Pastor A. A. Zimmermann, from Pekin, Illinois, president of the North Illinois district. At the festival services to be held at 10:30 A. M., Pastor R. A. John will preach in German and Rev. A. A. Zimmermann in English. At 7:45 in the evening there will be English services, to which members of sister parishes are especially invited. Pastor Louis W. Goebel and Pastor H. J. Schick have been engaged as speakers. Professor Waldemar B. Hille will play the organ during the services. On Thursday, October 11, at 8 P.M., there will be a carefree get-together of the parish, at which the ladies will serve coffee and cake. Reverend Alfred E. Mayer of the Ravenswood Church is expected to speak. Prominent speakers are expected on the following Sunday, who will honor the parish on the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary.</p>

   <p>The Trinity Parish is the fruit of the Synod's Internal mission. In the summer of 1884, the mission board of the district began to bring together the German Evangelical families of the district. On October 9 of that year, the German Evangelical Trinity Parish was founded by fifteen members. Soon after their organization, the members of the parish proceeded to buy a building lot. Their choice fell upon a lot at the corner of Robey Street and 22nd Place, which is still the site on which the church stands. A two-story structure erected there was dedicated April 19, 1885. At the same time, school classes were established on the second floor.</p>
   <p>G. H. Stanger was installed as pastor in October 1884, remaining faithful to the parish until 1889. In the same year were founded the church choir and the ladies' club. With the retirement of Pastor Stanger, and with the call of teacher Riemeier to the St. Louis School of the Community of Peace, the life of the parish suffered a setback in 1889. This was later overcome by many years of tenacious work, and by the tireless creative spirit of the parish's pastor, Julius Kircher. The present pastor of the parish took over <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the position in October 1889. At that time, the parish was quite small, and had been burdened with debt from the time the church was built. The years of depression following the close of the World's Fair of 1893 were indeed trying times for the parish. With the return of improved conditions, the stability of the parish was assured, so that by 1898 it was possible to start remodeling the church building.</p>
   <p>The dedication of the rebuilt church was held October 9, 1898. In the following year, the parish enjoyed a period of peaceful progress and expansion. In 1913, English services were introduced for the first time; their expansion became necessary in 1919. In 1912, the newspaper of the parish, "Der Drei-Einigkeits Bote," appeared for the first time. At the time of its 30th anniversary, the parish was at last free from debt, and could occupy itself zealously with plans for a new church structure. But the plans had to be abandoned during the years of the War, only to resume new shape in the year 1923. The new additions to the church, and the remodelings of the present building, were accomplished in the years 1923-1925; the modernized structure was dedicated in <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>September, 1925. In the year 1931 the church was compelled to give up the parish school--an unfortunate drawback. Teacher Daniel Schlundt remained in the employ of the parish.</p>
   <p>Pastor Julius Kircher has for many years (some of them years of need) remained faithful to the parish, and to his position, until the present day. It is, for the sake of the parish, to be wished that the Church of the Trinity continue in its fruitful development for many years to come.</p>
