   <p>The circular, which the Great Lodge of the Harugari Order sent to the Turner song, school and church clubs of Chicago, in order to organize a German Alliance, fell on fertile soil. The committee of thirteen did its work well. Yesterday's meeting of the delegates at the North Side Turner Hall is the start of a mighty movement, if we are not misled by all existing indications. More than 100 delegates respondes to the clarion call to fight for German interests and liberty, and enthusiastically acclaimed the ideas of the evening's speakers. The assembly represented about 50,000 Germans.</p>
   <p>The following comprises a verified list, issued by the committee: 1.) "Garden City L. 1163 K of H" .... 5.) "Club of German Engineers".... 51.) "Germania Assistance Club." Etc...Altogether 96 are listed. One delegate was sent by 94. The Great Lodge of the Sons of Hermann was represented by 6, and the Harugari Order with its committee of 13, constitued 113 votes. Besides these about 150 persons occupied the galleries.</p>

   <p>M. Goldbert, provisional chairman added: " I greet you as helpers in the great fight which looms before us. The Harugari is not an open order, but the dissemination of the German language is its goal, hence, a matter which also concerns you. We are on common ground, but they wish to trespass and abrogate our mother tongue. When the old German Michel is expected to endure such treatment he wags his head and demands his rights. We insist upon German instruction in the public schools for which we pay taxes. Laws are made, which cleave roots, undermine our foundations and, therefore, we must protest. Whoever has an education, has the future in his hand. In this cosmopolitan country the Irish-Americans and Germans-Americans are the most important factors. Both wish to, and should, retain their language. Furthermore, whoever knows two languages stands on a higher plane. In order to defend our good cause, we need not only our mental weapons, but must also take recourse to the ballot box. All party interests must cease before this lofty goal, the propogation of Germanism! We will not experience much difficulty if we are united. (Applause). The second speaker's, E. F. S. Gans, address was about as follows: "I greet you as my countrymen but in a dual manner, as Germans and as Americans! Rather recently, a powerful leader of a great nation exclaimed: "We Germans fear nothing in the world, except God!' (Applause). But what about the <span class="page-break">\3</span>Germans in this country? Sheepishly, they submit to a curtailment of their rights. Does Bismarck include us German-Americans among the Germans? Not unless we gather oursleves for the deed. In the political life here, we play a sordid roll and yet, how much we have contributed towards the development of this land! We are an anvil and are constantly being pounded. If our despicable inactivity is not replaced by energetic procedures, then we will disappear without trace into the morass of oblivion. Everywhere the Germans show their living intelligence. Their power is felt everywhere. In a great measure we have caused the blossoming of modern industry, but the English element does not need us at the moment. It hates, especially, the German press, German art, German institutions, the German language and German ambition. We have no unity. Politics prevent us. Therefore, we must combine and protect our interests in the voting booth, and victory will be ours. (Applause). We must remain Germans but be Americans! (Applause). Let us act in faithful unison and save the German language. Arise, my German brethern! Awake, success is nigh. If the Germans succeed, then America will prosper!. (Applause). Temporary election of officers, until a definite organization is formed has been established." Pastor Krafft of the Salems community called attention to the necessity that the Illinois school law must be opposed. A committee is to decide, if certain resolutions shall be submitted to the Springfield Republican Convention. The North Side Turner Hall <span class="page-break">\4</span>management gave the use of its hall gratuitously for this occasion. Adjournment.</p>
