   <p>"When the war broke out, we hoped that the people who are blessed with democratic Governments would sympathize with Germany. We have deceived ourselves and have learned that this Republic in its relation to foreign nations is nothing but a business firm. Five months ago Wilhelm Rapp went for the first time to Washington to protest against arms being sent to France. Since then arms for $12,000,000 have gone out. Where would France have been after Sedan without these arms? Who has given those deluded Brenchmen the means to continue the war? Not England, but the U. S. Even the arsenal of St. Louis has been emptied. This is a shame. All of the Germans here should have arisen before to put an end to this damnable dealing in blood."</p>
   <p>Next speaker, George Schneider, lauds sending of grain to France("with grain one makes people happy, one does not kill"). but bitterly attacks Carl Schurz(without naming him). "The Germans demand in serious times, serious men. No church steeple policy, no policies of empty phrases. He does not represent Missouri alone. And if this man, however high he stands, forgets his mother and forgets the Germans, he must be criticized mercilessly.</p>
