   <p>Yesterday morning the Evangelical Lutheran St. Martin Church at 51st Street and Ashland Avenue was consecrated officially. The Church stood originally at 48th Street and Frazier Street. As most of the congregation-members moved further Southwest, the Church was also transferred in that direction.</p>
   <p>Pastor A. Kohn led the Church-Service and in convincing words pointed out the information of the consecration ceremony.</p>
