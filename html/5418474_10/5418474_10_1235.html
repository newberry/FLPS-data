While in the American and Irish quarters on their houses, festive decorations were hardly noticeable and in a few instances flags could be seen. In contrast to this the houses of the Germans were more or less abundantly decorated with wreaths, inscriptions and pictures of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.</p>
