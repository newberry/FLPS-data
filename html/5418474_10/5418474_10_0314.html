   <p>New long editorial about the arms trade: polemic against the Chicago Journal. The Journal has declared that the laws of Nations permit the U. S. to sell arms to belligerents, and so, why not profit from the good occasion? One Staats Zeitung says that this is exactly the point of view of Shylock- he too, was legally entitled to his pound of flesh.</p>
   <p>Besides, it is not so much that American citizens sell Colt revolvers and Spencer rifles, but that the U. S. is emptying its arsenals. "Are $ 12,000,000.00 more in the treasury of the U. S. an equivalent for the thousands and tens of thousands of human lives extinquished by those arms?" ( Another article, reprinted from the N. Y, Journal, gives the names of all ships, dates of sailing, and statistics of the arms they carried to France.)</p>
