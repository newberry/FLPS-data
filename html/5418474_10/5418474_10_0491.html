   <p>The local group of the German National Clerks Association celebrated last Saturday its 24th anniversary with one of its well-known social evenings, which are based on amusements. This gave an opportunity to those who enjoy dancing to do it to their hearts' content.</p>
   <p>A large number of old and new adherents assembled in the ballroom of the Germania Club, and soon they were dancing to the tunes of an excellent orchestra, which played mostly German airs. The association spent a good deal of money on this occasion, and the lovely room with its elegant decorations made a truly festive impression. The management of the association, whose president, Mr. Zeglin, together with Mr. Schoene, president of the festival committee, decided not to encumber the program with a large variety of artistic performances, being well <span class="page-break">\2</span>aware of the fact that the majority of the youth preferred dancing to listening to speeches, etc.</p>
   <p>A pleasant intermission was caused by a few singing performances by Miss Gertrude Clauss, for which she selected the Waltz of the Muses from La Boheme, "Yours is my heart," "For you alone," and a few more songs from different Operettas. Her lovely soprano made it easy for her to gain rich applause from the audience which expressed its appreciation also by presenting several beautiful bouquets to her.</p>
   <p>The evening was rounded off by a cello solo by the leader of the orchestra, Mr. Derer, who performed in a masterly way a potpourri of Rhemish songs. The company retired late at mid-night, after spending a wonderful evening.</p>
