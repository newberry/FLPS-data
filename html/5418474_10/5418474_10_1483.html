   <p>The Evangelical Lutheran St. Peters Church,is celebrating the fortieth year jubilee of their well-beloved pastor, Rev. G. Lambrecht.</p>
   <p>Forty years ago, Rev. Lambrecht started as a young preacher to build up the then small congregation. Under his leadership this congregation became the mother-church of various other congregations. This Mother-church is still on of the largest German congregations in the city. The congregation, of course, is anxious to express their appreciation of the services of their pastor and to celebrate the occasion in a most appropriate and dignified way. All sister churches of the same faith contribute their share to the festival.</p>
   <p>Later a concert will be given in honor of the pastor.</p>
