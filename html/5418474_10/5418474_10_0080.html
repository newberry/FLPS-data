   <p>The German movement in the United States should have been united a long time ago, but it is now to become a reality. The German-American National Alliance clearly recognized the stupendous defect which exists among the German-Americans because of their division into ecclesiastic, liberal, and agnostic parties. They have undertaken the first step to overcome these difficulties. All resolutions in this direction are, not doubt, of most vital importance. Of course, it can not be expected that the different elements with their various philosophies of life can be melted together in one compact mass, but these different elements with their various views could have been united in the one purpose of mutual concern, that is the fostering of the German language, customs, culture, and intellectual and social life in this country. As far as they are sons and daughters of mother Germania, they are of one mind in this respect. They know no difference in their desire and ambitions to retain and cultivate their inestimable national treasures and ideals, and in this general aim of the German-Americans they can certainly all be united.</p>
