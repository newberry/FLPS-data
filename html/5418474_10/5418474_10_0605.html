It has been highly successful, due in a great measure to the favorable weather. An auto parade, comprising more than a hundred festively decorated cars, started from Dayton Street and North Avenue.

Slides and a merry-go-round proved very attractive; also arrangements had been made whereby Fortuna could be tempted with a nickel, and other kindred pleasant diversions to regale all. Exceptional liveliness prevailed at the dance hall, where couples stopped only long enough during intermissions to strengthen themselves with refreshments for the next round....</p>
   <p>As members of singing societies were present, festive melodies were not lacking, and thus one heard the last song, and had the final dance until the stars twinkled in the sky....</p>
