   <p>Last Sunday was a particular holiday for the German Catholic St. Martin's Congregation, as its minister, Rev. John M. Schaeffers, celebrated the 25 years' jubilee of his priest ordination. For this occasion a high mass was held by Rev. Schaeffers' forner student friends, Rev. Lochemes, Rev. C. Becker and Professor H. Ries in the Congregation Church at 59th Street and Princeton Avenue.</p>
   <p>Vicar-general Joseph Rainer from Milwaukee was making the speech of the day. Then a cablegram from the Pope was read, who sent his blessings to the celebrants.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon, 450 children of the churchchoir honored Rev. Schaeffers with a cantata and then presented him a young tree with 25 Silver Dollars hanging off its twigs. Towards evening a committee of congregation members gave Rev. Schaeffers $1500.00 as a jubilee gift of the congregation.</p>
