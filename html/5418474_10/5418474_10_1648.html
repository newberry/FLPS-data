   <p>St. Michael's church, Eugenie St., has built a new tower and redecorated the whole exterior at a cost of about $50,000..... These unnecessary buildings have grown up in spite of the present misery in the parish of St. Michael's church, seemingly there is harshness and actually existing un-Christian spirit predominating in the circles of leading personalities of St. Michaels.</p>
   <p>It would have been Christian action to stop the misery of suffering human beings first and then if there were funds left, to use the rest of this solicited money for the erection of Stone advertising posters.</p>
