   <p>The National Federation has begun its task which is to send its petition, a bill of opposition directed against the Prohibition measures of Hepburn Dolliver, to all German Clubs throughout the nation. Besides the petition, the annexed text is included. " To the German Clubs of the United States! Compatriots! The German-American National Alliance, succeeded several years ago, in procuring a Pro-Boer (South African) petition, containing1, 500,000 signatures, and sent it to congress with the result that the proposed emigration laws were drafted in a more lenient manner, to wit: The education test was dispensed with; the hear-tax was reduced from $3 to $2. This Federation calls for the third time. It is a roll-call against the increased Prohibition enforcement. The present Hepburn bill, now before the House of Representatives, and an identical measure submitted to the Senate by Dolliver, are an infamous attack on personal liberty and the rights provided by the constitution.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Residents of Prohibition States shall be denied the right to obtain beer and wine from other states, by declaring it unlawful for railroads and transportation companies to carry intoxicating beverages into Prohibition States. German-American! The prohibition forces are concentrating their strength for the purpose of unfluencing the national laws. Every victory of theirs is just another slap to personal liberty and sane thinking. The life of the people will be ruled by and will produce the results we can expect from such hypocricy. Every failure of the Prohibitionists is a stepping stone for liberal views. Every German Club is therefore urgently requested to consider the enclosed petition as its own and to mail it to the representatives of the House and Senate, forthwith, after affixing the signatures of their respective presidents and secretaries. In the name of the German-American National Alliance, with German greetings, Dr. C. J. Hexamer, President Adolph Timm, Secretary.</p>
   <p>As German-American citizens of this nation we do not consider ourselves inferior to anyone, in so far as true moderation is concerned in everything <span class="page-break">\3</span>that appertains to the sacredness and purity of the home, the propriety and order of the State; but we are emphatically opposed to the passage of any law which destroys our privileges derived from personal liberty, and for the protection of these rights we stand united in a phalanx.</p>
   <p>As free and sovereign members of a free and sovereign people we believe that we have a right to shape our lives and homes as we consider proper. We have the right to drink our wine and beer, to use these beverages in our homes. We consider this right as important an adjunct to man's liberty as the right to purchase any other food product. The acceptance of the Hepburn and Dolliver bill would give the State in which we live the right to prevent us from placing a glass of beer or a bottle of wine, on our table, and the holy right of every man to create his own happiness, in his own way, would be at the mercy of the notions and fanaticism of those, who consider the consumption of spirituous beverages a crime! We German-Americans have never allowed the use of food and drink to develop into debauchery, nor have we molested the community, but we regard these proposals as an illegal interference of our human rights and liberty, and as the most misleading and unjust proposition which has ever been submitted to Congress. Therefore we beg that you will vote against these measures.</p>
