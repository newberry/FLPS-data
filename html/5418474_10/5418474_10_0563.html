   <p>In the magnificently decorated Cameo ballroom of the Morrison hotel, the German club celebrated yesterday afternoon its Christmas festival, at which members and their families were present in considerable numbers. A Christmas tree, ornamented with candles, gew gaws and pretty presents shone in the center of the room and the shouts, the laughter, and the jubilation of the children proved how well the arrangers understood the preparation of a festival for little ones.</p>
   <p>Judge Sherwat acted as Santa Claus, and distributed the presents to the boys and girls in a humorous manner. F. W. Siebel, the club president, made a speech, received with great applause, in which he explained to the children, the history of the Christ Child in a touching manner. Another speaker was Congressman Rathbone. Sweet, well known Christmas carols were afterwards sung, and happiness and satisfaction were reflected from the faces of grownups and little ones, when the beautiful festival came to an end. Oscar A. Stoffel merited great praise for the successful arrangement of the festivity.</p>
