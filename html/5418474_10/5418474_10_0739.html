   <p>Yesterday, the above Club held its 7th anniversary at the Roosevelt Hall. The exceptionally large crowd showed, that the club was able to obtain popularity throughout an extensive territory. Mr. Friedrich Maisold, the jovial president gave the festive speech, but contrary to accustomed proceedings he did not speak to the men of creation but addressed the ladies,"who have been ordained to weave heavenly roses into man's terrestrial existence." They are the guardians of German virtue, the protectors of the German language with the inevitable influence upon the growing youth and he admonished them to take an interest in the burning questions of our time, and to bring their influence to bear upon everything that Germans here aspire to and especially to show greater participation in Club activities. His words must have found appeal in the hearts of all, as he was greeted with continual applause.</p>
