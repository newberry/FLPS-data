   <p>Our ambassador to German, Jacob Gould Schurman, honored the spirit of his country on July 4th with a noble gesture, by serving as a bridge between the new and the old world. He made a pilgrimage alone to Weimar and spent a solemn hour at the grave of Goethe. A humble and plain deed, which in the excitement of the present day, would hardly be noticed.</p>
   <p>We like to celebrate the day of Independence actively and noisily; we burn fireworks, which next to inevitable accidents, causes nervous breakdowns on the part of many of our fully as patriotic citizens. We just like to celebrate our freedom from England with the most possible noise. That is the way we are.</p>
   <p>Ambassador Schurman is of a different type. To him, celebration of the Declaration of Independence indicates a pensive and thoughtful hour, dedicated to the great minds of the world, whose achievements created the spiritual basis and atmosphere of this singlular American national event.</p>
   
   <p>Goethe was a contemporary of our revolution; the spirit of time, which speaks out of his works, is the same spirit, which inflamed Washington with enthusiasm, and inspired Jefferson, Adams and the other members of the committee to draw up the Declaration of Independence. Goethe and America of those days were connected by many spiritual bridges, and it is good to remember that it was he who declared "America, you are better off". But who remembers today; that it was Europe after all, which populated America, ideally impregnated it and helped it to tis importance in the world.</p>
   <p>There are not many people, either here in this country or abroad, who are thinking of the spiritual significance of July the 4th, relating the Old with the New Continent! In Europe, they reproach us, and we sneer at Europe! And yet, the development of one would not have been possible without the help of the other. Every development must build bridges, and the bridge between America and Europe, and especially German, with its many relations, was a naturally necessary element, from which the development of both was built up.</p>
   <p>Just like the German immigrants of 1848, who were of strong help during the Civil War, so was the eager co-operation of the Intellectuals of Europe, at the end of the 18th century for the liberation of a nation of pioneers, from the yoke of foreign oppressors. This was what Ambassador Schurman on July 4th referred to, as he honored Germany's greatest master mind; that was the idea of the humble and beautiful gesture and a remembrance of a day of 50 years ago, when as a young enthusiastic American student at the University of Heidelberg, he celebrated for the first time the birthday of his country at the grave of this great German philosopher.</p>
   <p>He received from the spring of German philosophy the gift, to give his hours of rest a deeper power of thought; and to be a mediator between nations in the best sense of the word. Not only German-Americans, but the entire United States should be thankful to him for the hour of devotion at the grave at Weimar.</p>
