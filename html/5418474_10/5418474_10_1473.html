   <p>In the Fourth German Methodist Church, German Methodists held a patriotic celebration in connection with a protest against arms exports. In an interesting speech Dr. George L. Scherger, professor of history at Armour Institute, refuted all the accusations made against the Germans since the outbreak of the war. He explained the European war situtation and called attention to the circulars of the Germanistic Society, which answer pertinent questions of the day.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to issue a formal protest against the export of war materials to the Allies.</p>
   <p>The remainder of the program consisted of speeches by Pastor Hartl, the chairman, and Pastor Meck, of the Fourth Church. There was singing by the community <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>choir, and Pastor Meck recited a poem which he had composed. Mr. Max rendered a song by Koerner entitled "Vater, ich rufe Dich!" [Translator's note: Theodore Koerner was a well-known German poet during the time of the Napoleonic wars. His songs inspired the German people to liberate themselves from the yoke of the Corsican.]</p>
