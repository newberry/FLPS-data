   <p>In accordance with an old tradition, the nation celebrated yesterday the annual day of Thanksgiving. Chicago took a leading position among the neighboring sister-cities, and a festive mood prevailed everywhere. Not only did we celebrate because of the ordinance to close factories and stores on that day, but we celebrated because we are convinced that it is fitting and appropriate to do so.</p>
   <p>Who is so poor and miserable that he could not spare a few hours for a pleasant change in this life of labor, difficulties, and disillusionments?</p>
   <p>Those who really walk the thorny path of despair were refreshed and encouraged on this day through the kindness of human beings, who doubled their joy by being charitable to the needy. It was a day of well-doing, a day of manifesting love for our unfortunate neighbors. Undoubtedly, many went forward with new courage and hope, having met the angel of friendship and charity.</p>

   <p>Even if this happy holiday were only a self-delusion, it would, nevertheless, be a lovely dream, leaving behind only favorable consequences for even grotesque humor helps men to rise above difficulties.</p>
   <p>However, the majority of Chicagoans were in a happy frame of mind. Our city enjoys a healthy growth, and a steady progress. We had a very good year. There were no epidemics or calamities with great human losses. Of course there are faults and shortcomings in our happiness, but we know how to adjust ourselves to the inevitable. There is no misfortune which is without a ray of hope. We have in the midst of a deep social peace, and all classes honestly desire to improve their conditions gradually.</p>
   <p>The day of Thanksgiving is an institution of the church. It corresponds to the German harvest festival.</p>

   <p>On such days old and young feel a deeper sense of human fellowship. Friend is seeking friend, and feels a tranquilizing effect when he realizes that he is not alone and forsaken. The social instinct demands its rights, and everything conducive to entertainment and happiness is carried on. The day of Thanksgiving, indeed, takes on various peculiarities in a cosmopolitan city, and in a country where religious and individual liberty prevails.</p>
   <p>For one, it is a day of introspection; for the other, a day of exultation amidst friends and relatives. Every one acts according to his own tendencies or training.</p>
