   <p>A well-planned festival in true patriotic spirit, commemorating the hundredth anniversary of Illinois as a state, was held last night by the members of the Chicago Lincoln Club in their club house. Lieutenant Governor John G. Oglesby participated as guest of honor and was the main speaker. The Chicago Singverein brightened the evening with songs. Dances were given by pupils of the ballet school of Mrs. Marie Yung. An orchestra concert and solo song recitals were part of a many-featured program which also included a supper.</p>
   <p>The evening entertainment began with the singing of the "Star-Spangled Banner" after which several orchestra renditions were heard. This was followed by "Deep River" and "Hail to the United Country," sung by the Singverein from the gallery and conducted by Mr. Wilhelm Boeppler. The first song mentioned, especially, made such a deep impression by its solemn air and the splendid manner in which it was sung by the Singverein, that even Lieutenant Governor Oglesby made reference to it in his speech later. Then followed dances by ballet students which were greatly appreciated, and then the inspiring song, "Follow the Flag," sung by Mrs. Elsa Deubert and the chorus, and "Lift Thine Eyes," sung beautifully by the ladies' chorus. Solo dances were given by Dorothy Gnaedinger, the talented prima ballerina of the ballet school. This young and ambitious artist recently returned from a successful tour with the Thavius Orchestra.</p>
   <p>This ended the first part of the evening, creating a festive mood. The second part of the program, which was taken up with the centennial celebration itself, was opened by an address of the president of the club, Mr. Ernest J. Kruetgen, who spoke as follows:</p>
   
   <p>"As president of the Chicago Lincoln Club I have the privilege and the pleasure of extending a hearty welcome on behalf of the Club to all of you.</p>
   <p>"We are gathered here tonight to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the State of Illinois and we follow not only the custom, but also the command of our own hearts and our patriotism when we celebrate the birthday of this state which we love so much and which is closest to our heart, our great State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>"Our Club has been in existence for more than half of the hundred years which have passed since Illinois became a state. It has special reason to celebrate the birthday of our state since it bears the name of Illinois' greatest son, Abraham Lincoln. Since this is so it may not be out of place, if I grant a request which has been made and repeat a brief history of our Club, taken from a recent speech.</p>
   <p>"More than fifty years ago, the Chicago Lincoln Club was born as a child of our patriotic Americans of German descent and, at the bier of Abraham Lincoln, was given the name 'Germania Maennerchor'.</p>
   <p>"When the great and noble Lincoln died by the hand of his assassin, not only the whole nation but the entire world was grief-stricken and when the body of the immortal Martyr-President lay in state in our City Hall, on the way to its last resting place in its home state, the American singers of German descent, who revered Lincoln so much, gathered together and founded the Maennerchor to honor the deceased President. Thus the Chicago Lincoln Club was established.</p>
   <p>"At Lincoln's bier the new chorus sang German songs in the German language. This patriotic deed speaks for itself and proves, irrefutably, that music and song are international in character; it further proves that the heart, patriotism, and especially American patriotism, make no distinction as far as race or language is concerned. What name would fit our club better, would be more in harmony with its history, than the name of Lincoln? What name would be more appropriate at the present time than that of the man who would again, if he were now alive, exhort his countrymen to act 'with malice towards none and charity to all'?</p>
   <p>"Motivated by the desire to honor Abraham Lincoln, we have named our club the "Chicago Lincoln Club," but what's in a name if we do not show ourselves worthy of it by emulating the high ideals and principles of the man whose name we have assumed; and if we do not prove, again and again, that we are true, loyal Americans?</p>
   <p>"My friends, we Americans of German descent do not regard our citizenship as a comfortable piece of clothing that we wear when the sun is shining and hasten to exchange for another one when stormy weather comes. Just as Washington led Americans of British blood into their struggle against Great Britain; just as Lincoln called Americans of the North to fight against their brothers in the South to preserve the Union; so have Americans of German blood been called upon to take part in our country's struggle against the people of their own race; and our sons and brothers have fought for the Stars and Stripes, for your flag and my flag, for your country and mine. Uncle Sam called, and Americans of German descent loyally answered the call.</p>
   <p>"The history of the United States is conclusive proof that Americans of German descent have willingly, and at all times, made every necessary sacrifice to uphold the honor of our country. Their attitude is still the same today.</p>
   <p>"Faithful and loyal Americans as they are, they cherish the memory of their childhood days, their literature, and their music. A man may give his sons for his adopted country, or may even shed the last drop of his blood for it, but the man who could change the love for his own, his native land into hatred could never become a good and trustworthy citizen of any other country. Uncle Sam makes no distinction in citizenship. For all naturalized as well as native citizens the door of American opportunity is open, and all that is asked in return is decency as a citizen and loyalty to the ideals and principles of which our flag is a symbol.</p>
   <p>"Americans of German descent, like all other Americans, reconciled themselves to the position which confronted our country, in the spirit of Jefferson, who said in 1812: 'If war is forced upon us we must abandon all differences of opinion and stand by our country like one man.'</p>
   <p>"They are also animated by the spirit which caused President Wilson to say, in 1917: 'The supreme test of a nation is at hand. We all must speak, act, and serve together.'</p>
   <p>"Now is the time to abolish all hyphens, the time to co-operate, the time to fan the flames under the melting pot, that the true American may emerge from the test tube. Now is the time to appeal to all citizens to aid the country, not as hyphenated citizens, but as American citizens, and to fight for American ideals.</p>
   <p>"May the great principles of our Constitution contribute in bringing to the world that glorious condition which will inspire every human heart to sing, with deepest devotion, the hymn of our nation: 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee, Free [sic] Land of Liberty, of Thee I Sing!'"</p>
   <p>At the close of this speech, which was warmly applauded, "America" was sung, after which the orchestra played several numbers. Then Mr. Kruetgen introduced Lieutenant Governor Oglesby, the son of a famous governor of Illinois. Mr. Oglesby said, among other things:</p>
   <p>"I congratulate the Chicago Lincoln Club on its choice of a name which is revered by all free peoples in the world as the herald of liberty and democracy. It is the glory of Illinois, this name which has closely become associated with our state. Illinois has been the scene of important events which were of basic significance in the establishment of the Union. The pride in our past should go hand in hand with the inspiration it can give us regarding the services which we are to render our country. The admission of Illinois into the Union was not a single event, but there were four stages by which it was completed: the Act of Congress of April 18, 1818, by which organization of the state was approved; the Constitutional Convention in Kaskaskia; the election of the first state government; and the assembly of the first legislature on October 5, 1818. Of all the memorial celebrations which have been held all over the state, the ones that took place on October 5 and 6 at Springfield, dedicating the monuments of Lincoln and Douglas, and the laying of the cornerstone of the Centennial Building, have been, perhaps, the most significant. In the present great struggle we are making every effort to preserve liberty and to maintain for our country that place among nations to which she is entitled. The great cultural progress of the last hundred years will serve as an inspiring example for those that come after us. Just as the pioneers blazed a trail through the wilderness, so are we progressing, inspired by patriotism, self-sacrifice, and love of country. Just criticism is necessary at times; it is the privilege of American citizens, but let us not forget that it must be based on facts, must be helpful and constructive. Let us use good judgment and consideration in the criticism of our officials, and not put obstacles in the way of our government by nagging and jealousy. Our state is the second in importance within the Union; she has proved her worth in the Liberty Loan drive and in other war activities. Three hundred thousand of her sons are serving as soldiers and sailors, and of these, fifty-five per cent were volunteers. We cannot all have the privilege of serving at the front but everybody can do his utmost for those who are at the front. Let our boys know that our country is worth fighting for and, if necessary, dying for. Nobody is entitled to its blessings who is not equally willing to come to its defense. We at home would not be keeping faith if we permitted our government to become paternalistic and bureaucratic. At the present time, civil authority has been subordinated to military authority, but only in order to safeguard conditions under which civil power may again rule. Better days are coming, but we must not relax our efforts to preserve freedom and democracy. When the war is over, and our boys come home, we must have a clear conscience when we look into their eyes and tell them that we, too, have done our duty. This indeed is our supreme test."</p>
   <p>After the applause had died away, the audience sang the first verse of the Illinois State anthem and five ballet dancers danced the "Dance of Illinois," taken from the performance at the Centennial celebration.</p>
   
   <p>Afterwards, Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, chairman of the Centennial Celebration Committee, recalled in his address interesting events from the history of the State and talked about the successful activities of the Committee, which had existed six years. He announced the publication on the occasion of the jubilee of a work dealing with the history of the State from the time of its discovery up to the present.</p>
   <p>A song recital, "Abundance of Illinois," by Mr. Miklos R. Redey and the ladies' chorus, and the song, "America," concluded the celebration. Afterwards there was dancing.</p>
