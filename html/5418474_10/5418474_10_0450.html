   <p>The Bund of the Friends of the New Germany held a public debate, last Wednesday night, in the Lincoln Turnhalle. The affair was attended by about five hundred persons. The main speaker was Captain Peter V. Armstrong, erstwhile officer in the Russian and German armies, who spoke on the topic, "The Enemies of America". The speaker showed that, concerning historical proof for the causes of the present general misery of the world and the threatening peril of Bolshevism, he is an authority not to be underestimated.</p>
   <p>The second speaker was Wilhelm Schoenherr, whose topic, "A walk through the world," was timely. The humorous, yet impressive, manner of his speech won lively applause from the audience.</p>
   <p>Herr Bauer, accompanied on the piano by Frau Reher, sang Wagner's "Lied an den Abendstern," and the ballad, "Die drei Wanderer". The renditions were excellent, and both artists reaped the ovations they merited.</p>

   <p>At last, the gauleiter (district leader) of the Middle West, Fritz Gissible, took the floor for a few brief remarks, which culminated in an appeal to all to turn the approaching first Gantag (popular assembly of the province), scheduled to meet October 20th in the Palmer House, into a powerful manifestation for German nationalism.</p>
