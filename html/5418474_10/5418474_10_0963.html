   <p>In the meeting which the Chicago Turngemeinde held last evening, Mr. Friedrich Hartmann presented a letter of recommendation and a testimony by Dr. F. Weitze, vice-chairman of the Aid Society For German Immigrants. Dr. Weitze states that Mr. Hartmann is twenty years old, that he came to America eight months ago, and that he is suffering from chronic heart disease and bleeding of the lungs, resulting from an accident which occurred while he was employed drilling a well. Dr. Weitze appeals to the public to aid the young man, and so the Chicago Turngemeinde voted to give him twenty-five dollars, and to publish his request for help.</p>
   <p>We ask all charitably inclined Germans of Chicago to assist in supporting Mr. Hartmann, because we are firmly convinced that he is in dire need and is worthy of our benevolence. We sincerely hope that this appeal will not be in vain.</p>
