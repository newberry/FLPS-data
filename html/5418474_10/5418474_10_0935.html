   <p>A social German Club was founded yesterday in the house of the Nescio Club at the corner of Clark and Ohio Streets. Anyone with a good reputation may become a member provided he is not rejected by seven who are already members. Provisory members of the board of Directors are, Mr. C. Prussing, A. C. Hesing, John Seba, August Blum, and P. D. Derves. The most important Germans of the city especially those of the Northside, intend to join the Club.</p>
