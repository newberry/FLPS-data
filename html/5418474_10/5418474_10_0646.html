   <p>Bread cards were introduced in Germany on February 21, 1915, exactly one year ago yesterday. The leader of our German Labor Aid Society of Chicago introduced the bread here two months ago. One of our largest German bakeries produces it now regularly according to the original chemical formula. "K-bread" is baked under the constant supervision of Dr. M. Niven, a circumstance which gives the public adequate assurance of obtaining full value for their money (ten cents a loaf), as well as proper hygienic safeguards. The new product may be obtained at the office of the German Labor Aid, Room 76, 154 W. Randolph Street, and at G. W. Cramer's, 3434 N. Halsted Street; the Bismarck Hotel, the Kaiserhof, etc. [A list of twelve places given]</p>
