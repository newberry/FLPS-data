   <p>The Turnverein Fortschritt held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 1826 Milwaukee Avenue to protest against the Blair Bill.</p>
   <p>The hall was filled to a great extent although more people could have come to the meeting. Paul Grottkav was the chief speaker. He branded Christian religion as inimical to culture and the Blair Bill as brutal and reactionary. At the same time about 100 persons attended a meeting held under the auspices of the Turnverein "Teutonia" in Schumacher's Hall. The purpose of this meeting was the same.</p>
   
   <p>The attendance would have been larger if at the same time a very important citizens' meeting had not taken place in Oswald's Hall. The following resolution was finally adopted:</p>
   <p>"This mass meeting demands from the general assembly of the State of Illinois that no priority rights shall be granted to any religious denomination and that all church property within the state shall be subject to taxation."</p>
