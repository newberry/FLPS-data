   <p>The German-American Citizens Alliance of North America. This is the name of The Projected German National Association.</p>
   <p>In response to our announcement wherein we quoted Karl Wohlfeld's proclamation to Germans to organize a national alliance of all clubs, thirty members met at Mueller's Hall, 45 No. Clark Street. Mr. Wohlfeld gave a brief outline of his plans and the association's purpose. All his listeners were indeed enthusiastic about a matter of such magnitude, but the details remained somewhat obscure; it is to be clarified by a selected committee within the next fortnight. Much time was consumed in useless arguing about the name of this venture. Eventually, the most important point was solved by Mr. Schlenker of the Schwaebischer Unterstuetzungs Verein, who suggested the very appropriate title. German-American Citizens Alliance of North America. All, except two of the visitors, called as individuals only. The two exceptions functioned as official representatives of their own clubs. (particular name not given). Receipts: $6.60.</p>
