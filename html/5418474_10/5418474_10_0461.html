   <p>The German Club of Chicago held its annual summer festival and picnic yesterday in Ehrhardt's Grove, as has been its custom for years. Many members and their friends participated. Almost before noon a large number of automobiles had come, and during the early afternoon a regular migration of people set in. It is probable that toward evening over a thousand people were in the beautiful, big park on the bank of the Des Plaines River.</p>
   <p>They all got their money's worth, too, thanks to the efforts of the arrangements committee, whose chairman was William F. Jacobs. The program was so well filled that there was not a tiresome mement. There were sack races and baseball, golf and tugs of war, and in between something good to eat and drink. A man cannot very well ask for anything more....</p>
