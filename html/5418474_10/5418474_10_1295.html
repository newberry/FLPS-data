   <p>Christmas presents were distributed yesterday afternoon at Uhlich's Orphanage, located at the corner of Burlington and Center Streets. Many members of Chicago's Lutheran parishes were present. In connection therewith let it be said, that the appeal of the asylum's executive board brought generous response from the Germans. Donors were very liberal, and so many presents were received that many were saved for another occasion.</p>
   <p>Members of the board, and several ladies, decorated the Christmas tree, which was mounted in the sewing room. The tree was provided by Miss Bauer, the Kindergarten teacher.</p>
   <p>The festivities started at 4 P. M. and several hundred people were present. The orphans, twenty-one girls and forty boys, marched from the schoolroom into the festival room, surrounded the tree and sang, "Vom Himmel Hoch Da Komm Ich Her". Pastor Hartmann preached an inspiring sermon and ended with a prayer.</p>

   <p>Then the children sang "Ein Koenig Kommt Aus Zion," at the conclusion of which Reverend Gottlieb Blankenhahn, in charge of the Orphanage, had the children recite the prophesies of the Bible up to the time of Christ's birth.</p>
   <p>The tree was lit while the children sang "Welche Morgenroethe Wallet Himmelab," and, after a few more words were said about the age-old festival, the children formed into ranks again and marched and sang.</p>
   <p>Then the presents were distributed. At first a bag of candy and nuts, finally a toy commensurate with the child's age. The children played until 9 P. M. and then went to bed. We may well assume that all had pleasant dreams, as all departed in a very happy mood.</p>
   <p>Finally Reverend Mr. Hartmann addressed the visitors. The festival was undoubtedly one of the most outstanding affairs of its kind we have witnessed this year.</p>
