   <p>The St. Bonifacius Congregation, under its new leader Preacher, Rev. A. Evers, is making preparations to build a new schoolhouse, as the old one became too small for the increasing number of pupils. The construction of the building will be started this coming spring. In order to boost the construction fund, plans have been made for a fair and carnival at Schoenhofen's Hall in October.</p>
   <p>A large attendance of guests from German clubs and societies is expected.</p>
