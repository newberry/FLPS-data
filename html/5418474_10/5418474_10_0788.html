   <p>The officers of the German Veterans Club of Chicago were inducted into office yesterday at the first meeting of the New Year, held at the North Side Turner Hall during the afternoon. Two former presidents, Joseph Forcher, and Joseph Schlenker, inducted the new leaders. During the course of the proceedings, Martin Gass, treasurer of the German Veterans Alliance of North America, made the encouraging announcement that the treasury of the Alliance has $16,000 available for death benefits. The relatives of deceased members receive $300. The per capita rate is $6 per year. He added that three German Veterans associations have been affiliated with the Alliance since the last general session, and that a substantial increase may be expected in the near future.</p>
   <p>After the business session, the meeting turned into a social affair under the guidance of Mr. Tanzer, the new president. He suggested that a special chairman be elected for the occasion, and the well-known "Barbarossa," Fritz Lindemann, was selected on the strength of his often-proven capacity. Then followed dancing, lively and jovial, to say nothing of the homage paid to barley brew. There was no lack of humorous recitations; such exponents in the art as Albert Luettke, Franz Damske, Stein, and many more, took good care of that.</p>
   <p>Other clubs sent delegates, among them police officer Max Heidelmeier, a former German cavalry captain.</p>
