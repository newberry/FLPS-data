   <p>The agitation for the installation of a Postal Savings Bank which was instigated by the Chicago Turn-Germeinde finds general support in all parts of the country. City councils and other public administrations took up the matter, and Chairman Julius Goldzier received daily reports in which the movement is recommended.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goldzier has asked President Roosevelt to discuss the plan in his next annual message and he has received an affirmative answer. The petitions to Congress for installation of the system have received about 30,000 signatures in Chicago and vicinity, but also from out of town circular letters with many signatures are coming in already.</p>
