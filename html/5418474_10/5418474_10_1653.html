   <p>The first German Baptist Church comprising 540 members assembled yesterday to celebrate the laying of the cornerstone for their new and stately house of worship at the corner of Paulina and Superior Streets. Not only members of the church were present, but a great many visitors had come. The first part of the celebration was conducted in English but the more important activities were conducted in German. The pastor of the church, Rev. J. Meier, preached an appropriate sermon. Then followed the laying and dedication of the cornerstone by the architect Mr. F. Alschlaeger.</p>
   <p>This splendid, two-story building with one large tower and three corner towers is to be finished before winter, including the interior, so that the church can move from their old place into this magnificent and considerably larger house of worship. The cost of construction is estimated at $35,000. The building-site or ground was purchased by the church several years ago for $6,000. There is $25,000 in the building fund of the church. The administration committee consists of the following members: E. W. Benning, H. Peters, Ch. Stubenrauch, G. Schneider, W. Grosse, E. Alschlaeger, and F. Schaeel.</p>
