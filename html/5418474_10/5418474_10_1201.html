   <p>The veterans of the German regiments, the 24th (Hecker) and the 82nd, were unable to visit the graves of their dead comrades, and to commemorate this occasion on one of the cemeteries this year. Instead they assembled yesterday at Hecker's Regimental headquarters 171 N. Clark Street. There they honored the memory of their fallen comrades by speeches and by exchanging reminiscences. The headquarters were elegantly decorated with flags and banners. Many veterans of the 24th and the 82nd regiments were present, and several comrades from Springfield and Elgin also attended.</p>
