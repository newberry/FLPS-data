   <p>Under the auspicies of the German branch of the Socialist party, in conjunction with the Reichsbanner and the Workers' Gym and Sport Organization of Chicago, the leader of the Republican Schutzbund and the Workers Defense, Dr. Julius Deutsch, who fled from Austria following the unsuccessful Socialist uprising last February, gave a lecture in the upper hall of the Social Turner Hall, 1651 Belmont Avenue, on the subject, "The February combats and present-day conditions in Austria".</p>
   <p>As he was presented by the chairman, Alderman Dreifuss, Dr. Deutsch was enthusiastically greeted by the audience that filled the hall to capacity. His discussions were listened to with tense interest, although in the main they were dealing more with the failures of the Socialist movement during the exciting years of the post-war period in the lands of the former double monarchy than with the results which, according to the speaker's own words, must be reserved for the future.</p>
   
   <p>In brief outline Dr. Deutsch then explained the conditions which, in his statement, are becoming more and more unbearable for the workingman who is forced to pick up the challenge thrown into his face by capitalism and fascism and to defend himself as much as possible against complete subjection.</p>
   <p>"And in spite of all temporary drawbacks and failures," the speaker continued, "we will never rest nor enjoy peace until Fascism has been thoroughly swept from Austria, and the red banner of Socialism has been established to wave over the entire land."</p>
   <p>In this connection Dr. Deutsch appealed to the comrades of the whole world to support with all their might the cause of their brothers in Austria, because a victory for the latter would bring only advantages for them too, advantages that can be brought by nothing but true Socialism alone.</p>
   <p>Before Dr. Deutsch took the floor, chairman Dreifuss asked Comrade M. Kryzki from Milwaukee to say a few words to the audience. Comrade Kryzki is the 
chairman of the Socialist party of America, and came to Chicago as substitute for Heinrich Bartel, the originally named speaker, who, because of illness, was prevented from attending the Deutsch meeting. Kryzki admonished the audience to make the proper uses from the statements made by the main speaker, because conditions similar to those which led to revolutions in Austria and Germany are also apparent in this country.</p>
   <p>The Sangerbund Freiheit and the mixed choir of the organized workers' singing clubs rendered a few songs under the direction of Hy. Kuhl. They were a welcome addition to the evening. Following the speech by Dr. Deutsch a collection was made for the benefit of the Austrian comrades. Later the audience was given an opportunity to engage in debates, which brought further information in the form of answers to the questions of the guests.</p>
