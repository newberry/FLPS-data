   <p>Yesterday the German society of Chicago held its semiannual meeting. Only a few members attended.</p>
   <p>Since there is so little money in the treasury, it was proposed that a ball or a fair be held. The members decided on a ball, and authorized the executive board to make arrangements for a future fair or concert.</p>
   <p>Mr. Charles Verghoe was elected treasurer by acclamation.</p>
   <p>Upon recommendation of the agent of the Society his semiannual report was read; it was adopted, and the members voted to publish it. Adjournment followed.</p>
