   <p>NO EMPEROR'S DONATION</p>
   <p>During the convention at Milwaukee the proposal was made, to make a donation to the German Emperor and Empress on account of their silver wedding. Meanwhile it has been reported from Berlin, that their majesties do not wish for any presents and that they will only accept contributions for benevolent purposes. Though this would only refer to citizens of the German Empire, as for instance the Yacht Club of New York, the delegates thought it best, that the formation of a new fund for the support of local, old or needy German veterans under the protectorate of the German Emperor and Empress would be the best solution of this question.</p>
   <p>The necessary steps in this affair will be taken by the Central Committee. According to a resolution of the convention the Veterans Festival and next year's convention will take place in Dubuque, Iowa.</p>
