   <p>The last few editorials of the "Tribune are devoted to the know-nothing theme namely, that the English language is the predominant and the only language which is used by our Chicago citizens. The editorial contends that the forty thousand persons speaking German at the present time will eventually die out and with them will cease the German language in Chicago, for, their offspring have naturally been Americanized.</p>
   <p>Contrary to this statement is the fact that the majority of German parents send their children to German (denominational) schools and that German immigration outnumbers that of various other nationalities (meaning the total number). The Federal State Census of 1880 aids us to disprove the Tribume's statement. According to this there were: 607,524 citizens in Cook County, of which 365,109 were born in Chicago, in Illinois and elsewhere in the United States; and 242,415 foreign-born residents, with the following list:</p>

   <p>The majority of the Bohemia, Polish, Holland and the Luxemburg immigrants know German before they leave their country; others again learn the language from their co-workers much sooner than they learn English. The immigration from the Scandinavian countries was as follows:</p>

   <p>The German people immigrate almost to any country, therefore it would be safe to say that five percent of those immigrants grown up in British dominions speak the German language. The majority of German churches conduct also parochial schools, therefore we presume that of the 35,000 Chicago children attending denominational schools there are at least 20,000 of German parentage.</p>
   <p>It is well known that a large number of American marriages remain childless; figures show that on the average there are only two children to each family; in contrast to this the married German woman of Chicago rears on the average a family of five children. The American population is declining as the result of aversion toward marriage.</p>
   <p>Since the Federal State Census was taken, Chicago has grown considerably which leads us to presume that there are as many persons living in this city now, as at that time in the whole of Cook county. The immigrants generally rear large families. Chicago Germans surpass 150,000 persons and besides, the Slavic nations speak German too.</p>
