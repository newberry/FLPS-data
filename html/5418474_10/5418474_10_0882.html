   <p>The club of "German '48 and '49 Patriots" yesterday celebrated the 40th anniversary of the revolution in Germany. The old veterans were reminded of those trouble-some times when they had fought for Germany's liberty and unity.</p>
   <p>The president of the club, Mr. A. Hottinger, made the statement that the German patriots of New York had decided twenty years ago to celebrate in memory of those stirring times and hold a festival annually. Chicago, the New York of the west, made arrangement for the first general and large festival fifteen years ago, when the German champions of liberty came together for that purpose.</p>
