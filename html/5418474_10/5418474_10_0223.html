   <p>Germany got very bad thanks for its friendly indulgence. The United States, as the most interested country, was at liberty to preserve peace and order in Mexico. No objections were raised at their offending international rights on land or sea. American citizens had to be brought to safety by German and British ships. No difficulties have been made by European Powers against the American blockade at Vera Cruz, though the commercial interests of these countries have been largely destroyed. Only hate and stupidity can try to place the faults, and responsibility on other shoulders. All other ports besides the blockaded one, were left free for international trade and traffic and if the foreign countries took advantage of this, it was their right. It is very regrettable, the after all the friendly services Germany has rendered to the United States in this matter during the past, there still exists the German American incident. The cause of this does not lay with the German ships or their companies, they only made use of their rights. The German ships only acted as express agents in the unloading of arms for American manufacturers. Who is the guilty party?</p>
