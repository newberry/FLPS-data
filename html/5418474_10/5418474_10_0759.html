   <p>At the meeting held yesterday, sixty persons were present to give an opportunity to the president and secretary of the German-American National Union to explain their objects and views to the delegates of the German associations of Chicago and induce them to join the Union.</p>
   <p>Mr. Emil Mannhardt, secretary of the German-American Historical Society of Illinois called the meeting to order and introduced Dr. Carl Johann Jacob Hexamer of Philadelphia, the president of the German-American National Union. The speaker compared the formation and development of the German-American National Union with an avalanche. One day in Philadelphia it was officially forbidden to a German veterans' club to bury a dead comrade on Sunday, with music. As this had been permitted to a grand army organization, the favoritism caused great disappointment in German circles. The German clubs held a meeting, the Central Union was formed and such a sharp protest was lodged, that the authorities had to give in. The Union thus organized remained as a permanent institution with the object of furthering all common German interests. In other towns of Pennsylvania, sister organizations were formed and in the course of a few years they also arose in neighboring states; all joined the mother organization which quickly grew in membership and importance. With the Boer War the Union for the first time intervened in a national affair. In cooperation with the Assistance Committee of the Boers, the Union procured one and one-half million signatures for a petition to Congress to take a position against the oppression of the Boers by England. If the Boers could have continued their heroic fight for another three months the desired intervention would have been effective.</p>
   <p>With complete success the National Union has acted later for the repulse of the Hepburn-Dolliver proposal, by which the temperance supporters asked a law to forbid the transportation of alcoholic beverages from non-prohibition territory into one of prohibition. The speaker pointed out the importance of history teaching in the public schools of the country; that the deeds of the German element in the course of time should be recorded and taught to the coming generations with the proper evaluation of their merits in the development of the country. As regards the War of the Revolution, much is taught in the public schools about the bad Hessian. Nothing, however, is mentioned in the history courses in the public schools that the Germans in Pennsylvania already had united against the enslavery of the Negroes. When in cultured New England, witches were still roasted on the fire, the Germans of Germantown and suburbs in the year 1776 stood up united for the cause of independence; that at the time when the cause of the Free States was despaired of during the cold winter days of Valley Forge, German farmers fed Washington and his army; that only by an addition of 1,500 new fighters from the farmers was it possible in the Spring to continue the fight against the British Army and bring it to a victorious finish. Also little is said of the fact that during the Civil War, 200,000 Germans fought in the army and effected the future existence of the Union and to make an end of Negro slavery. But the coming generation should be informed and the descendants of the German immigrants should know that they have no reason to be ashamed and this will be the work of the National Union and it will resist all machinations to destroy German liberty by ignorance and bigotry.</p>
   <p>The speech earned much applause and appreciation and Mr. Mannhardt represented Mr. Timm, the secretary of the National Union. He proved that the National Union is represented in about thirty states of the United States of America and that in about twelve states all of the city German associations (about twenty-eight) have joined bodily; and in about eighteen other states, over eighty individual ones have joined. Mr. Timm gave a review of the activity of the Union and mentioned that it was due to their intervention last year that old General Osterhans obtained from Congress the rank of a Major General in the regular army with the right of a pension.</p>
   <p>The meeting then organized, electing Mr. Mannhardt as chairman and the former assistant coroner, E. T. Rucker, as secretary. Attorney Christ Meier, the former civil service commissioner, proposed the following resolution: "Resolved, that the German citizens and delegates of the German associations in Chicago assembled here declare themselves in agreement with the objects of the German-American National Union of the United States of America; that they recommend the joining of the German citizens and associations and that they think it necessary to appoint a committee for this purpose immediately." A proposal to change this resolution that it should be left to the Union of German citizens of Chicago and suburbs to consider the merging of the associations of Chicago with the National Union was made by Mr. John Kolling and caused a long debate but was withdrawn and the Meier proposition was adopted. The chairman appointed as members of the preliminary committee Mr. Adolf Georg, Rudolf Seifert, John Neumann, General Hermann Lieb, and Iriz Nebel. They will assemble Monday afternoon in the Bismark Hotel and will bring their number to fifty persons and submit a plan of organization. Mr. John Kolling assented to journey to the convention as a representative of the meeting, which opens tomorrow in Indianapolis and jointly with the others he will promote the "German Day" in a great celebration, the day afterwards. Mr. G. F. Hummel will accompany him. The State Union of the German associations of Indianapolis had sent felicitations by telegrams, which were read in the meeting.</p>
