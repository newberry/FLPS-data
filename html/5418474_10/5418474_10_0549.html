   <p>"May is here and the trees are breaking out," everybody must have sung this once in his life, when the first warm breeze of May struck his nose. The members of the Rhenish society celebrated yesterday evening in the Social Turner Hall a jolly May festival, which was attended by a number of guests. Last winter's festivals have shown, that it is not difficult with the Rheinlanders to get into the right spirit and already at the beginning of the festival yesterday evening a jolliness could be observed. A good orchestra played gay tunes, and it could be seen that in the month of May not only the trees, but often humans also break out.</p>
   <p>Dancing usually causes hunger and thirst. The former could be easily satisfied, but with thirst it was different. Although the committee did everything in its power, but "times and circumstances decide the man" and to a real May festival belongs a genuine May bowl. But as we are living in a <span class="page-break">\2</span>different time, they drank with closed eyes, lemonade, and it is said that some got tipsy from it.</p>
   <p>The height of the festival was reached, when the May queen was crowned and when they parted at an early hour, old and young were sure, that they had enjoyed a few very pleasant hours through the Rhenish Society.</p>
