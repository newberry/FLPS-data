   <p>The 148th birthday of our Nation was celebrated by the community. After a parade of about half an hour, the school children and the other excursionists boarded a special train of the elevated Railroad which brought them to the end of the Douglas Park Line, and there they continued by truck to Bergmann's Grove. Delightful weather prevailed.</p>

   <p>Regardless of the unfavorable weather, the festival at the Children's Home in Addison was well attended. An extra train brought many of the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>guests, but most of them came in automobiles. Pastor Hoeckler, president of the Friends of Children Society opened the religious service, and Pastor Karl Schmidt delivered the sermon in German at half past two, while Pastor Kowert spoke in English later. Walter Wendt's Male chorus sang two suitable selections. The children of the Home also showed their vocal accomplishments. The institution cares for eighty children at present. Forty applicants could not be accepted for lack of space. The Society decided to build an addition as soon as possible.</p>
