   <p>We have received a request from Mr. James W. Scott, chief editor of the Chicago Herald for a contribution to cover the expenses of the Centennial celebration on Apr. 30th. Here is our answer to this request:</p>
   <p>The Arbeiter Zeitung and its readers, having spent many thousands of dollars during the last few years in the vain attempt to prevent a traitorous clique from violating the constitution, have reached the painful conclusion that, as a matter of fact, the constitution is not in force any longer. Considering this lamentable state of affairs we deny, that our citizens have any reason to celebrate this Centennial. They should on the contrary repent in sack-cloth and ashes for their shameful departure from the principles held sacred by the fathers of the republic.</p>
   <p>As repentant sinners they might at some future day find forgiveness, but as yet a meeting for celebration is out of order.</p>
