   <p>With considerable tension and great enthusiasm, the Catholics of the United States--and of the whole world--look forward to the coming Eucharistic Congress which will take place in this city from June 20 to June 24. In cabled messages received today, the participation of a large number of German prelates of high rank was announced. Among them will be Prince Aloys von Loewenstein, president of the General Assembly of German Catholics, and His Eminence Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, who is the leader of the German section.</p>
   <p>Further, the visit of two former German chancellors is announced: Dr. Joseph Wirth, chancellor of the republic in 1923 and ex-chancellor Wilhelm Marx. The first mentioned will deliver one of the main addresses before the Congress. Accompanying Cardinal von Faulhaber will be two other representatives of the German hierarchy, Carl Fritz, archbishop of Freiburg, and Wilhelm Berning, <span class="page-break">\2</span>bishop of Osnabrueck.</p>
   <p>The economic and financial situation in Germany, which is still in a rather sad state, renders a more general German participation impossible, as can be seen from papers which arrived recently. It is, for the time being, not at all possible to give exact figures regarding the number of German delegates. However, the German participation may by no means be a small one.</p>
   <p>Austria, too, is going to do its best to send delegates to the Congress. Preliminary cable reports state that Monsignor Ignatius Seipel, former Austrian chancellor, will be one of the speakers at the Congress. This is going to be the chancellor's first trip to America seeing, as he does, in his visit to the Eucharistic Congress the realization of his most ardent wish, to know the United States personally and to express Austria's gratitude for the help so generously given during the time of grave need.</p>

   <p>The leader of the Austrian delegation will be His Eminence Cardinal Friedrich Piffl, Archbishop of Vienna. Among others, there will be in his entourage Sigismund Waitz, vicar bishop of Brixen, and Adam Hefter, bishop of Gurk, both highly respectable princes of the Church. As Monsignor Seipel has perfect command of the English language, he will make his address to the Congress in the language of the country, while Cardinal Piffl will speak in German.</p>
   <p>The German section, presided over by Bishop Joseph Schrembs of Cleveland, Ohio, is exceedingly busy, having made ample preparations for the reception not only of the German guests from abroad, but from all parts of the United States as well. In addition, the German section (of Chicago) made preparations for mass meetings in the Armory Hall on Broadway. These meetings will undoubtedly turn into imposing demonstrations.</p>
   <p>Ample care will be taken for the billeting of the German guests. It has been stated that rooms have been secured in one Chicago hotel for 450 visitors from <span class="page-break">\4</span>the German homeland. Many others will be invited as guests by relatives or friends who live here.</p>
