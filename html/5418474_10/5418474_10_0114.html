   <p>The chief and most important duty of every German is to become a citizen of the country, which he has chosen as his home country. Many possess the first papers, and could have been in possession of their naturalization papers long ago, but they have neglected it. Now is the most opportune time to remedy that which was caused by negligence.</p>
   <p>All Germans in possession of their first papers for two years or longer, who have been at least five years in this country, should call immediately at the German Democratic Headquarters, 167 Washington Street, near the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>building of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, where the procuring of the papers will be taken care of, free of charge. Those who have neglected up to now to get their first papers, ought to take advantage of this opportunity to obtain them. October 18, and 25, are the only two days to register. All who desire to vote must have their citizenship papers on or before October 25.</p>
