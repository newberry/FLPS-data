   <p>Magnificent and picturesque was yesterday's 4th of July parade arranged by the "Sane Fourth Association" in conjunction with the Central Committees of almost every nationalistic group of our population..... However, participants in the parade were not as numerous as it was expected, which was due to the intense heat wave, much to the annoyance of our citizens. Walking four or five miles in the sizzling sun could be of very serious consequences....It can not be denied that under the prevailing atmospheric conditions, the participants and the onlookers alike must have regarded it a torture, rather than a pleasant experience to aid in the festivities of the day. On the other hand, yesterday's parade surpassed anything of beauty and picturesqueness previously offered in Chicago. A pleasant surprise came from races whose ability to create something unique has always been doubted. For instance, the Croatian, the Irish, and the Lithuanian, floats widened our knowledge of the cultural accomplishments of those nations. The exceedingly interesting national costumes worn by various foreign groups gave the whole parade a pompous aspect......</p>

   <p>The German section, under the command of Marshall John Traeger, was headed by Ballman's band. This division was composed of two floats, one representing the "German gymnasts", the other "Snow-white", (Hornroeslein) and of about fifty trucks heavily decorated with flags, resembling a forest of national colors. Mr. Charles Kellermann, president of the United Societies headed that section. Each of a long list of societies displayed its banners also....Five floats of historical background, furnished by the Arrangement Committee concluded the festive procession. The first of these represented the winter quarters of Father Marquette, surrounded by a group of Indians on the soil which is identified with the Chicago of today; the second reminded us of the bloody battle at Fort Dearborn (1814); the third represented the eager response of the Nation to Lincoln's call of defending the Union; the fourth exhibited the Union as conqueror; and the fifth, Washington crossing the Delaware.</p>
   <p>Extraordinary activity was noticed in all Chicago's parks. Especially, in Washington and Jackson parks where plays of historical nature were presented. Needless to say that they drew large crowds of pleasure-seeking people.</p>
