   <p>What a remarkable contrast exists between the manner in which Decoration Day and Independence Day are celebrated! On the latter there is nothing but senseless and dangerous noise and murderous shooting, while on the former our national heroes are honored in a touching and noble manner.</p>
   <p>Is there any reason why the memory of the momentous times in which the Republic was founded, should not be celebrated in as dignified a manner, as the restoration of the Republic?</p>
   <p>It is true that John Adams, the "bulwark of Independence," as he was called by his friendly opponent, Thomas Jefferson, once expressed the hope that the American people would always celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence with bonfires and fireworks. However, if the stern gentleman could have foreseen a small fraction of the flagrant abuses of his admonition, he would have certainly abstained from giving it.</p>
   <p>Decoration Day, which has likewise become a national holiday, is evidence of the fact that the American people are capable of ideal and noble sentiments. This day, on the one hand, honors the triumphant restorers of the Great Republic, and, on the other hand, it is a day of reconciliation with the defeated South. This splendid characteristic is also obvious at this time, although the South has unfortunately and tactlessly delayed honoring the memory of the dead leader of the rebels.</p>
