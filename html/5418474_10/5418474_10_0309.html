   <p>President Grant has sent a message to Congress informing it of the birth of the German Reich, pointing out the similarity of the new German and the American Constitution and asking for a raise in the salary of the U. S. Ambassador in Berlin (from $12,000 to $17,900.)</p>
   <p>The Staats Zeitung, in ill humor, remarks:</p>
   <p>"In view of the abominable arms sale the politeness of the President makes an almost painful, in no way an agreeable impression. Of what concern is this proof of high esteem-the raising of the salary of the envoy. The best things to say would be to say nothing at all but to laugh. May Mr. Bancroft and his successors spend the money in peace-but they should not imagine that for this Germany will forget more quickly, what "neutral" nation has made it possible for the French to prolong the war by 3 months."</p>
