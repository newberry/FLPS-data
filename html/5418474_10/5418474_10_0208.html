   <p>A number of German-American ministers, of different denominations, held a meeting, last Monday, under the Presidency of Pastor L. Kohlmann, and resolved to form a union of German-American ministers of the country, with their congregations, the main purpose of which is to guard the nation against the World War. Branch unions of German-American ministers and citizens' associations should be established in all the larger cities of the country, and not only the German-American ministers of all denominations, but also their American colleagues, are invited to join this union, which has a true humanitarian and charitable aim. Dear colleagues and fellow citizens of our beloved country! In this great, serious time, the desire awoke in us that we as German-Americans should get closer together, in accord with the principle: "Unity makes strength". Although we German-Americans are, at least, as true citizens of this country as any other nationality, we are branded as traitors, because we do not forget our people and the beloved country of our fathers. In spite of the fact that we form at least one fourth of the population of our adopted fatherland, we have in proportion, but small influence and our just wishes and feelings are continually trodden on. Alas, it is getting worse instead of better, because from different <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sources we are accused of partiality. For this condition we are mostly to be blamed. We were organized because we had no trouble, until now about politics. But this must change. For this reason we must unite as a band of brothers. We do not wish to carry on a party policy with low and vulgar politicians, with whom we have a common cause. We want to fight them. Religious and other questions, in which we might have different views, we intend to consider in brotherly tolerance, as private matters. We want to forget old prejudices and try to get better acquainted with and respect each other.</p>
   <p>One of our main objects should be to guard our American nation against this terrible World War. We condemn, therefore, every egoistic and one sided influence of certain European nations upon our government, and every preference of certain nations on their part, also any possible alliance with a European nation, and demand an absolute and just neutrality from the present and succeeding government of our country. We issue a second declaration of independence of our beloved country, American, and our watchword, as true citizens of the United States is America first. Every candidate for any office, who does not follow this <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>principle, we will, in the coming, as well as in future elections, oppose with all our might and with inexorable severity. We therefore request you to join us. We want to co-operate, to bring closer together the German-Americans, so that we as true citizens of this country, may achieve the position which is justly due us. The awakening of the German conscience and the establishment of a good organization of the German-Americans will also be beneficial in our congregational work, because our countrymen only too often forget their descent, to the detriment of our churches. At the same time, our influence upon the German circles, not belonging to congregations will be beneficial and useful. The times are serious, and we all must answer to their urgent requests and take courage and unite, for this noble and great work.</p>
   <p>We desire to win all German-American ministers, whether Protestant or Catholic, for this serious and important matter, therefore, we beg you to get in touch with us in some way. If you visit the meetings of the Central Union in Chicago and are able to join it, you are heartily welcome. If you live too far from Chicago, to visit the meetings you are cordially requested to become a member of our union. In larger cities, and wherever it is possible to bring together a sufficient number of German-American Pastors, we urgently ask you to organize <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>yourself in conjunction with the Central Union in Chicago. You have no special obligations. We only expect, you to work with us for right, justice and truth.</p>
