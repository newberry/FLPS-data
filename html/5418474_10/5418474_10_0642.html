Margarete Drinkhause, ex-grand president gave a very impressive speech, which was followed by the ceremonies, in which Martha Janke and Alvin Spalding ex-grand presidents, officiated. They were assisted by Marie Weissbecker, the grand leader. The program went on, with the collaboration of twenty-four drill guards from Harmony Lodge No. 3 under the leadership of "Captain" Anna Brookmann.
