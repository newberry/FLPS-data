   <p>In a letter to Reverend Thomas V. Shannon, chairman of the Societies for Catholic Activity in Chicago, Archbishop Mundelein appeals to the people of his faith to buy victory bonds. He writes:</p>
   <p>"The Liberty Loan speaks for itself, and neither publicity nor agents nor salesmen are necessary to recommend it. It is a loan to the most reliable of all bankers, the United States Government; it is a profitable investment, for it yields as high an interest as could be reasonably expected; and finally, it is a patriotic privilege. Catholics have a further interest in the Fifth Loan of the Government. The chief official of our national treasury has repeatedly acknowledged the remarkable aid which Catholics of this city so loyally and enthusiastically rendered during the four previous Liberty Loan drives. And now, that the task is being completed, we should display greater interest and greater patriotic enthusiasm."</p>
