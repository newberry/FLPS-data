   <p>In the speech the other day of Senator Karl Schurz, the final apostrophe in which he reminded the German Americans of their duty to be good and faithful Americans was distinguished by its rhetorical flourish, and, one might almost say, by its pastoral unction.</p>
   <p>However, after one has listened to the artistically well-smoothed and well-rounded admonitions, one can hardly help from feeling a certain curious emptiness. It is as if one had consumed the foam on the champagne, but none of the wine. It seems to us as if one could say other, less common and long self-evident, truths about the position of the German part of the American people. It is easy to imagine that his speech must have greatly pleased those native Americans (always identifying American with Anglo-American) who now see in him an ally in their demand that the Germans get rid as quickly as possible of their national peculiarities, the good as well as the bad. That is, for example, the attitude of the Chicago Tribune, whose editor gleefully rubs his hands, about Schurz being so excellent and (Anglo) American, and wanting nothing to do with the "German demagogues" who would like (as Schurz' brother-in-law did here in Chicago only six or eight weeks ago) to form the Germans into a special party. These German demagogues. thinks the Tribune, get what <span class="page-break">\2</span>they had coming, and Schurz has renounced all their aspirations.</p>
   <p>Peculiar, indeed, seems his silence and his hidden warning against all attempts to make justifiable German viewpoints prevail; quite especially peculiar in view of the fact that the idea to call Schurz here had originated precisely with those men who tried to make the fight against all Sunday laws the starting point of a new party. One almost feels like calling it ungrateful that he made no mention of the platform that was accepted in the Northside Turn Hall with such noisy enthusiasm and such genuine understanding of its content. One should have thought that the excellent intentions of the authors of that platform had deserved some more friendly comment than Schurz'. Nothing could be farther from me than the idea of a separate "political organization of the Germans in this Republic." In this sentence we absolutely concur and we are glad that Schurz with whom we agree in so many, even if not in all, questions of public life supports all that we have said about a special German party.</p>
   <p>But not at all do we agree that the German speaking citizen should renounce his quite constitutional viewpoints about farce laws, in order to please his high and well-born Angle-American co-citizens. Not as Germans, but as American citizens we think we have the right to agitate against ordinances and <span class="page-break">\3</span>traditions that are to us repugnant. As American citizens we feel justified in contributing to the as yet fluid and flexible American nationality as much of the German national character as seems worth while to be preserved. So Stallo, Rumelin, Korner, Friedrich, Munch, and a hundred other worthy men have understood the rights of the German-Americans that correspond to their duties - but that Schurz also understands them so, one can at least not see from his last speech. It is a fact that during his long public career Schurz always has anxiously avoided any reference to the Temperance and Sunday question, and he probably owes, primarily, to this circumstance the panegyries that he gets in such papers as the Chicago Times, for his so perfect (Anglo) Americanization. If the same papers call so brilliant, noble, and eloquent a man as Stallo, a "bummer" of "scalawag" simply because he is not afraid to embrace the just demands of the German speaking citizens of the country, then the citizen who is not ashamed of his German descent and his German mind must ask himself if he would not rather be flayed and libeled, in company of Stallo, by the bigoted Anglo-Irish-American press mob, that he would want to be praised for his "complete Anglo-Americanization."</p>
