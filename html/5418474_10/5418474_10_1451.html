   <p>This relatively young sister congregation owns beautiful church property, a church, and a school. A few years ago, Teacher Rumsfeld started the school with nineteen children. The number has in the meantime risen to 104 who are instructed by Teacher A. A. Rumsfeld and two women teachers. The school enjoys a good reputation and has recently again been accredited by the city's school authorities. Eight of the pupils graduated this year; they are the first ones who may enroll in a public high school without any examination.</p>
