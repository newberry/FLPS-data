   <p>An evening described as an intellectual treat, was sponsored here last night, by the Turn Society of Chicago, and the National League of German-Americans. The exceptionally large attendance, was proof of the interest our public displays in intellectual affairs.</p>
   <p>Professor Kammann of Peoria, explained the merit of the German language, and also took this opportunity to urge the Germans of Chicago, to immediately exert all the effort possible in the renewed demand for the continuation of German instruction in the public schools. He pleaded for action, warning of the fate which befell the German language in the public schools of the city of St. Louis. He also told how Chicago Germans can prevent a like catastrophe. Here, he said," we still can build upon the foundation laid by the Germans of earlier days, but St. Louis will have to begin building from the very bottom."</p>
   <p>Mr. Eugen Niederegger, as the representative of the "German-American National League" and the "Turn Community," extended a hearty welcome to the audience. The scheduled appearance of Judge Girten, the President of the Chicago branch of the League, had to be canceled, as the result of the death of a member of the family.</p>
   <p>Professor Kammann, who is President of the "German-American National League," delivered a most captivating lecture, "The German language and its educational merit." Following are the principal points of his speech:</p>
   
   <p>"One of the noblest tasks-perhaps the noblest-fell to the lot of the "German-American National League," when called upon, to lend its services in the promotion, cultivation and perfection of the German language. No nationalistic impulse prompted me to this statement, it is purely of cultural interest and not a matter of German hyper-patriotism. In this great melting pot of nations-unequaled in history-one, and only one language could be recognized as the official language of the land. Circumstances were, of course, a contributing factor in the adoption of the English language, and except for the abominable orthography, English is the most suitable language to perform this unison.</p>
   <p>"But, it would be just as narrow-minded as it would be silly, to prohibit the cultivation of other languages. Exhibitors of so much "patriotism," can not expect to be complimented upon their attitude. No other language in existence is so closely related to the English as is the German. In the cultural development of this nation, still in the making, no other language can be used so advantageously as our language. To disregard the educational value of this language would indicate a neglect and disloyalty to one's duty. It could be regarded as a crime indeed; if the great number of German-Americans remain passive toward their inestimable possession, the mother-tongue, not realizing the importance of preserving and teaching this beautiful heritage to their children.</p>
   <p>"There is a generally recognized fact that the spirit of a nation is reflected in the language its people speak. The development of any People keeps step with the development of their language and literature.</p>
   
   <p>"I maintain, therefore, that in addition to the official language of a nation, another language should be cultivated, to replace that, which the official may be lacking; namely, thoroughness, adaptability, and stronger linguistic sentiment - something, of which the average American knows very little, or nothing.</p>
   <p>"Properly recognized and given its chance, the German language is certain of success as no other living foreign language could be. This is also the unreserved opinion of our foremost pedagogues. Tribute is paid to parochial and private schools in recognition of their interest and devotion to the worthy cause. Nevertheless, as a medium, they can not be powerful enough to reach the great masses. This can be accomplished only through the medium of public schools. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that with efforts united, we turn our attention toward public schools, and request, that German should be included in the curriculum of every school, where such is justified and circumstances permissible.</p>
   <p>"It is beyond any doubt, that the instructor should be especially qualified in teaching German. It is also imperative, that the teacher has thorough knowledge of German, as well as of the English language. Thus, we are encountered with a difficult problem. However, since the plan for the reorganization of instruction in public schools, and the separation of sexes at school attendance is under way, it is not just a dreamer's fancy that, if successful, the German language will receive more consideration in the curriculum of public schools."</p>
   
   <p>Professor Kammann concluded his address describing how the German School Association of St. Louis, established special classes in four of its public schools, the maintenance of which is made possible by voluntary contributions of many Germans, and German societies of that city. The response of the students is so great that based upon this very successful experiment, the German Society expects to induce the School Board, to include German in the curriculum of elementary schools, in the higher classes. We in Chicago are not confronted with quite as difficult a problem, therefore, we are hopeful of obtaining a more favorable solution.</p>
