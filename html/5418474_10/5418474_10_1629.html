   <p>Yesterday's German-meeting at the Kirkland Mission, 111 S. Halsted Street, was well attended; more than 100 Germans responded, regardless of the short notice. Among the Freethinkers, which were present in small numbers, "Six" decided to serve the Lord henceforth. The meeting ended long after 10 P.M. Tomorrow evening, on the Northside, at Moody's Church, corner Chicago and La Salle Ave., the regular Wednesday service will be held at 7:30 P.M. where everyone is welcome.</p>
