   <p>Presided over by William Joern, a general meeting of the committee for the fall festival of the German-American Citizens' Bund was held last Friday, in conjunction with a membership drive. It was decided that all present should function as a committee for the fall festival.</p>
   <p>Present, were the following gentlemen: William Joern, Chris Clausen, Gust Gross, Emil Rapp, Theo Schlichting, Fred Rixmann, Gust Scheel, Henry Neumann, Wenzel Wiese, Fred Brumund, John Beierwaltes, Herman Joern, Eugen Klomfass, and Otto Lausar.</p>
   <p>The Schiller Liedertafel is expected to take part in the program, as reported by Secretary Clausen. The Schleswig-Holstein Singers' Bund will be asked to participate, so that a mass chorus may be heard. John Beierwaltes and Emil Rapp will call on the former and Ernst Brosius on the latter to extend the invitation.</p>
