   <p>The tremendous success of the meetings which were held on the North and North West Side in regard to the attitude against the incitation of the American people by the newspapers, as well as against the exportation of contraband inspired the people, who have arranged these meetings, to organize the German-Americans of the South and South West Side, also.</p>
   <p>Preparations for huge mass meetings are in progress. Gen. Samuel Pearson and Miss Ray Beveridge will be among the speakers, whose topic will be the "European War Crisis". The council consists of Wm. Reichert, Chas. H. Kellerman, Carl F. Ansorge, Heinrich Lange, Herman Brandow, Fred Heine, G. F. Hummel, F. Fredersdorf, Otto Doederlain, Dr. August Strauch.</p>
