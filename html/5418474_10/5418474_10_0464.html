   <p>The North American Sharpshooters Festival was held at the new stand, and was attended by a large number of sharpshooters.</p>
   <p>In 1869 the Turners held their union festivals, which was very lively. The Turner Society Vorwarts obtained first prize through a guest turner, John Gloy, a cabinetmaker, who arrived only lately from Germany.</p>

The social life progressed and was industriously cultivated.</p>
