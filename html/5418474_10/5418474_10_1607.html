   <p>A number of Lutherans living on Elston Ave. and other streets near by between Maplewood and Avondale Avenues, organized themselves recently into the Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church "Concordia". At the same meeting they elected their own pastor, Rev. P. P. Brauns, the assistant pastor of the local St. Matthew's Church, was their choice, and he accepted the call. He was introduced yesterday to the congregation by Rev. P. Mueller of St. Luke's Church. The new pastor will deliver his inaugural sermon next Sunday.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, the church will grow very fast, and it is to be expected that their present place of worship will soon be too small. Until now 25 families have signed the constitution of "Concordia", and 30 children have enrolled for the new school. Perhaps the construction of a new house of worship will be started next year. Many Germans live in that vicinity. It is a beautiful and healthy location, and building lots are obtainable at moderate prices; therefore an opportunity is presented to German Lutherans to locate near a Lutheran Church and school.</p>
