   <p>In the name of the needy who receive help from the German Society of Chicago I heartily thank all who participated in this ball. The work of the magnaminous, sympathetic ladies whose efforts made the ball a success is hereby gratefully acknowledged. Some of them were more successful than others in selling tickets, nevertheless all of them deserve honorable mention. I am particularly grateful to Miss Grommes who handled the sale of lottery tickets; also to Mr. Huck, Bush and Brand, Hiller, Fischer and Lehmann, Wilhelh Gottfried and Schoenhoefer, Bier-John, and Siebert for their generous donations of beer.</p>
   <p>As usual, the press gave us their splendid support.</p>

   <p>Later we shall have more to say about the German Society of Chicago and its benevolent activity.</p>
