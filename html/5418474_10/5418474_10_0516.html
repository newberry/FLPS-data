   <p>Mr. J. W. Kobalter sent the following resolution to the Editor of the Sonntagpost:</p>
   <p>Having been notified that the City and County administration invited William Randolph Hearst to be a guest of Chicago on October 9 and, because we are of the opinion that every good American citizen should make it his duty to turn this reception into a great success and, because we consider it our duty to protest against the interference by foreign powers of the right to express our opinions, and to uphold freedom of speech, and because we are of the opinion, that this protest can only be noticeably expressed by making the reception of our guest of honor a great and impressive success!</p>
   <p>Be it resolved, that we request all citizens of German extraction to join in the reception and festivities at Soldiers Field October 9; arranged in honor of W. R. Hearst, and,</p>
   <p>Be it furthermore resolved, that we request all German-Americans to assemble Wednesday, October 1, at 8 o'clock in the evening, to form an organization, which shall carry out the performance of this resolution, signed by:</p>
   <p>Ernest J. Kruetgen, Chairman; Oscar A. Stoffel, German Club; A.F.W. Siebel, Chicago-Singverein; Jack Kobalter, United German-Austrian-Hungarian Societies; Reinhold Oeschler, Defensive Alliance; William Rothman, Steuben Club; John Cramer, Mutual Aid Society; Leopold Saltiel, Illinois Turner district; Fred Rixman, Citizens-Bund; Albert Wehrwein, United Singers; Paul Kirch, Central Union of Military Societies; William Sack, Low-German Society; Joseph Keller, United Men's Chorus.</p>
