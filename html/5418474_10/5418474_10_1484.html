   <p>To accomplish the building of a new church, costing about $55,000, as the German Evangelical St. Stephens Church did, is indeed a proof of great self-denial. This new church, built in the geniune Gothic style, was dedicated yesterday. The pastor,Rev. A. Buenger, has been with the church for 21 years. He can look back with satisfaction, because the small beginnings have developed to a considerable degree.</p>
   <p>The crowd assembled for the festival, was so great, that the church could not hold all of them. Ministers present were: Professor L. Dorn, of the Concordia Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana; Rev. Photenhauer and Rev. I. A. Molstad.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. Schulze, Vice President of the Schulze Banking Company, was chairman of the Building Committee.</p>
