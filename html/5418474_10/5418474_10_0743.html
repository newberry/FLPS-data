   <p>Those German Societies, which are members of the United Societies, have expressed repeatedly the desire to have exclusively German meetings arranged, where the delegates would speak only German. A formal request, pertaining to this object, has been deliberated and finally accepted by the organization committee of the United Societies. Subsequently, at all future meetings of those German Societies only the German language will be used. The delegates of all German Societies in Chicago will have from now on their own meetings, taking place once every month according to announcements.</p>
