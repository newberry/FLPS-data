   <p>The German Catholic Central Society is holding its 32nd convention in Chicago this year, and our citizens of that faith have shown their guests from other cities through the reception they gave them, how very welcome they were. High mass was read at St. Michal's church during which Bishop Wigger of Newark, N. J., gave the convention sermon.</p>
   <p>Many Catholic Societies took part in the impressive procession which was scheduled for 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
