   <p>President reported to have prohibited further sales of arms. One editor sharply attacks Secretary of War Belknap who was asked by the German Envoy, Herr Von Gerolt(at the time when the government decided to sell its superfluous store of arms) to wait till the Prussian government could make a bid for the total amount. Belknap answered that the U. S. government would not sell to any foreign government, but only to citizens of the U. S. without caring what these people would further do with the arms. The editor says that legally Belknap has, of course, been correct, but that the Prussia government, of course, would also have used U. S. citizens as middle-men, and that Mr. Belknap's decision, due to the exact moment at which it came, showed his intention to help France.</p>
   <p>Shame upon such infamous artifices! The next result of it will be that the U. S. loses all ground under her feet in the Alabama case.</p>
   <p>With such a beam in her eye, how can she express judgment over the splinter in England? The German citizens of the U. S. demand no partisanship, no, not even "sympathy", but just an honest and sincere neutrality.</p>
