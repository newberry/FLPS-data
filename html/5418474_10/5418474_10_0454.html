   <p>The German Club recently held its annual picnic at its shady Camp Hoffman on the Desplaines river. There is reason to be satisfied with the affair, and with the number of visitors.</p>
   <p>Besides the members and guests the Chicago Singverein and the Steuben Club Booster announced their willingness to come, and actually came in large numbers. On the picnic grounds, in the dance hall, and in the dining room there was a lively "bustle", which increased in the afternoon, when others begam to arrive who could not come in the forenoon. Food brought along, as well as that provided by the housekeeper, Mrs. H. E. Muller, had an excellent taste in the fresh air. Later, the guests gave themselves to the entertainment of the afternoon provided by the German Club. Horseshoe throwing, rope pulling, baseball, sausage eating, and running afforded entertainment for young and old. The best performers were rewarded with beautiful <span class="page-break">2</span>prizes. It is needless to mention that ample care was taken of the young folks who wished to dance.</p>
   <p>Among the guests who came to the picnic there were Mayer Kelly, many judges, politicians and officials.</p>
   <p>The entertainment committee, under the direction of its chairman, William F. Jacobs, and its vice-chairman, Joseph P. Immel, did its best to insure the success of the fest.Another committee, with Judge Walter P. Steffen as its honorary president, Arthur Meier as its president, and Mr. Albert M. Weinberger a member, directed the games of skill.</p>
