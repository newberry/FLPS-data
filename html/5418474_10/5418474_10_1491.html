   <p>With high mass the new St. Clemen's Church and School (Orchard Street and Deming Place) was consecrated yesterday afternoon by Archbishop Quigley. The Church Prince complained of the want of religious instruction in the Public Schools which makes it necessary to keep up the Church schools. The building cost $35,000; it was started a year ago and was completed a month ago. At the high mass assisted the Reverends, Kirsch, Schiffer and Czikewski.</p>
   <p>The Reverend F. A. Rempe entertained his colleagues after the celebration, with a banquet.</p>
