   <p>The call for Stallo, to become American ambassador to Rome is meeting with the undivided approval of the German-American press. The most prominent German newspapers like the Cincinnati Free Press (Freie Presse), the Baltimore German Correspondent ( Deutscher Correspondent ), and others are praising the government for the choice of Stallo.</p>
   <p>Stallo was born and raised in Germany. He came to America when he was young, and soon became politically active here. He started out as a staunch Democrat, became a Republican after the Civil War to participate in a Republican Progressive program, which utterly failed. There upon, Stallo returned to the Democratic Party, which brought him in close contact with the Democratic president, Cleveland.</p>

   <p>In his private life, Stallo is a well-educated man with a clean record, and honest, sincere character. He still is a German at the bottom of his heart, but has never shirked his duties and obligations toward his new fatherland. He had, of course, powerful political friends, particularly A. C. Hesing of Chicago, who recommended in Washington his selection for the ambassador vacancy in Rome.</p>
   <p>Due to the growing influence of German-American political preponderance in Washington, the following promotions have taken place recently:</p>
   <p>Oscar Bischoff of Kansas become Consul in Somerberg. Edward Camphausen of Pennsylvania is going as Consul to Naples. M. G. Neumark was sent as Consul to Lyon (France), and E. Kuhlmeicr from Iowa was made federal tax collector. The German, A. Weber, became federal marshal for Southern Illinois.</p>
