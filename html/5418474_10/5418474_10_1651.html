The sermon for the occasion was delivered by the new pastor of the church, the Rev. J. S. Kling, who had been the pastor of the Salem Church and had been instrumental with the combined efforts of M. Hattendorf to gather this congregation. Pastor Hattendorf also delivered a very impressive speech.</p>
