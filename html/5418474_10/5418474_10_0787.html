   <p>At yesterday's general meeting of the Central Alliance of German Veterans Club, three items on their agenda were dealt with, namely, the annual reports of the officials, which were read, and accepted; the return to its owner of a German flag, a present of Emperor Wilhelm II to the Central Alliance; and the election of officers for the year 1901.</p>
   <p>The president-elect gave the flag to Joseph Traub, president of the Landwehr-Verein, who will have it for the ensuing year. [The article does not state whether this is the flag presented by Wilhelm II or a flag belonging to the Alliance. Transl.]</p>
