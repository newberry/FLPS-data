   <p>The Executive Committee of the G. A. N. A. is informing us, that since the beginning of the Prohibition fights-the German-American National Association through its delegates and permanent legal advisers has been in close contact with all phases of pertaining preceedings in the Senate and Congress. Even when secondary aspects of the problems were transferred by the Legislature to Sub-Committees, the alertness of the said Association never relaxed, in order to keep the Public posted on all decisions.</p>
   <p>On various occasions, the prohibitionists have tryed to create a confusion and smuggle in misleading bills to prepare the final step to-wards a Federal Prohibition Law. So far these backward reactionary Fanatics did not succeed and still are far from reaching their goal, as long as the Representatives of the people and the Nation itself can be kept aroused about the importance of the issue.</p>
