   <p>Yesterday's imposing demonstration was the celebration of the Evangelical churches of Chicago and surrounding territory in the Moody Memorial Temple, Clark Street and North Avenue. It was like a jubilee hymn proclaiming the spirit and the wonders of the Reformation. Not less than 4,000 people assembled, and everyone of the participants undoubtedly was strengthened anew in his faith, by the impressive celebration, and went home richer in inspirations and spiritual treasures. An extremely rich, and inspiring program, not lacking in variety, had been provided by the festival committee, with William Boeppler, gifted leader of the Chicago Song Club, a mixed mass choir, composed of the city's different evangelical church choirs, the children's choirs of the Uhlich's and Bensenville orphanages, and the Englewood High School orchestra, under the direction of Charles S. Espenshade, the musical director of St. Paul's Church.</p>

   <p>The program started with the march from the opera, "Tannhauser," by Richard Wagner. Then the whole congregation sang, accompanied by the orchestra, "Jesus Calls Us." Pastor Jacob Pister of St. Paul's Church asked for God's blessing, and Pastor Philpott, who put the temple at the disposal of the evangelical churches for the festival expressed his thanks to the assembly and the choir, "The Church's One Foundation Is Jesus Christ," sung by the congregation and accompanied by the orchestra, rang through the imposing hall.</p>
   <p>The German speech of the day, having as subject: "The Inheritance and the Heirs of the Reformation," was given by Karl Chwarowsky, pastor of St. Peter's Church in Elmhurst. The speaker appealed not only to the heart and soul, but also to the intellect of the listeners, upon whom he wanted to impress, that it was not sufficient to be the heirs, to pat each other on the back and to be glad that there was a Luther, and that we are now Christians.</p>

   <p>Penitence and humility are needed by us, the heirs. The inheritance of the Reformation is not a new theology, a new church, a new controversy, a new apology, neither democracy nor prohibition but is expressed by one word: liberty!</p>
