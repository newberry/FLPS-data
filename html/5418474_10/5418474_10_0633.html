   <p>The Schwaben Verein held its quarterly meeting last evening at the North Side Turnhalle. President Emmanuel Gall was chairman. After the minutes of the preceding quarterly meeting and those of the meetings of the board of directors had been read by Secretary Henry Hieber, current business was the order of the day. It was voted to commemorate the anniversary of the society's organization in the usual manner, on March 31, in the North Side Turnhalle.</p>
   <p>All members were urged to attend the Sunday afternoon concert to be held on January 26 at the North Side Turnhalle.</p>
   <p>Thereupon two very important resolutions were passed: First, to resign from the United Societies For Local Self-Government and, secondly, to join <span class="page-break">\2</span>the newly organized Independent Voters Association of Chicago and Cook County. This step was taken after Messrs. Albert Wehrwein and Wilhelm Kramer had given detailed information concerning the object and aims of the society, and had read its declaration of principles, which were then approved by the Schwaben Verein.</p>
   <p>This declaration is as follows: "As advocates of sound politics it is imperative that we urge our fellow citizens to exercise their natural and constitutional rights and duties in all questions pertaining to the public welfare.</p>
   <p>"We indorse the aims of the societies which are members of our alliance.</p>
   <p>"We advocate unrestricted suffrage for women, and will do what we can to induce feminine voters to make use of their right to vote.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"The executive committee will examine all candidates for public office as to their qualifications. Adherence to the principles of personal liberty and local self-government will be a requisite for indorsement.</p>
   <p>"We favor every movement against prohibition and monopolies.</p>
   <p>"The right to amend these principles is reserved by the alliance."</p>
   <p>The Independent Voters Association will soon hold its first general meeting and elect officers. No one who holds a political office, or is a candidate for one, may be elected to office.</p>
   <p>The Schwaben Verein elected the following as its delegates to the general meeting of the Alliance: Messrs. Julius Schmidt, Wilhelm Kramer, Heinrich <span class="page-break">\4</span>Hieber, F. Ruedel, and Henry P. Runkel.</p>
   <p>Since the movement to erect a monument to the great German poets Schiller and Goethe emanated from the Schwaben Verein, and since the society also gave the movement no small financial support, its members are naturally highly indignant because of the proposal to change the name of Goethe Street. Therefore it was resolved to send a letter of protest to all aldermen, apprising them of the fact that the change of the name "Goethe Street" to "Boxwood Place" would be considered an affront to all Americans of German descent.</p>
