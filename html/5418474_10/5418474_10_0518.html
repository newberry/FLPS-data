   <p>The German-American Citizens' Bund can look back with satisfaction upon its 12th. People's festival, which was held in Riverview Park yesterday afternoon. Henry Johnk's orchestra furnished the music and executed its task in a very commendable manner.</p>
   <p>George Weideling, as first vice-president of the bund, had the management of the festival in his hands in the absence of Mr. Rixmann, who is in Germany at the present time. After a humorous speech of welcome, he introduced a first speaker Dr. George Scherger, who in his address dwelled on the question: "Have the Germans a future in this country?" which he, in an exceedingly optimistic manner, answered with a "yes."</p>
   <p>The speaker declared that because the Germans in this country have played such an important role in the past and have found deserved recognition, it is again time that Germanism should be acknowledged anew and its worth appreciated. Besides, it is untrue that half of our population is English, as Mr. Dawes, of our neighboring town of Evanston, declared. We ought to protest vigorously against such statements. Therefore we should oppose the new immigration law because, on the basis of this law, the English send us negroes from the West Indies as British subjects. Is their blood purer than those of the German immigrant: "We are not any longer in a land of freedom," Professor Scherger emphasized, "since narrow-minded puritanism attempts to make saints of us through their laws." The Germans have a different conception of the word "freedom." Our ideal of freedom is the same as those of Washington and Jefferson, namely, personal freedom and independence from all foreign obligation. Therefore, we German-Americans are real Americans who reject internationalism. German art, music, and inventions make us proud of our extraction, and the time will come when the world will recover through the use of German character.</p>
   <p>The festival manager then read a telegram from Mr. Rixmann, in which the latter expressed his wish for the success of the festival.</p>
   <p>Other guests of the day were introduced, namely: Otto F. Reich, candidate for the office of president of the County Board, who declared that his intention, as a German, is to help the German group secure an honest management worthy of their confidence and support, and who furthermore reminded us of the fact that in the near future Germany will be free again.</p>
   <p>The following were introduced and requested to give short addresses of welcome: Robert Sweitzer, County Clerk; James Kearns, of the Municipal Court; John E. Traeger, and Walter W. L. Meyer, Democratic candidate for Assessor of Cook County; Jos. Graher, Z. A. Kardom; Leon Edelman, Judge of the Municipal Court; Judge Joseph Burke, Wm. Tegtmeier, G. Seidl, Edward Barrett, and Nat Rurell. Of course, Sheriff John Traeger and Ernest Kruetgen had also to welcome the audience. In their case no introduction was necessary because they are already well known.</p>
   
   <p>Louis Link, honorary president of the Citizens' Bund, spoke in English, recalling former times and declaring his pleasure at being able to notice that Germans whose names have a good reputation and who are dependable are entering the ranks of candidates for public office.</p>
   <p>During the course of the festival a resolution was read and adopted which contains in extract the following statement: "We Americans of German descent declare again to be true to the ideals of Washington and reject foreign interventions, as well as the league of Nations, including its World Court in Hague; we protest against the "National Origin Clause" of the immigration law and support the proposal of Senator Shipstead to create a Commission to establish the proof of the war guilt in an impartial manner, as well as the repeal of the 18th Amendment; furthermore, the Volstead and Jones laws, and express vigorously our wish that all German=Americans of Chicago should become members of the Citizens' Bund, so that they may be able to form a great union in the battle for real freedom and equal representation in public life.</p>
