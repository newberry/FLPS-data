   <p>The first popular and summer night festival held under the auspices of the German-American Central Society took place yesterday and last evening at the North Side Sharpshooters Park. This society is the central body of 198 Chicago German associations of Turners, singing societies, benevolent orders and other organizations formed to maintain the interest of the Germans in all public questions. Francis A. Hoffmann Jr., is president; and Louis Dreyfus, secretary of this central body. Three thousand people thronged through the park yesterday. The young folks, to the strains of a fine orchestra, kept the dancing floor warm. The athletic youngsters found ample accomodations for muscular sports. Francis A. Hoffmann Jr. had suggested that the 350,000 Germans of Chicago set apart and celebrate a day in the fall of each year as German Day, in honor of the landing of the first Germans in the United States, 100 years ago.</p>
   
   <p>He was supported in this by the Staats Zeitung, Free Presse, Abendpost, Tageblatt and National Zeitung and to consider this was one of the main objects of yesterday's festival. Pres. Hoffmann called the assembly to order from the music stand. He said: "The object of our organization is not nativistic. It is not for independent action in politics. It is a social and domestic body to bring the Germans in line. The immediate object of the meeting is to institute in Chicago the observance of German Day as it is celebrated in New York, St. Louis and a few other large cities." Richard Michaelis, editor of the Free Presse was then introduced. He spoke about the benefits of the organization, insisted of the institution of German Day in Chicago, and said that from the best information he had October 6 was the day on which the first German stepped on the soil of the United States.</p>
   
   <p>Louis Wagner, editor of the Tageblatt, said: "Germans should be opposed to prohibition, the Puritanic Sabbath, and Puritanic school laws; they should be united as they were in last fall's state election." He spoke then of Herman Raster, the late editor of the Staats Zeitung, as a man "whose force of diction and forcible expression of the mother tongue had captivated every one. As a Lutheran , he continued, I believe the German Day should not be celebrated Sunday. Let us do as do the other Americans -when the Fourth of July falls on Sunday they celebrate Saturday or Monday."</p>
   <p>Henry Rarb, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, said: "Germans are assembled in other cities in this land as we are here today to perpetuate German life, morals and usages. Their idea is to maintain in this land, far away from home, such customs and habits of their land as do not interfere with the institutions of this country.</p>
   
   <p>A part of the population of this country consider such principles a crime. They claim we could level everything. I tell you if such were the case, if all the peculiarities of adopted citizens should disappear, this land would not be as it is now. If they should disappear it should not be for the welfare or unification of this country. Among all nations the German nationality stands highest. It allows each tribe to live and act as it pleases so long as it does not conflict with the laws of the land in which they reside. The Greeks had a national idea that the diversion of tribes was not by birth, but by custom and habits assumed and taken under a Republican form of government. The German tribes in this country have similarly non-unification against a common enemy. Patriotism is a matter of sentiment not of reason. Patriotism manifests itself not only in war, but in all the arts of peace social equality exists only in China, where every particular is regulated by law even to the form of a visiting card.</p>
   
   <p>The population of this land is divided into two classes, laborers and idlers. I maintain without fear of contradiction, that the Germans belong only to the first class. "There is another patriotism. The German farmer in their land wins for himself a homestead which he intends to maintain. What is patriotism? It is opposed to silver and greenback humbug and is determined to pay in honest money. In religion the German is conservative. He is opposed to revivals. In arts, the supreme sentiment of humanity, the flower of civilization the German is ahead. In music, the drama, sculpture, the German excels. That is also patriotism. When this adopted country was in danger there was not a village where the Germans did not take to arms. The soldier character of the German has never denied itself in this country. That is German patriotism and while we love Germania, we are true sons of Columbia."</p>
   
   <p>A poem by Dr. Frederick Roesch was read entitled "Das Deutsche Lied". No date was set for German Day. The picnic yesterday was under charge of Louis Dreyfus, Anton Kuek, and Richard E. Stupe. Among those present were Charles Bary, Senator J. A. Lense, H. W. Shaffer, Dr. Lininger, Carl Harting, Franz Koch and Henry C. Zuttermeister.</p>
