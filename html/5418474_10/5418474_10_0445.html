   <p>At a time when all inhabitants of the Saarland who are of voting age are getting ready to cast their vote on January 13th to return the Saarland to its German homeland, a club of Saarlanders was established in Chicago for the purpose of supporting the homeland in its striving to return the territory to Germany by collecting money. The young club celebrated its founding Saturday night with a Saarfest at the Germania Club. It was quite a success in a financial and in a social way.</p>
   <p>The ballroom was decorated with the American and German flags. Hennecke's orchestra played lively music until the dancing began at a late hour. The president of the organization, Joseph Martin, greeted the audience in an <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>opening address, in which he gave detailed information about the aims of the organization. He then presented the evening's guests of honor, the consul general, Dr. Rolf Jaeger, the vice-consul, Dr. Strack, Dr. Scherger of the Church of St. Paul, and Tony Miller of the Friends of the New Germany. A prologue, composed by George Siegold, was sung impressively by Frau Phil Mohr.</p>
   <p>Consul General Jaeger took the opportunity to wish the Saarlander organization success in its activities for the restoration of the Saar. In brief words, he sketched the struggle with spiritual weapons conducted in Germany for the restoration of the detached territory. Dr. Scherger joined in with the hope that the Saar would always be and remain German. Tony Miller, chairman of the local Chicago group of the Friends of the New Germany, made a speech in which he made comparisons between the situation of the Saarlanders and the formation of the states which succeeded Austria, which owe their existence solely to the principle advocated by Wilson, namely, the right of the people <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to determine their own destiny. What was at the time right for Czechs and Poles, must now be proper for Saarlanders. The words of the speakers were received with applause. Members of the organization, men and women, walked from table to table in the becoming garb of the miners of the Saarland, and sold the familiar badges for donations to the Saar.</p>
   <p>Later in the evening, the Schiller Liedertafel declared its readiness to sing a few songs under the direction of its president and vice-conductor, Paul Wagner. They were received with much applause.</p>
   <p>At a late hour the guests departed, after a beautifully spent evening.The preparations for the festival were in the hands of President Joseph Martin, the fest president, George Kemmler, the secretary, C. R. Bauer, the treasurer, Hans Dietz, and a number of other committee members.</p>
