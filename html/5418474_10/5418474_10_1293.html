   <p>The Turnverein Einigkeit (Turner Society Harmony) had its Christmas celebration last night in its new building. At first, gymnastic exercises were demonstrated. These exercises showed a high grade of accuracy, drill and training. A cheering applause rewarded the high achievements of the Turners. A distribution of presents among the children then followed. Also a few valuable gifts were presented to Mr. Cabelli, the gymnastic trainer of the verein, from his admiring pupils.</p>
   <p>The arrangments of the festivity, which closed with a jolly dance, were in the hands of Messrs. John Mutz, Louis Danpeon, Carl Mueller, Adolph Nagl and Louis Kind.</p>
