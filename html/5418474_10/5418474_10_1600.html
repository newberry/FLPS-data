   <p>The readers have been well informed in our columns about the activities of the latest Catholic Day. This undoubtedly, has also been welcomed by the non-Catholics, among German-Americans.</p>
   <p>An exception to this is, of course, the resolution regarding the restoration of secular power and the rule of the papacy. Not only are all non-Catholics against this, but there are many German Catholics who disapprove all propaganda along that line, because they realize that these efforts are in vain, or they are aware that papacy has gained in spiritual and mental power since it lost its secular power.</p>
   <p>The German Catholics of this country, have demonstrated at the Catholic Day that they are loyal to the American government, just as the other German-Americans are; that they are strongly in favor of using their mother tongue in the home, in church, and in school, without neglecting in any sense the <span class="page-break">2</span>English language; and that they are determined to defend their equality with all other nationalities of this republic, in all church, state, and secular affairs.</p>
   <p>The most furious German haters must have clearly observed that the German Catholics of this country have nothing to do with the much scandalized manifestations of a Cahensly. Therefore the English-American Press can not continue to publish the most absurd stories about conspirations with foreign countries, unless they persist to be blind, or prefer to spread lies.</p>
