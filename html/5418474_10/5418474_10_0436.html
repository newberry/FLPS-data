   <p>To Coronel and Falkland, the two great German naval battles, was devoted the memorial celebration, last Saturday night, by the German Marine Bund of North America, Chicago branch, at the Germania Club. The meeting at the same time served as a welcome to the naval attache of the German embassy in Washington, Captain of the Navy Witthoeft.</p>
   <p>It was at Coronel, on the coast of Chile, where, for the first time, in November, 1914, a German squadron met an opponent of equal strength in open naval battle, and where, for the first time since Nelson, a British squadron made ready for battle. Coronel symbolizes a victory at sea for the German navy such as was never won before. Five weeks later, the same German squadron succumbed to a much superior opponent at the Falkland Isles. The twentieth <span class="page-break">\2</span>anniversary of both events occurs this year around this time.</p>
   <p>The memorial celebration of the German Navy Bund was held with extreme solemnity in the hall of the Germania Club, which was decorated with flags of the Reich, of the navy, and of the merchant marine. The hall was filled to the last seat, and the ceremonies proceeded with dignity. Following a number of musical numbers by the marine band, the fest was opened with the raising of the flag. Consul General Dr. Jaeger was present, together with his staff, representing the Reich government. Representing the Federal navy was the chief of staff, Wolleston, in place of Vice-Admiral Cluverius, who was unable to attend.</p>
   <p>Following a speech of welcome made by Herr Dr. W. Voigt, the German Consul General, Dr. Jaeger, took the floor. He pointed out that the spirit which now permeates the present small German marine is the same that animated the heroes of Coronel and Falkland. Up to this very day it is still ready to lay down everything for the fatherland. Stormy applause was given Dr. Jaeger when he asked the naval attache to use his influence so that, at the next visit of German warships to <span class="page-break">\3</span>one of the United States ports, a detachment of marines and officers may be sent to visit Chicago.</p>
   <p>Particular interest was elicited by the words of the guest of honor, Captain Witthoeft, who was in Chicago for the first time since he took over his post at the German embassy in Washington. After a short preface in German, in which he expressed joy at being allowed to participate in the Chicago memorial celebration of the Navy Bund, Captain Witthoeft continued in English. In his main speech he emphasized that the men belonging to the navies of various nations should bear no personal hatred against each other when the battle, in which they only have done their duty, is over. To prove his contention that where sailors meet, nations meet, Captain Witthoeft (who formerly was an officer on the old Emden, which formed a part of the squadron of Graf Spea) gave a number of examples from his own career, chiefly from the days of the World War.</p>
   <p>The memorial address was made by Herr R. Godbarsen, president of the Naval Bund, himself a participant in the naval battles of Coronel and Falkland. With <span class="page-break">\4</span>impressive words he described the events of the two days, giving a picture of faithfulness to duty on the part of officers and men, many of whom sacrificed their lives for the fatherland. With flags lowered, the singing of the "Lay of the Good Comrade" ended the memorial to those who fell at Coronel and Falkland. In a brief address, Captain Wolleson pointed out the spirit of comradeship among the sailors of all countries.</p>
   <p>German veteran organizations of Chicago, who came to honor their comrades of the navy, were the Styrian Ladies' Chorus, (sic) which, directed by H. A. Rehberg, sang a number of songs, and the Schuhplattler organization "Gamsgebirg," which also came to take part in the celebration. Caroline Reichert-Umbreit and Giuseppe Rizonini, of the International Opera Company, sang a number of songs, and Benno Bukow-Greiner and Irma Bremer contributed their share toward the entertainment of the guests.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the program, a ball took place, which lasted until a late hour.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The committee responsible for the success of the outstanding memorial celebration consisted of R. Godbarsen, B. Schmidt, H. Kohn, and E. Benlig.</p>
