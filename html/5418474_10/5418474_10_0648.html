   <p>Soon we'll say, good-by, Prince Carnival. On Rose-Monday, March 6, the great annual masquerade (it will be the 25th) and the 25th carnival season of the Rheinischen Verein (Club of the Rhine) will be a thing of the past. The silver jubilee season, is so far as the three "Dunce-cap meetings" are concerned, met with the customary success, and yesterday's assembly at Yondorf's Hall was no exception, for the stragglers found difficulty in obtaining seats, only a few being available on the balcony. An ocean of gay-colored head protectors greeted the observer. The walls, too, were suitably decorated and adorned with the emblems of the day. Music galore; songs and near beer, the only substitute available, kept up at the proper tempo the ardor of the participants.</p>
   <p>While the crowd found amusement in singing and conversation, some of those endowed with the social talents added their share by reciting monologues.</p>

   <p>After secretary Mathias Biesdorf's reading of "The Day's Roster," Mr. Gottfried Koehl expressed "foolish observations" about Schiller's works. He was relieved by Mrs. Gretchen Gerard's recitation, "The Book Saleslady;" and in turn came a wet-nurse, impersonated by Fritz Schroeder, who brought pandemonium. Similar appreciation rewarded the succeeding numbers: "German Punches," by Fritz Grobel, "An Ardent Wooer," by Heinrich Wegener, who added the couplet "Congress in Washington." Next came Heinrich Bungartz's "The Sermon on the Mountain;" then "The Warming Stone," which proved highly effective thanks to the efforts of Gustav Gillmann, Otto Roth, Helene Schroeder, and Miss Bonnem. Lively dancing concluded the program. The program was arranged by Mr. John Cremer, president of the club, and a group of members.</p>
   <p>Aurora Turnverein</p>
   <p>Yesterday's festivities to celebrate the fifty-second anniversary of the Aurora Turnverein were held at Wicker Park Hall and brought such a response that the Park's large assembly hall and even the adjacent rooms were crowded to overflowing. <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>The popularity of the club had much to do with it; to say nothing of the generous program which had been announced, in which there was offered not only many gymnastic numbers but also moving-pictures showing the great parade of "The Allied Associations for Local Option," an event that took place last November, as well as views of the war. The festivities began in the afternoon with orchestra numbers and several gymnastic acts. This was the order of procedure: Dumb bell exercises for boys, 2nd class; flag exercises for boys and girls of the 1st class; club swinging, 2nd class, for girls; [A long list follows in which older people are also included]; aesthetic dance by the girls of the 2nd class; and performances with regular equipment by the older, active members. All movements showed painstaking exactness, the result of capable leadership by our tried and true instructor E. A. Strobel.</p>
   <p>A very pleasing number was the portrayal of "The Star-Spangled Banner," in which Miss Evelyn Feyereisen appeared as Columbia, while the Misses Ruth Feyereisen and Vera Johnson sang the solo parts, accompanied on the piano by Miss Margarethe Johnson. The chairman of the Entertainment Committee, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>John Bobeng, presented diplomas to all members affiliated with the club for twenty-five years. Six Turners were eligible; and Mr. Peter Ellert, who showed continous participation for forty years, was given a beautiful "Bierstein" beer-mug).</p>
   <p>The moving pictures, were received with enthusiasm; even though they showed little which may be construed as new.</p>
   <p>The main speech was entrusted to August Behrens, one of the former senior speakers of the Aurora. He described the development of the club and its fluctuating periods of distress and prosperity. His speech was very interesting. "The Aurora has always been a pioneer of freedom, willing to support any cause beneficial to mankind, and it will follow this path in the future," he said.</p>
   <p>The festivial was exceedingly successful due to the extensive preparations made by the Turner members John Bobeng, chairman, and others.</p>

   <p>German Veterans' Club</p>
   <p>The various socials given by the German Veterans' Club during the winter have been growing in popularity, and yesterday's large attendance is ample proof of this assertion. The two lower halls were crowded; one served for a social gathering and lectures, the other was reserved for dancing. Doctor Gerhard, one of the members, acted as chairman. Doctor Nachtigall gave a very interesting and informative lecture, "The Development of Cancer and its Treatment," during the course of which he discussed the subject in terms easily understood by the uninitiated. The lecture over, there followed a number of musical selections, the reading of Mrs. Martha Kiehl's poem on the present war, Carl Schledorn's recitation of "The Flag of Dijon," a monologue by Hans Stunkel, and other numbers.</p>
