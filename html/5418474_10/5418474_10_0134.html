   <p>Dear Mr. Editor: I think that it would be worth while to publish the following facts in the Chicago Arbeiter Zeitung because what happened to me, the undersigned with my two daughters, that also happens to many other German parents who are trying to send their children to the free schools, so they may learn something.</p>
   <p>I used to live on the west side at Elston Avenue; four weeks ago I moved to the north side #34 Concord Place. When the vacations were ended. My wife went to the west side and got the certificates for both children as it is customary. With that she went to the Clybourn Avenue Public School. Naturally there were many mothers and fathers with their children to have them enrolled. Those, who spoke English were quickly taken care of, but the Germans were not considered. When my wife's turn came, she told from where she came, and demanded the certificates of both girls, but the old, short, corpulent teacher or whatever she might be, did not care to listen to anything, gesticulated with her hands and ordered her to leave the place. My wife left with embarrassment and with her quite a few other German women and men, who were <span class="page-break">\2</span>trying to get instruction for their children.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>Henry Goppelt.</p>
   <p>Monday we had to report a similar case. The Germans had been treated roughly by knownothings of the school, on the corner of Willow and Orchard Street, and had been forced to desist from their intention to enter their children in that public institution. This is outrageous and the German members of the school board should make it their task to see that such things do not happen again.</p>
   <p>School principals should be the last ones to discriminate between persons and nationalities. If they do that, they prove that they lack the most essential qualifications of an educator, a feeling for fairness and justice.</p>
