   <p>The annual meeting of the Chicago branch organization of the German-American National League was held yesterday at 106 Randolph Street. The Association's president, Mr. Michael F. Girten, was chairman of the evening. The suggestion that this year's German Day shall be celebrated by each branch organization separately, did not find the expected response from the meeting; moreover, the assembly advised the usual joint celebration of the day.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fritz v. Frantzius, who is the manager of the benefit fund for the assistance of needy veterans who participated in wars fought by Germany, requested that moral support shall be extended to this cause. The response was exceedingly gratifying. The newly elected directors of the organization are Eugen Nideregger, M. F. Girten, Joseph Danziger, Franz Doniat, C. O. Kellermann, Ernet Brosius, Otto Cummerow, Karl Christmann, Ernst Kusswurm, Louis Sala, Anton Kercher, Karl Haerting, Lorenz Schlegel, and C. A, Schoessow.</p>
   <p>Attention was called to the forthcoming lecture, "The value of the German language <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the field of education," to be given next Wednesday by Mr. C. H. Kammann, president of the League State's Association at the North Side Turner Hall.</p>
