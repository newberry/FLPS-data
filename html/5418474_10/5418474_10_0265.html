   <p>The Germans regardless of party always have stood for a sensible and reasonable currency system, and this attitude has been appreciated greatly by the thoughtful among the English-Americans. The Germans have resisted energetically any in-flation of unredeemable paper money; and they are just as determined in their stand against the free coinage of silver. The Independent, the Republican, as well as the Democratic German press (with the exception of one) are all fighting against the silver swindle. The German Democrats demand a program antagonistic toward the free coinage of silver whenever a national election is on hand. This is the reason why the Germans of the whole United States are for Grover Cleveland. However, should Cleveland be sacrificed for one who favors free coinage of silver at the coming National Democratic Convention, the Democratic Party would experience an unpleasant surprise with the German Democrats.</p>
