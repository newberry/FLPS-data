   <p>This newly organized club held a meeting yesterday, which was well attended, and assured the successful continuation of the same.</p>
   <p>After the election of its officers, H. Rasper gave a very enthusiastic address, in which he expounded the necessity to always defend Germanism. He asserted that it is very urgent for the German-Americans to awake from their stupor and to shake off the chains with which they too readily had permitted themselves to be enslaved, from all sides.</p>
   <p>A quartet was formed and it entertained the audience with the singing of good German folk songs.</p>
