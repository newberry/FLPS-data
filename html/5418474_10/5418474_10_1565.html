   <p>The former Imperial Court preacher Dr. Adolph Stoecker, who arrived yesterday evening from Philadelphia and stops at the Hyde Park Hotel, took this morning, occasion to excuse himself that the many people who came to the Central Music Hall yesterday to hear his lecture had to leave disappointed. "It was really inevitable," said Mr. Stoecker,"as the special train of the Manufacturer's Club from Philadelphia with which I came was nearly four hours late." Concerning his working plans everything depends of the arrangements which Mr. Moody makes. Questioned by a reporter if Mr. Stoecker will hold anti-semitic lectures here in America, he replied," that he has not come for this purpose. He came plainly as a preacher and he will not hold any political speeches," just as unlikely is he will express his anti-semitic ideas.</p>
