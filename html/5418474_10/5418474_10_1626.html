   <p>A committee of the Evangelical Conference, at Wisconsin Street, recommended, not to give an authorized version of the circumstances which led to the much disputed schism in its ranks, as by this action the various assertions will have their effects diminished. Furthermore, all information shall be with-held from the "Evangelical" and the "German General Nerus Paper", as these publications promoted dissension in the church which helped only to hasten the breach.</p>
   <p>Bishop Bowman, of Iowa, addressed the assembly amidst much acclaim. In the Sheffield Avenue Church, Pastor D. Byers replaced Pastor C. A. Paette, as presiding Elder of the Naperville conference.</p>
