   <p>The German Young Men's Christian Association, corner Wells and Carl Streets, a branch of the Y. M. C. A., arranged an evening of entertainment for yesterday. The hall was filled to capacity. All honor to the Secretary of the association, Mr. Horlacher, because through his efforts this association has prospered. It is not yet one year old, and it has already seventy six members.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of well rendered solos, excellent declamations, various instrumental music. All were enthusiastically applauded. One of the members contributed some humorous declamations. The evening was spent very profitably and enjoyably by every one present.</p>
