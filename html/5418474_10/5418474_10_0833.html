   <p>Brand's Hall was the scene last night of a very jolly, really German celebration. The Chicago Veterans of the German Army celebrated there, their Third Annual Festival and at the same time the 21st anniversary of the Foundation of the German Empire. All German Military Organizations were represented by deputations. A particularly patriotic impression was created by the Bohemian Unit "Radetzki" which appeared in uniforms.</p>
   <p>All numbers of the well arranged program pleased the visitors enormously. All had a good time. A dance kept the younger folks together until late in the night.</p>
