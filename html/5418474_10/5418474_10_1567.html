   <p>In the hall of the St. Joseph's school, at Hill and Market Streets, the first general meeting of the German Catholic Young Men's Association took place last night at 8 o'clock. The meeting was held under the auspices of the St. John Young Men's Association, and proceeded in a splendid and uplifting manner. Since the weather was very unfavorable, none of the out-of-town visitors appeared, but numerous delegates from the eight associations of the city assembled in the beautifully decorated hall. The members of the St. John's Association, competing with the Benedictine Sisters, had done their utmost to decorate and beautiful the hall. The young men proved that they intended to continue, earnestly and intelligently, the program as set forth by the Association and considered it the right way. The program contained a rich selection of various chorals, songs, and several speeches. We mention especially the inspiring address of the former president, M. B. Zimmer, who spoke concerning importance of Young Men's Associations, and the speech by <span class="page-break">2</span>Mr. F. X. Faller, who spoke on the topic of Religion in Business, Amusements and Temperance. The excellent contributions by the Temple Quartet and the mandolin orchestra added their share to the success of the festivity which will long be pleasantly remembered by all who attended.</p>
