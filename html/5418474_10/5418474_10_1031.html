   <p>"Restless in his productivity, keen in his mind, steadfast in his morals, secure in his rights, strong in his defense: thus may our people walk hopefully toward the future."</p>
   <p>Two artisan apprentices walked toward Cologne. One of them was from Cologne, and was just finishing his travels, and intended to become a master artisan. The other came from the East, intending to continue his apprenticeship at Cologne.</p>
   <p>The closer they came towards the city on the Rhine, the more taciturn became the Colognan. The other kept telling him of his home of the beautiful church in his home city. When, however, the Colognan did not seem to pay enough attention and was continually enveloped in his own thoughts, his companion burst out with the following words: "You keep having an exaggerated opinion of your Dome. I do not expect it to be anything particular".</p>
   <p>When the powerful towers of the Dome became more distinct, the other became more silent. When they stood before the Dome, the Colognan asked: "Brother, what do you say now?".....</p>
   <p>With this, the story of German Day is as much as told. Dame Clio, (sic), however, expects more....she asks a little too much.</p>
   <p>It would be easy now to let loose words of praise, but the cause would not be served by it. Through this fest show, something came forth that will be of great importance for the future of Chicago's Germans. It is to be admitted that all expectations have been surpassed--that it pays to work for German Day if you do it right, but it will also be quite hard to surpass this present achievement or even to make anything like it.</p>
   
   <p>Many apparently became aware for the first time how manifold are German what the Germans have evolved into in the course of centuries, with what momentum they have inscribed themselves into the history of the world. The individual scenes of the mommental picture will give to many the right explanation, so that a herald could say, "We have every reason to be proud of our ancestry, able, as we are, to name such an enormous number of heroes of the mind as our own tribesmen."</p>
   <p>A Bridge Across the Centuries</p>
   <p>In the same manner in which the history of the German people has taken from did Herr Brand shape his entertainment.</p>
   <p>These were no pictures cut for a special reason; no, there were pictures taken from life, the hard life side by side with the soft, war and peace mixed together, pictures that will be engraved in memory for a long time, pictures that showed how inseparable the German is from his history.</p>
   
   <p>All that, however, was only an introduction. In all the pictures the symbol of collective unity was missing--the flag.</p>
   <p>How, through the flags it was expressed that it is possible to be a good American, and yet remain a German at heart, was probably the most beautiful part of the show.</p>
   <p>Two flags stood opposite each other, the American and the German, surrounded by warriors who fought for these flags when they stood, one against the other, on the field of battle. Across everything that separated them the mutual salute of honor, was given the highest expression of mutual respect.</p>
   <p>The American national anthem resounded mightily, sung by all present. "In the citizen's oath we swore fealty to thee, Columbia; we intend to keep it!"</p>
   <p>Then, in a powerful roar "Deutschland, Deutschland ueber alles". "We think of thee, old land of the fathers. We shall never forget thee, we shall preserve what we took with us from thee on our way to this country".</p>
   <p>Then Germania is welcomed by Columbia: "Here we stand. We come not as beggars. We bring something with us that you can use if you grant us a place to live. You let our past pass in review before you so you may know whom you take into your community".</p>
   <p>According to the results of the presale it was anticipated that quite an imposing gathering would be present. All expectations were exceeded however. About twenty thousand persons came and only those seats remained unoccupied that could not be sold because the stage could not be seen from them. The throngs at the entrances were at times so large that the gentlemen from the reception committee [Editor's note: Police, possibly?] were often hard pressed to pacify the impatient ones who boisterously demanded admittance.</p>
   <p>The large hall was decorated with American and German flags in a dignified way. The stage made a particularly good impression. All "loud" decorations were rejected and only a modest wreath of oak leaves wound itself about the scaffolding. The ladies' choruses sat flanking the stage in their white gowns, and in the mezzanine were the lady turners.</p>
   <p>In the corridors, traffic was unusually heavy. Thanks to the excellent information given, there was no disorder. Everyone hastened to get a good seat.</p>
   <p>At six o'clock sharp the great organ played a march. The buzz in the hall kept increasing. The tension could be felt everywhere, and all eyes were directed on the stage. The patience of the audience was not tried for long. The curtain failed to open, though, as was planned right after the introduction by the organ, but the music stopped to bridge over the unintended pause.</p>
   <p>A shrill signal soon came from a whistle, and the president of German Day, Architect Gustave A. Brand, gave the sign to begin.</p>
   <p>It is especially to be emphasized that the moment the performance began the flying peddlers who until then offered their wares for sale disappeared immediately so that the events on the stage could be followed undisturbed.</p>
   <p>Beside many German-Americans, there was also a sizeable number of officials from the various administrations, among them Mayor Kelly, who took over the honorary chairmanship of the meeting. There were further Postmaster Ernest J. Kruetgen, Fire Commissioner Arthur Seyferlich, Jury Commissioner Charles Neumann, Clerk of the Criminal Court George Seif, County Recorder Clayton F. Smith, County Judge Edmund K. Jarecki, exsheriff John E. Traeger, District Judge Burke, Alderman John Toman, former postmaster Arthur C. Lueder, Judge John G. Lewe, member of the tax revision board Fred W. Richter, Emil Eitel, Karl Eitel, Paul H. Mueller, the editor of the Abendpost, Attorney F. W. Siebel, Attorney Joseph B. Hermes, and Clerk of the District Court John A. Convoy.</p>
   <p>In the box of the German Consulate sat Dr. Rolph Jaeger and Consul Dr. Tannenberg, together with the whole staff of the Consulate-General.</p>
   <p>A strong delegation came from Milwaukee, with about two hundred persons led by Herr Seelig. Germans from outside Chicago sent their representatives, especially the Germans from Indiana.</p>

   <p>The Festive Show</p>
   <p>The moment arrived! Silently the throng waited for the performance of the show destined to captivate all present for the hours to come. With admirable zeal, sacrificing his own interests, the president of this year's German Day celebration, Gustave A. Brand, had composed the fest-show "Heimatsklaenge" (familiar sounds from the homeland) which was made the basis for the stage presentation. Scenes and costumes for the show were designed by himself. Many smaller details had to be worked out, with which he was well assisted by all co-operating in the celebration of German Day. He was at last to see the crowning of his labors and to witness the enthusiasm with which the crowds were gripped by the performance. Under the leadership of the actor, Kurt Benisch, a stage show was presented which appealed greatly to the audience. Directors Walter Steindel, Rheinhold Walter, and H. A. Rehberg handled the musical part of the program in a fine manner.</p>
   <p>Then resounded the strains of the organ through the stadium. With the last note, a group of carefree students came marching down the main entrance to the stage singing the beautiful song "Horch, was Kommt von draussen rein". Drowsy, as though after a night of debauchery, they slumped down at the foot of the platform, but their slumber was fated to be quite short. With a lantern in his hand came a night watchman attired in a medieval garb, and proclaimed in a loud voice: "Hear ye, people, let it be said, the bell has rung six times". There was no time for sleep. The day of the Chicago Germans had to be celebrated. Who would think of being weary?</p>
   <p>A flourish of trumpets announced the arrival of the Germania group. Accompanied by torch bearers and an honor guard of young ladies, the symbol of German lands, "Germania," was carried through the hall seated on a throne. Meantime the stage curtain was parted and "Columbia" was seen sitting on a throne surrounded by the forms of American history whose cradle stood in the old homeland. It was elevating to see "Columbia" rise from her throne and with outstretched arm go to meet "Germania's" daughter. An embodiment of welcome was then accorded to Germany's sons and daughters in their new homeland.</p>
   <p>Again trumpets were heard announcing the procession of the historical groups symbolizing Germany's history from its beginnings to the present. Much more beautiful than could be expressed with a thousand words was the expression given by the fest show through the deep meaning underlying the celebration. To exult in the deeds of the fathers and to gather new strength for the struggle to maintain the nation intact, the audience had a demonstration of an image of the German soul as represented by the embodiment of its great men and women. Accompanied by the strains of Wagner's "Kaiser march," the apparitions from the earliest days of the German people--from the stone age and the bronze age--marched through the hall, presented by members of the Hessians' Club, under the leadership of H. Dochtermann. Clothed in skins and armed with javelins and clubs, the figures marched through the hall toward the stage. Hermann of the Cherusci, Germania's great son, was characterized by a blond youth with a sword in his hand. Characters from the battle of the Huns, in which the struggle of the Asiatic with the Germanic-Christian culture was decided in favor of the latter, followed after. Accessory groups embodied the chase, the nomadic elements, idolatry, and the influence of the Romans.</p>
   
   <p>After the groups took their places on the stage the monarchs and great war lords of the German people represented by the veterans' organizations under their group leader, Paul Kirsch, passed by the rows of spectators. From among the great number of German sovereigns and leaders of armies those were selected who had gained merit with the German people as leaders. The figures of Frederick the Great and of Hindenburg, whose masks and poses were splendid imitations, were greeted by the throngs with roaring applause.</p>
   <p>The religious life of the German people was presented by the Steuben Boosters under their group leader, Dr. G. A. Eberhardt. They were next in line. The spiritual development of the German people from the conversion of the Germans to Christianity and the time of the Reformation was pictorially demonstrated by outstanding figures.</p>
   <p>Then the orchestra, under the direction of Walter Steindel, played Beethoven's "Second Symphony". To its strains, groups representing art, poetry, science, culture and philosophy, consisting or members from the Swabian Society moved in solemn procession into the hall, guided by their group leader, George Iberle. They presented the outstanding figures from the rich cultural life of the German people. The public kept acknowledging their efforts with applause. The German Art Society, under their leader, Martin Ziegner, followed with a group in which the beaux arts were personified together with their outstanding representatives. High above the group, the figure representing Art was carried to the stage in a litter, where it took its stand with the other groups which kept filling the stage. The next group was presented as an homage to Agriculture, Commerce and Industry by the German Club, under its leaders, Frau B. A. C. Hoelzer and Captain George Weideling. Increasingly the conviction prevailed that this all-embracing drama was a delight. Much that was beautiful was offered by the participating organizations.</p>
   <p>One group which ostensibly carried progress on its banner was that of the sailing ship staged by the aviation teacher George Dengler, and the marine aviator Joseph Steinhaner. Topping this group was the figure of a naval pilot. Preceding the group was a shield on which the motto of German aviation could be read.</p>
   <p>Strains from the "Nibelungen March" and from "Hansel and Gretel" ushered in figures from the German sagas and fairy tales. The Knusper-Haeuschen (candy cottage) and Schnee-Wittchen (Snow White) with the seven dwarfs were present. The group was staged by the Ladies' Aid Society of German Day, headed by their leader, Frau A. Mattesius.</p>
   <p>Once again the public was given a view of the history of the neighboring former monarchy, Austro-Hungary, for all to remember that there are people living there who are of the same ancestry and of the same blood as the German. From the history of the Germans of that land, figures of vigor like Maria Teresa, Josef the second, Andreas Hofer, and others are conspicuous; homage was given them by the members by the united Austro-Hungarian organizations under their group leader, John Strama.</p>
   
   <p>When homage is given to all, the German woman must not be overlooked. Into her hands was laid the task of giving meaning to the German character. Her memory was honored before the united Austro-Bavarian Ladies' Society, led by Frau E. Kunz "The German Women, Her Life and Activity," bringing into view the manysided problems of the German woman.</p>
   <p>The Low-German guild Jefferson #24, with its leader, Karl Stasinswsky, took it upon itself to honor the German artisan with a sketch, "Gilden, Zuenfte und Gewerk-shaften" (guilds, crafts and unions). Attired in medieval costumes the representatives of the crafts walked to the stage carrying their tools and the products of their toil. Strains from Richard Wagner's "Die Meister-singer" heralded the procession. The hope of the German people, its youth was represented by the Jungenschaft (crew of boys) of the Bund of Friends of New Germany, at the sight of whom the public had a look into the future, as it were, of the German nation. Lads and lasses, their postures smart, marched to the stage and there took their positions among the rows of performers who swelled to such numbers that the spacious stage could not hold them all. Behind them marched a group of Americans with the American national colors.</p>
   <p>A flourish of trumpets announced the end of the procession of the historical groups. The doing of homage before the two symbolic figures, "Columbia" and "Germania," was to begin. A group of heralds, composed of members of the Swabian Saengerbund and of the ladies from Madame Ludwig's dancing school conducted Herald Curt Benisch to the stage, where he recited the prologue to the celebration of German Day, closing with homage to the two figures. Then the trumpets ushered in the procession of organization flags from all affiliated organizations taking their positions at both sides of the open space on the stage. Once again trumpets resounded to the pageant of government flags with their convoys recruited from the Woodlawn Post of the American Legion under its commander, Major Hamlet E. Ridgeway. With ringing music played by the marching minstrels, World War Veterans escorted by a guard of honor, the colors of New Germany were brought in by the Organization of German War Veterans, the German Warriors' organization, the Steel Helmet, and the Bund of the Friends of New Germany. Around the ensign carrying the star-spangled banner there were grouped the ensigns of the German national flags, then all flags were simultaneously carried to the stage. Remaining on their feet the throngs intoned the American National Anthem while the German colors and the flags of German organizations were lowered. Similar honors were given to the German colors by the singing of the Deutschland Lied. With the departure of the groups the historical part of the show was closed.</p>
   <p>Scarcely had the waves of enthusiasm subsided when the orchestra began to shift to the second part of the show. It was going to emphasize the importance of bodily care. The columns of drummers and pipers from the social and Lincoln Turnvereine, clad in white, marched upon the stage ushering in the man and women turners from the Illinois Turn District. The stage was thrown open and the gaze of the spectators fell upon a bust of the Father of Turning, John, in whose honor the turners sang the "Father John Lied," accompanied by the audience. This was followed by calisthenics of the Riege (team) supervised by Turnward E. C. Klafs and by shorts fencing bouts by the Turnverein Vorwaerts, commanded by the fencing master of the Club, Henry Kraft. Smartly and with postures exact as the preceding performances, the turners marched down from the stage to make room for the gay muses of dance and song.</p>
   <p>Infected by the enthusiasm, the Woodlawn Post of the American Legion wanted to show off with its drill routine, and gave a few samples of dress parade exercises under its commander, Major Hamlet C. Ridgway. The public responded with shouts of joy.</p>
   <p>A mass group of German girls, conducted by Madame Ludwig, with a dance interpretation, demonstrated the beauty of the body in modern German dancing art. It had been rehearsed by Miss Erika Thimey, a student of Wiegman. The United Ladies' Choruses directed by H. A. Rehberg, followed with sicher's "Lorelei". Meanwhile the stage curtain opened and in the background the rocks of Lorelei became visible. In conjunction with this, the Chicago Singverein brought Rheinberger's "Wiegenlied," conducted by the music director, Walter Steindel. The song which now followed with Walter's arrangment of the folk song "Die Kapelle" was also accompanied by a living picture. It was given by the United Singers of Chicago, under Reinhold Walter, while the organ accompanied the song. Calisthenics were performed by the girls' section of the Turnverein Vorwaerts, under the direction of Arthur Buchler. The fencing team of the Turnverein Vorwaerts brought with them plastic figures (sic) which made an impressive effect. With Miller's song "Die Einkehr," the United Singers concluded the second part of the performance, conducted by Rheinhold Walter.</p>
   <p>The gay note with which the fest show was started was sustained to the end. In a scene out of Old Nuernberg, known in the whole world from the "Meister-singers," the third part of the fest performance gay activity was carried on, and there was quite a stir. Constumes and dances from homelands, were given. Genuine humor from these customs and usages was transmitted to the throngs of people who, carried away by the swing of the fest, were not stingy with applause. A Watschentanz (slap-in-the-face dance), given by Conrad Obermeier and Franz Heinrich; the Sdyrian figure dance "Hidauer Plattler," performed by the Schuh plattler Verein "Gamsberg", led by Siegfried Weiss, and a Westphalian dance by the teacher of dancing and gymnastics, Miss Anna Rudolph, did not miss their effect, and contributed considerably to the general pleasure. The German-Hungarian Home for the Aged organization staged a Banat costume show, giving once again a place of honor to the costumes of the Home. The Swabian ladies' organization undertook to bring back to memory the popular wine of their home and of the Cannstatt Folksfests. They organized a picturesque Swabian procession with a genuine gigantic grape which spread the smell of musk all around. A group of dancers from Madame Ludwig's gave a rustic valse. In their bright dresses, they impressed with the symphony of colors complemented by a symphony of form.</p>
   <p>After an organ solo, the united ladies' choirs sang the Stein song "Der Spielmann ist da". It was followed by "Rosenstock, Holderbluet" sung by the United Singers.</p>
   
   <p>The master of the whole production, who until now had kept himself modestly in the background, consented to accept an expression of gratitude from all present. This was done by the first vice-president of this year's German Day, Herr Fritz Brumund. With a quiver in his voice, and overcome with pride over the work accomplished, Mr. Brand thanked all who, by their co-operation and attendance, contributed their share towards the success of the performance. His conviction that the Germans of the City would be for a German Day with all their heart was proved by their deeds especially when something good, beautiful, and artistically valuable is offered them. It should remain the guiding principle for future celebrations of German Day.</p>
   <p>Singing together the "Wacht an Rhein," the splendid day of the Germans came to a close. All took with them the conscious knowledge of having experienced something that will become the envy of all those who were absent from the celebration.</p>
