   <p>We cannot agree entirely with the statements made lately by Professor Knortz, superintendent of public schools in Evansville ( Indiana) , in regards to the German language in America.</p>
   <p>Professor Knortz is praising the French Canadians for their perseverance in preserving the French language for 200 years, whereas the Germans in the United States do not speak their mother tongue any more in the 2d and 3d generation. Professor Knortz is ignoring the fact, that Canada has been for over 100 years a purely French colony under the direct rule of the French Government. This period laid the foundation of French civilization, the French language and French community life in Canada, which even later under British rule gave the province of Quebec a well guarded home-rule concerning the French-language. Even the influx of English, Irish and other European immigrants could not change this status, and thus Eastern Canada became a territory with two principal languages...English and French.</p>
   <p>The situation in the United States is different. This country has been British territoty during 400 years before the American revolution and before a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>noteworthy arrival of Non-English speaking immigrants.</p>
   <p>Particularly German elements did not enter this country in larger numbers before the beginning of the 19th century, and when they did come-they had to learn English as a means ofcommunication with the English talking population and towards an easier livelihood in general. It is quite understandable that most German newcomers were more interested in learning English thoroughly than being left behind with the mere knowledge of German.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the Germans in this country have done a lot to preserve German arts, music, literature and the German language. Innumerable German newspapers, schools and German societies are carrying out this task continuously for the benefit of our American-born German children.</p>
   <p>If the latter and their offsprings gradually forget the German language, then this is caused mostly by the assimilating process, which is a melting pot, building the fundamental structure of the American nation.</p>
