   <p>The Nineteenth National Convention of German Baptist Churches of North America will be in session until the end of this month at the Moody Institute, Chicago Avenue and La Salle Street. About six hundred delegates, representing congregations in all parts of the United States, are in attendance.</p>
   <p>To open the program of the Convention, the Baptist Male Chorus, under the leadership of Director[Otto]Berndt sang "Greetings," after which Dr. F. L. Anderson made the welcoming address. Fred F. Friedrich welcomed the delegates in the name of the Chicago churches. Professor F. Kaiser, chairman of the Conference, made the opening address, and Fred J. Pfeiffer the opening sermon.</p>
   <p>Reverend W. Kuhn, of Philadelphia, secretary of the General Mission Board, reported on missions. It was decided to move the managing office of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>missions from New York to Chicago. It was also resolved to send a committee to Germany in order to determine the best way in which the spiritual and material needs of the Baptists there might be served. Should the Baptists in Berlin become unable to carry on the work of manning the mission in Kamerun[Africa]as they have done in the past, then the work will be carried on by the Baptists in America.</p>
   <p>One matter of great importance may be reported here. The Convention resolved to continue the use of the German language in church services and Sunday schools. In the Eastern states English is used principally, but not to any extent in the states west of the Mississippi. The secretaries of the Convention are: Reverends E. Umbach, Racine, Wisconsin; and S. Rese, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sessions will be held today, Saturday, and Sunday.</p>
