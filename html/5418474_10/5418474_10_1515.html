   <p>The St. Alphonso Hall at Southport and Oakdale Avenue could not hold the number of visitors last night, which had come to view the performance of the Oberammerganer Passion plays, explained by moving and stereoptical pictures. The German Roman Catholic Central Association, at the inducement of the St. Joseph Club gave the performance and Dr. John H. Scherer made the German translation. The deep impression, which the individual pictures made on the public, has been strenghtened by suitable songs of soloists.</p>
   <p>The passion plays, without doubt, will be performed by many other local Catholic congregations, as the undertaking has the fullest support of the clergy.</p>
