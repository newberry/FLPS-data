   <p>In accordance with the proclamation which the Mayor of Chicago issued today all organizations of the city and vicinity have been requested to participate in the memorial procession next Monday afternoon. I therefore ask all Turnvereins (gymnastic clubs) of the Chicago district to march in the procession. All inquiries from out-of-town clubs addressed to me will receive prompt attention. [Translator's note: The procession commemorates President Garfield's death.]</p>

   <p>German Clubs and Lodges</p>
   <p>The Turnverein Vorwaerts (Forward Gymnastic Club) has announced a special meeting for tonight, at the Club's hall, to make preparations for the procession, and all members are urgently requested to be present. The members of the Chicago Turngemeinde will attend the memorial procession in full numbers. They will appear at 12:30 P.

   <p>The Oddfellows held a meeting yesterday at their lodge, corner Clark and Washington Streets. Grand Patriarch John P. Foss presided. It was decided to ask all the members to march in the procession in honor of the departed member of the Order, President Garfield, and Grand Patriarch Foss was nominated marshal of the Oddfellows' division of the procession. A committee was formed consisting of the marshal, the high patriarchs, and other high ranking members of the lodge, who will make the necessary arrangements. All lodges and divisions are requested to meet at their respective halls at 10:30 next Monday and to march to the corner of Clark and Washington Streets, where the Oddfellows' division will be formed. After the procession a memorial ceremony will be held, with J. Ward Ellis as principal speaker. The members of the Committee are M. C. McClure, John Snitzer, J. Ward Ellis, Samuel Stein, M. C. Eames, J. Buechel, Charles Seymour, and Leon Schlossman.</p>
   
   <p>An appeal was also issued to the Knights of Pythias....to march in the procession....in full uniform....and whoever has none is to wear dark clothes.... [Translator's note: No German names, in fact, no names at all are given; so the item has been abbreviated.]</p>

   <p>The Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers' Association) held a special meeting yesterday at Joseph Miehle's hall, on South State Street, which was well attended, and the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>"The members of the German Wirthsverein of Chicago, good and true citizens of this great Republic, are deeply moved by the death of our beloved President, a loss which is felt throughout the land, and we therefore resolve and declare:</p>
   <p>That the departed was a good citizen, a courageous and unselfish crusader in the interests of liberty, an excellent statesman, and a man exemplary in his domestic life;</p>
   <p>"That we hereby give assurances of our profound sympathy to his bereaved family;</p>
   <p>"That we honor our esteemed President, who met tragic death at the hand of an assassin, and that we will close our places of business next Monday, September 26, throughout the duration of the memorial services;</p>
   <p>"That our Association will be represented by a delegation of members in the funeral procession; and</p>
   <p>"That a copy of these resolutions shall be sent to the family of the deceased.</p>
   
   <p>"The Committee on Resolutions:</p>
   <p>V. Knobloch, Philip Dieter, Peter Mahr,</p>
   <p>Christ Volke, Charles Schreiber,</p>
   <p>John Mueller, Joseph Miehle"</p>
   <p>Upon a motion by Peter Mahr it was decided to close all saloons from ten o'clock in the morning to five o'clock in the afternoon, and Messrs. Peter Mahr, Joseph Miehle, George Gruenbaum, Christ Volke, and Frank Schwucho were delegated to request the Mayor to issue a proclamation to all the tavernkeepers of Chicago, including those not members of the Association, directing them to keep their places of business closed during the aforementioned hours. A motion was carried that the officers of the Wirthsverein and the committee on legal matters should occupy three coaches in the procession. Participation of the Association in a body was considered inadvisable because the majority of the members are also affiliated with other clubs and will therefore be present anyway.</p>
   <p>Other Participants</p>
   <p>....The State militia....The Hancock Veterans....</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Order of G. S. P. O. will be represented by nine clubs and about five hundred members, according to the Mayor; the Bohemian Expert Riflemen [a sharpshooters' association] will also march.</p>
   <p>City and State officials will go to Cleveland after meeting at the Tremont House.....The Stock Exchange decided to send a deputation to Cleveland..... Departure Sunday afternoon....</p>

   <p>Mourning Decorations (Vox Populi)</p>
   <p>"The statement of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung that even the smallest hovel would display symbols of mourning by next Monday induced the writer to make a casual investigation on the North Side. The editor's opinion appears to be justified; the smallest homes show signs of mourning. But what about the palaces of the wealthy, east of Wells Street? In those locations where the German workingmen and the none-too-prosperous German businessmen make their homes the houses give mute evidence that the occupants feel genuine sorrow for our departed President, the man who rose from the ranks, and that the people of this district have done everything possible (considering their limited means) to express their sentiments. I do not speak of the main streets of the North Side, such as Chicago Avenue, Clark, Wells, Sedgwick, and Larrabee Streets and Clybourn and North Avenues, where naturally nearly every housedisplays black decorations. I have in mind the unpretentious side streets such as Vedder Street and Rees Street, west of Larrabee Street, where workingmen have their modest homes, localities where almost all houses show the dark color indicative of sorrow. On Dearborn Avenue [Avenue, verbatim] from Division Street to Illinois Street the writer could find only seventeen places which displayed black, and this count includes even the smallest ribbon, and two thirds of these symbols were smaller than those on Vedder and Rees Streets. Of course most of the businessmen living in these palaces had decorated their stores profusely in black, but that was just a matter of business. Genuine sorrow manifests itself at home; at home we show what sentiments we actually have. Or do the gentlemen in their magnificent houses fear to be reminded too much of death? In that even we shall have recourse to Schiller's lines, the declaration of one of the Homeric heroes to the braggart Thersites, which by the substitution of another name becomes highly suitable in this instance:</p>
   <p>" 'Even Garfield had to die, and he was greater than ye!' "</p>
   <p>Resolutions</p>
   <p>The Vorwaerts Turnverein held its last general session in honor of the President. Dr. Liebig spoke, eulogizing the character of the eminent man and expressing great regret at the despicable political corruption which prevails in America, of which he regarded Garfield as the innocent victim, the third man who had suffered death because of such deplorable conditions. An opinion was also expressed to the effect that the Republic would not need a President. The Club decided to publish the speech, since it fully coincided with the principles of the Turnerbund, as set forth in its platform. [Translator's note: No other details are given.]</p>
