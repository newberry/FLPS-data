   <p>The German "Kriegerverein" of Chicago celebrated yesterday and today, its thirtieth foundation jubilee at North Chicago Schuetzen Park. As an introduction there was a parade from the North Side Turner Hall, Clark Street, to Lincoln's Monument in Lincoln Park. The parade was led by Lieutenant Max Heidelmeier at the head of a detachment of police in gala uniforms, followed by the German Marine Band, the festival marshall Wilhelm Schmidt, Adjutant-General Georg von Massow and staff, all on horseback, the section "Iron Cross", the German Military Club, Militia Club, German Army Comrades and, last, the German War Veterans.</p>
   <p>In front of Lincoln's Monument the parade came to a stop in honor of the great President, and there it was greeted by Judges Brentano, Stein, Mack, Tuthill, Chetlain, President of the County Board, Foreman, President of the Lincoln Park Board, Tracy, City Treasurer McGann, Coroner Traeger, an adjutant who was representative of General Grant, and many other notables. That the Mayor did not accept the invitation was especially noted. As soon as the parade was lined up, the Marine Band stepped forward and played two <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>marches, the "Wacht am Rhein" and the "Star Spangled Banner". Special street cars brought the crowd to Schuetzen Park.</p>
   <p>The festivities at the Park, which were attended by 15,000 people, were thoroughly enjoyed by all. The official program was introduced by a festival prologue from Mr. E. F. L. Gauss. This was followed by speeches and the bestowing of personal and flag decorations, a concert and general recreation.</p>
