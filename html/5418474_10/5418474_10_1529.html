   <p>The new and beautiful hospital building of the Alexian Brothers, Racine and Belden Avenues, received yesterday the ecclesiastical consecration by Archbishop Feehan with a pompous celebration. A High Mass was held, by Pater Matthias, in the Hospital Chapel. Especially impressive was the singing which was taken over by the famous student chorus of the Teacher Seminary in St. Francis, Wis. which is conducted by Prof. Dr. J. Singenberger. The festival speech was given by the Archbishop in English, and Pater Adolphus of the St. Elizabeth Hospital congratulated the Alexian Brothers on their success, in the German tongue.</p>
   <p>He expressed the wish that the exorbitant trouble and labor, connected with the erection of this beautiful building, might find adequate recognition. The investiture of the Novices John Borucki, Georg Lauten Schlaeger, and John Baccini, concluded the High Mass, which was followed by a splendid banquet.</p>
