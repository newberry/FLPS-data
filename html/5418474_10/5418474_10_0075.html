   <p>Several weeks ago the Illinois Staats-Zeitung mentioned in one of its articles the possibility of organizing a German-American Party, and readers were invited to express their opinion about it. This has been neglected so far; perhaps the organization of such a party has been considered futile. If two Germans in the Old Country have three different opinions, the German-Americans here are not less prolific in variations of viewpoint. Every attempt to organize will be doomed to failure, because the German-Americans could not bear the idea that one of them might achieve political success, due to such a party.</p>
   <p>This fear is stronger by the Germans than their love for liberty. He likes to scold about those who endanger their personal liberty, but as soon as he observes that one of his fellow-countrymen might obtain a political position through his efforts against prohibition, he soon becomes quiet. He justifies such an attitude in his own mind by accusing the successful candidate of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>incompetency and shortcomings, which he must first invent. He is inclined to suspect others of secret plans if they join a church, a lodge or a club. With such a suspicious attitude no party which is to defend liberty, can achieve success.</p>
   <p>However, such a party would be necessary as bulwark against those trying to kill liberty, because the wise ones build their dams and dykes before the flood. Personal liberty was never in greater danger than it is now....What would be more important than the establishment of a party which has only one aim, namely the protection of personal liberty, and which would be against every other party which would not fully defend the natural rights of man, irrespective of economic questions.</p>
   <p>Personal liberty is based on natural human rights. It is a human right which each person possesses, to make his life as enjoyable as he can, according to his social standing and educational status quo, as long as he does not <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>thereby injure himself or anyone else. Self-determination is the highest privilege of every man, and to tolerate attempts at its limitation is a sign of degeneration.</p>
   <p>It is indeed a sad fact that for many, the battle for personal liberty is nothing else but a fight for licentiousness, although every sane person should know that the sister of self-determination is self-control. Self-control is the mother of all virtues and all morals and liberty reaches through her the greatest triumphs. Prohibitionists have imprisoned personal liberty in a keg of beer in order to label immoderation as one of their results, and thereby to frighten many away from the fight for personal liberty. But every thinking person will admit that no reasonable being will defend licentiousness. The friends of liberty consider the prohibition movement as a side line of the real purpose of the prohibition fanatics, who are really trying to prevent others from enjoying life, because of their mental and moral deficiency, seeing all others in their own image.</p>
