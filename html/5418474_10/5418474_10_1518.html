   <p>This afternoon the annual conference of the Pastors and Teachers of the North Illinois District of the German Evangelical Synode came to a close at the St. Peter's Church. Pastor Carl Krafft of the Salem's Parish was elected president.</p>
   <p>The meeting resolved to found a new district. This shall include the center part of the State and it is expected that by this act many of the still independent parishes will be united.</p>
   <p>Several of the parishes will complain before the Federal Senators about the custom of nominating as members of the Indian Commission or any other Federal office representatives of any one church congregation.</p>
