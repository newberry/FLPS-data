   <p>A second public meeting was held yesterday. It was called by the Athletic Club,"Vorwarts", to protest the Blair Bill. The meeting took place in the club-hall on 12th Street and was well attended.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Jacobs called the house to order and explained that the purpose of the meeting was to protest the assumptions of Blair, namely, to submit to Congress a Bill, requiring the institution of Sunday as the Ecclesiastic Sabbath in this country, and also to add instructions in the Christian religion to the curriculum in public schools.</p>
   <p>The first speaker, J. L. Christensen, Editor of the German Labor Zeitung, attacked religion in general, and Christianity in particular.</p>
   <p>Mr. E. A. Stevens of the "Secular Union" was the next speaker. He expressed himself in favor of preserving the old constitution of the United States, just as the immortal Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, had given it. He is supposed to have said: "Millions of innocent men, women and children have been burned, punished, put in prison for the sake of their faith, and yet we have not come one inch closer to a oneness in religion. What was the result of every compulsory religion? One half of the people were made fools; the other half became hypocrites. After the speaker had elaborated upon that statement, the well-known leader of the Anarchists, P. Grottkau, proclaimed his atheistical confession of faith, but he refrained from rage and his furious attacks. At the close of the meeting several resolutions were read and accepted.</p>
   <p>Those present signed a petition to Congress, asking the legislative body to maintain the complete separation of church and state as it now exists, and, as demanded by the Constitution, forever shall remain. It also requested to ignore Bills, demanding the observation of Sunday as the Sabbath or the "Day of the Lord" and likewise to oppose amendments to the Constitution which would tend to favor one religion above others. This petition was headed: "The American Constitution must remain intact."</p>
