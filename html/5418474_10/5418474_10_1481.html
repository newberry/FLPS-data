   <p>The German Catholic Trinity Church at Leavitt and Taylor Streets celebrated yesterday their silver jubilee. This Church festival was very well attended. The Archbishop Quiggley, with the assistance of the President of the Loyola Seminary, and the Rev. Fox celebrated the pontifical-mass. The Archbishop also delivered the official sermon. The Rev. D. Thiele, the founder of this congregation, could not be present to the jubilee because he had just accepted the pastorage of the St. Mathias Church.</p>
   <p>Rev. Eisenbacher is the present leading pastor of the Trinity Church.</p>
