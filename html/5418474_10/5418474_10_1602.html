The Bishop made a short address, and after singing a hymn the ministers made way for the laymen, who had been in session in the Sunday school room below. The laity filed down the front aisle, and the Chairman, Mr. G. A. Seefeld, addressed the Bishop, telling of the work that had been done in their meeing. Bishop Newman made an interesting address on Methodism, closing by saying that Methodism was marching on to make a conquest of the earth, and hoping that the laymen would do all in their power to make pleasant the duties of the ministers who have been assigned to the various churches for the next year.</p>
   <p>The laymen formed about the altar, and while all sang "Nearer My God to Thee," the ministers passed by in line, shaking hands and saying a few words to each.</p>
