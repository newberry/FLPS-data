   <p>The Lutheran Bethania Parish consecrated yesterday their new church that was erected on Humboldt Avenue and Rockwell Street. The Church is built of bricks, 75 feet long, 50 feet wide and has a 120 foot high steeple. The interior is furnished very tastefully, also it is in general kept plain. The steeple contains two large, beautiful bells, a product of the foundry of Stuckstede in St. Louis. The foundation stone was laid on April 16th. The entire building costs $20,000 and has seats for 800 people.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately the organ did not get finished in time. Yesterday's celebration was visited by numerous members of the sister churches.</p>
