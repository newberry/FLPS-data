   <p>An entertainment has been arranged by the Workers Educational Society of the North Side, Sunday afternoon and evening, in Otto Bergner's place, 58 Clybourn Avenue. The proceeds are destined for Christmas gifts for the pupils of the Sunday school.</p>
   <p>The school is expected to progress again under the direction of its new teacher who will be installed next Sunday. In order to fight the parsons it is necessary for a while to imitate their tactics. Afterwards,when humanity has reached the age of reason, the so-called Christmas celebration can be discarded as well as other inanities.</p>
   <p>No worker's family of the North Side should be absent on the coming Sunday. Admission is free. A program and dance orchestra will be provided, beginning at 4 o'clock.</p>
