   <p>The song-club of the above parish, gave its great-sacred concert yesterday at their church, 177-179 Hastings Street. So many eager listeners arrived that the quaint little church was almost overcrowded. Pastor Heinemann acted as host and gave the reasons which prompted the song club to offer this concert. Its object is to arouse the desire for singing among a greater number of people and also to create more interest for the parish.</p>
   <p>The soloist, Mrs. Emma Rolph, and a host of others gave excellent renditions. The choir, under the direction of their instructor Gersch, gave several choral numbers. Declamations, solos, and piano selections alternated throughout, and met with appreciative recognition. This church has functioned since 1865, two years under the leadership of the present pastor.</p>
