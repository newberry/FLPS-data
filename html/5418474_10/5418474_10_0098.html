   <p>The union, just recently organized by businessmen of North Avenue, held its second meeting last night, at which the president of the union Mr. Wm. Friedmann presided. The aim of the union is to further the improvement of the transportation and lighting system of North Avenue and the abutting streets. Inasmuch as all property owners of North Avenue are vitally interested in this undertaking, it has been decided to name this union The North Avenue Improvement Association.

With the appointment of more officials for this new organization, the list of the members of the Executive Board is complete; William Friedmann, president; C. Thiessen, secretary; J. Yondorf, treasurer; Wm. Rauen, vice-president; and Messrs. A. Yondorf, H. F. Mueller, Val. Stauber, E. H. Cuny and H. Branch as directors.</p>
