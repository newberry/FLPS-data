   <p>The German Christmas Celebration at the Lake View High School yesterday evening was very inspiring. The performance of the Comedy, "Der Traum des Kuensters" (the artists' dream) was carefully prepared and spoke well for the directors as well as for the players.</p>
   <p>The celebration opened with a recital of a German Christmas carol by the Lake View Glee Club. Gymnastical performances under the able instructor Emil Groener, were very pleasing. Also a song recital by Camilla Bunte was much applauded by the large audience, which filled the hall and the corridors.</p>
