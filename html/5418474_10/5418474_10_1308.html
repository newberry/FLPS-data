   <p>The German-American citizens' Union imparts the following: "The German-American Citizens' Union, Chicago alliance, sent out invitations to the Germans of Illinois, to send delegates to the state convention, at which the establishment of a state union should be effected. Other points on the agenda are, the election of delegates to the National conference and the selection of a place for the next state convention, to carry out the decision of the National Conference. Judging by the great number of communications which the citizens'Union received in regard to the question of founding a German-American organization the Germans of the state are displaying a great interest in the matter, which will find its expression in a correspondingly strong attendance of the State Convention. The convention is to be held on October 18th, at 10 A.M. in the Northside Turner Hall, 820 N. Clark St.</p>
