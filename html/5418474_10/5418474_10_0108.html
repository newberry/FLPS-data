   <p>The fight of the German Pythias Lodges against the Supreme Lodge of Pythias is being carried out now on a larger scale. In order to keep up the fight to a victorious end, the German Lodges have organized an Executive Committee, which mailed yesterday to all German Pythias Lodges of Illinois the following circular letter:-</p>
   <p>Brothers!</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee is instructing herewith all German Pythias Lodges to conduct their meeting ritual affairs etc. in the German language, regardless of guest visitors from the Supreme Lodge at the said occasion.</p>
   <p>This case has been given to the courts, upon which we rely for a just decision. Until then, there will be no further interference from the Supreme Lodge Council. With Faternal Greetings! The Executive Committee! G. Lauterer, A. Grunwald, F. W. Buschick, L. Wodeck, F. J. Stubbe.</p>
