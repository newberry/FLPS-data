   <p>The news that this year's celebration of German Day wound up with a surplus of several hundred dollars, and the resolution to make the final account next month at the meeting of delegates and to have election of new officers at the November meeting, were the most important items covered at yesterday's meeting of delegates to the German Day committee, which was sparsely attended.</p>
   <p>According to the report on the financial outcome of the celebration, there was a surplus of $732.92 to be entered in the books, said the president of German Day, Bernhard de Vry, and, even taking into consideration some possibly outstanding debts, there will still remain a surplus of a few hundred dollars. A large part of this profit is due to the sale of advertising space for the official program.</p>

   <p>An extensive debate followed over the recommendation of the chairman to present the members of the executive committee with fountain pens in memory of the German Day celebration, and in recognition of their efforts. The motion was turned down by the delegates, and another motion was carried to give each delegate a button in memory of the German group.</p>
   <p>No less heated was the discussion over the request to repay $100 to the German-American Hostess Society, which needs money for expenses incurred for the German-American house at the World's Fair. This money was advanced by the Society to the German Day committee to cover a deficit. It was decided to wait for the final financial report from German Day, and to vote upon the motion at the next meeting of delegates.</p>
   <p>The last item in yesterday's meeting constituted the establishment of a day for the general convention, at which the election of new officers would take place.</p>

   <p>In an effort to gain sufficient time to conduct the election, the delegates finally agreed to render a final account on the German Day celebration next month at the meeting of delegates, to take place October 27, and to decide about the use of the surplus on hand. It was suggested by the board of executives not to distribute the money on hand for purposes of charity, but to retain it as a fund for next year's celebration.</p>
   <p>The meeting of delegates to be held in November is to be a general convention. All German-American organizations are to be invited to take part in the election of officers by sending voting delegates.</p>
