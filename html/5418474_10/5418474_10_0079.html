   <p>There are still real "Germans" in other countries who are proud to be such, and whose pride no foreign influence could diminish. They hold fast to their "German" language, customs and practices.</p>
   <p>Could it be possible that a nation of highest achievements, in every line of human endeavor and knowledge would send thousands of their sons and daughters into the world, and then these children being ashamed and let their heads hang? Certainly not! The Germans possess, besides other personal characteristics a very good parental training and excellent skill and knowledge in their lives.</p>
