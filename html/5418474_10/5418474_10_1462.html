   <p>Wicker Park Hall was much too small to accommodate the many people who sought admission to the entertainment given by the Concordia League last evening. Even before starting since only those were admitted who had previously purchased tickets, and many of them found only standing room. Hundreds were turned away at the door. However, it was announced that the entertainment would be repeated on the coming Wednesday in order to give all who could not gain admission last evening opportunity to enjoy the annual "big night" of the League.</p>
   <p>The Reverend W. F. Pieper welcomed the guests. He remarked that the object of these entertainments is to acquaint the public with the social work which the League does among the young Lutherans; that the League tries to offer young people good, interesting entertainment, and to render mutual aid to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>members who are in need and, at the same time, to lend support to the Lutheran Church. He cited the fact that the League has a membership of 3,500 and branches in every state of the Union, even in far-off Louisiana and Wyoming, as incontrovertible evidence of the organization's indomitable spirit.</p>
   <p>Later Mayor Thompson also spoke for a few minutes, merely, as he said, to greet the large assembly and so wish everybody good luck. The Mayor was introduced by Henry Utpadel, a court reporter. When the Mayor entered the hall he was greeted with loud and long applause. He spoke briefly, in a simple, easy manner, and did not refer to any political matter. He stated that he comes from a family which is counted among Chicago's old settlers, and that the first public playground for children was established as a result of his efforts. He assured the assembly that he wholeheartedly approves of the League's efforts, especially its efforts in behalf of youth.</p>
   <p>The entertainment consisted of songs, readings, and instrumental music. The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Strassen Trio of Milwaukee, consisting of three sisters who play violin, cello, and piano, respectively, delighted the audience by rendering several selections in wonted artistic manner. Mr. A. Wendelin, violinist, and Mr. Walter Wendt, pianist, also contributed instrumental numbers. Humorous vocal selections were given by a quintette, consisting of Messrs. Edward Krause and M. G. Severinghaus, and Miss Gladys Severinghaus, Miss Minerva Severinghaus, and Mrs. M. G. Severinghaus. Bob Allan and Lucy Clabaugh gave readings which were well received. Members of the Jehovah Maennerchor (Male Chorus), directed by Walter Wendt, sang an English-German medley which caused much laughter. Miss Viola Stell, Mr. Louis Jannusch, and Mr. Ernst Blume contributed well-rendered readings.</p>
