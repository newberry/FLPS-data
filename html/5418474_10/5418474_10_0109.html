   <p>The Supreme Lodge of the Knights of Pythias adopted yesterday a resolution, which allows the use of the English language along for all ritual occasions of the order. This new regulation ousts automatically all German lodges of the same order.</p>
   <p>We regret deeply, that the "German question" has been stirred up by the Knights of Pythias, whom we thought to be a set of broadminded American fellow-citizens. The said resolution is a severe blow and humilation to all Germans. The best way out for all German lodges, as we see it, would be to ignore the deplorable population and keep up the use of their native German language at all occasions, until the Supreme Lodge pronounces a formal ouster of all German lodges or a cancellation of the same regulation. The latter is doubtful, as apparently the Supreme Lodge has sought the German issue for quite a while towards a final decision in favor of the English language.</p>
