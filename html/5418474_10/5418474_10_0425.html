   <p>The association of the Friends of New Germany held a "German national evening, " Saturday, at the Lake Shore Athletic Club; the event was attended by many visitors. Its tasteful musical and artistic program did full justice to the purpose of the evening.</p>
   <p>The orchestra of the association, under the leadership of conductor Ernst Hennecke, handled the musical part of the program splendidly, proving that it was quite capable of meeting the requirements of the occasion. Conductor Hennecke has, in his orchestra, a thoroughly disciplined body of musicians..... Owing to the small size of the orchestra, only such works were selected as are suitable to small orchestral units--works bordering on chamber music. The orchestral part of the program consisted of the most beautiful pearls of German musical literature--works by Lortzing, Beethoven, Wagner, Mozart, Liszt, Schubert, and Von Weber as well as jolly marches to accompany the entrance <span class="page-break">2</span>of the flags and association guards.</p>
   <p>The soprano soloist, Frau Ellen Wilson Meibes, who comes from the school of the Duesseldorf municipal theater, sang the aria "Dich, tenre Halle" from Wagner's opera "Tannhaeuser" and, in the latter part of the evening, sang the aria "Wie nahte mir der Schlummer" from Weber's "Freischuetz". She gave the two numbers with artistic expression and fine musical feeling. The pianist Otto Munke, a musician of extraordinary ability, substituted for the piano virtuoso Erwin Goerlitz in the solo part of the "Polonaise No. 2, for Piano and Orchestra," by Liszt. Both he and the orchestra were enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>The ladies of the association performed a charming "solstice dance," patterned after old German models. This was very well received, as were the group dances of the dancing master and his school.</p>
   <p>The local group leader, Tony Miller, and the district leader of the association, F. Gissibl, pointed out, in their addresses, that the large attendance justified <span class="page-break">3</span>the idea that, in the future, more attention must be devoted to fostering German music.</p>
   <p>The concert was followed by a ball, which held the visitors together for many hours longer.</p>
