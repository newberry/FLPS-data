   <p>The administrative council in charge of the Veterans Relief Fund created on Jan. 18, 1911, will hold its annual festivity at the Northside Turn hall on Thursday, Jan. 20, to commemorate the founding of the German Empire 45 years ago. The entire net proceeds will be used to augment the relief fund which has been created for the benefit of the local destitute veterans of Germany's significant period, the years 1864, 1866, and 1870-71. Nearly all of the 160 veterans living here, excluding the injured, were in France on that memorable day, Jan. 18, 1871, when the German Empire was founded in the Royal Palace at Versailles. [Explanatory - We Americans call it the "the Palace," but the German newspaper uses the term "castle," which is probably more appropriate, as this building was formerly a fortress. Transl.]</p>

[This sentence refers to the "Land-wehrleute" or "Home-defense men," old men used for reserves during the Franco-German war of 1870-71.]</p>
