   <p>p. 5 - Memorial Day was observed yesterday in its customary fashion. Veterans visited at various local cemeteries the graves of their comrades. Later in the forenoon the veterans participated in the customary memorial day parade. One of the most impressive solemn ceremonies was held at the Oakwood cemetery, this being the resting place of most of the veterans. Those from the north are resting in their native soil, while resting in the same soil are veterans from the south, who were taken prisoners during the civil war, and away from their homeland, slowly faded away....</p>
   <p>The Association of the Veterans of the German Army made arrangements to have the graves of their comrades at the St. Bonifacius and Waldheim cemeteries decorated with flowers, and with the German and American colors.</p>
