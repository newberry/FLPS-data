   <p>In yesterday's meeting of the World-Religious Congress, the representatives of the different faiths, almost came to blows. A certain sensation was caused by the German philosopher Dr.Adolf Brodbeck of Hannover, who offended the fundamental teachings of Christianity as well as the Buddhistic and Jewish religions and spoke about "the new religion of Idealism". This religion denies heaven, hell and resurrection; it strives for the ideals of humanity, for the perfection of man in all branches of human activity. Noteworthy is the tolerance, with which the assembly listened to these teachings, denying the basis of all belief. Besides Mr.Brodbeck, Professor M. Valentine spoke upon "Proofs of the existence of God"; Rabbi Dr. Isaac Weise on "Judaism"; Rev. Virchand Gandhi of Bombay read an essay of Manilal N. Dvivedi about the religion of the Hindus. At the evening meeting spoke, among others, Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul about "Catholicism and modern life".</p>
   <p>The Congress of the Lutherans was yesterday continued under the presidency of Dr. L. M. Heilmann.</p>
