   <p>A Democratic paper in Philadelphia has produced the idea, and other Democratic papers have eagerly taken it up, that the next amendment to the Federal Constitution should consist in the elimination of the paragraph that excludes foreign-born citizens from the presidency. With an easily recognizable interest in the German vote, these papers declare it an unbearable shame, that the mulatto, Frederick Douglas, could be elected president, or vice-president, but not Carl Schurz. And they make it clear, that if it was not for that clause in the Constitution, Carl Schurz would already, next year, be welcome to the Democrats as a presidential candidate.</p>
   <p>It hardly needs to be said, that the papers that Make Mr. Schurz these declarations of love, are so free with their praises only because he is not eligible to the presidency. Nobody needs imagine that the great mass of Americans, Democrats or Republicans, would want a naturalized citizen as president just because he was permitted to be a candidate. Even after the prohibition of the election of a "foreigner" had disappeared from the Constitution, plenty of water would run into the sea before American nativistic pride would come around to electing a German. That is not at all to be wondered at. If  Germany were a republic, it would be there just the same - even though the Germans of all peoples on earth are those which have least prejudice, frequently a pathological and repulsive predilection for foreigners.</p>
   <p>In its aim to catch votes, the Democratic press is sure to fail, at least on the German side. And that for the simple reason, there is no desire in this direction among the Germans. On the contrary - the German press of both parties has characterized it as great good fortune that this clause of the Constitution opens a chance to develop statesmen who do not speculate for the presidency. Among hundreds of American statesmen are exactly hundreds of aspirants for the presidency.</p>
   <p>This, the Louisviller Anzeiger also points out, and then continues: A German president of the United States - that would be beautiful, very beautiful! But the amendment would not be made for the German naturalized citizens alone. It would make the presidency accessible also to all the other foreign-born, for example - the Irish. And after the amendment had been adopted, it could happen that an Irishman would become president sooner than a German. Once an Irishman in the presidency, and the natives, who after all are still in an overwhelming majority, will lose for very, very long, all desire to make a foreign-born, president.</p>
   <p>For the time being we will therefore make no use of the flattering offer of a German president. Do they really want to see a Carl Schurz brought into the position where he could be most useful to his adopted fatherland.....why not boost him for secretary of state?</p>
   <p>And this (concludes the Staats Zeitung) would probably completely satisfy his ambition.</p>
