   <p>The Verein Deutscher Waffengendssen (Association of German veterans) held its first festival at Oswald's Garden, 5210 S. Halsted Street, yesterday. It was a huge popular celebration which included the dedication of two new club-flags. With military punctuality the parade started at 11 A. M., and as many other clubs participated, it grew into an imposing spectacle. The veterans started at the corner of State and 40th Streets, under the leadership of Comrade H. Grebasch, who had been decorated with the Iron Cross, and Adjutant K. Krueger. With waving flags and a band the warriors marched on State Street to 42nd Street, thence to Wentworth Avenue, 47th Street, Princeton Avenue, Garfield Blvd., Wright, 57th to Halsted Street and thence to the festive decorated park.</p>

   <p>The Guard-Infantry band, which was at the head of the procession, made a splendid impression with its neat, gala uniforms and inspiring melodies. They came from the German village (World's Fair) and were led by their bandmaster, Mr. Ruscheweyh, imperial director of music. Buffalo Bill kept his promise and sent 51 horsemen, Germans, Americans and English, 17 of each nationality. There splendid deportment and spirited horses evoked boisterous enthusiasm...they just about stole the show, if one may use the popular expression. Many clubs, a largenumber of them with their own bands, joined the parade to show their appreciation and give support to the new, ambitious club which has, in a short time, obtained such a large membership - 200 members since February 7, 1892. Altogether, 37 flags were displayed. The guests of honor and the ladies rode in coaches. As soon as the former soldiers reached Oswald's Garden, new life was instilled into the party. The various bands played alternately - the <span class="page-break">\3</span>German Military band from the German village (World's Fair) gave excellent selections, which served to arouse the interest of the crowd and everyone was in a festive mood. In connection with the aforesaid, we must mention, that Mr. Henning, a member of the above mentioned orchestra composed and dedicated a march in honor of the club and today it was played for the first time in public. His work was very favorably received and the publishing rights have been assigned by the composer to the new club. After Mrs. Julius Valentin presented the flags, Mr. R. A. von Manstein, the club's president, gave the regular dedicatory address. He justified the founding of German clubs in the United States, and emphasized, that regardlessof the German's faithful allegiance to the newly adopted fatherland and its institutions and the affection and esteem he feels for them, he will always nevertheless endeavor to promote German influence in this land....The <span class="page-break">\4</span>World's Fair commissioner, representative of the German government, privy-councilor, Weamuth, was absent; Consul-General Spiess took his place and expressed great satisfaction that the Germans should have created a nucleus which will help to combine all elements, will further German sentiments and customs and create a greater spiritual union. The club-flag was a master-work of embroidery, probably unequalled in this country. On one side, on a white silk background, are two impressive figures, Columbia and Germania, surrounded by the German and American coats of arms, oak and laurel wreaths. These two national symbols clasp hands as a token of unity. The name of the club and its founding date, (Feb. 7, 1892), are also embroidered prominently. On the other side of the banner appear the German colors, the emblem of the club held in the talons of the American eagle and the words: "All for one, one for all." The Star Spangled Banner, made of heavy silk, <span class="page-break">\5</span>was also displayed. In order to provide an opportunity to see these magnificent flags they will be exhibited by the manufacturer, the A. G. Armstrong Company, at 149 Wabash Avenue, until next Wednesday.</p>
   <p>The festival drew a large crowd; by 6 P. M., 2,500 tickets had been sold. The young people danced while the older generation retold stories of the past; a merry crowd sang martial songs and imbibed the indispensible Teutonic brew. Credit for the huge success belongs to W. Bothe, president of the club and the committee members, who provided such an enjoyable, genuinely German entertainment.</p>
