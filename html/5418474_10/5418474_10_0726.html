   <p>The Chicago Song Society made its first public appearance in an appropriate and splendidly executed program at the Auditorium Theatre yesterday afternoon. It was an excellent beginning, and if the society continues to follow in that path, there is no doubt that it will justify the expectation of a year and a half ago, when it was founded. We venture to go as far as to say that it appears to be destined to play a prominent part in the musical life of Chicago. As a society of humanitarian aims also, the profit derived from concerts will benefit German benevolent societies or institutions showing similar activities.</p>
   <p>Great choral works are being prepared for presentation in the near future. The chorus is composed of well trained voices under the direction of the well-known master, Mr. William Boeppler. Nevertheless, certain short-comings were also noticed; namely, the predominance of feminine voices. Therefore, to bring about the necessary uniformity, the male choir needs to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be definitely intensified.</p>
   <p>The opening number of yesterday's program was Bach's "Toccata," followed by "The Fuge," both organ solos, played by Mr. Middelschulte, who was enthusiastically received when he appeared on the stage. The next number was the great Doxology "Praise the Lord" by Bartniansky, and "You Shepherd of Israel," by the same composer. The octet then sang Mendelssohn's "Forty-Third Psalm." The execution of each of those numbers was perfect in every phase, except for the inadequately composed choir.</p>
   <p>The pianissimo in Brahm's "Sandman," was masterly interpreted under the baton of Mr. Boeppler. The appreciative audience insisted on a repetition of that number. The "Nightingale" by Mendelssohn, "Haidenroeslein" (Wild Rose), and "The Prayer of Thanks" were among the other offerings of the evening.</p>

   <p>Inasmuch, as this is comparatively a new singing society, and the public is expected to be somewhat apprehensive as usual, the society deemed it appropriate to acquire the services of a famous artist as the medium of introduction for the group. The choice fell upon Leo Slezak, leading tenor of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, and a former member of the Imperial Opera Company in Austria. Slezak's voice is that of a dramatic tenor, pure and voluminous. However, his slight indisposition was noticed in the pianissimo passages, when the clarity became somewhat clouded. His selections were: "It is a Fascinating Likeness" from "The Magic Flute," followed by Loewe's ballad "Tom, the Poet," Schubert's "Lotus Flower," and "The Serenade" by Richard Strauss. The beauty of his voice electrified the audience-despite the slight indisposition-which reached its climax in the execution of "Assad's Tale," from "The Queen of Sheba." Mr. Slezak, obliged by singing many encores.</p>
   <p>Last night's net proceeds, of approximately $3,500, will benefit the German Old People's Home.</p>
