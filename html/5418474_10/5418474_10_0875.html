   <p>Last Sunday an extremely interesting meeting was held in the Lincoln Turner Hall by the Vorort (local Turner Clubs) of the Chicago Turner Districts.</p>
   <p>The debates indicated clearly that only a fraction of these people, who call themselves Turners, understand the aims of Turners.</p>
   <p>Unlike real Turners, they disregard all the aims, to the execution of which they had pledged themselves, because they fear to incur the disfavor of the reactionary elements of our population and to expose to losses in their private business.</p>
   <p>There are two kinds of Turners: the real ones and the sham Turners.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The first mentioned are also called the "reds" while the latter are named the "blues."</p>
   <p>The main characteristic of the "reds" is honesty, while with the "blues" it is "diplomatic honesty."</p>
   <p>The blue's honesty is elastic; he has the ability to come to terms with his Turner conscience and enjoys therefore an advantage.</p>
   <p>A letter from the Turn Verein Freiheit requests all the Turners to support the eight hour day.</p>
   <p>Ballots are considered opposed to Turner principles.</p>

   <p>The Turn Verein Freiheit demanded several weeks ago, that the Vorort should protest against the interference with free speech and the holding of meetings; a vote count showed a majority of 326 against 260 in favor of the motion.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy debate, thanks were expressed to Judge Tuley for his judgment.</p>
