   <p>Judge Dunne, Ex-Governor Altgeld, Abraham Fischer and others protest against the usurpation by England.</p>
   <p>The Representatives of the South-African Republics were given an opportunity last evening, to present their case at the Auditorium, where they met a large and responsive audience. The assembled were heart and soul for their cause and eminent American speakers spoke of the injustice they had to endure because of England's perfidious, hypocritical-and greedy political ambitions. About 5000 people were present, a large number of them ladies and when the emissaries of the Boer-Republics appeared, they were greeted with a tumultous welcome;handerchiefs were waved and shouts of acclaim reverberated through the immense hall, while the public rose in unison. The addresses by the various speakers were exceptionally gruff, but to the point. Rev. Jenkins Lloyd Jones created a profound impression with his remark, that he is an Englishman by birth <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but he is fully justified in being ashamed of the flag of his native country.</p>
   <p>After the prelude, played by Prof. Beseler on the organ, Judge E. F. Dunn, chairman, spoke to the assembly: "We are standing today in the shadow of a great political crime, the greatest infamy of the 19th century. Transvaal, in an agreement with an by England was conceded to be a free and independent country in 1884."</p>
   <p>We know the real reason for this war, is the discovery of gold near Johannesburg, in other words, English greed. We hope that you emerge as victors and that your mission will be successful. American sympathy is on your side. The Amphion Singing Society gave the next number on the program. Then the chairman announced, that Mr. Webster Davis, who knows South African conditions from personal observation will not be present because of sickness.</p>
   <p>Ex-Governor John P. Altgeld, functioned as the next speaker. He was received <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with great enthusiasm and his speech was often interrupted with applause.</p>
   <p>"A small, modest nation gives an example of heroism, as seldom has been witnessed. Whatever the outcome, the Boers have engraved their name with and iron instrument into the records of the world's history. Need we ask, which side is in the right? Even in England only one class defends this war, the money and birth-aristocracy, but its people condemn it. England uses the iron tactics to which it always adhered...</p>
   <p>Thrice, in various years, the Boers receded further into the African, unfriendly wilderness to escape from English oppression and England gave written guarantees each time, promising to desist from further interference but the lion always waited until the new fields were cultivated and then struck deep into the flesh of the Boers. England rejects the Boers. proposal of arbitration before an International Tribunal, Chamberlain knows the weakness, so they made demands for preposterous concessions, to provoke a war. Only the relinquishing of the Transvaal's independence would satisfy England, thus the Boers are compelled to reach for the sword, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to protect their home, hearth and country...Let us hope that our sympathy will help to encourage them. If the war is sufficiently prolonged, then their just cause may obtain success finally.</p>
   <p>(The American War of Philippine subjugation in a parable is compared to English methods, and is the principal reason, why, the administration does not show much concern, according to a native Boer orator. Resolutions are sent to the President of the United States, the President of the South African Republic and the Marquis of Salisbury, which were submitted by Wil. Vocke.)</p>
   <p>Mr. Fritz Sonntag (German) received a letter from the Transvaal Government, expressing thanks and appreciation for his poem: "The Sentinels of Spion Kop."</p>
