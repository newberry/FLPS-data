   <p>With the general convention held last night at the Hotel Atlantic, at which the administration board for the next year was elected, the official activities of the German Day Organization for the year 1934 were brought to a close. There are still a number of small details to be attended to, among them the collecting of sums for admission tickets from a few organizations which have failed to send them in.</p>
   <p>That the delegates, who are by right the representatives of the great majority of all Germans living in Chicago, were quite satisfied with last year's administration, was proven by the election of officers, which was the main business of yesterday's session. Last year's members of the board of administrators were, in so far as they did not absolutely decline the honor, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>re-elected without exception (and in most cases unanimously) by the delegates, representing all who speak and think German, regardless of where their cradle stood.</p>
   <p>They proceeded to the election of officers right after passing a unanimous and enthusiastic resolution to hold a German Day next year.</p>
   <p>Herr Gustave A. Brand, to whose tireless efforts and selfless devotion we primarily owe the success of last year's German Day, was again entrusted with the leadership of the German-Day Organization, and was unanimously elected president. The first vice-president, Fred Brumund, and the secretary-treasurer, Joe Gies, absolutely declined to be re-elected. The board of administrators for the coming year is now composed of the following:</p>
   <p>President, Gustave A. Brand; first vice-president, Frank K. Waldherr; second vice-president, Frau Elisabeth Vavrinek; third vice-president, Joe Beron; fourth vice-president, George Iberle; corresponding secretary, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Afolf Glauche; recording secretary, Fred Lindner; treasurer, Hermann Loesicke; secretary-treasurer, T. J. P. Schlichting; supervisor, Erich Karl Huebener; finance committee: Joe Gies, Theodor Pilgram, and Justus Emme. Unanimous votes were cast for the first vice-president, recording secretary, treasurer, and supervisor, whereas, in the other cases, an absolute majority of votes were decisive.</p>
   <p>The election was presided over by the last ex-president of the German-Day Organization, Bernard de Vry. Three other ex-presidents--Adolf Gill, Dr. Jack Kobalter and Captain George Weideling--assisted him as judges of election.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's meeting was called to order by President Brand at exactly 8:30 P. M. The President welcomed the delegates and expressed his regret that not every meeting of delegates was as well attended during the last few years as was that of yesterday. There were 131 delegates and board members present.</p>
   <p>A gift of $25 was donated to the old war veterans. Recording secretary <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Lindener and treasurer Loesicke read their annual reports. The latter showed that, after paying all current expenses and making all authorized purchases, there will still be a balance of $1570.50 left over for purposes of charity, and for the beginning of preparations for the next German Day. The other officers, with the exception of the president, who had made his detailed report at the last meeting of delegates, made their reports orally. There followed the customary expressions of gratitude, etc.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to leave the representation of the member organizations as at present, namely, for top organizations two delegates, and for smaller organizations one delegate for each 105 members or fraction thereof. The last Friday of each month was again named as regular meeting day for delegates. It was, however, unanimously decided to omit the December session (as was done last year) on account of the holidays.</p>
   <p>Those assembled honored the memory of the late chief of the fire department, Arthus F. Seyferlich, by rising from their seats and presenting a wreath <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of flowers, in addition to sending condolences to the family.</p>
   <p>President Brand again drew attention to the great Saar demonstration to be held next Saturday, in which it is the duty of all Germans to participate. The delegates were further cordially invited to come to the Caritas celebration to be held at the Schubert House, next Tuesday, by the Austrians and Hungarians, also to the reception for the German lady flier, Elli Beinhorn, next Wednesday, at the Lincoln Turner Hall.</p>
   <p>The meeting, which was harmonious throughout, came to a close shortly before midnight.</p>
