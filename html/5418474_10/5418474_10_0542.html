   <p>"We are a small group amidst the ocean of superstition. Although we possess a one thousand year old civilization, it will take thousands of years till humanity acquires true knowledge and till the wheel of progress will bring mankind to its goal." The well known lawyer Leopold Saltiel spoke these words yesterday, on the occasion of the 25 year Jubilee, of the Southwest Side Liberal Community, which was held in the Vorwarts Turner Hall.</p>
   <p>He related the great struggles which this organization had to weather since founding. He then added: "We want to be free not only in thoughts, but we also strive to free ourselves of bad habits, of hatred, envy, greediness and lies. We set ourselves a high, almost unattainable aim, and we must fight without fear if we expect success."</p>
   <p>Loud applause rewarded the speaker. At the festival, which well arranged in every respect, a number of singing societies appeared, amongst them the singing section of the Milwaukee Free Community, the singing section of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Liberal Community, the Concordia Men's Chorus, the singing society "Freiheit," the glee club "Unity," the Westside Singing Club, and others.</p>
   <p>Great pains were taken to make the festival pleasant for all the visitors. It was a great success.</p>
