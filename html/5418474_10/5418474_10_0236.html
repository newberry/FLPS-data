   <p>At a special general meeting called by the Chicago Turner Club last night notwithstanding the great heat, about one hundred persons were present. Speaker Hoechster explained in short words the object of the meeting and the well-known lawyer and former Congressman, Goldzier, submitted the following resolution: The recent failure of a Chicago Banking Institution by which 22,000 depositors mostly belonging to the working classes have lost most of their savings, calls public attention to the ways and means to prevent such catastrophes for the future and to give to the people positive surety for their savings. In many other countries the question has been solved by the opening of Postal Savings Depositaries. The absolute security under this system not only increases the thrift of the population; but also makes better citizens, taking a greater interest in the affairs of the Government. To protect the savings of the people is an important function which in our opinion should be executed by the Federal Government. We think that the <span class="page-break">2</span>Federal Government of the United States of America should take the necessary steps for the establishment of Postal Savings Depositaries without consideration of those, who have made up till now honest or dishonest profits.</p>
   <p>For this reason, it is resolved, that we promote the opening of Postal Savings Depositaries and employ all means to move Congress to take the necessary steps. Resolved also, that we instruct the Turner Club to take necessary preparatory measures by their executive committee with the assistance of all other associations.</p>
   <p>Resolved also to appoint a committee to collect all literature on the subject, to send a petition to Congress and collect signatures by all associations, that all political parties should be asked to take the matter up in their platform. That each candidate for Congress should be asked about his attitude to the above question. The resolution was adopted after a short debate in which only Mr. Konstantin Goldzier a brother of the speaker opposed on the ground that the Turner Club should not interfer in political <span class="page-break">3</span>matters. As members of the Committee, Mr. Emil Hoechster, Julius Goldzier, Max Stern, G. A. Schmidt and Louis Schaffer have been nominated.</p>
