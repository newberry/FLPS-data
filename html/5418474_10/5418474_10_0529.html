   <p>The German comrades celebrated their forty-fourth anniversary combined with Hindenburg's eighty-second birthday. The guests appeared somewhat late but in large numbers nevertheless, and the festival proceeded splendidly.</p>
   <p>Jung's orchestra played a march, followed by an overture, whereupon Comrade Schlosser, president of the Association, greeted the assembly and introduced the speaker of the evening, Comrade Argut, president of the Central Alliance of the German Military Clubs.</p>
   <p>Mr. Argut gave a short, chronological account of the German Veterans' movement.</p>
   <p>A large picture of Hindenburg, draped with the former and present German flag, was mounted over the orchestra's podium. While the orchestra played the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>"Hindenburg March," two soldiers of the old and new army, one dressed in blue, the other in a grey uniform, stood on each side of the picture, presenting arms in honor of the General Field Marshal.</p>
   <p>A selection of songs by Mrs. Brune were met with great acclaim.</p>
   <p>The orchestra played German marches and folk songs with great zest, finally providing good dance music to the satisfaction of all.</p>
