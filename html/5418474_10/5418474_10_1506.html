   <p>With pride the parish can look back at its achievements within the last quarter of a century because, no other in the entire country could show in so short a time such a great development, an expansion that has brought the parish to the first place among all German parishes of the city.</p>
   <p>History of the Parish</p>
   <p>The St. Alphonsus Parish owes its foundation to Father Josef Essing, who was the Rector of the St. Michael's Parish and who in 1882 caused the purchase of five acres of land. In the fall of the same year the first church, a building of 120 x 50 feet, and the first school, 60 x 50 feet with eight rooms, were completed. The building costs for both amounted to $12,000. The consecration was done by Archbishop Feehan. Father M. Leinengruber was the first Rector. Sixty pupils were instructed in the school under the guidence of the Sisters of Notre Dame.</p>
   
   <p>The young parish flourished so rapidly that, four years later in 1886 church and school proved too small to satisfy all demands; new buildings became an absolute necessity. In 1889, the erection of a larger church could be started. The basement was used for services until in 1897, when the entire beautiful building was completed, which since then is an object of interest and an ornament for the North Side. The interior measures 86 X 206 feet and has 1300 seats and 7 exits. The stately steeple reaches 260 feet into the sky. The new school was dedicated in 1902; it is four stories high, 189 X 90 feet base; has 24 rooms and cost $115,000. The parish has a membership of 1500 families and the school attendance is 2000 children. The Rector is Father Georg Thomas.</p>
