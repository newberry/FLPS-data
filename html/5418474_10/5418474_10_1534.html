Zimmermann of the Evengelical Lutheran Synode of North America, following the induction of Pastor Schaube of Mohana, Illinois, gave a warning against Oscar Keltsch, the present minister of the St. Nicolai Church, as a borrower and as not regularly ordained minister, Mr. Keltsch lost his position.</p>
