   <p>Again this week-end numerous German clubs and societies held lovely festivals and entertainments which were attended by gay crowds, and everywhere a splendid time was had by everyone.</p>
   <p>The German Veterans Comradeship held its first masquerade of the year at the Lincoln Turner Hall. The committee had prepared wisely to accommodate a large crowd, so the ball was a success in every respect. Similar very successful festivities were held by the Gross Park Ladies' Society at the Social Turners' Hall, by the Tourist Club at the Belden Hall,the Friends of Nature at the North Side Turner Hall, the German Football Club at Prudential Hall, the Chicago Sport Club at the De Paul Auditorium, and many more. All festivities were distinguished by genuine German cheerfulness and brought to all those who were present, a few really enjoyable and pleasant hours.</p>
