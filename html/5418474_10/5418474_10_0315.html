   <p>Letter of the Staats Zeitung ad: Turnhalle-meeting demands measures against the lying and slandering Times. The Staats Zeitung, using rarely printed expletives, refers to an unnamed German "Sanblatt"(Pig papers) that is said to have insulted in the most infamous way a German speaker,"who was pulled in by the hair."</p>
   <p>The Staats Zeitung is indignant against those who pulled him into the meeting by the hair but now, when he is attacked, defends him with a luke-warm protest that is in fact a new insult.</p>
