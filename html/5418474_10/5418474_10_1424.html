   <p>Today the Bethany parish inaugurates its school. Services begin at 11 o'clock. Professor C. M. G. Eifrig of River Forest Teacher's Seminary will deliver the German sermon and Professor Paul Bretscher the English one. Choirs will sing. Coreligionists from near and far are invited to attend the services. The building is at the corner of Narragansett and Wabansia Avenues. On the occasion of inaugurating the House of God, the services of last Sunday were well attended. The building is a handsome, solid structure, taller than the other buildings in the neighborhood. The cellar contains the steam boiler, kitchen, and a few other rooms. On the first floor there are two school-rooms provided with electrical ventilation. The second floor has a spacious hall, furnished like a church. It will at times be used for gatherings of a devotional nature. There is also one other room, which will serve as vestry.</p>
