   <p>The German Knights of Pythias in their fight for the German language have won their first victory and there is every chance that they will gain a complete permanent one. The injunction forbids the Grand lodge to interfere with the Waldeck lodge on account of the use of the German language, or to take any punishing actions against them on that account. In the German lodges of Illinois for the present, the German language can still maintain its right. Not satisfied with this success, Attorney Bock, the lawyer of the Waldeck lodge, will take a second action against the Grand Lodge to force them to recognize the Waldeck lodge inside the order and give it full possession of their rights. The result of this case is looked for with the greatest interest by the whole German speaking population.</p>
   <p>The writ set up by Dr. Bocke explains that the Waldeck lodge, like the Grand lodge, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was incorporated according to the laws of Illinois as a legally independent unit and that the Grand lodge had no right to forbid his client the use of the German language. The constitution of the Waldeck lodge has been approved by the Grand lodge. There, as in 14 other lodges, in Chicago, also use the German language, none of them would have joined the order, if the use of the German language was not guaranteed.</p>
