   <p>The United German groups of the city of Chicago, an organization for promotion of the study of the German language and literature at the Chicago University, has just been founded. The group will also strive to uphold and introduce such traditions of the old world, as will add to the best of the new world. The group will participate at the cornerstone laying of "Wieboldt Hall" on November 6th, the University building which is dedicated to the study of modern languages and to which the Wieboldt Foundation contributed $500,000.</p>
   <p>The United German group will work hand in hand with the University of Chicago, because the members of the group acknowledge, that the University on the basis of long experience, is particularly fit to promote the cultural knowledge of their homelands. Prominent members of Germanic nationalities belong to the group, Chicagoans who very often solved successfully important problems of national welfare.</p>
   <p>The main executives of the United German group, all Chicagoans, are: Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, president; William A. Wieboldt, honorary president; Cornelius Teninga, financial secretary. German: Bernard DeVry, E. J. Kruetgen, A. F. W. <span class="page-break">2</span>Siebel, Max L. Teich, and Henry Zander. The University of Chicago is represented by its president Dr. Max Mason, Philip S. Allen, professor and president of the group of German language and literature; Professor Ferdinand Shevill of the history group, and Dr. H. Y. Atchison.</p>
   <p>Mr. Otto L. Schmidt, president of the executive committee, made the following declaration today: According to reports of the census of the year 1920, more than 50 percent of Germans, Scandinavians, Hollanders and Flemish, who were born abroad, live in the middle west, whose industrial and spiritual center is Chicago. This fact is the more noteworthy, because these twelve states only contain 28 out of 100 of the total population of the United States. Considering that the city of Chicago is the real center of the masses of German descent, many far seeing members of this race have intended for a long time to avail themselves of the opportunity to offer to all who study world problems, in a suitable manner, to glance into the literary, historical and cultural values of the German language and literature and to emphasize as an important factor, the welding together of all elements, constituting American civilization.</p>
   <p>The University of Chicago offered these leading men an excellent opportunity, which should not be neglected, to show the value of German civilization. The <span class="page-break">3</span>expression Germanic in this sense, is a philologic expression and interprets as such the fact that the German, Scandinavian and Holland-Dutch languages are from the same origin, and developed apart from other language types, therefore so to say are sisters and cousins. Although English is another Germanic language, it naturally occupies such a position in America, that it must be considered as a separate division. In the modern language groups, French, Italian and Spanish must be considered.</p>
