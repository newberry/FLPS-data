   <p>The German Evangelical Church St. Paul, corner La Salle Avenue and Ohio Street, will resume its church services on Sunday, September 26, after six weeks spent in repairs, painting and interior decoration. All this work was done masterfully by a decorator, Emmel, and gave the church a new and refreshing appearance. A special divine service will be observed Monday evening, on which occasion the new teacher of the St. Paul's German-English congregational School, C. A. Weiss, will be introduced.</p>
   <p>Mr. Weiss already has been principal of the school two weeks and had proved his abilities as principal and teacher.</p>
