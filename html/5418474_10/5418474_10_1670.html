   <p>At the refectory of the Franciscan Convent, the yearly meeting of the Directors of the Catholic Orphanage and the Catholic St. Bonifagius Cemetery was held under the chairmanship of the Rev. Father Fischer. The priest of every German Catholic parsonage and two members of each parish participated as representatives. Rev. Father Fischer made a speech in which he related that at the time of the foundation of the cemetery only four German parishes existed in this city and that it was a hard struggle before the Catholics, who were then hated received a permit to found their own cemetery. This was in 1863. Today the parishes share the cemetery. Four small parishes founded the cemetery in the belief that it would provide resting places for the dead for an endless number of years. Today, with more than 80,000 German Catholics in Chicago, new cemeteries soon will have to be established. The same is true of the Orphan home, but in an even more pressing way, 183 children have found a good home there, thanks to the unselfish service of twelve servants of Christ. During the last year, 1,132 Catholics found their last resting place at the St. Bonifacius Cemetery.</p>
