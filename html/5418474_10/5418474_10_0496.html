   <p>At the German Concert held at Ravinia Park yesterday "The German Constitution Day" was the subject of the two speakers. An all-German musical program was played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the direction of the orchestra's assistant conductor, Mr. Eric De Lamarter. The program consisted of the following compositions: The "Fourth Symphony," by Schumann; the "Academical Festival Overture," by Brahns; the "Bachanal" from Tannhaeuser, and the "Ride of the Walkyries" by Wagner. The German Constitution Day was also observed with two addresses by prominent men. The first was a short address, explaining the history leading to the development of the Constitution, delivered by Doctor Schaller, the German Vice-Consul. He was followed on the speaker's <span class="page-break">2</span>platform by Professor Frank Spiecker of the Northwestern University, brother of the former chief of the German press.</p>
   <p>Spiecker's Address:</p>
   <p>"We could not avail ourselves of a more opportune time to speak of the German Fatherland than today on the eve of the twelfth anniversary when the German nation, under most adverse conditions, adopted the Constitution. The memory of that day will and must remain sacred to every German. In profound gratitude we think today of those German men and women at Weimar who delivered the nation from chaos by introducing more sane and orderly conditions. They have also restored the people's courage to build anew upon the ruins of the Reich. They have revived their sense of justice, a heritage of the <span class="page-break">3</span>German people. Today, we recall with deep gratitude the services rendered to the German nation by these apostles of justice and peace. It was no easy task indeed. The German nation is reminiscent of the hours of gloom which confronted the new Reich. We all know that old and young were victims of deplorable conditions, which then prevailed. Simultaneously, we must pay tribute to the American Nation for her readiness to extend relief to the German people. The Star Spangled Banner made a triumphant entry of good will into Germany when that nation experienced the gloom of its darkest hours, the humanitarism of which will never be forgotten by us.</p>
   <p>In gratitude, we also think of those statesmen, whose fatal illness was the direct result of the strain and the difficult task of their duty, that of <span class="page-break">4</span>reconstructing Germany. I speak with reference to Walter Rathenau, Ebert, and Stresemann, whose health was thus undermined. However, other men took their places, resuming the work and the responsibility of their predecessors.</p>
   <p>The German horizon has been, and still is, threatened by clouds, heralding stormy weather. Misery and want obscure the sun rays which try to penetrate and shine upon a suffering people. Observers and others know that a collapse of Germany was imminent during the past few weeks. The worse has been suspected. But the grave situation has cleared, at least temporarily, with due recognition for the able leader, now at the helm of the state. Irrespective of the enmities confronting him, and despite the difficult sailing of the ship of state, Reich's-chancellor Bruening steers his ship with a strong and steady hand, compelling us to give him unanimous admiration. He pursues one course only, the course of friendship among nations. The sole aim of the German chancellor <span class="page-break">5</span>is to attain a friendly relationship between all nations as well as mutual regard and mutual understanding. Upon this basis, all political negotiations should be conducted. It should bring salvation to the people of the world.</p>
   <p>Our best wishes accompany Mr. Bruening for a safe landing, the benefit of which shall be shared by all nations.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, this German statesman had the encouragement and the moral support of one man not mentioned yet. This man was Herbert, Hoover, President of the United States. The moratorium plan of the President inspired that statesman with renewed vigor and renewed hope to safely anchor his ship.</p>
   <p>If he reaches port safely, which, in the interest of the human race we hope he <span class="page-break">6</span>will, the services of the man who assisted him in steering the ship through a stormy sea must be duly recognized. To this man, who is none other than the President of the United States, I, a subject of the German Reich, and enjoying this nation's hospitality, have the special privilege and the great honor to extend the heartfelt gratitude of the German people.... May peace and happiness settle upon the German nation. This is our wish and salute to the German Reich, on the anniversary of the Constitution Day. We also salute the aged President, von Hindenburg, the father of the Reich. May he lead Germany once more to victory, not by the method of War, but through the all uniting love and peace, encircling not only Germany, but the whole world. May the Allmighty will it so!"</p>

   <p>A musical selection, unusually interesting, followed the speech. It was the concerto in G minor by Bruch, presented by the concert master, John Weicher, who was loudly applauded for the poetical interpretation of this work.</p>
