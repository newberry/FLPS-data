   <p>A few days ago a half dozen old German-Americans were sitting at a table and discussing citizenship. All of them considered themselves real American citizens, with full rights, however it turned out that only one of them was a real citizen and the others were not.</p>
   <p>In nearly every case their misconception was due to the fact, that they were under age when they came to the United States and their fathers secured the citizenship papers. This led them to believe that, thereby, they automatically became citizens. The fact of the matter is, that they become citizens only, if their fathers received the final or second citizenship papers, before the children reached the age of 21. If this is not the case, then the naturalization papers of the fathers are of no personal benefit to the children. In such cases the children themselves must apply for citizen ship. Even if the fathers had become citizens before the children became of age, it is best for them to get their own citizenship papers. It would be necessary to use their father's citizenship paper to prove their citizenship and besides they must have witnesses to testify that at the time, they were still under age.</p>
