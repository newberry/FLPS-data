   <p>After remodeling and refurnishing it, the German Methodist Memorial Church at Hancock and Mc Lean Avenues was again dedicated. This celebration took place yesterday. More than a dozen ministers and many members of sister churches had come to take part in the services. The Pastor of the Church, Karl Keck, delivered the sermon for the occasion. Several ministers held short appropriate speeches, and the mixed choir of the church, as well as a quartet, which had come from Aurora, assisted with their songs to make the dedication service impressive and dignified.</p>
   <p>The church was originally built in 1897, but was hit by lightening and destroyed by fire. After rebuilding the same church was hit twice by lightening.</p>
