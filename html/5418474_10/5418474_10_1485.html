   <p>In crowded Orchestra Hall last night a celebration in honor of Dr. Martin Luther took place, in an impressive manner, which was organized by the Lutheran institution. After an organ prelude performed by Prof. Rupprecht, the congregation sang the beautiful Lutheran choral, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God." Dr. Arthur Haermann of the Lutheran College at Watertown, Wisconsin, made a speech about Luther in the German language. He spoke about the spiritual life of the reformer, the most important and most audacious clerical teacher since the time of the Apostles. The teachers' choir, managed by Mr. Bildermann, followed with two Dutch popular songs. Prof. W. H. R. Dan, of the Theological Seminary, Concordia, in St. Louis, made a speech in the English language about Lutheranism in the U. S., which has two and one-half to three million followers in 13,372 communities or 67 synods. The property in churches and real estate has a value of $46,500,000.</p>
