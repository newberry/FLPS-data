   <p>The widespread hostility to trusts is rooted largely in the manifest purpose of great corporations to evade their share of taxation. The "trusts", considered purely as industrial agencies, would be discussed more calmly and with less hostility by the public if the people were convinced that the gigantic corporations could be depended upon to assume their part of the public burdens. They never fail to invoke the law when their rights are threatened, and due protection is never denied them; in fact, some people are under the impression that the rights of property, especially corporate property, are held more precious and sacred by our courts than are the rights of men. This may be a prejudiced view. But the people are not mistaken in their firm belief that corporations generally pay much less than their just portion of the taxes.</p>

   <p>If managers of great corporations would adopt a broader and less selfish policy the interests entrusted to their charge would be safer, as they would rest upon a foundation of justice which is now lacking. It is true of corporations no less than of individuals that, in the long run, honesty is the best policy. In the present temper of the people, corporations will not be safe from attack so long as they attempt to shirk their duties to the people. If they are slow to move, the people will rise some day and call to account not only public servants who sell their rights but also those who buy them. When their wrath is once aroused the people may go too far; but the blame will be upon somebody else. Injustice and wrongs always expose society to serious disturbances and dangers. Just taxation is the very foundation of social stability and safety, as unjust taxation is the mainspring of social discontent and upheavals.</p>
   <p>Let the corporations share the public burdens with the people upon equal terms, and they need not be concerned about the safety of their interests, but may then confidently look to the people for full and fair protection.</p>
