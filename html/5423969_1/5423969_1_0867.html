   <p>Last Sunday the Communists held a meeting at Wicker Park Hall. The Scandinavian Bolsheviks seemed to be the leading factor there. More than fourteen hundred people attended, and about forty per cent of these were Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>Copies of the Voice of Labor, The Worker, Attack Upon Labor, The Proletarian, and The Proletarian Songbook were sold by the thousands. A string orchestra, consisting mostly of mandolins, played revolutionary music. The music portrayed the longing and sorrow of the people. It was well done. Next, the Freiheit Singing Society, consisting of one hundred voices, sang a number of classic Jewish songs.</p>
   <p>The main feature of the evening was then presented. The audience waited quietly and expectantly. The feature was "The Last Revolution," the text written by Michael Gold and the music by Jose Bamirez. The music was excellent. The final number on the program was a duet by two Swedish girls, <span class="page-break">2</span>Vinzie and Lilla Lindhe, ten and fifteen years of age respectively.</p>
