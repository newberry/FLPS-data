   <p>Miss Van Zandt and August Spies were married by proxy a few days ago.</p>
   <p>We are absolutely against anything of this kind. If people are allowed to marry by proxy, we will find that the number of bigamists will increase.</p>
   <p>Why were Miss Van Zandt and Mr. Spies permitted to marry at all? The churches and ministers should object to this.</p>
