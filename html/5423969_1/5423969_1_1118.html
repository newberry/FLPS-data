   <p>The burning question of the day is the temperance question. Both the major political camps are divided on this question.</p>
   <p>The Germans are mostly anti-Temperance, and the Scandinavians are divided about fifty-fifty on the question.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian Republicans seem to be pretty well split. We think that this general division in the ranks of all the national groups will assure many a Scandinavian victory.</p>
   <p>Several prominent men will speak for the anti-Temperance group at Turner Hall tomorrow evening.</p>
   <p>The main speakers in the Danish group will be: Theodor Winholt, Martin <span class="page-break">\2</span>Rasmussen, A. G. Krogstad, Christian R. Rasmussen, P. P. Holst, and H. S. Paulsen.</p>
   <p>In the Norwegian group the main speakers will be: A. Olledorf, Chas. S. Jewne, Martin Losby, and S. T. Gunderson.</p>
