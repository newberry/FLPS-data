   <p>The free public evening schools are opening tomorrow. They give immigrants a good opportunity for winning a future. The activity of the evening schools fall along three main lines as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Instruction in the language of our country for immigrants who have not mastered this language. These courses are of course chiefly for adults.</p>
   <p>2. A continuation school for boys and girls who for one reason or other had to leave the regular public schools before having completed their courses.</p>
   <p>3. Vocational training in various trades.</p>
   <p>The value of the evening schools is admitted by all. Investigation of the results attained so far show that for society as a whole, the evening schools have been of great importance, but especially so for immigrants.</p>
   <p>An immigrant may have had good training in his homeland, but unless he learns the American language, he cannot make use of his training here.</p>
