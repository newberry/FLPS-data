   <p>It is rather curious to note that the Scandinavians have quite different opinions about politics. Republicans and Democrats are almost equal in representation and constituency, the Socialists slightly less, but the Prohibitionists have by far the greatest representation.</p>
   <p>Look at this picture. Oscar Hillstrom [Swede] runs for city treasurer on the Republican ticket. John E. Larson [Norwegian] runs for city clerk on the Prohibitionist ticket. In the aldermanic elections the picture is as follows: Republicans: A.O. Erickson [Swede], August Monson [Dane]; Democrats: Stephen Lawson [Norwegian], Wm. E. Nielsen [Dane], Jens N. Hyldahl [Dane]; Socialists: Axel Gustafson [Swede], Nicolay F. Holm [Dane], V.A. Sorensen [Dane]. Prohibitionist; C. C. Ostergren [Swede], Oscar Larson [Swede], A.Gust Gustafson [Swede], Wm. Borg [Dane], Oscar Alberg [Norwegian], John Everson [Swede], John L. Johnson [Norwegian], Peter Nielsen [Dane], J. M. Pedersen [Dane], Olaf Wahlberg [Swede], J. R. Peterson [Swede], C. W. Johnson [Norwegian] and Bert Thompson [Dane].</p>
