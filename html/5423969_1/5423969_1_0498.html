   <p>When the praises of our country are sung, our hearts beat high with joy, for we love our republic, the mightiest on earth; its welfare is our delight, its growth our pride. Our souls are filled with ardent wishes for its prosperity.</p>
   <p>And yet, in our devotion we are not blind to its imperfections. In mechanical skill and in inventive ingenuity, we are world leaders. Our resources, combined with our practical turn of mind and our industry, have made us a rich people and we are able to afford more luxuries than any other nation. But this very circumstance seems to be our great misfortune. We have been caught in the meshes of our own prosperity, and have become slaves of our wealth. The maturity of mind that characterized the builders of the nation is no longer abiding with us; our best traits are fast deteriorating just because of the abnormal growth of our prosaic, practical faculties.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>No greater misfortune could befall a people. For those ill-directed tendencies, if not checked, must in the end lead to our downfall. History tells the story. Preferable [it is] many times to be a poor nation with a country as stingy as that of the Alpine people, but with a rich, spiritual life, than to be the earth's richest nation devoid of spiritual life.</p>
   <p>Degradation has advanced so far that we have made the dollar our national idol--the meanest to which any people can bow down--and we have even confided the issues of our state and national elections to its decision. We have made the march back as far as the corrupting times of George III. Thoughtful men view the situation with the greatest anxiety, and not one dissenting voice is heard in the declaration that a reformation is necessary.</p>
   <p>It is among our young people such a reformation must begin, among the heirs of yesterday's pioneers, among the citizens of tomorrow's nation. Our young people must be awakened to see the impending danger, and must be stirred to come to the rescue. There must be a great uprising from mountain to plain <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>all over this broad land. As of old, Switzerland against Austria, Greece against the Turks, and young America against King George, so must our youth flock under the banner of spiritual freedom, and advance against the lurking foe that threatens to destroy what is best in us. And when this young army of giant strength takes the field, it shall not rest until the last lingering enemy has fled our borders.</p>
   <p>But somebody must begin; somebody must make the first move. And it is here, I believe,[that] our Scandinavian youth should find their places. They should be the vanguard of this noble army; the leaders of this great movement. Why not?</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian peoples have always possessed strong moral and religious convictions; even the old heathen cult shows this very clearly. To this add a fixed determination and steadiness of purpose, traits inherited from the old Vikings and still inherent in the people, and certainly, the Scandinavians are endowed with qualities which in a high degree fit them for leaders.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The Scandinavians in this country have shown several times that they admire the successes won by their brethren across the sea. It is meet and becoming that they should so do. But that is not enough. How will the glory of Ibsen, Bjornson, and Nansen help us if we do not prove that we are of their spirit. We must act ourselves, do deeds that bespeak our relation to those great minds. Then we will have the right to claim their brotherhood.</p>
   <p>Certain accomplishments are, of course, necessary to take up the proposed work effectively. A sound, common sense education is necessary.</p>
   <p>Some courage needs to be cultivated. It is the lack of this quality, courage, which, for a long time, has prompted our people to take their places in the rear of the ranks. There is no reason why we should do so any longer. We must have some faith in ourselves, and come forward in the broad daylight, not fearing to face our fortune. If we sit the whole day brooding over our own imperfections, and even imagining some <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>where we can find none, what wonder then if others should look down upon us, and consider us inferior? A great portion of success is made up just of faith. And we must have conviction. Conviction is the mainspring of action.</p>
   <p>It is an heirloom of the Scandinavian race; and I believe that our youths have great wealth in possessing it, and hence are particularly well-fitted as leaders.</p>
   <p>I know well enough that there are among us worthy representatives who have taken their places among the foremost of the nation. But those are only single voices in the wilderness, and would easily be drowned in the great roar. In every place where the Scandinavians have cast their fortunes there should be spokesmen; young men and women who would not be satisfied merely to follow others, but would themselves be leaders of noble enterprises. That scarecrow. The language, should soon be exploded to atoms, and the dark phantoms who go abroad whispering murderous doubts of our <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>abilities should be utterly destroyed.</p>
   <p>Scandinavian youths, do not linger behind in the race, and do not suffer yourselves to be looked down upon as inferiors and skulkers by those who believe themselves more able. But push forward, seize the unfurled banner, and march at the head of the advancing columns. Then the burning shame of incompetence shall no longer make havoc in your breast, but the spirit which unites you with the greatest minds of mankind, shall urge you on to still greater actions.</p>
