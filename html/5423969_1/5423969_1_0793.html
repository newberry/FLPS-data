   <p>p.4.....For the first time in its history Chicago (thru its city council) has moved to mediate in a labor conflict. The initiative was taken by Alderman Merriam (7th ward), formerly professor of political economy at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The occasion is the month old clothing workers strike involving nearly 45,000 men women, boys and girls who demand a union, union recognition, closed shop, better hourly and piece work rates, elimination of fines and other "prison" rules and abuses.</p>
   <p>It is about time the city woke up and did something for its citizens regardless of ancestry. Adults and children are starving and desperate measures must be employed to bring about an agreement between striking employes and the clothing barons. The act of our council will be backed by every progressive and decent citizen in Chicago.</p>
