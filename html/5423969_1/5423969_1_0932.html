   <p>(The undersigned committee writes to Scandia in behalf of Alderman Buck.) These are the reasons why you should go to the polls on Tuesday and nominate him as the Republican candidate of the Thirty-third Ward.</p>
   <p>In the term he is just finishing in the city council he has proved his courage, his honesty, and his sense of responsibility. In the two years he has served the city as alderman, he has become one of the conspicuosly valuable men in the council, and the citizens of the Thirty-third Ward should be proud to claim him as their representative.</p>
   <p>Women citizens, especially, should endorse him because he has always taken a firm stand against vice conditions. It was Alderman Buck who conducted a continual warfare against ex-Chief of Police Healy long before State's Attorney Hoyne woke up and indicted him. When Healy deprived Second Deputy <span class="page-break">\2</span>Funkhouser of his trustworthy inspectors and put political appointees in their places, Alderman Buck set up a determined resistance. He would not stand for this interference in the restriction of vice in Chicago. When vicious cabarets flaunted their immoral attractions, it was Buck who realized their dangerous appeal to the young people of Chicago, and his efforts have been continuous to keep such resorts out of the city.</p>
   <p>It was Alderman Buck who insisted that vicious films should not be shown at the moving picture houses of Chicago, where the youth of the city congregate, and unconsciously absorb immoral standards.</p>
   <p>The women signing this appeal believe that it will be a disgraceful thing if the women citizens of the 33rd Ward do not support Buck.</p>
   <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
   <p>Dr. Helsa Ruup, Dr. Ingeborg Rasmussen, Mrs. S. Arthur Walthers, Mrs. C. Thompson, Mrs. Harry B. Miller.</p>
