   <p>The grand jury has indicted a large number of Chinese and others for gambling. This must be a great and unpleasant surprise for all the honest people who believe the story told by those in control of the government in Chicago; and, of course, one ought to believe those who are in control, for it should be assumed that these people always tell the truth, at least when speaking in official capacity.</p>
   <p>If there is any matter on which they have given definite assurance, it is the question of gambling. Mayor after mayor, including Mayor Busse; chief of police after chief of police, including Chief of Police Shippy--have regularly repeated the pleasant statement, "No gambling in Chicago!" These men might disagree on practically anything else, but on this point there has been sweet agreement. Of course it has happened--quite frequently, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>even--that the chief of police, in speeches to the public and to the police force, has declared that the gamblers had better look out now, for they were on the black list, every one of them. A couple of days previously, he might have declared that the city was free of gamblers, but that fact would not keep him from parading a declaration that gambling was to be extinguished.</p>
   <p>Thus the men in control of the city government have kept it up, year after year. Only a short while ago, we were told that such a thing as gambling is not to be found in Chicago. And then comes State's Attorney Wayman and the grand jury and present us with a mass of gamblers in one indictment--on a tray, as it were!</p>
   <p>Perhaps, at last, we are to see a real cleanup. Wayman has proven himself a man of action. When he takes hold of a situation he generally keeps on until the matter in question has been finished.</p>
