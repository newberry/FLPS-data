   <p>The Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Chicago, Illinois, is located in Maywood, a suburb of Chicago, about ten miles due west of the City Hall, and can be reached by the Aurora, Elgin, and Chicago Electric Railway, which stops at the Seminary Station, Eleventh Avenue; by the Madison Electric line; and also by the Great Northern Railway. The Seminary property consists of fifteen acres of land, partly planted as park, pleasantly located, and well drained. The site was purchased by the Seminary in 1909.</p>
   <p>In 1910, eleven buildings were erected on the grounds; these buildings included residences for the president, three professors, and the general secretary; two dormitories, administration buildings, dining hall, and heating plant. The buildings are provided with modern improvements, such as electric lights, water, steam heat, sewerage, etc.</p>
   <p>The Seminary has now completed the twentieth year of its existence. Originally it was located on the North Side of Chicago, the site consisting of two acres fronting on Waveland Avenue, between Clark Street and Sheffield Avenue. The lot was a donation of the late Reverend William A. Passavant, D. D. Considering what the Seminary has accomplished, and the great work it has before it in the future, it may be of some interest to briefly review its history.</p>
   <p>To the late Reverend William A. Passavant, D. D., is due the honor and the credit for planning, promoting, and founding the institution. Dr. Passavant was one of the foremost leaders in the Lutheran Church in America in his day. Eminent in his profession, widely and well known, everywhere revered and beloved, devoting his great ability to promote organized charity, building up institutions of mercy and general missionary work among the thousands of Germans and Scandinavian immigrants who poured into the western states in those early days, Dr. Passevant clearly foresaw and fully understood and appreciated the great need of an adequate number of educated clergy to take up the work among the early settlers, to organize them into congregations, and to administer to their spiritual wants in general.</p>
   <p>In 1869, the General Council, one of the largest and most influential Lutheran church bodies in America, held its biennial session in Chicago. Before the convention, Dr. Passevant, with his well-known eloquence, held forth the great need of clergymen to carry on the mission work in the western states. He laid especially great stress on the importance of having men able to preach in the English language as well as in the native tongue of the people, mainly in order to keep the younger members of the growing population in the fold of the Lutheran Church. He therefore strongly recommended that an English seminary be established in some convenient central part of one of the western states, and in his opinion Chicago would be the place.</p>
   <p>As a result of the doctor's pleading, the convention devoted one day to the consideration of ministerial education. The convention, after a full and earnest discussion of the matter, unanimously adopted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, In the deliberate judgment of the Council, the time has come when the needs of the Lutheran population in the western states require the establishment, at some central point, of a theological seminary, where the future ministry of our English, German, and Scandinavian churches may be educated together, in the unity of the common faith, confessed and maintained by this body; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the General Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, in the humble acknowledgement of its inability to carry forward the great and difficult undertaking to a successful issue by its own resolution and strength, nevertheless, in confident reliance upon Almighty God and His promised grace, does, now, in the name of Jesus Christ, and alone for His glory, solemnly resolve to take the necessary steps toward the establishment of such an institution."</p>
   
   <p>After some of the preliminary steps had been taken toward carrying these resolutions into effect, among which was the securing of a site for the Seminary, and the selection of the first professor by the General Council, circumstances arose over which the Council had no control and made it impossible to open the Seminary until October 1, 1891. The distinctive aim of this Seminary, as set forth in its charter, is to "educate together" men of a pure faith, of a holy life, and of the requisite gifts and education, so that by all necessary learning and practical skill they may be fitted for the ministry of the Gospel, especially in connection with the Evangelical Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>From the early history of the Evangelical Lutheran Seminary of Chicago, it might appear that it was a child of the General Council, that it was founded, as it were, under its auspices, the members of the first board of directors being elected by the Council. At present, however, the relations between the two bodies seem to be merely that of good fellowship. The General Council in various ways extends favors to the Seminary, and the Seminary, on the other hand, has been of inestimable service to the General Council, especially in its mission work.</p>
   
   <p>The exact position assumed by the General Council toward the Seminary was set forth in a set of resolutions adopted at a session held in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1893. In these resolutions the General Council expresses its appreciation of the importance of the Lutheran Theological Seminary of Chicago, and its confidence in the board of directors which the General Council had appointed, "and cordially recommended the young institution to our pastors and people," but added that it was clearly the intention of the General Council to keep itself free from all pecuniary responsibility, etc.; that it would not have anything to do with the management of the institution; that it would not approve the appointment of professors, nor would it examine or have anything to do with the adoption of the Seminary's constitution. This left the Seminary as an independent corporation, to manage its own affairs, to choose its professors, and to elect its own directors. The Seminary was also left to provide the means for its maintenance.</p>
   <p>That the Seminary had its hands full will be readily understood when we know that it had no funds to fall back upon, and no endowment. The site was donated, but buildings had to be erected, the ground improved, salaries paid, etc. The professors had to devote all of their spare time to solicit funds for the institution and for their own salaries. A financial secretary had to be employed to raise funds. It should be no surprise, therefore, that the Seminary often met with financial embarrassment, and that not infrequently the president of the faculty had to fall back upon his private resources in order to meet the deficits.</p>
   <p>The Seminary was formally opened on the first Thursday in October, 1891, with the professors, Reverend Revere Franklin Weidner, D. D., L. L. D., and experienced teachers. Dr. Weidner had been a professor at Augustana College in Rock Island. Dr. Roth for a number of years was president of Thiel College. The lectures were held in a chapel situated on property adjoining the Seminary. Truly it has been said that "at no time in the history of the Christian Church has so great a stress been laid on the proper training of our sacred ministry as in our day". The board of directors of the Seminary were indeed fortunate in selecting Dr. Weidner as president of the institution. Dr. Weidner's reputation as a scholar, author, and teacher is international as well as national. His name at once gave the Seminary a standing it would not otherwise have had. As a teacher, Dr. Weidner is clear, concise, and inspiring. He took up the work at the Seminary with his whole heart and soul, took it up with an earnestness and enthusiasm that meant success.</p>
   <p>During the first year (1891-92) six regular and five part-time students were enrolled, and in addition sixteen others placed themselves under the direction of the faculty to pursue a post graduate course. The number of students in attendance during the second year (1892-93) consisted of twenty-three regulars, eight part-time students, and thirty-nine who pursued prescribed post graduate courses, making seventy in all, and coming from twenty different Lutheran synods....</p>
   <p>Since the Seminary was opened about twenty years ago, two hundred and sixty young men have graduated from the institution. The majority of them have taken up mission work in the Lutheran Church. A number of them have done valiant service in foreign lands, in India, Africa, China, Japan, and Porto Rico. Nineteen are or have been engaged in the educational work of the church, others have been or are teaching in theological seminaries, colleges, and academies, while some are founders and promoters of institutions of learning.</p>
   <p>Considering the many difficulties and drawbacks that the Chicago Seminary has had to contend with, this is indeed a most satisfactory showing, reflecting credit alike on the Alma Mater and the alumni. With four professors, and as many instructors, with enlarged and improved facilities, and with a brighter financial outlook, the Seminary is now in a position to do larger and even better work than heretofore.</p>
