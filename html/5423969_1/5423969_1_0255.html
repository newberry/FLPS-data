   <p>Sunday evening, Jan. 18th, was a gala occasion at the Kenrik Ibsen lodge of the I.O.G.T. The ladies entertained the male section, showing the chesty brothers what real entertainment was. Singing, instrumental music and recitations flowed from the cornucopia of enjoyable offerings. In addition, the newly-organized Henrick Ibsen orchestra made its first public appearance; though small it is a very good musical ensemble. Everyone contributed to and everybody enjoyed the evening of fun.</p>
