   <p>p.30.........Every age has its burning question to be solved. So it was a half century ago with the "Slavery-question." Our time has several questions awaiting solution, for example; the Prohibition question, Woman's Suffrage, etc.</p>
   <p>To our countrymen in America a question of more importance than any other, has come up: "The Language question." What shall our position be with respect to the language of our fathers? Shall we endeavor to retain it, or shell we put it aside?</p>
   <p>This is a question which concerns the whole emigrant population. Germans, Italians, French and all the other 101 nationalities living here. All these people have,to a large or smaller degree retained the language of their fathers. Bohemian, Polish, Russian, Finnish, French, Spanish, Dutch, etc., is both spoken and written by these people today. And some of these people, for example; the Germans and the French would never think of giving up the language of their fathers.</p>
   
   <p>Among us Norwegians it has always been taken as a matter of course, that we should retain our mother-tongue; it has been the common language in the church as well as in the many business enterprises, when we come in contact with one another. Now, however, it seems as if we have reached a transition period lingiustically speaking. The first generation, the old emigrants, is dying out, the second generation is far advanced, and the third is just appearing on the scene. The question Norwegian English has become a burning one to every congregation, city or country. Consider the meaning of the strong demand for English-speaking ministers. It has been said, there was no use for the Norwegian language; many are clamoring for a change - better have the boat ready - the old ship is sinking. Others are striving hard to keep the old ship afloat a while longer; they teach their children Norwegian catechism, maintain Sunday-Schools and Norwegian sermons.</p>
   <p>But this question steadily booms up before us and has reached a stage, where we must take a stand, and then only after a very thorough, deliberate and careful study in order to determine the right course to pursue.</p>
   
   <p>As in all other questions the word of God should also here be the governing one, wherefore I have chosen one of the most important as well as best known of God's words:</p>
   <p>The Fourth Commandement.</p>
   <p>In this connection there are three questions I shall try to answer: "What has the Fourth Commandement to teach us with reference to the language question?"</p>
   <p>"What effect on our peoples' future will our stand on our mother-tongue have?" "And, is it possible for us to preserve our language in this country?"</p>
   <p>Our position to the English language does not enter here, that question is settled once and for all, and we have no choice. The laws of the land demand that we all learn English which is desseminated through our public schools. The question that confronts us is: Shall we. besides the English language, also retain our mother-tongue?</p>
   <p>That is what we are going to look into now.</p>
   
   <p>The Fourth Commandment.</p>
   <p>What has the Fourth Commandment to teach us with reference to the preservation of our mother-tongue?</p>
   <p>"Honor they Father and they Mother, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."</p>
   <p>It was as children we struggled with the Fourth Commandment, and we will continue to struggle with this as well as the other Commandments all through our lives. The Fourth Commandment touches our life more deeply than any other. It is the first Commandment with a prediction, it appears first and the second Slate, and has a decided meaning for our earthly life's wellbeing. To elucidate upon this would require too much space, suffice it to say, that upon this Commandment lies the whole foundation of a civilized State, Church and Home.</p>
   <p>The first question is: Who is my father and mother? Is it only my natural parents, who gave me birth and raised me? Am I not also a child of my grand-parents? Can we stop here? Do not the roots of my family-tree extend still farther back in time? I know a girl, who is the very image of her great-great-grandmother. My father and mother are certainly also my forefathers as far back as we can trace our history; to those who were the first father and mother in our land. I belong to a family of people older than history, who has lived and built among Norway's mountains. I am a product of the Norwegian people. Our natural surroundings and life have through "eons" stamped us as being different from other people.</p>
   <p>It is said, and truthfully, that a person who commands several languages, has several souls; he is broadminded, able to see and understands things from many angles, or in other words, he is better informed in the topics of the day than the average person. We may use several languages to the extent of our ability, but our mother-tongue remains the language of our hearts.</p>
   <p>The Mother-tongue stayed.</p>
   <p>In a letter from Mayville, N.D. to "Minneapolis Journal" dated April 30, we read the following: Paralysis has deprived State Senator Elken of his ability to speak English. While he before spoke English and his mother-tongue Norwegian with equal facility; he is now able only to utter a few English words; his ability to speak Norwegian has not been impaired in the least.</p>
   <p>We have a right to, and should, be proud of our forefathers in this land. The Scandinavian people together with the Germans are builders; wherever they go, one will find orderly communities, with churches and schools of the first order; and look at their farms, more well tilled and better maintained farms cannot be found anywhere in the great North West.</p>
   <p>An awakening seems to have come over our people during the last few years. The Norwegian language has been introduced into many high schools and grade schools, and it is also being studied in our colleges and universities. In the high schools in Minneapolis, Germans, Jews and even Irish are studying our language, and many of these people send their children to our Sunday schools to learn Norwegian.</p>
   
   <p>The Centennial Celebration (in Norway) with its thousands of American visitors, as well as the Parish Organization (Bygdelags Bevegelsen) together with the stronger and easier means of Communications, have also helped to foster interest in the Norwegian language.</p>
