   <p>It has been asked; "Why did Olaf Ray leave the Democratic party?" Here is his answer:</p>
   <p>"Now that I am being asked why I left the Democratic party, as every one knows I have done, here is my answer, briefly.</p>
   <p>"Because the Democrats are not sincere as to principle. Grover Cleveland, though elected on a good and liberal platform, turned out to be an autocrat who defied the country and the people. He promised, before his election, that he would take up the tariff question. This he forgot, and instead he took up the issue of capital for the benefit of the Wall Street bankers, and so betrayed his trust almost at once. Mayor Harrison who was elected on a 'free silver" platform, also forgot, and instead acted very undemocratic in regard to civil service reform.</p>
   
   <p>"Because in time, all liberal and radical elements have supported the Democratic party, but have found it necessary to drop away, one by one. The Democrats did not support the issues at stake, such as free trade, the single tax, personal rights, and, last but not least, the People's party had its wings clipped because of the alliance with the Democrats. Everyone who has allied himself with the Democratic party, has been fooled--everyone from the royalist to the anarchist.</p>
   <p>"In general, the Democratic party has shown itself as an element without honor; a party that forgets its promises; a party that wants to gain at the expense of their supporters.</p>
   <p>"Their stand in the recent war was very unsound; yes, almost traitorous. They have turned their backs on Dewey and his victory, refusing to profit by the peace terms; and on the Philippine question, they are going against the will of the people.</p>
   
   <p>"I agree with President McKinley's stand on this question. He is a real patriot; he is firm in his statements and on his issues. We should show our appreciation this fall, by electing a full Republican slate."</p>
