   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>We like boys who have no bad habits: such as, drinking strong liquor, smoking and chewing tobacco, gambling, and swearing; and we also like those who have respect for their mothers and sisters. We do not approve of any young men who are not willing to lend a helping hand to a great cause, or who are ashamed to be seen helping their mothers and sisters around the house.</p>
   <p>A boy who will go with a girl just for the sake of going with someone, and when he thinks a better chance is afforded, will slight the one who thought him true, is not worthy of an honorable girl.</p>
   <p>Some young men say they think there are girls who can live up to this standard.</p>

   <p>We say to them that they had better go out among the people more and see if they cannot find someone who does. We think there are some girls left yet, who have respect for themselves as well as for others.</p>
   <p>We will say: When we are discussing dancing or any other topic which has appeared in this paper, let us not take God's name and the Bible in vain, for they are not things to be trifled with, but to be studied with care.</p>
