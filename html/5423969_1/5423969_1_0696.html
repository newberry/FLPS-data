   <p>It is not only part of moral doctrine that every citizen without discrimination should pay his just share of taxation of securities, embodying mortgages, bonds, etc. If some property is cancelled to avoid taxation it only means a heavier burden on those not inclined to deception. Men of increasing wealth are paying taxes. It is one of the easiest things in the world to formulate a lie and deceive the tax collector.</p>
   <p>The poorer people do not avoid paying taxes. Farmers are undoubtedly the most honest class of people with their names on the tax list. But it is the wealthy who are guilty of such dishonest acts.</p>
   <p>Monopolies and trusts have got hold of our government; the legislatures of the states have become their workshops for private profit only. They nominate and <span class="page-break">\2</span>elect men that will work in their interests. These officeholders vote against everything that tends to injure the trusts and monopolies. They have got politics into their own hands through the formation of machines. They elect the public officers while the people's choice is rejected. The will of the people becomes no longer the law of the land.</p>
   <p>But why do they do all this? To have such laws passed that will enable them to avoid taxation. Now, is this just? Is it right? No, it is wrong. We must annihilate this evil. Talk will never do it. The power of the government must come to the rescue. Adopt a plan of electing honest officers true to the people. Get the direct vote system instituted. Abolish caucuses and conventions and so make this government a government by the people and for the people. Act now, before it is too late.</p>
