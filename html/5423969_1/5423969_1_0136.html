   <p>The "almost unbelievable" has happened. After a lot of trials and tribulations and a seemingly thankless and useless task, our work has been crowned with success. Two classes comprising over fifty students, have been formed to study Norwegian at the Carl Schurz High School. Indications are that the number of students will be substantially increased, now that a real start has been made.</p>
   <p>The classes will be conducted by Mr. Alsager, a very capable young man who is taking a great interest in the new undertaking. No class has as yet been started at Tuley High School, though it is expected that this will be accomplished by the time schools re-open next fall, after the summer holidays.</p>
