   <p>The Norwegian Democratic Club's beer festival came off quietly last night with "Bier Vom Fass" [3.2.]. One barrel after another was emptied. The brew was served by nice, clean Democratic ladies' hands. The alcoholic contents of the foaming brew, was soberly (?) discussed. The guests were rather skeptical about the results that might be obtained with 3.2.</p>
   <p>Several chemists learnedly pointed out that the beer in Norway contained six per cent, bock beer ten per cent and Norwegian "peasant" beer four percent. It was then decided that the American beer that was being served was only 2.80; no one could get drunk on that.</p>
   <p>Whether it was the memory of good Norwegian beer, or that the "Vikings" had so weakened that it was possible to get drunk on 2.80 or whether it was the quantity that caused it the fact is that the good Vikings were found under the tables by the score. Will the mystery ever be solved?</p>
