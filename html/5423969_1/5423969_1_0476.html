   <p>We often forget the importance of time when we are young. In youth when we have but few sorrows, cares, and responsibilities, we forget about the time that is to come when sorrows, cares, and responsibilities will rest upon us. Everyone is placed at the entrance of two roads, the one broad and the other narrow, the one leading to vice, disgrace, poverty, and ignorance, the other leading to glory, honor, learning, and fame. In youth we begin our journey on one of the two roads. At first the two roads run together, but they get farther and farther apart. The same is true of those that walk on these roads; at first they walk together, but as time advances, they drift farther and farther apart. Those that took the broad road sink deeper and deeper into vice, disgrace, poverty, and ignorance, while those that took the narrow road receive more and more glory, honor, learning and fame.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Now, in youth, we are to determine which of those two roads we are going to take. Some may take the broad road because it seems to be more pleasant, some because it seems easier, and others because they want to be in line with some of their companions. But let us remember that we cannot become great by pleasure alone--that greatness is not acquired by always doing what is easy, or by following some of our companions. If we wish to accomplish anything in the world; we must work, and this work must begin in youth.</p>
   <p>We are living in a great and glorious country; we are blessed with happy homes, and surrounded by learning and advancement on all sides. Who has done all this for us? Is it the youth of today? No, but it is the youth of the past; it is those that have lived and died before us. Oh, then, what a debt we owe to those that made this country what it is, and carried this country through all its dangers, so that we now may enjoy peace, freedom, and happiness.</p>
   <p>But whether peace, happiness, and prosperity is going to continue in the future as it has in the past, does not depend upon our never-to-be-forgotten Washington, Lincoln, or Blaine; it depends upon the youth of today, whether they are going <span class="page-break">\3</span>to take the road that leads to glory, or the road that leads to shame, whether they are going to try to follow men like Washington, or whether they are going to follow those that are leading this country and its people to destruction.</p>
   <p>What a precious time is the time of youth! How important it is to begin our walk in life on the right road! For on the youth of today largely rests the destiny of our country. Therefore, it is the duty of each and everyone of us to try to follow the great men and women who have raised this country to its present heights; and to follow them we must work, and the work must be such that it does not pull us downward, but continually tends to lift us and our country to greater happiness and prosperity.</p>
   <p>If the work and aim of the majority of the youths are of this kind, there is good hope for our country's future. But if a large part of the young are going to take the downward path, respecting none higher than themselves, and not trying to rise any higher than they now are, then will this nation reach a point when <span class="page-break">\4</span>happiness and prosperity must end, and sorrows and calamities begin. This nation must then fall, fall as many other strong nations have done--fall for lack of true men and women.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we must all join in and work for our dear beloved country by sowing the seeds which shall grow into true manhood, by following men and women that are worthy of imitation. Then we may say in the future as we say today: "We live in the happiest and most prosperous country on the globe."</p>
