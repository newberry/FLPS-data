   <p>Trusts are growing and spreading out in Europe about as fast as they are here in the United States. They have, however, not aroused as loud a clamor in Europe as here, on account of the fact that the question has not been drawn into politics in Europe to the same extent as in the United States.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wilhelm Berdrow, a careful observer, informs us that the brick, stone, glass, lime, and other great industries in Germany, which have been organized into a few strong combinations, show that this organization is a real blessing for the industries in question; without having derogatory influence as far as the public welfare is concerned. In other words, these combinations have prevented unreasonable competition without markedly increasing the price of the goods. Competition is all right within limits; but there may be too much even <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of a good thing.</p>
   <p>Karl Marx once said that "competition is going to destroy competition." He saw clearly enough that if two competitors fight each other until their businesses no longer give any returns, then the weaker of the two must succumb; the victor remains alone in the field, and competition has ceased.</p>
   <p>A German author, writing about trusts in Germany, asserts that these trusts so far have shown prudent moderation in fixing prices, and have given no just cause for complaint. In following this policy they are simply protecting them-selves-following the dictates of a natural commercial law. No person, trust, or corporation will be able long to control the distribution of any product if the price is made high enough to make it profitable for any person who might wish to start producing the product.</p>
   <p>The European trusts, as a rule, have gained a more or less complete control <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of the production of some articles in certain districts. In doing this they have not quite prevented overproduction, but they have lessened this evil. Frequently the complaint has been put forward against the American trusts, that in order to curtail production and oversupply, they close their factories; thereby depriving thousands of people of the chance to work. Such complaints cannot be leveled against the majority of the European trusts. The custom in Europe is not to close any of the factories controlled by the trust, but to distribute production between the factories. Then every factory producing an article of particularly good quality, is permitted to employ only enough workers as may be needed to meet the demands of the market for that article. In this manner it is possible to keep in operation all the factories connected with the production.</p>
   <p>These trusts have not abolished overproduction, but they have lessened the evil; they have not put an end to strikes or solved all the labor questions, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>but they have, however, made some progress in the desired direction.</p>
   <p>The experiences of the European trusts emphasizes what has been learned in this country in regard to the advantages which may be gained by business combinations and co-operation. These foreign trusts, however, do not throw much light upon the question of the influence wielded by the trusts in regard to the work and the wages of the employees.</p>
   <p>The pay of the European factory worker is, as a rule, woefully small, and there has not been produced sufficient evidence to show that the wages have been either increased or decreased by the merging of thousands of businesses into a few hundred--each directed by a central executive staff.</p>
   <p>In Europe they are fully aware of the advantages gained from trusts. If the European trusts had been of derogatory influence instead of the opposite, if <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>they had produced evil instead of good, they would not have been tolerated; for the political leaders of the various countries, as well as the leading economists there, are making careful studies of their activities. There are robbers among the trusts--such as combinations holding more water than value. These are detrimental to society and should be destroyed. The world has nothing to fear, however, from an honest combination of capital; only where there is misuse of the power gained through combination, should the government step in to restrain the evildoers.</p>
