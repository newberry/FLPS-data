   <p>The Chicago Telephone Company will not get its franchise quite as easily as it seemed to think. The servants of the company had been working long and hard, and had prepared a proposal for a franchise with which the company, at least, had every reason to be satisfied. But the reception of the proposal by the press and among the people was not quite as favorable. It is quite safe to predict that this ordinance will not be adopted by the city council without very considerable changes.</p>
   <p>In the meanwhile, the Manufacturers' Association has renewed efforts to obtain a franchise. The association offers to deposit a considerable amount, $5,000,000, as security for complying with the obligations assumed if it obtains the franchise. This indicates that the association is ready to stand by its promises, that it intends to give to Chicago a good, <span class="page-break">2</span>up-to-date telephone system. Since the association consists of Chicago men, while the Chicago Telephone Company is owned mostly by Boston capitalists, there seems to be good reason for preferring the home company, especially since it offers conditions, which are far more advantageous to the telephone users, than those offered by the Chicago Telephone Company.</p>
