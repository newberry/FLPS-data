   <p>A recently published Tribune editorial speaks of the Norwegians as a Germanic race. That is undoubtedly true, but the people of Norway have not taken any pride in that relationship during the last thousand years. Traditionally the Germans are far from us, whereas the Norman-English stock is much nearer in our mind's eye. The German language is framed on the Latin order with a grammer heavy and involved. English is comparatively simple and is almost a twin brother to the Norwegian. A very large number of the common words and expressions are much alike in the two languages. Paul du Chaillu in his "Viking Age" says that in the seventh and eighth centuries the people living along the coast of the North Sea spoke tongues so closely related that they had little difficulty in understanding each other.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians sought to build a sea empire, as it were, about a thousand years ago and gave no attention to extending acquaintance with the Germans or Slavs <span class="page-break">2</span>of the interior. Iceland, the Orkney, the Faroe Islands, the Shetland Islands, the Hebrides, the shores of Great Britain, the Isle of Man, Anglesey at the South of Ireland, and finally Greenland in the far west, were settled wholly or in part by Norwegian-Danish vikings. The ethnological vision of Norway is toward its offspring in the west. The Germanic origin spoken of is no more to us Norwegians than it is to the Anglo-Saxon elements of Great Britain and Ireland. It is too remote to figure as any factor whatsoever in the Norwegian relations to the present World War. The Scandinavians generally look upon themselves as a maternal trunk line that does not start from or go by way of Middle Europe.</p>
   <p>About nine hundred years ago Norway, England, and Denmark were united for a brief period under one King, Canute the Great. We have never had any King or government together with Germany. For a thousand years and more we have looked upon Normandy, France as an emigrated Norway and our racial affections have flowed that way. When the Normans conquered England our <span class="page-break">3</span>ancestral spirit went along with that conquest, although the Normans then beat an army of English, Danes, and Norwegians under King Harold at the Battle of Hastings, and terminated forever the direct viking power in Great Britain.</p>
   <p>Our sympathies were with the French in the Franco-Prussian War, and we are with the French and British again in the present war, on plain racial grounds and sentiment, all other things being equal.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians in the United States are solidly with Uncle Sam on the ground of loyalty in addition to our racial alignments. The inexplicable conduct of Senator Gronna and the propaganda in our Lutheran Church and on the part of the Norwegian-American press have at no time made any inroads upon the historical learnings of seafaring Norway toward her kindred of Normandy and the British Isles. Here in Chicago the Norsemen joined as volunteers in the Civil War. Today our Norwegian youth are volunteering for service, just as fast as <span class="page-break">4</span>any other nationality.</p>
   <p>We say, let others talk and rave; we will show by deeds and acts whom we are with.</p>
