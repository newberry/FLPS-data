   <p>The cable car company, of Baron Yerkes, on Milwaukee Avenue is already so dilapidated that passengers find it a torture to ride the cars. In the winter there is no heat and, still worse, some of the cars are open. The south side company has proven that it can give better service, can give heated cars and can operate with fewer accidents. Baron Yerkes could do the same if he would spend just a fraction of the millions he has made.</p>
   <p>We will start a movement to force Charley Yerkes to give us better transportation. We were partly instrumental in causing changes to be made at the poorhouse, the county hospital, and at Dunning.</p>
