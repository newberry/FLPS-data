   <p>"I'll never go to a Norwegian social or meeting again," said a lady who with her husband and family recently moved to the Northwest Side." "Why, what's the matter," we asked. And then the lady told her grievance. It seems that when the baskets were sold at the party, the English language was used, but as soon as the business of "getting the money" was finished, and the crowd settled down to begin the social side of the party, group after group began to chatter in Norwegian and this lady could not understand a word of it.</p>
   <p>Some time ago, we induced a young man and his wife to attend the commercial club banquet at a downtown hotel, selling them tickets at a dollar each. Next morning, the young man came to us and said: "I'll never go to another Norwegian meeting of any kind," and he was angry about it. It seems that three men with <span class="page-break">\2</span>their wives had been grouped about this young couple at the end of the table, and all during the banquet the three couples chatted in Norwegian, heedless of the young couple and yet knowing perfectly well that they could not understand the foreign tongue.</p>
   <p>Is this right? We are living in America, and Americans should have first consideration. There are those who have accepted the privileges of leaving their native shores to take up their home in the United States. To our way of thinking, it is just as ill-mannered to speak a foreign language in a public meeting where all cannot understand, as it is to do anything else forbidden by the rules of good breeding. Then why is it done? Thoughtlessness, perhaps, or maybe carelessness. But isn't it high time that Norwegians begin to give more consideration to the English-speaking people, more now than ever before?</p>
   <p>We may honor our native country, think highly of our mother tongue, and prize the heritage given us from across the sea, but first of all we must show that <span class="page-break">\3</span>we have the good breeding that entitles one to entrance into everyday society. We trust that this editorial will come to the eyes of those who have been guilty of this breach of etiquette, and that they will take it to heart and reform. The Norwegian people, as a whole, are very polite and considerate. Let us show it on every occasion.</p>
