   <p>The vote in the House of Representatives on the Constitutional amendment giving Congress full power to deal with industrial combinations has revealed a new phase of the complex problem of trusts.</p>
   <p>Both parties were already on record as favoring legislation for the suppression of monopolistic combinations. Antitrust laws have been enacted in Republican as well as in Democratic states, and the various Democratic and Republican state platforms adopted in recent years have been pronounced in their hostility to the rapid growth of the trust movement. In 1890 a federal antitrust law was enacted by a Republican Congress and signed by a Republican President. Although this law was necessarily limited in its scope and faulty in some respects, the Democratic party failed to improve or strengthen it while it had the power to do so during President Cleveland's administration. Since then, however, it <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>has been trying to recoup itself by vigorous shouting and by claiming a monopoly on the antitrust sentiment. The solid front presented by the Democrats in Congress to the antitrust amendment will make it rather hard for Democrats to shout, and still harder for the average voter to believe in their sincerity.</p>
   <p>It is probable that both parties in Congress, in view of the impending national election, were apt to look at the trust question mainly from the political point of view, while the purely economic aspect of the problem was more or less disregarded. Mr. Richardson, the Democratic leader, charged his opponents with proposing the amendment merely for political effect and made a frantic and most undignified appeal to his party associates to oppose it because it was a "Republican measure". This, however, was only the political scum of a heated debate. The debate went to the bottom of the question from a Constitutional viewpoint and disclosed the opposing parties in their traditional positions: The Democrats stoutly opposing any enlargement of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>power of Congress as detrimental to the "sovereignty" of the states--and the Republicans ready to confer upon Congress such additional powers as the exigencies of existing conditions and the welfare of the people seemed to demand. The practical unanimity of each party shows that neither, as constituted at present, will or can recede from the position taken.</p>
   <p>The trust problem may possibly solve itself without any further interference by legislation. That is not at all probable, however. The people are likely to insist upon exhausting every means of legislation in their determination to arrest a development that threatens to destroy the present economic fabric of society and pave the way for a new society framed upon socialistic lines.</p>
   <p>But, according to the best legal opinion, they will find themselves handicapped at every turn. The power vested in the states is inadequate, even if all the states should agree upon a uniform law, which is a practical impossibility. The power vested in Congress is admittedly insufficient to enable it to cope with the question. Hence, unless the Federal Constitution can be amended, the power <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of the people to deal with trusts is practically exhausted. Upon this battle-ground the last and final contest of the political trust-war must be fought. The recent vote in Congress has foreshadowed the battle lines of the opposing parties and also the strategic objective of the forces opposed to trusts. The solid opposition of the Democratic party to a sufficiently broad antitrust Constitutional amendment will make it necessary for the people not only to keep the Republicans in power, but also to give the Republican party a two-thirds majority in each branch of Congress.</p>
   <p>This is a stupendous task which may not be attempted for some time. But if the trust question is to remain before the people as a dominating issue of politics, public thought and action will, sooner or later, be determined by the new phase of the problem.</p>
