   <p>Attorney Charles M. Hardy....presented a remarkable statement in his speech of defense in court last Friday.</p>
   <p>"....Jury bribery," he said, "is taking place right along in Cook County. I do not know whether the corporations have formed a trust for the purpose of perpetrating this crime, but it looks that way. I do not believe that there is a single railroad or streetcar company, having cases here in court, which does not bribe or try to bribe juries. A lawyer risks his reputation when he works for these companies."</p>
   <p>If Mr. Hardy is right -- and there is reason to believe that he is well informed--the jury system in Cook County is rotten to the core. "All the corporations bribe juries or try to do so." This is spoken of as an everyday occurrence -- a situation with which everybody is familiar.</p>

   <p>The greatest danger that threatens our society is the disdain of the powerful corporations for law and justice. The people cannot and will not, in the long run, stand for the bartering of justice for money. If the great corporations cannot or will not obey the laws of this country, the people will be compelled to put on the thumb screws even though the end were to be that the government be compelled to go further in its control of semi-public companies than most of us wish at this time. If companies which are supposed to be the servants of the people attempt to dictate the laws of the land and the judgments in court, then it becomes clear to anybody that danger is lurking. The practical question is, will the people act forcefully, prudently, and moderately before it becomes too late?</p>
