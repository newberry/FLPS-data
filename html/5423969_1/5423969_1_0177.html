   <p>The following decisions were made at the annual meeting of the Norwegian Lutheran Church:</p>
   <p>1. The annual average attendance in high school courses which are accredited by the Board of Education of the Norwegian Lutheran Church shall form the basis of the classification. The Board may also to some extent consider attendance in other courses.</p>
   <p>2. Academies having an annual average attendance of 150 pupils or more shall constitute the first class.</p>
   <p>3. Academies with attendance of 120 to 149 pupils shall form the second class.</p>
   <p>4. Academies with 90 to 119 pupils shall comprise the third class.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>5. Academies with less than 90 pupils shall comprise the fourth class.</p>
   <p>6. When academies of the first class meet the requirements of the Norwegian Lutheran Church, they shall receive an annual appropriation of $2,000 each.</p>
   <p>7. Academies of the second class shall, on the same terms, receive an annual appropriation of $1,500 each.</p>
   <p>8. Academies of the third class shall annually receive $1,000.</p>
   <p>9. Academies of the fourth class shall annually receive $500 as heretofore.</p>
   <p>10. The board of education shall have the authority to ratify the standard academic course of each school, but not other courses.</p>
   <p>11. The Board shall have the power to ratify the assignment of work <span class="page-break">\3</span>to the teachers of the standard course.</p>
   <p>12. The principals and the teachers in the standard course shall have the bachelor's degree from a college or university of recognized standing. The Board may in exceptional cases grant exemptions from this requirement. This paragraph shall not apply to principals and teachers now in service.</p>
   <p>13. The principals should not teach more than twenty periods a week.</p>
   <p>14. The teachers of the standard course shall not teach more than thirty periods a week.</p>
   <p>15. The Board shall have the authority to ratify the election of the principals of all academies.</p>
   <p>16. Academies of the first, second, and third class shall be required to give four-year courses of high school studies for training teachers of <span class="page-break">\4</span>religion and Norwegian. Only pupils who have completed the work of the eight grades shall be admitted to this course.</p>
   <p>Academies of the fourth class are earnestly requested to give this course if their teaching force and resources permit.</p>
   <p>17. The Board recommends that, where it is found advisable, the academies establish normal departments for training public school teachers. Such departments should meet the standards fixed for high normal school departments by the state authorities, or, where there are no public normal departments, by the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>18. The Board recommends that the principals of the academies of the first class receive a salary of at least $1,800 per year, principals of the second class, $1,600, those of the third class, $1,400, and those of the fourth class, $1,200.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>19. The teachers of the standard high school course should be paid not less than $800 per year.</p>
   <p>20. The academies should endeavor to secure first-class principals and one or two other permanent teachers with excellent training and approved ability.</p>
   <p>21. In view of the fact that a majority of our academies are at present charging $45 per year tuition in the standard academic course, and some small fees in addition, the Board recommends that, as far as possible, all small fees be abolished and that our academies establish the uniform rate of $50 for tuition in the academic course. It is further recommended that schools having about $45 as the present rate, increase it to $50 for 1918 and 1919, and that schools which have a tuition of $36 per year require $43 for 1918 and 1919 and $50 for 1919 and 1920.</p>
   <p>22. Since about ten of our academies are charging $36 and $50.00 per year for rent, light, and heat, the Board recommends that all our schools <span class="page-break">\6</span>charge at least $36 for ordinary rooms and $50 for first-class accommodations. Lower rates should be allowed in poor buildings or in localities where rooms are very cheap.</p>
   <p>[Translators note: There are several academies in the Illinois (Chicago) district. The above applies to all academies and normal schools in this district.]</p>
