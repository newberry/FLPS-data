   <p>Sugar speculators blandly predict that sugar will retail for thirty cents per pound or more when the canning season opens. Conservative wholesalers say that the retail price will reach or exceed fifty cents per pound before it closes. One billion pounds of sugar have recently been exported from these shores to Great Britian in addition to the millions of pounds shipped abroad during recent weeks or months, says a current news report. The Government owes it to itself and to the American people to declare at once an embargo on sugar and seize immediately every stock of this commodity in the United States for distribution to the consumer at cost.</p>
   <p>Because a government that is sworn to protect its people permits this robbery and puts no curb upon it, this profit-taking campaign and canning-time hike <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the speculators and profiteers in sugar now surpasses in bareface nationwide grand larceny any brutal and impudent demand yet made on this long suffering and outraged nation.</p>
   <p>The American colonies went to war against George III for much less when they dumped his taxed tea in Boston harbor and defied him. Are we now to permit a few score of reckless and greedy exploiters to victimize the American people at will?</p>
