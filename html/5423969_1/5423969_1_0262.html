   <p>Members and friends of the Tordenskjold Lodge, I. O. G. T., gathered last Thursday at Bowes Hall, Erie and Noble Streets, to start the new year with a pleasant festival. The ladies had decorated the Hall which was quite well filled when Mr. Hans A. Stensland, as the chairman of the committee, opened the festival.</p>
   <p>A very good program had been provided. First there was a piano solo by Miss Olga Olsen, then a violin solo by Mr. Neeb. Miss Edna Nelson gave a reading accompanied on the piano by Olga Olsen. Ryvingen, the most lately organized male chorus among members of the Norwegian temperance groups, appeared in public for the first time, under the leadership of Mr. Neeb. The chorus holds good voices, but it needs more practice. Miss Harriet Mork gave some Norwegian ditties and folk songs which were greeted with applause. Mr. A. Edison spoke about the work among the children. Finally the ladies of the Lodge served refreshments, after which some games were played. All agreed that the social had been a success.</p>
