   <p>A new Norwegian Good Templar lodge has been organized on the South Side by Henry Weardahl. Because most of the members come from Farsund, Norway, the lodge has been given the name "Lindenaes". It is to be hoped that the new society will be successful, since the South Side has hitherto had no Good Templar lodge.</p>
