   <p>The Norwegian Lawyers and the Chicago Bar Association desire to enlist your co-operation in the election on Monday, June 4, of seven judges of the superior court of Cook County.</p>
   <p>The Democratic column will have to be blank. The Republican column will be filled with your Republicans and three Democrats--selected by Republican and Democratic bosses. They have determined to appoint our judges.</p>
   <p>You are aware that certain political bosses, together with the bosses of organized crime, constitute the invisible power which holds Chicago and Cook County in its sinister grip.</p>
   <p>We are calling upon all patriotic Norwegian citizens to unite in the present effort to dispose of and destroy this power. Scandia has, to a marked degree, the confidence of a large group of patriotic Norwegian-Americans. We ask that <span class="page-break">\2</span>you urge them to use their might in support of this significant movement.</p>
   <p>In order to give opportunity to voters who do not wish to have their judges appointed by bosses affiliated with organized crime, we have undertaken to present a nonpartisan ticket. Securing the signatures of over 17,000 voters, it has presented a ticket which will appear on the ballot under the heading "Chicago Bar Association Nonpartisan". The candidates are:</p>
   <p>Howard W. Hayes, Daniel P. Trude, Charles Center Case, and (to fill vacancy), James J. Balbour.</p>
   <p>Three other candidates who are sitting judges, and whose terms of office as superior court judges are expiring, have been approved by the vote of the Bar Association for re-election. They are Walter P. Steffen, Martin M. Guidley, and Joseph Sabath. Their names will appear on the ballot in the Republican column.</p>
   <p>The Association's only interest in supporting its ticket lies in its desire to <span class="page-break">\3</span>obtain the proper administration of justice. It has heretofore sought to induce the leaders of both political parties to nominate suitable men for the bench.</p>
   <p>In nearly every judicial election for many years one or more candidates deemed by the Bar Association unfit have been nominated by the party bosses and one or more honest and eminently able judges, whom the Bar Association deemed worthy of re-election have been refused nomination, and the voters have been denied the right to re-elect them.</p>
   <p>In the present instance, the Bar Association tried and failed to induce the political leaders to nominate the candidates it recomends. It has now undertaken, for the first time, to present its own ticket on the ballot.</p>
   <p>How the political bosses choose or reject candidates is not publicly known. The Bar Association chooses its candidates openly by vote of its 4,000 members. The candidates are first examined by a committee consisting of <span class="page-break">\4</span>fifteen of its former presidents. Each candidate is given opportunity to appear before the committee. The recommendations of this committee are submitted to the membership of the Association in a printed report. It then takes a secret ballot, at which 4, 000 members--a large majority of all the reputable practicing lawyers of Cook County--have the right to vote. The candidates thus selected, not by any bosses or by any committee, but by the members of the Association, are recommended to the voters.</p>
   <p>The question for the voters is, will the public interest be served by voting the ticket presented by the party bosses or by voting the ticket selected by the lawyers who know the men they endorse, and know them to be honest and competent.</p>
   <p>Patriotic Norwegian-American citizens who are jealous of the good name of their city should unite on June 4, as they did at the last primary election, and overthrow that invisible power which seeks to dominate our judiciary and defeat the administation of justice. We invite your influential paper and its readers <span class="page-break">\5</span>to join us in this movement to destroy the supremacy of the bosses and establish the supremacy of the law.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Bar Association,</p>
   <p>and outstanding Norwegian Attorneys.</p>
