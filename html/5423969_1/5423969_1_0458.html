   <p>p.4. Chicago is, at the present time, being honored by visits by the country's most prominent governmental figures. The greatest of these is President Wm. H. Taft, who is making the La Salle his Chicago home and temporary capitol. About twelve congressmen are also in the city in connection with investigation of the famous Lorimer case.</p>
   <p>Last night the president led the polonaise at the Irish ball in the La Salle ball-room. Incidentally, we recall that on his last visit to Chicago he was the honor guest at the Irishmen's St Patricks Day banquet. It seems that the Irish have monopolized our president or that he imagines all Chicago is Irish; or it might be that we of other nationalities are beneath his notice. On Monday President Taft will officiate at the laying of the cornerstone of the Hamilton Club's new building on Dearborn Street.</p>
