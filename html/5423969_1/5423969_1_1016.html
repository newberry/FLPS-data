   <p>Alderman Adolph Larson spoke for the Norwegian Republican Club in which he explained the necessity for all newcomers to apply for Citizenship and also the necessity of voting after they receive their papers. He explained that it was a good citizen's duty to vote and to try to help the best man into office. We should also learn to love our new country. Our nationality has a high reputation here, no one need be ashamed of coming from Norway. This club is an excellent aid for its young members; they have clean politics and clean citizenship and loyalty.</p>
