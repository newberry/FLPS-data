   <p>Politicians and newspapers are wont to complain of the nationality issue in our politics. If an adopted citizen seeks a public office and receives strong support from the voters of his nationality, his candidacy and following are branded as clannish, un-American, etc.</p>
   <p>Improper appeals to the sentiment of nationality are occasionally made in many parts of the country, but this is not primarily the fault of our adopted citizens. Their ambition is to become good Americans. They are proud of their American citizenship and endeavor to fulfill their duties as citizens to the best of their ability. They may make mistakes, but they are honest and upright and conscious of their responsibilities and have amply demonstrated that they are worthy of the franchise. A comparative study of the local political history of the northwest will disclose the fact that public affairs have been managed as economically and as well by our adopted citizens as by the native born, and in many instances better.</p>
   <p>Then, some fine day, along comes a native-born politician in need of votes. He will address a gathering of adopted citizens, not as Americans, but as Germans, Irish, Scandinavians, Frenchmen, etc., as the case may be, feeding nationality-taffy to them with a lavish hand, and soliciting their support not as Americans, but as foreigners.</p>
   <p>And right there we have the origin of the "foreign vote". The adopted citizen did not know that he was a "foreigner" in politics until he was taught the lesson by native-born politicians, demagogues, schemers, trimmers, and designing manipulators. They probably did not foresee that by rubbing their political Aladdin's lamp they called to their aid a spirit that some day might get beyond their control. That, however, is precisely what has happened , for example in Chicago. The undue and dangerous influence acquired by certain nationalities in the politics of this city is but the inevitable result of cowardly and discreditable scheming on the part of leading American politicians. They will confess as much in private and whine about "the ruling race," etc. But they find themselves unable to break away from the policy and precedents they have established, and are compelled to keep on as they have begun.</p>
   <p>To illustrate: during the last municipal campaign a particularly offensive appeal to the supposed prejudices of an audience was made by Mayor Harrison in a speech in the Twenty-third Ward. Addressing a meeting of Swedes, he advised the Swedes not to vote for Alderman Olson because Mr. Olson is a Norwegian. Mr. Harrison evidently thinks that because Sweden and Norway honestly disagree upon certain questions, Swedes and Norwegians, even when they have become citizens of this country, are bound to be enemies. This error is to some extent excusable in people who are not particularly well versed in foreign affairs, and Mr. Harrison is in the same boat with many other gentlemen who wear good clothes. But his lack of information upon this point does not excuse his demagogical catering to the basic instincts of his audience. Even if he intended to say to the Swedes of the Ward that they ought not vote for Alderman Olson in the belief that he is a Swede, since he is a Norwegian, the Mayor would have been guilty of gross impropriety inasmuch as this would have been tantamount to saying that if Mr. Olson had been a Swede the Swedes ought to have voted for him on account of his nationality. The "foreign vote" will disappear when the native-born politicians come to understand that our adopted citizens are Americans and should be treated as such, but not before. Until then the "foreign vote" will remain to plague them.</p>
