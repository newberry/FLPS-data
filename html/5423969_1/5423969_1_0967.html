   <p>Skandinaven repeats that we all know that Carter Harrison will be elected as mayor, but we repeat - do not forget that other men are going to be elected as aldermen, etc. Our advice is to split your vote. Pick the best, cleanest and the most honorable man, regardless of party. Be a good citizen on election day and vote right.</p>
