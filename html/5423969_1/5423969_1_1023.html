   <p>The Scandinavian American Club of the 15th Ward has now over three hundred members. It was started March 12, 1903. It is the club's intention to try to gather all the Republican Scandinavians in the 15th Ward together and thereby to strengthen their voting power.</p>
   <p>The club has a Naturalization committee and aided over one hundred persons in securing their citizenship papers. The club's president, P. H. Peterson is fighting very hard to get a league started for Scandinavians in the 15, 16, 17, 26, 27, and 28 Wards on the northwest side.</p>
