   <p>The political disagreements and the consequent misunderstandings and strife which temporarily may spring up between neighbor peoples in the old world, should not be transplanted needlessly to their representatives on this side of the Atlantic. We may and we must have our sympathies, but these should be curbed as soon as they threaten to lead us beyond the limits of friendly rivalry and honorable competition. Here we are primarily Americans, and only secondarily and traditionally, Swedes and Norwegians.</p>
   <p>Sweden and Norway have lived in peace together as separate and independent kingdoms but with a common king for three quarters of a century,and, as we believe, with mutual advantage. That a relationship so unusual should be fully comprehended in both countries from the beginning, could not be expected. Questions have arisen which have put to test the sagacity of the statesman, as well as the intelligence, patience and good temper of the masses. Such questions <span class="page-break">2</span>are now agitating our kinsfolk beyond the seas, and we can hardly expect that they will all be settled in this generation. Their final adjustment, however, will certainly not be accelerated by stirring up strife or enmity between Swedes and Norwegians in this country.</p>
   <p>This is unfortunately the natural tendency, and, as it would seem, the direct aim of Mr. Robert Lindblom in his recent statements in The Press in this city and in his reply to criticisms in The North, a Minneapolis newspaper.</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven has already with sufficient severity characterized both the animus and the inaccuracies of Mr. Lindblom's effusion (in the foreign edition). We do not care to rehash these things for the edification of our own readers, nor do we wish to pursue Mr. Lindblom with any spirit of vindictiveness or revenge. The occasion does not call for it; indeed, we think his frivolous remarks have received too much attention already. But we do not desire that anyone who may have read them should suppose that they had remained unchallenged, and therefore accept them as a correct exposition of the relations between two peoples. We <span class="page-break">3</span>recognize in Mr. Lindblom a man of great energy and no inconsiderable native talent. These endowments he may put to much better use than his public statements both in addresses and in the press recently would indicate. His statements in regard to Norway--that her "politicians are trying with all their might to foster hatred towards their political superiors"--that they are "striving to gain political independence"--and that "experience shows Norway incapable of self-government"--are so malicious and false as to merit nothing but contempt. If Mr. L. had been familiar with the expressed sentiments of the sober-minded and well-informed men in his native country, he would have avoided this public display of his folly. The fact that the Scandinavian peninsula has enjoyed external peace since 1814, should be the sole and sufficient proof that Sweden forever must control the foreign policy of Norway, is another example of the political and economic wisdom of Mr. Lindblom.</p>
   <p>This new statesman seems to be unaware that in the national developments of today, there are other factors to be taken into account than the movements of <span class="page-break">4</span>armies and navies. That Mr. L. finally characterizes Bjornson as a "political mountebank whose failure as a poet has compelled him to seek other fields of action," that he is "in the pay of Russia" trying to excite hatred towards Sweden, and that both Bjornson and Ibsen are together trying to work themselves into passion and prominence by talking revolution, liberty and separation--are statements so sublimely ridiculous that anyone who is awake must attribute them to the disturbed dreams of one who has just made a disastrous plunge on the Board of Trade. But when he boastfully talks about the possibility of Sweden finding it necessary to administer "another spanking", the boyishness of the whole performance is so apparent that it is impossible to treat it with anything but amused forbearance. Who is it that is trying to "work himself into passion and prominence"? Where are we to look for "other fields of action"? It has given us pleasure to learn that Mr. Lindblom has made successful plunges on the Board of Trade and that he has come out of some of them covered with glory and gold, but from present indications, we are afraid that he will emerge from his plunges into journalism covered with a much less lustrous coating. If we are correctly informed, The Press is to be Mr. Lindblom's personal organ.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>We would respectfully warn Mr. L. that in his present state of mind, it may prove as dangerous for him to toy with a newspaper as for a child to play with edged tools. Before he again ventures upon these international, political and historical themes, we commend him to the sound and dispassionate instructions of the editor of The North. We entertain nothing but feelings of friendship and respect for our brothers the Swedes, both in their native land and in this country, and we are sure that nothing Mr. Lindblom may say, or that may be said in criticism, will in any way disturb that amicable relationship and mutual good will which does, and forever should,bind the two peoples together in indissoluble union on both sides of the waters.</p>
