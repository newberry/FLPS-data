   <p>On or about May 15, the press published biographies of four candidates running for the Republican nomination for office. The article, it is understood, was written by Joe Mannix in the interest of John Reese, who, like Mannix, is of Irish descent. Among the four candidates "written up," was the present assistant county attorney, James A. Petersen. The biographer took great pains to state the nationality of Mr. Petersen's parents, but had nothing to say about the nationality of the parents of the other three candidates.</p>
   <p>This insidious discrimination called forth the following letter signed by "Nils":</p>
   <p>"Why is it that when you write about [political candidates], you always differentiate between men of different nationalities; and between men in office, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>those 'running for office'? Why is it that when [the candidate] is a Scandinavian, you mention his nationality? Although [this reference] is, of course well-intentioned and appreciated--since we Scandinavians are rather proud of our respective mother countries--why do you omit [making references to the nationality of the candidates] when you speak of men of Irish descent? I never saw you allude to the fact that William Henry is of Irish descent, even when you reported that he was dining with the Lord Mayor of Dublin. Moreover, in your recent survey of the candidates, why did you not give Brother Reese credit for his Irish nationality to offset the fact that Petersen (the only one whose nationality you do mention) had opened his office on Washington Avenue in 1887, thereby getting a two-year head start on Reese? If any of the other candidates of Irish descent or parentage are too modest to permit their nationality to be mentioned, you should have stated this fact.</p>
   <p>I wish to beg the pardon of the editors, but I insist that the Times is principally to blame."</p>
   <p>Thereupon the Times replied as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"The complaint against the distinction made among the foreign nationalities can probably be accounted for by the facts that the Scandinavians are numerically the largest [foreign nationality], that they hold the balance of power between the two parties, and that they vote as a [national] bloc on political questions, although there are indications that they are out-growing this narrow attitude."</p>
   <p>As the reader will observe, the Times admits that it is discriminating against the Scandinavians, and tells its readers why it has taken this stand. "They are numerically the strongest and hold the balance of power between the two parties" says the Times--hence candidates for office with Scandinavian blood in their veins should not have a fair deal. Another reason for discriminating against Scandinavians is that they tenaciously "cling together in politics".</p>
   <p>This certainly is [a good example of] "minority representation" and "minority rule" with a vengeance. The weaker a group is, the stronger is its claim to public offices--that is the logic of the Times. Our contemporary [i.e., the Times] should scold the Irish group, because, up-to-date, it has not furnished <span class="page-break">\4</span>more than three candidates for offices this year--Armstrong Taylor for probate judge, John Reese for county attorney, and John Steele for district judge, all gentlemen whose parents were born in Ireland. The Irish are certainly weak enough in the county, numerically speaking, to be entitled to more offices, according to the logic of the Times.</p>
   <p>The assertion that the Scandinavians "cling together in politics" is false, and, we believe, insincere. If any one doubt this statement let him turn to the columns of the Times. No newspaper has been more persistent [than the Times] in proclaiming that the Scandinavians, particularly the Norwegians, are altogether too broad-gauged and too thoroughly Americanized to support men of their own blood who are not fit to hold office--e.g., such men as Senator Knute Nelson. Generally speaking, this is true. In Minnesota and the Dakotas, the Scandinavians are probably more thoroughly divided along party lines than any other nationality. Nor is this division quite so unequal as that of the Irish, who furnish all parties with a liberal supply of office-seekers, while they give the Democratic Party the benefit of all their votes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>To make James A. Petersen a butt of this sort of narrow prejudice is rank injustice, and, moreover, utterly absurd.</p>
   <p>Pray, who is a true American, if he [Petersen] is not one? His parents were naturalized citizens for twelve years when he was born on their homestead in Wisconsin. He grew up on the farm, and received his education in the public schools, graduating from the law department of the university at Madison. He has always been a member of the "so-called 'American' church". He is intensely devoted to his country, and exultingly proud of its achievements and grand destiny. His American citizenship is his platform, and his claims to consideration rest exclusivly upon whatever ability and integrity he may possess. What more is required to constitute true Americanism? Can it be that a knowledge of foreign tongues has come to be considered an un-American trait? Are blue eyes to be tabooed in conventions, or is a genuine white man to be excluded from the Republican ticket?</p>
   <p>Mr. Petersen has been sternly relentless and exceptionally successful in meting out justice to rascals, not excepting those born in the native country <span class="page-break">\6</span>of his parents--even if they happened to have a pretty strong "American pull". Is this trait un-American if found in a prosecuting attorney?</p>
   <p>The nationality issue has no place in politics. John Steele is a good American, even if his parents do come from Ireland. John Reese is a "bright boy," and may properly covet the county attorneyship, but not as an Irishman. James A. Petersen is an American, and should be permitted to run as such.</p>
   <p>His claims to the office, we believe, are the strongest. As the first assistant to the present attorney he has shown himself to be thoroughly competent, fearless and absolutely incorruptible. That is the kind of a county attorney a very large majority of the people want; and, if precedent is followed and justice done, he will undoubtedly receive the nomination.</p>
   <p>We all know that "shuffling politicians" use the nationality issue for selfish ends. But the press should take a different attitude, and frown upon every <span class="page-break">\7</span>sneaking effort of this kind, instead of pandering to narrow prejudices. The Skandinaven believes that every responsible contemporary [newspaper] takes the same view, and it expects the Times to repair the injustice it has done to James A. Petersen and to disavow its flimsy pretext for discriminating against citizens of Norse blood.</p>
