   <p>Labor and political demonstrations are becoming quite a fad today. Some of the demonstrations held here lately have been instrumental in winning a great number of issues for labor.</p>
   <p>The Knights of Labor have been the leaders in most of the major demonstrations. They have come to the front especially for the building trades, the bakers, and the cable and horse car unions.</p>
   <p>The recent strike at the Pullman Palace Car Company was successfully led and won by the Knights of Labor. Many of the so-called "assemblies" are officered by prominent Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>Tonight, at 8 P.M., a mass meeting will be held in Battery "D" Armory. A call has been sent out to all labor and fraternal organizations to attend this meeting. Many prominent speakers will be present, and the burning <span class="page-break">2</span>issues of interest to labor will be on the agenda.</p>
   <p>We believe that these militant demonstrations and mass meetings will win many issues, and at the same time pave the way for a broad, unified labor movement.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian Typographical Union has been very active recently, and some very radical resolutions have been presented by the Danish members of the union.</p>
