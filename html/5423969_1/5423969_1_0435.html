   <p>The Scandinavians have contributed much to Chicago culturally and politically. Since the founding of the city, [our people]have held a great number of political offices, both city and county.</p>
   <p>There are seven newspapers in the Scandinavian community, and twelve churches. In business we are well represented, many owning quite large enterprises. In banking we have also been represented, but due to the panic, some of these banks have closed their doors.</p>
   <p>Carl Dreier, the Dane, is connected with the International Bank, and is one of the main stockholders.</p>
