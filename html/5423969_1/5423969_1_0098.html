   <p>The National Educational Association fittingly closed its thirty-seventh annual convention with a timely and ringing protest against political meddling with our public schools. A declaration adopted by fifteen thousand teachers attending the convention says in part:</p>
   <p>"The integrity of our educational system can only be threatened by ignorance and by political corruption. A sound and intelligent public opinion must be, in the future, as it has been in the past, the support of every movement to elevate the ideals and to strengthen the efficiency of our schools, public and private, higher and elementary, general and special. To labor unceasingly to produce such a public opinion is a main duty of the teaching profession, and to stimulate and instruct it, a leading purpose of our <span class="page-break">\2</span>professional gathering.</p>
   <p>"We ask our fellow citizens to give heed to the needs of our educational system, to protect and develop it, and particularly to guard it from damage through parsimony and political chicanery. The suffering and loss so inflicted fall not chiefly upon the teachers or upon the citizens themselves, but upon the nation's children, who are in due time to assume the responsibility for the preservation of our institutions. To limit their opportunities for a sound education is to strike a deadly blow at the republic itself.</p>
   <p>"We deplore and resent the tendency manifest alike in cities and in rural districts to treat the public school service as political spoils, and to attack the reputation and professional standing of teachers and superintendents for political reasons alone. Political preference and religious faith have no place in estimating professional efficiency, and we demand that the selection, promotion, and displacement of school officers and teachers be made on professional <span class="page-break">\3</span>grounds alone."</p>
   <p>This emphatic enunciation embodying the correct and sound principles of school management appeals with special force to the people of Chicago at the present juncture. Our schools are threatened by a corrupt political combine: our public school service is treated as political spoils; the superintendent of our schools has been made a victim of political chicanery and has been removed for political reasons alone.</p>
   <p>The Harrison-Thornton campaign against our public schools was known in all its despicable details to the teachers of the convention and justly aroused their indignation. A ranker treatment of the school service as political spoils probably never came to the notice of the educational association, and the assembled teachers' spontaneous resentment of this outrage found a fitting expression in their timely declaration.</p>
