   <p>The Norwegian Republican Club of the 28th Ward will have its yearly Smoker at 876 Artesian Avenue next Thursday at 8:00 A.M. Chief Judge Harry Olson will give a lecture on the new methods of jurisprudence in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Judge Olson is very prominent as a judge. Judge Oscar Tarrison, Alderman Walter Raymer, Dr. A. Doe, Alderman Adolph Larson, and Attorney Olaf Ray will all attend the meeting for the sole purpose of working harder among the voters in the ward and to work for barmony; so that we will all vote for the right party at election time. We want to be recognized not as the tail and but as the leaders of the party.</p>
