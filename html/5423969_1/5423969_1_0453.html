   <p>One of our readers informs us that the Singer's League has made a serious blunder. He writes, "I have always thought that the aim of the Singer's League was to preserve Norwegian culture, especially Norwegian songs. One begins to doubt this when one sees how disinterested the League was when it was given the opportunity to demonstrate the excellence of our Norwegian music before a typical American audience.</p>
   <p>The management of the Agricultural Exhibit invited the League to take part in the exhibit. The invitation was read at the meeting of the League, and after an exceedingly careless discussion there was only one singer (one of Bjorvin's members) who spoke favorably of the proposition, so that the invitation was declined as the other speakers considered the exhibit a humbug. Can you beat that one?</p>

   <p>Aside from the opportunity to advertise our Norwegian songs, there was lost sight of the fact that the exhibit management always remunerates generously all organizations who contribute to their entertainment, and such a remuneration at this time would not come amiss in view of the proposed tour of Norway in 1914.</p>
   <p>"Our Norwegian singers stayed at home while the Germans accepted and turned out with a chorus of 500 voices, an honor to themselves and to their fatherland, plus a nice donation of cash."</p>
