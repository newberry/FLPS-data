   <p>The Scandinavian Naturalization Clubs advise all the Scandinavians to vote as a bloc at the next local election. Wards 14, 15, 16, and 17 can be controlled by the Scandinavians. We showed that at the last mayoralty election.</p>
   <p>The meeting will take place at the Scandia Hall next Wednesday evening. We expect a large audience.</p>
