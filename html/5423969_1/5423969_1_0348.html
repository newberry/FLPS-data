   <p>Charles F. S. Colomb, a young clerk, has been arrested and charged with embezzling $5,000 from his employers. He is only twenty-three years old, and was married recently. He came to Chicago from New Orleans. The cause of his downfall was betting on the races.</p>
   <p>In these few words a human tragedy of crime, dishonor, and sorrow, enacted in our great city, is revealed. Who cares? If the young man went wrong he has only himself to blame. There are plenty of other young men to take his place. It is bad for the young wife whose life has been ruined on the threshold of her happiness; but she must be responsible for her choice of a husband. And the parents--but that is none of our business. The reader, who is in a hurry, skims down the column, and the sad fate of the couple is forgotten.</p>

   <p>But the next day his paper may bring a similar tale; for, alas, such tragedies are of frequent occurrence. A continuous train of embezzlers is winding its way through our police stations and courtrooms. It is only an occasional glimpse of this melancholy procession that is caught by the eye of the newspaper reader. When a victim of evil passions takes his own life, or when a case of wrongdoing presents some other unusual feature, there is a piece of "good news" that must be dressed up to attract attention. But the majority of the cases pass unobserved by the public.</p>
   <p>People in a position to know agree that betting on the races is, in most instances, the cause of the downfall of young men. No form of gambling is more seductive or dangerous. It appeals to the traditional interest of most people in splendid horses; it is encouraged by the examples of leading men whose betting and winnings are chronicled by the press; it attracts the poor with the rich; the clerk and the mechanic; the worker and the small businessman is invited to stake his small earnings, as the rich is afforded an opportunity to risk his fortune. And thousands upon thousands yield to this apparently <span class="page-break">3</span>innocent temptation. How many seal their fate by so doing, we do not know; but we do know that a large number of men--and women, too--lose their moral footing the moment they enter the race track as betters. Their downward course may be more or less swift, but the end is terribly certain. Controlled by his passion, the honest man turns thief and is often gradually drawn into greater crimes. A moral wreck himself, he wrecks the happiness of his family and leaves them to shift for themselves as best they can. He is worse than lost to society and to himself.</p>
   <p>And who are the beneficiaries? Those who operate the tracks and pocket his earnings and stealings. Many of them occupy leading positions in the financial and business world--shining lights of society, and "model citizens". It is written: "Thou shalt not lead into temptation". They are apparently exempt from this injunction. But the blood of countless victims of the passion of gambling is upon their hands.</p>
   <p>And what are the people doing about it? They elect and re-elect public officers <span class="page-break">4</span>who traffic in the ruin of young men by exacting a share of the spoils of the race track.</p>
   <p>O! the pity and infamy of it all! This thing must be stopped, and stopped now.</p>
