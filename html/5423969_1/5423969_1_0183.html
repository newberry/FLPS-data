   <p>The festival celebrating the fortieth anniversary of St. Olaf College has been in progress for a week and will probably last for several more days. On Saturday a special concert was arranged by the St. Olaf Band. Saturday evening the literary societies met to formulate a program for the new school year.</p>
   <p>St. Olaf College was opened on November 6, 1874. The purpose was to establish a Christian college for young Norwegian men and women. During the first year the College enrolled 39 students, 29 men and 10 women. Most of the students did not speak English, so an English class was set up. In those days the expenses were small: board, outside the school, cost only $2.25 per week.</p>
   <p>The first building was an old fashioned frame house, but in 1877 a new building was begun. The new building cost $13,500 and was dedicated in the fall of 1878. Up to 1886, the school was only an academy, but in that year it became a college. Reverend J. N. Kildahl, of Chicago, was elected president of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>St. Olaf in 1899. The College began with only one course, a study of the classics. In 1900 a scientific course was introduced, and in 1906 a literary course was set up.</p>
   <p>The College has seven buildings and a campus covering approximately 136 acres. [Descriptions of buildings omitted in translation.] At present the College has 527 students, 416 of whom are in the college division. In 1891 there were 3 graduates; in 1914 there were 60.</p>
