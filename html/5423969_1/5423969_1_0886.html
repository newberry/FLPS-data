   <p>The attempted assassination of Theo. Roosevelt last Monday, at Milwaukee, has caused the whole country to be thoroughly wrought up. Tactics such as this, we in the U. S. associate with darkest Russia, but when they are resorted to in our own country, the land of freedom, we wonder whether the masses in any land are ripe for this freedom. Regardless of our own political views, whether we agree with Roosevelt or not, none of us has neither the legal nor the moral right to dispose of him by murder.</p>
   <p>According to reports, Mr. Roosevelt's injury will in no way halt or slow down either his campaign or his personal activity, and, agree with him or not, we feel that one with his ability, courage, and clear thinking will live to cut many a Gordian knot which all others have failed to overcome.</p>
