   <p>The executive committee of the Dovre Club met last Friday at the Norwegian Club in order to discuss certain candidates in the coming election. Birger Osland presided.</p>
   <p>After a long discussion the executive committee approved the following resolutions:</p>
   <p>"The executive committee recommends that the members of Dovre Club cast their votes for all the candidates backed by the Lowden-Deneen-Brundage faction of the Republican party. The committee strongly condemns the candidates of the Lundin-Thompson political organization.</p>
   <p>"The Committee also recommends that the members of the Club support Niels Juul [Dane] for Congress. Niels Juul is recommended because of his past record. As an example of what may be expected from the Swede, Lundin, attention is called to the case of Thomas Pihlfeld, who was fired after thirty years of excellent service,"</p>
   <p>The members of the executive committee of the Dovre Club are: Peder Cederstrom, chairman; Oscar M. Lumby, secretary; Edvard Savre, H. L. Oftedahl, Carl Bauer, B. D. Borgerson, J. M. Pedersen, Henry Erland, Andrew Hummeland, O. Gullickson, John P. Hovland; and Henry Tolzien.</p>
   <p>The board consists of: Birger Osland, president; Ole Gullickson, first vice-president; H. N. Stoltenberg, second vice-president; T. A. S. Queland, third vice-president; Albert Petersen, secretary; John A. Melum, treasurer; and Ole Rinnan, sergeant at arms.</p>
