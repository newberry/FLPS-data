   <p>The majority of the world's countries have at some time or other been characterized and publicized by some special national food: Italy has been identified with spaghetti; Switzerland, with cheese; Russia, with caviar; etc., but there is one food whose popularity has grown astonishingly through its coupling with the name of the country where it originated: Norway's own "Lutefisk." Nor is the consumption of lutefisk confined to the Norwegian people: German, the Irish, and the Yankee are all becoming lutefisk conscious and lutefisk consumers.</p>
   <p>The name Lutefisk has been heard so often that it is now almost Americanized. In fact,in one of the most popular farces now running in our Chicago vaudeville theatres, intitled "The Man from Minnesota," the hero is named "Mr. Lutefisk." The connection and significance of the name cannot be doubted. And, an American college, located in Tyndale, So. Dakota, has included, or rather built around the name "lutefisk" in their college yell. Hva' Ska' Du Ha? Hva' Ska' Du Ha? Ludefisk, Ludefisk, Rah Rah Rah. Hva' Ska' Du Ha? means "what will you have?" Long live lutefisk and may it ever become more popular. We Norsemen could not be true Norsemen without it.</p>
