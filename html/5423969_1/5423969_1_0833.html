   <p>The Retailers' Commercial Union is a country-wide association of retailers. The object of the organization is to reduce costs through co-operative buying. This association has just concluded its semi-annual conference and exhibition of goods at the Hotel Sherman.</p>
   <p>Throughout the week the hotel was crowded by out-of-town dealers who had come to buy. The Union covers over sixteen states, and more than a third of the members are Norwegians. With a buying power of more than $40,000,000 the association can command both respect and the best of bargains, enabling the smaller dealers in the country to obtain the best goods on the market at the very lowest prices.</p>
   <p>The first exposition of goods was held in St. Louis. Ten years ago the general office of the association moved to Chicago, where the conventions and expositions have been held twice a year ever since.</p>

   <p>In 1914 the Retailers' Union began to sell goods to members at wholesale, an innovation which won unexpected acclaim. In 1916 it was found necessary to increase the storage space, and it was therefore decided that the association should erect a building of its own. This building is located at the corner of Loomis Place and Thirty-sixth Street, Chicago, at the heart of the so-called central manufacturing district. The building is five stories high and modern in every way. From it merchandise is shipped to members of the Union all over the country.</p>
   <p>As a result of its great buying power the association has been able to make deals with the largest manufacturers in the country, so that everything is obtained at the lowest prices. The president of the Retailers' Union is a Norwegian.</p>
