   <p>Mr. Editor: It appears, upon analysis of the recent decapitation order of Chief Kipley, that out of sixty Scandinavians in the police force, fifty-four were guillotined by that one order. The figures may not be absolutely correct, but they are nearly so. A more outrageous case of Know Nothingism could not be pointed out, and it is a gross insult to all three nationalities--Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians--which group themselves under the general head of Scandinavians. We have no better class of citizens, and this practical declaration that they are unfit to serve as protectors of the public peace is nothing short of a gross insult to every son and daughter of Scandia.</p>
