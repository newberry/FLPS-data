   <p>We now have two Norwegian churches that conduct all their services in English. This is bad because from all indications many more will follow suit. It was only natural that the Sunday-school classes were held in English for many years, because most of the children of Norwegian parentage prefer to speak English.</p>
   <p>With immigration practically stopped, it will only be a matter of a few years before the foreign-language groups will be a thing of the past. This will, of course, be felt by churches, clubs, and newspapers.</p>
   <p>We see in the singing societies that it is necessary to sing more and more English songs, unless someone will translate some of the beautiful Scandinavian songs. A few songs have been translated to date, but not enough to make much difference.</p>
