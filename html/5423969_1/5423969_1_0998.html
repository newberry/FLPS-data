   <p>p.7. "Dovre Klubben" (the Norwegian Republican Club) announces the appointment by Governor Deneen, of John P. Hovland as a member of the West Park's Board. This appointment was brought about by the "Dovre" Club in spite of it being a Republican club and to the consternation of many who were positive no Norseman would be appointed to fill the vacancy created by the well-known druggist Mr. Quales, also a Norseman. Our Democratic Governor, Mr. Deneen, recognizing the influence of "Dovre", and in justice to the Norwegian citizens of Chicago, requested a recommendation by "Dovre" and, upon this recommendation, appointed Mr. Hovland.</p>
   <p>Our Norwegian colony of Chicago is pleased over "Dovre" having been recognized by such men as Carter H. Harrison and Governor Deneen though both are Democrats. (Mayor Harrison appointed Charles O. Sethness to the school board.)</p>
