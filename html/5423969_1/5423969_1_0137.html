   <p>At last! We are pleased to be able to announce that two teachers have been secured for prospective classes in the instruction of the Norwegian language in our high schools.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alsager, who passed the examination brilliantly, has been assigned to the Tuley High school; and a young lady, whose name we were unable to learn, is to be assigned to the Carl Schurz school.</p>
   <p>It is now entirely a question of parental interest. We of the Norwegian colony have been the object of quite a bit of sarcasm from other national groups since our failure to obtain teachers in time for classes that opened in September. Now that we have the teachers, failure to supply an adequate number of students would be a real disgrace; a disgrace which, we trust, parents will not bring upon us. A knowledge of Norwegian will prove to be a receiving channel for real Norwegian culture.</p>
