   <p>One of the bad traits of our young people is the growing tendency to earn their living by their wits, and to leave manual labor to foreigners. Bodily work, except of the lightest kind, is getting more and more distasteful. The sons of our farmers, carpenters, and blacksmiths no sooner become their own masters then they stray off to the cities to engage in the "nobler" work of compounding prescriptions, soliciting insurance, or measuring calico.</p>
   <p>And yet, if the young man would but stop to think the matter over, he would find he could engage in manual labor at a far better recompense. The young man, in his ignorance, is not able to compete with the older and more experienced businessmen, and consequently the business sooner or later turns out a failure. Then his "air castles" have vanished, his fortune is gone, and he retires in disgust, having obtained neither wealth nor fame.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, if he had followed his father's pursuit, be it that of a farmer, a blacksmith, a carpenter, a mason, or a millwright, such an occupation would have developed his body and muscles, as well as his ability and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> energy, which are necessary for success. His father would have proved to be an able teacher, giving him an education for his chosen profession as well as starting him in his pursuit at a trifling cost.</p>
   <p>Begin at the bottom of the ladder of success and work your way upward. Every child should be trained to be dextrous in one or another useful branch of productive industry. Not that he should necessarily follow that pursuit, but that he may have that one to fall back upon if driven from that of the more intellectual. If everyone would comply with this rule, we should have less business stagnation and fewer panics; our country would be prosperous and we would feel content, one and all. My friends, do not evade the harvest field. Kepp it up, and you will find manual labor no disgrace.</p>
