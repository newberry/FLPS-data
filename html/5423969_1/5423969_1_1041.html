   <p>We have just received a letter of criticism from Arthur Olsen. We print this letter below, with our answer.</p>
   <p>"Mr. L. H. Lund,</p>
   <p>"Editor, Scandia.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir,</p>
   <p>"Your issue of February 25 contained an editorial on Judge Landis.</p>
   <p>"I wish to comment on your effort in recommending him to the citizens of this city for our next mayor. Whether your argument will succeed or not is yet to be seen. You mention casually that you believe that he will rectify all the errors that he has made when he is elected mayor. I do not believe that you can call his decision in the building controversy an error, unless you <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>call it a willful error.</p>
   <p>To show his inconsistency, I may recall to you a case which appeared before Judge Landis not long ago, in which a young man was accused of stealing funds from the bank by which he was employed. The Judge at that time came out with a statement putting the blame of his misdemeanor on his employers, for the reason that he was inadequately paid. Now this young man was only eighteen years old. How can a man of Landis' integrity turn right around and award to a man who has to support a family a salary which would be very little more than what was received by that boy? This instance alone shows his inconsistency. Can you now recommend a man of that caliber to the city as our next mayor?</p>
   <p>"Did you ever stop to think what the motive of Judge Landis was in resigning from the Federal bench? Statements contained in the newspapers say that he wants to devote his time to his duties as baseball commissioner and to help the American Legion, but the real reason for his resignation was that he was to get $43,000 as arbitrator for the baseball commission instead of $7,500 as <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Federal judge.</p>
   <p>"I cannot understand how a paper of your circulation, which includes among its readers the foreign element, nearly all of which belongs to the working class, can come out and recommend such a man for mayor. I am sure that if a poll could be taken among the subscribers of your paper as to their opinion of your editorial, the great majority would join me in criticizing it. Did you ever stop to think how many of your readers, if compelled to work under the Landis award, would be unable to support their families or to give to their children the proper education, and that possibly they would have to depend on charity?</p>
   <p>"Do not forget that there are in this city 400,000 members of organized labor who would do their utmost to defeat his election. I, as one of the 400,000, take this opportunity to protest against your article, and I should appreciate your comments on the same, for I am sure that not only I but many of the other subscribers are anxious to know your real intentions regarding <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Judge Landis.</p>
   <p>"Yours truly,</p>
   <p>"Arthur Olsen."</p>
   <p>Our answer is this. At the time when we wrote that particular editorial we did not think of that side of Landis' character. We thought of him as a Federal judge, but we did think of him quitting his work as judge to become a professional sportsman. But notwithstanding this we felt that he could well serve as an unpolitical mayor, that he could follow an entirely new line and keep entirely free, not entangling himself even with labor organizations.</p>
   <p>But if Mr. Olsen intends to start a discussion on labor problems, we want to assure him that we are not only modern but radical. On this point Mr. Olsen is fifty years behind the times with his Frazierian and Gomperian unionism.</p>
   <p>Yes, Mr. Olsen, we are so radical that we are surprised at ourselves, for we <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>have little, if any, respect for Frazier and Gompers and Landis and the Mayor, politically. We feel like Ibsen, who said that he would make a move in the political chess game, but that his move would be to overthrow it.</p>
   <p>We do not care who becomes mayor. We thought that we might just as well accept Landis as any one of the machine politicians or any entirely unknown person.</p>
   <p>In closing we want to ask you, Mr. Olsen, whether you know of some one, a friend of yours and mine, and a friend of the workers and of the masses. If so, let us have him. We will give him space in the paper; yes, we will give him the entire paper.</p>
