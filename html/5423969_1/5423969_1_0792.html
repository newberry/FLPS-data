   <p>p.8...The striking garment workers of Chicago paraded to Cubs Park on Wednesday, where they were addressed by various leaders. Indications are that they will win a partial victory, the employers having expressed a willingness to meet some of the demands.</p>
   <p>On Thursday Mayor Busse notified both sides that they would have to forget all thoughts of violence and arbitrate if they expected the support of the administration and citizenry of Chicago. This is the first time in the history of Chicago that a Mayor has taken any part in the settlement of a labor conflict. The coming election, in April, is a thorn of anxiety in the side of our body politic, and this strike and settlement will undoubtedly have its bearing on election results.</p>
