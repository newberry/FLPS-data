   <p>p.7...........One of our new subscribers has called our attention to outstanding Norwegian-Americans in politics. We have on several occasions mentioned individuals in this bracket though we have not attempted to paint a word picture of them as a group. Although there are hardly a million Norsemen (including their descendents) in the country they are well represented in our govermental setup. In the U.S.Senate we have Knute Nelson, Minnesota, Asle J. Gronna,North Dakota and Reed Smoet, Utah, whose mother was Norwegian. According to the last national census there are about 91,000,000 inhabitants who are represented in the upper house by ninety-two senators; a ratio of one senator to approximately one million. At this rate we Norwegians are well represented, in fact we have three times the representation our one million is entitled to, were this computation based on the size of nationality groups. In the lower house we are also well represented - Anderson, Steenerson and Volstead, Minnesota, Haugan, Iowa, Nelson, Wisconsin and Helgesen, North Dakota, i.e. six for our million.</p>

   <p>In Illinois alone we have 100,000 Norsemen represented by Olsen, 8th district, Waage, 28th district and Johnson, 39th district; three to 100,000 as compared to the allotted one for each 200,000 voters.</p>
   <p>In three states our countrymen have been elected to the governorship: Knute Nelson, Minnesota, Andrew Lee, South Dakota, and James Davidson, Wisconsin. The administrations of these three were nationally known for efficiency and honesty in all departments.</p>
   <p>An extensive volume would be required were we to mention all Norsemen who have been prominent in the administration of affairs in city, county, state and nation. A recognized characteristic of the Norseman is that his interest in the political welfare of the land does not destroy his interest in his church and the Norwegian benevolent institutions. Throughout the U.S.A. the Norsemen have established and maintained old peoples homes, orphanages, hospitals and welfare societies that are second to none in scope and efficient management.</p>

   <p>There is, however, no rose without its thorns.</p>
   <p>We have, to our regret, like all foreign groups some individuals who see only the material side of life, seeing none of the beauty of life and high culture, who spend their all for momentary excitement or diversion and many become the victims of drunkenness and dance hall debauchery. The percentage of such is comparatively small, a fact we thankfully appreciate.</p>
