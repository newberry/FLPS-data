   <p>M.S. Boutell, Republican candidate for re-election in the sixth congressional district, has demonstrated marked ability during his comparatively brief service in Congress, and should be re-elected. Congressman M.N. Johnson sends a good word for him in a letter to the publisher of this paper, in which the writer says:</p>
   <p>"Congressman M.S. Boutell of Chicago sits next to me in the House at Washington. I have thus had a fine opportunity to know him and his work well. He is an able and conscientious member, one of the best. As a Republican nominee he undoubtedly has your support anyhow, but I wish you could give him an extra good word in your paper. He deserves it."</p>
   <p>Yes, he deserves it. With a full Republican vote his re-election is a certainty. Let no Republican in the sixth, or any other district be counted among the stay-at-homes on Tuesday.</p>
