   <p>In Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland Fascism is growing, and for the same reason it rears its ugly head even among our people here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In Finland, the movement is vigorous, especially among the peasants. Communistic activity is suppressed with vigorous severity.</p>
   <p>In the three Scandinavian countries there are active Fascist organizations known as "Nordisk Folkereisning" [Norse Peoples Upsurge.] Here is another instance of the use of misleading labels. For a time, an attempt was made to publish a Fascist newspaper in Oslo.</p>
   <p>It was a scurrilous sheet; and it lead a precarious existence, and it devoted itself mainly to attacking the Jews, even those in public life in Norway, and to arousing social and religious prejudice. It copied Hitler's methods even to adopting as its symbol the old cabalistic swastika cross, which is Hitler's symbol, in place of Roman fasces of Italian Fascism. The paper and its true character were exposed in Scandia last summer. In Denmark, the Social Democratic party, with Premier Staunins at the helm, has practically become the Pascist party. In this it simply follows the lead of the German Social Democrats, so far as their proletarian policy is concerned, and of the British labor party. These parties are now face to face with a serious situation in their historical development.</p>
   <p>By their non-revolutionary action they have, consciously or unconsciously, maneuvered themselves into a position which is clearly Fascist in general. So astute a bourgeois statesman as Lloyd George has discerned this clearly. In a public statement he made a few weeks ago he admitted that "liberalism" is dead, and that there are now only two directions to choose between, either Fascism or the Soviet economic system. He added that the world is on the threshold of a vast and fundamental social change.</p>
   <p>Let us be alert, and not be misled into errors that may change the economic system for the worse.</p>
