   <p>Mr. Edward Carroll has resigned as president of the Building Trades' Council, and Mr. William Schardt has been elected his successor. Mr. Schardt is the president of a Bryan-Alschuler Club. His election as president of the Building Trades' Council means that the latter will use its influence for the advancement of the Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>There is nothing new in this, since most of the leaders of the organization mentioned have for a long time been in the service of the Democratic party. At their last meeting it was reported, for example, that sixty-eight of the delegates to the Building Trades' Council are Democrats who are holding well-paid positions in the service of the city of Chicago, while two delegates are Republicans, also holding official positions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The committee in charge had prepared a proposal demanding that all delegates holding political jobs be expelled from the Council. The leaders of the Council, however, are of course desirous of keeping their fat positions with the city and their influence with the workers as well, and they saw to it that the proposal in question was not even taken up for consideration by the Council.</p>
   <p>The election of Mr. Schardt as president of the Building Trades' Council is, then, in full accord with the policy these leaders have been constantly pursuing. There is one good feature involved in the election of Schardt: the labor leaders have now cast off their mask so completely that even the most confiding workers will be able to see what course is being steered. The fact that these "leaders" have chiefly their own interest in view can no longer be denied by anyone who wishes to see.</p>
   <p>What do they care if the workers and their families are starving? Through <span class="page-break">3</span>their votes the laborers have made these men "leaders," and because the latter occupy the positions of "leaders" they have been given fat jobs by Mayor Harrison. In return for their salaries they need only create dissatisfaction and dissension, the more the better. In performing this service, they show their power, and it costs them nothing, since the workers are paying--with enforced idleness and starvation. In addition to their salaries from the city, the "leaders" receive their pay from the workers for being "leaders"; furthermore, these"leaders" are in charge of the contributions to workers who are in distress.</p>
   <p>There is every reason to believe that the "leaders" took care to create trouble in the building trades for political purposes. And there is at least an equally strong reason to believe that the intention was to keep the quarrels alive until the election is over. The result is that building activity in Chicago has been paralyzed for about nine months. Thousands upon thousands of workers in the building trades and in related <span class="page-break">4</span>industries, who could have been steadily at work at good wages, have had to loaf while their wives and children have been starving. And if anyone attempted to work in spite of the prohibition by the "leaders," he risked being killed by the leaders' thugs.</p>
   <p>Now winter is at hand, and this makes the situation still more miserable in the homes of all these workers. They have kept alive during the summer, but how are they to get along now? They have been unable to save anything and they have no credit. What can they do? Of course they may apply for relief. But to do so is not very agreeable for honest men who are able and willing to work if only they were permitted to do so by the men whom the workers have trusted and who have the workers to thank for the ease and comfort provided for them all the year round.</p>
   <p>Time will tell whether the workers have been learning or whether they are still willing to bow to the selfish tyranny of the "leaders". The workers <span class="page-break">5</span>should not relinquish their organization although the temptation to do so may be strong. A radical reform is necessary, however, if it is to be possible for an honest and diligent worker to live in Chicago in days to come.</p>
   <p>Organization ought to have been the worker's best friend; it has become his worst enemy. This cannot go on. But the means for changing the present conditions are in the hands of the workers; they must drive out all the loafers, the office seekers, the humbug-makers, the rascals who during the past years have led the workers into the present morass; they must see that they are represented by able workers, by honest men. Unless this is done there can be no improvement in conditions.</p>
