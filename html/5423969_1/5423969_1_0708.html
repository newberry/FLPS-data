   <p>Those contemporaries who a few days ago vilified and hounded Governor Tanner because he refused to aid the Chicago and Virden Coal Company in running its mines, have suddenly become as silent as the grave. What is the matter with them? Is the Constitution dead since they have quit quoting it upon the Governor, or have they come to understand that the Governor was right?</p>
   <p>However this may be, their silence is significant. If it is sullen and ill-tempered, it is nevertheless a plain recognition of the force of public opinion. The Governor acted for the best interests of the people in this grave crisis; the people understand this, and no amount of misrepresentation will blind their eyes to the plain fact.</p>
   <p>The officers of the coal company had a great deal to say about their constitutional rights and the duty of the Governor to protect these rights by all the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>power at his command. But they were silent about the duties of their corporation and the rights of the state.</p>
   <p>Theirs is a position that cannot be tolerated in a civilized society. There are no rights without corresponding duties; right and duty are in every instance so completely intertwined that one cannot be separated from the other. When workers attempt to enforce their rights without any regard to their duties, they wage war upon the fabric of society as it exists today, and are branded as anarchists. The same is true of capitalists. The impudent threat that the Virden Coal Company would enforce its rights at the mouth of Winchesters and to the extent of sacrificing every life on the train, was the rankest sort of anarchy. The Governor properly took the ground that the company had outlawed itself by its armed attack upon the state, and that it is responsible for the lives lost in the deplorable conflict.</p>
   <p>Governor Tanner has furnished a precedent for his successors in this state and the executives of other states. His position is in advance of the written letter of the law, but it is in line with public sentiment, which will be the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>law of tomorrow. He deserves the thanks not only of labor but of the people at large for his wise, patriotic, and courageous action. And the tragedy at Virden will arouse the people to a sense of the danger that threatens society from the anarchy of corporate capital that is controlled by unscrupulous men who recognize no duty or law that conflicts with their rapacity and greed.</p>
