   <p>Three Norwegian students are to be given an opportunity for a free university education; Senator Waage of Chicago is to appoint the fortunate ones from the 25th district, which he represents. This opportunity is open to boys and girls of 16 and those who live in Senator Waage's district (25th) and competitive examinations will be held, to determine the lucky three, beginning June 6th.</p>
   <p>The laws of the state permit the appointment of from one to three students from each district, by the senator of each, and it is Senator Waage's intention to see that these free scholarships go to talented youngsters of Norwegian descent whose parents are not financially able to give them the higher education they desire and deserve. We urge all boys and girls of 16 years and up to try for these scholarships by taking the forthcoming examinations. Send your name and address to Senator Johann Waage, 60 W.Washington St., Chicago.</p>
