   <p>A correspondent sets forth that the railroad system of this country ought to be owned and controlled by the government. I fully agree with him. But what about the passenger steamboat lines on the coast and the Great Lakes? It requires just as much care and precaution to take a passenger across the waters as it does to take him across the continent. The passenger steamers should be owned and the traffic controlled by the government. Upon it depends the welfare of the traveling public, and that is too valuable to be left in the hands of those greedy and heartless private companies, whose only object is to accumulate money, regardless of the prosperity and welfare of their traveling customers. With the passenger traffic in the possession of the government, traveling expenses could be reduced considerably, and it would still yield a fine income to the government.</p>
   <p>Besides this, I will propose some restrictions to be made on the acquisition of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the citizenship of this country. Uncle Sam is too liberal in his distribution of citizenship papers. Many individuals that cannot master the English language sufficiently to express themselves in it, and naturally know little or nothing about government affairs, hold responsible offices. The result of this, however bad it may be, is insignificant compared to the evils of weak administration occasioned by careless voters. They will, without further consideration, cast their vote for the purpose that will bring them the greatest immediate gain, whether it be financial or otherwise.</p>
