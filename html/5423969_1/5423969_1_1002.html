   <p>The Twenty-eighth Ward Norwegian Republican Club has done quite a job in the past year. The Club has cleared up many issues for the voters; it has brought out the qualifications of several candidates and blocked the election of many men who were not worthy to hold office.</p>
   <p>The members of the executive board, all of whom are outstanding people in the community, are E. S. A. Lahlum, Dr. M. A. Unseth, and William Thoreson, vice-presidents; A. C. Petersen, treasurer; Julius Jaeger, secretary. As can be seen, the Club is now in good hands.</p>
