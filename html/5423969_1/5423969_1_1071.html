   <p>p.8............President Kolocek of the West Parks Commission announces that Chas. A. Mulligan, well known sculpture, has been engaged to make two new statues to be placed in our parks. One is a statue of Lincoln in bronze, the other a statue of a miner and child in Georgia marble. We recommend the latter for Humboldt Park and Lincoln for Garfield Park. The more of the substantial statues we get the sooner we will be rid of the cheaply made and cheap looking monstrosities now on display. Most of these statues suggest products of poverty or graft and and are an eyesore as well as a joke. In no other country in the world would such statuary be tolerated in a public park. There are so many disfiguring blots on the fair faces of our parks and an insult to any one's sense of beauty and art; and when they are again placed on display this spring we should enter a vigorous protest against saving them. Quantity in this matter should not predominate over quality.</p>
