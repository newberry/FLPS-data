   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I have been reading, with great interest and amusement, the columns in your paper for the young people. The readers of the Skandinaven have written a great deal against dancing. I like dancing, and I do not see any harm in it if it is with respectable people. But there are other amusements that I like a great deal better, such as literary and musical circles, or something of that sort. It is both interesting and beneficial to individuals and to society at large.</p>
   <p>Mr. Servold wrote an article in which he says: "books that are not worth keeping are not worth reading". I do not understand that. There are a great many <span class="page-break">2</span>poor people in this world who have great love for good books and they have books that, perhaps, we would think were not worth keeping. Should they throw away such books? The contents of a book are more valuable than the outside of it. I would rather have many cheap, good books than just a few with ornamental covers and a fine appearance. Many cannot afford to get good books of that kind. Now, I do not mean these trashy dime novels, but books written by celebrated authors: Dickens, Ebers, Hawthorne, Dumas, Hugo, Lie, Ibsen, Tolstoy, Zola, Gorky, Dante, Drackman, Bjornson, etc. I think everyone should read these books and we can obtain them very cheap. I like poetry best of all and my favorite poets are Longfellow and Heine.</p>
   <p>A young man wrote in the Skandinaven sometime ago that he has been in the company of girls who have drunk whisky from a bottle that was carried in one of the boy's pockets. I wonder what kind of company he was in. If I were he, I would keep away from such associates.</p>
