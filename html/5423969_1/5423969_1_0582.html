   <p>p.4...........Permit us to boost (brag) just a little. We recently protested, through our columns and personally, against the poor street car service on Milwaukee Avenue and the waiting time between cars was reduced from fifty-five to forty minutes. A follow-up of the protest has again brought a reduction to a thirty minute schedule. It pays to be both insistent and persistent, thank you.</p>
