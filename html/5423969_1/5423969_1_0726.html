   <p>Why is the transportation, both horse and cable cars, so bad? They talk about improvements day and night, but nothing is done.</p>
   <p>The new electric trains which are used in New York should be tried here. These trains are faster, more comfortable to ride in, and should be cheaper to operate. The boodled politicians are becoming wealthy by following the orders of big business, and the transportation companies pay well. The company which asked for a franchise on an Elevated line on Milwaukee Avenue would not or could not pay boodle, hence no Elevated trains on Milwaukee Avenue. Well, what price graft?</p>
