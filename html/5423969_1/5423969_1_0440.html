   <p>With the decrease in immigration it becomes quite a problem to save Norwegian as a language. The churches have already started to preach their sermons in English, and nearly all of the Sunday-school classes are in English.</p>
   <p>The language newspapers do not have quite the same problem, but it will not be long before the immigrant who cannot or will not learn English, has died out. We believe that the time to change will come very soon, and if our language papers are to survive they must soon begin to print part of their papers in English. We can save Scandinavian culture only by making it the property of the English-speaking people; so why not begin now.</p>
