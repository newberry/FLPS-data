   <p>A. M. Wright, the probable Republican candidate for mayor, may personally be a temperance man, but does not wish to inject this question into politics. For some time a temperance organization, called "The Reform Alliance," has been trying to influence the mayoral election, and its representatives have approached Mr. Wright, inquiring how he stands in regard to their cause. He stated definitely that if elected, he would never order the beer-halls and theatres closed on Sundays, since such an act would constitute usurpation of authority and breaking of the mayoral oath.</p>
   <p>It is not likely that the Democrats will fall for the temptation of buying the votes of the temperance organizations by yielding to their demands, and consequently, at the coming election they will stand alone, probably forming their own political party, and voting for their own candidates.</p>
   <p>Such a policy is very dangerous, as evinced by the victory of the People's Party, a victory for which the city's respectable citizens are now paying dearly.</p>
