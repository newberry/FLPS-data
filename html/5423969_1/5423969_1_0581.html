   <p>p.2.............A grand military show is now under way in Grant Park where 10,000 soldiers are mobilized for training an exhibition. The majority of them are citizen soldiers, designated as National Guards (the former State Militia), there being but a handful of regulars taking part. The maneuvers are sponsored by the Chicago Association of Commerce, conclusive evidence that capital and industry in order to carry out their aims, do not hesitate to use our military strength in peace as well as in war.</p>
   <p>Who, if any, of the country's founders would have dreamed that within a comparatively few years the American soldier would be used to put on a circus to attract customers to a central market? The whole thing is abhorrent, almost unthinkable.</p>
