   <p>Regarding my statement that politics ought to be kept out of the Norwegian singing societies and turner societies, permit me to inform you that it was caused by two recent occurrences which seemed to me to require consideration. Mr. Johnson, the attorney, recently gave a strongly political speech at the singers' picnic. On the day of the picnic Mr. Martin, the president of the Turner Society, gave an interview to a reporter of the Chicago American, and in this interview declared that the decidedly social-democratic newspaper in question had filled a long-felt want among the Norwegians in Chicago. Both these gentlemen have the right to think as they must and do, but they should not try to intrude their political opinions into the affairs of the societies in question. When two hundred and fifty people gather for a banquet, it is not to be expected that all are of the same opinions politically, and one does not pay two dollars for <span class="page-break">\2</span>the purpose of having some occasional speaker condemn what, in one's own opinion, is right. Political activity has ruined many of the societies in Norway of the types we are here considering, and this fact ought to serve as a warning against committing the same blunder in America. I stand up for my expressed opinions in these matters in spite of Mr. Ray's disagreement.</p>
   <p>Attorney Ray does not seem able to write on this matter without giving me a kick for still maintaining Norwegian citizenship. Without entering into a discussion of the principle of this matter, I shall nonetheless inform Mr. Ray that, upon investigation, he might be able to find proof that I discontinued my Norwegian citizenship in the year 1894. I may add that the information by the attorney that I am living in Ward Fourteen is incorrect.</p>
   <p>Since, however, the attorney is so poorly informed, why does he bring up these matters? One may blow one's own horn, perhaps, but one must also <span class="page-break">\3</span>consider the logic of the case or one may make one's self ridiculous.</p>
   <p>My dear friend Olaf Ray, just a piece of friendly advice: one should not throw stones if one is living in a house of glass.</p>
   <p>According to Attorney Ray, a turner society should not confine itself to gymnastics; politics must also be included [among its activities]. The same is true, of course, in regard to the singing societies. We may assume that the political mill is grinding at full speed in the Society for the Home for the Aged, of which Mr. Ray is a member. But what kind of politics, my dear Attorney, is to be represented? Is it Republicanism or Democratism? Is a Republican to start the discussion, to be followed by a reply from a Democrat, perhaps to be followed in turn by blows? The result would be that we would need only political societies. What in the world do we need other societies for, if politics is to be the main issue in those also?</p>
