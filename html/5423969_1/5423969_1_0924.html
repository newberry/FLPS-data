   <p>To the Editor of the Chicago Tribune: April 27. In nearly every report concerning the Communistic movement in this city it is made apparent that the Scandinavians are the leading element. That no one has taken up the pen to rectify this error is probably because the Scandinavians themselves are aware of the insignificent part their communist countrymen are playing in reality, and for this reason the articles have been considered too riduculous for attention, however aggrevating. Nevertheless this silence on their part may result in the idea gaining ground that the Scandinavians as a class are communistic, and to be ranked among the scum of society. It is therefore for the interest of the Scandinavian majority, and for the sake of justice to make known to the American people how very few Scandinavians are in sympathy with the communistic movement.</p>
