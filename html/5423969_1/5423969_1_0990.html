   <p>The Dovre Club decided at its last meeting to support Oscar M. Lundby for the Illinois legislature. The club, after some research, reported that a great majority of Norwegian-Americans were Republicans. The research committee also reported that the Norwegian-Americans in Chicago, especially in the twenty-fifth senatorial district, were numerous and powerful enough to swing an election in favor of the Republican party.</p>
   <p>The resolution pledging support was signed by the following:</p>
   <p>B. O. Borgersen, Arthur A. Haarstad, Henry N. Stoltenberg, Birger Osland, Tryggve A. Siqueland, Henry H. Erland, Charles Runden, Dr. M. A. Unseth, Ole Gullickson, Ole Rinnan, C. Runden, Edward Savre, and Peter Cederstrom.</p>
