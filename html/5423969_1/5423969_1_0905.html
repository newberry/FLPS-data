   <p>Whether Leon Czolgosz was sent upon his bloody errand by a band of conspirators or simply went forth to execute a decree of death formulated in his own wicked heart is a question of secondary importance. In any event the crime was the ripened fruit of the seeds of anarchy. No formal commission of murder was needed to nerve the wretch to his horrible deed. His views, his associations, the satanic fire of a Miss Emma Goldman brought him under the fell spell that led him into the assassin's path. The creed of anarchy is per se a conspiracy against society. Anarchy seeks the life of society itself: assassinations of the foremost representatives of law and order are only a means to an end. Hence it should be met with the weapons of war. Its apostles and tools have placed themselves outside the pale of society and should be dealt with in accordance with the principles of the laws of war. Only the swift sternness and vigor of "war justice" will afford society full protection and exterminate <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the red monster.</p>
   <p>But who are the "reds," and where does anarchy end? If we think that the enemies of society are confined to small bands of unwashed people with more or less foreign-sounding names, we shall have a dangerous delusion. Like the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, the wretch at Buffalo is in possession of all the legal qualifications, barring age, for being himself elected President of the United States. He was born on American soil and has been educated in our public schools. He may have acquired his special brand of anarchy from foreign sources; but we have other anarchists whose influence is more pernicious and far-reaching than the disordered ravings of the "reds". Newspapers of the type of the Chicago American and others, that fit their standards of public morality to the basest instincts of the vicious classes--that make sensationalism, lying, and systematic misrepresentation of public policies and the motives of public men their specialty--that becloud weak intellects and inflame wicked passions--such newspapers are more powerful promoters of anarchy and crime than are all out-and-out anarchistic publications <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in the country combined.</p>
   <p>If they were not dangerous public enemies the publishers and editors of such newspapers would be beneath the contempt of all honest men. Upon the same moral plane with them are the people whose patronage makes the existence of publications of this class possible. They do not all belong to the ranks of the unkempt and unwashed. On the contrary, the select circles of merchant princes and financiers, the fashionable clubs, the pulpit, the bench and the bar, the mechanic and the worker--all furnish recruits to the hosts of well-dressed enemies of society, and all are co-responsible with the detestable sheets that make it their business to stab law and promote anarchy.</p>
   <p>For some two or three years an organized campaign against the popular will and national authority has been waged by people who claim to represent the very highest type of American citizenship and intelligence. The Atkinsons, the Winslows, etc., supported by influential newspapers, have branded as a crime a policy ordained by the will of the people. And they have gone <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>farther: with a fierce hatred and vehemence that no firebrand anarchist orator could eclipse, they have denounced President McKinley as a usurper, a tyrant, and a redhanded murderer. Leon Czolgosz, who resolved to strike down the "ruler," the representative of law and order, would have been perfectly justified in claiming a tacit or expressed commission from this group of blue-blooded American anarchists.</p>
   <p>And they acknowledge their guilt by their traitorous conduct in this hour of national affliction. The most numerous and shameful expressions of approval of the bloody work of the murderer have come not from the scattered bands of "reds," but from the ranks of the "anti-imperialists". When a Senator of the United States, upon learning that the President of the United States had been shot down by an assassin, has the brazen audacity to exclaim, "I am indifferent to the whole matter," it is time to begin to look in high places for anarchists.</p>
   <p>The heart of the nation is sound. But we must not shut our eyes to the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>poisonous eruptions that appear in scattered places on the body politic. We realize that men of high intelligence confound liberty with license and that disloyalty, treason, and anarchy have displaced respect for law in many intelligent minds. We should not fail to understand that the war upon anarchy must be conducted on lines as broad as society itself.</p>
