   <p>p.8................Uninformed people are prone to ridicule and belittle Norway and Norwegians, as well as American citizens of Norwegian descent, fondly imagining that America always has the largest and best of every known (and unknown) thing. We present here an item of interest to our colony and for the enlightenment (we hope) of detractors of Norway and Norwegians. The world's largest turbine in the world's largest electrical power station has recently been put to work at Vemork Station in Telemark, Norway.</p>
   <p>The plant produces a current of 145,000 H. P. through the ten generators now installed and running. Construction was started late in 1907 and is practically completed. "Rjukan Foss" (Rjukan Falls) is now the world's highest water fall. Throughout Norway, hydraulic stations have been constructed and the percentage of users of electrical current in Norway is greater than either the U.S.A. or Great Britain. Norwegian engineers are always in demand in both these countries.</p>
