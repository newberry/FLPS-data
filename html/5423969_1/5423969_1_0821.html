   <p>There is now a fair prospect of an early adjustment of the difficulties that for so long have paralyzed the building industries of Chicago. The contending parties have at last entered upon the road which in nine cases out of ten is the short cut from industrial war to peace--direct negotiation. They have agreed to meet in a friendly conference under conditions that will insure a free and full discussion of all the points at issue. Each body will be represented by a committee of men who enjoy the confidence of their respective constituents and understand the situation thoroughly. A full exchange, by two such bodies, of views and information cannot fail to correct misunderstandings that may have existed on either side, eliminate every irrelevant point injected into the controversy, foster a spirit of conciliation, and thus pave the way for a restoration of complete harmony.</p>

   <p>The pianomakers' contest, which thus far has cost the employees something like a quarter of a million dollars, illustrates forcibly that trouble between employers and employees is much easier made than mended by outside agencies. This is the burden of the decision just rendered by the state board of arbitration after a searching investigation of the causes and origin of the controversy.</p>
   <p>"The manufacturers," says the board," appeared to have made no objection to the wage scale submitted by the men, but preferred to deal directly with their own men rather than with an agent of the union who had never been connected with any department of the piano and organ workers' trade, and who was altogether without practical knowledge of the business."</p>
   <p>Any sensible man would take the same position. A thorough understanding of the nature of a dispute is always the first condition of a fair and intelligent settlement. This applies with particular force to the pianomakers' controversy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"There is such a wide difference in conditions in the several factories that we," says the board," shall make no attempt in this case to recommend a wage scale applicable to all of them, but shall leave the wage question to be settled between each individual employer and his employees. We feel confident that no difficulty will be experienced in any case in reaching a satisfactory agreement upon the wage question."</p>
   <p>As the employers had not applied for arbitration, the board could not attempt to arbitrate the matter. It makes the following recommendations:</p>
   <p>"That the strike at the factory of Story and Clark and the lockouts at all other factories be declared off immediately;</p>
   <p>"That work be resumed at all factories at once;</p>
   <p>"That all of the employees at work at the time of the strike and lockout be re-employed without discrimination;</p>
   <p>"That a day's work in all factories and in all departments shall consist of nine hours; <span class="page-break">4</span>"That in case of a difference involving a proposed increase in wages, each employer shall meet a committee of his employees and endeavor to settle such differences by mutual agreement."</p>
   <p>To an outsider this looks like a fair proposition. But it is reported that at a meeting of the piano and organ workers the report was received with derision and thrown into the wastebasket, and it was decided to continue the strike.</p>
   <p>Why these recommendations should receive such treatment is a little difficult to understand for the third party to the contest--the community at large; and the employees would not weaken their cause in the least by explaining it to the public. Inasmuch as it may, apparently, be taken for granted that there is no real difference as to wages it may seem to some that the employees are pursuing a shadow and rejecting the substance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The lesson taught by this somewhat peculiar controversy is that when anybody gets between employer and employees, trouble is likely to follow, and that a controversy, once started, is not easily settled from without, not even by such a well-intentioned agency as the state board of arbitration. As a rule, arbitration is either unnecessary or ineffectual. No outsider understands a labor contest as well as do the parties to the controversy. The state cannot force either employer or employees to accept in good faith an incongruous decision. But if it cannot compel them to agree, the state has a right to compel them to try to agree. It can make it compulsory upon the parties to a strike or a lockout to meet in conference under conditions that will enable both the contestants and the community at large to learn and understand the exact nature and bearing of the conflict. In most instances an adjustment would then be reached, while the unsettled differences would quickly yield to the irresistible force of a crystallized intelligent public opinion.</p>
