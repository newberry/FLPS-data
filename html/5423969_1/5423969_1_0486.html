   <p>The Chicago Daily News of yesterday gives an account of the rush of volunteers at Quartermaster Lee's office and says in part:</p>
   <p>"The Swedish sailors were a detachment of hardy Norsemen, all veterans of king Oscar's fleet or of the Swedish merchant service. They had decided that dry land and the lakes offered few attractions as compared with the "bounding main", and that war for their adopted "country" was a peculiarly proper method of getting back to the element they love so well. So, the Swedes--a superb-looking crowd of mariners--crowded into the hydrographic office, put down their names, and, when the hour of battle comes, will be on the big ironclads or in the turrets of the monitors."</p>

   <p>The "Swedish sailors" who enlist will give a splendid account of themselves. But the majority of the so-called "Swedish sailors" in Chicago are Norwegians. By consulting The Daily News Almanac, our contemporary may ascertain that the merchant marine of Sweden is small compared with that of Norway. Norway's army of sturdy seamen is more than twice as large as that of Sweden.</p>
   <p>The majority of sailors on our Great Lakes are Scandinavians, and among them the Norwegians are in a decided majority. In Chicago there are at least three Norwegian sailors to one Swedish; hence it is fair to assume that three out of every four Scandinavian sailors enlisting in this city are Norwegian tars, or "sturdy Norsemen" in the proper sense of this term.</p>
   <p>Many people cannot understand why the Daily News is unable to treat Norway or Norwegians in common fairness.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>It would seem that it is a settled policy in the News office to ignore Norway and her people, or, if that cannot be done, to insult them by slurs and misrepresentations. Norwegians are loath to think that the hostility shown by the Daily News to everything Norwegian can be accounted for by the fact that the Proprietor of the News was born of Norwegian parents.</p>
