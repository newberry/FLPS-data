   <p>According to an announcement, Judge Marcus Kavanagh is to speak at the Seventeenth of May celebration--an occasion that is purely Norwegian. If such is the case, Skandinaven deems it the height of absurdity. The Norwegians do not need an Irishman (who traces his ancestors back to Ireland) to give them any of the usual Irish bunk.</p>
   <p>The Irish boast of having chased the Norwegians out of Ireland, and now they come out with their pro-Irish stuff about liberty-loving Norwegians and Irish. Ask the Waldenses if the Irish brigade was liberty-loving when they helped to crush liberty of worship. This is a pro-Irish move and should be stopped.</p>
   <p>This same judge is in favor of the Irish Republic, thereby recognizing the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Sinn Feiners, a Catholic group operating only for their own interests, and as such are allied to all that is against freedom and liberty of conscience. We fear that the middle ages are not over yet, and if the Catholic authorities cannot control the kings as they did in days gone by, the kings will be controlled by the ballot.</p>
