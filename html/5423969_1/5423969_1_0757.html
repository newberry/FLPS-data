   <p>The Scandinavian Painters' Union, Local 194, celebrated its tenth anniversary last week in Aurora Hall. All the eight hundred or more members belonging to the union had been invited with their families, and more than twelve hundred people were present.</p>
   <p>The program opened with an overture by J. P. Jensen's orchestra.</p>
   <p>Attorney Olaf E. Ray spoke in honor of the occasion.</p>
   <p>The members of the Painters' Union belong to various political parties; yet, in the speech by Mr. Ray there were several statements explaining the program of the Republican party.</p>
   <p>The Danish singing society, Harmonien, sang several numbers. Mr. M. <span class="page-break">\2</span>Pedersen played a cornet solo; Mrs. Lawrence Hansen gave a piano solo; Mr. H. Saller presented a trombone solo; Severin Arnesen, tenor, gave two vocal solos, "Remember Me," and "Bohemian Girl". All these various numbers were loudly applauded.</p>
   <p>Supper was served in the dining room--the caterer being "The Economy Butter Store," Grand and Central Avenues.</p>
   <p>The celebration was enjoyed by everybody; there was no entrance fee, since the Union assumed all expenses.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian Painters' Union was organized on October 1, 1890, with fifteen members. The following year the number of members had increased to two hundred. Since then the membership has been increasing steadily, and the Union is now one of the strongest branches in the painters' trade.</p>
   <p>In sick aid the Branch has paid $3,050 during the past three years.</p>
