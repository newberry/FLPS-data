   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>It has afforded me both pleasure and interest to peruse the columns set apart "For Ungpommen" (The Youth) in your paper. On the whole, they have been witty, pointed, and good. But to be candid, I wish to say that I took special notice of a suggestion made by Mr. J. M. Mason, who concluded his article thusly: "Now let us have something about history, political economy, books, people, countries, etc." A better suggestion could not be made. Baldwin says that "our history, our plan of government, and our political economy ought to be made as familiar as the multiplication table." Hence, I take it that the young citizens of Free America, who are mounting the stage <span class="page-break">2</span>of action, and ourselves, the legal inheritors of civic and religious liberty, can use our spare moments for no better purpose than to study and discuss ways and means by which we can best preserve and promote these blessings. It will be our duty in the near future, if not directly then indirectly to be the guardians of that political edifice of liberty and equal rights--the acquisition of our hardy, brave, and patriotic ancestors, which respect to our fathers and justice to ourselves require us faithfully to perform.</p>
   <p>How, then, can we best prepare ourselves for the duty which will be ours? Will it be by shunning history and political subjects in preference to petty social discussions, insisting that anti-dance, game-playing, cold water society members are intellectually superior to those who sometimes amuse themselves by a little headshaking, and occasionally refresh themselves with a little of the Kentucky or Milwaukee brands? For my part, I believe that a <span class="page-break">3</span>person can be a broadminded, intelligent citizen while being socially either of the above-mentioned. But he or she can certainly not be such without some knowledge of the principles which underlie our institutions. The whole trend of civilization today is in the direction where studies of this kind will be more and more useful, and in a land of popular government it is of importance that the people be more or less conversant with all its branches.</p>
