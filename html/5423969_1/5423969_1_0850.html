   <p>The Scandinavian Furniture &amp; Cabinet makers have for some time had large meetings regarding co-operative factories. The idea is to have a number of the smaller factories co-operate under one roof, as they did in Rockford. The site of the Scandinavian Co-operative in furniture factories will be in Chicago Heights. It will cost $150,000 to realize the plans, but the money is easy to get.</p>
