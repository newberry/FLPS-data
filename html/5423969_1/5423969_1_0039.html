   <p>Alderman Utpatel is known in these parts to be quite a statesman, and his remark contributed to the discussion of military training in the schools is at least up to his high average. "We should educate our children", said Mr. Utpatel, "but we should not teach them to shoot their brothers". Mr. Utpatel would doubtless favor teaching them to be shot by "their brothers" without giving way to impatience or resentment. Belgian boys were not taught to shoot their brothers either, but they had no Alderman Utpatel to see that they were educated to be shot by their brothers without showing impatience or resentment. As a result, if Mr. Utpatel were to meet any of the survivors, he would find that they did not share his beautiful theory about being taught not to shoot their brothers in case their brothers took to shooting first.</p>
   <p>We suggest to Alderman Utpatel and his like-minded colleagues that they abolish the city police force and let the law-abiding citizens rely upon their own pacific natures for their security.</p>
