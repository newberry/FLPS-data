   <p>The Scandinavian-American Club of which P.H. Peterson is president was started March 12, 1903, and now has more than 300 members. The aim of the Club is to unite all the Republican Scandinavian voters of the 15th Ward.</p>
   <p>The club is now trying to start clubs in the following Wards: 16th, 17th, 26th, 27th, 28th on the Northwest Side. On this committee are: P.H. Peterson, Pres.; A.K. Mose, Vice-Pres.; H.H. Erland, 2nd Vice-Pres.; C.L. Olsen, Sec.; James Heyn, Treas.. This committee is helped by fifteen active residents in the Wards. If these plans are carried out it will mean a lot of power for Scandinavian voters of these Wards.
