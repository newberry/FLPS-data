   <p>p.4.............Even before the present tense international situation developed, there were those who took a somewhat hostile or skeptical view of the possible patriotic functions of the foreign-languages press in the matter of Americanization. Without getting at the facts it was assured offhand that any continued use of a foreign language was in itself a check to inculcating American ideals, the critics forgetting that for the adult immigrants the language of their birthplace is the only medium by which an idea relating to America can be communicated. It is surprising, therefore, that Max Henrici, in a recent number of The American Ledger, makes out a strong case for the use of the foreign-language newspaper as factors in that social amalgamation, for which all true Americans are striving, and he calls attention to the fact that it was the apostle of common sense, as well as uncommon science, Benjamin Franklin who was the first to recognize the value of using a foreign tongue for the purpose of Americanizing the newcomers. Franklin's Philadelphia Zeitung, which came out in 1732, being the first foreign-language newspaper published in America. Today more than 750 foreign language newspapers are <span class="page-break">\2</span>printed in the United States and Canada in thirty different languages, reaching eight million people and having a combined capitol of $27,000,000. Those who would ignore the influence of these papers over their constituents, especially in preaching a simplified Americanism, are blind to the facts of the situation, since for the most part every one of the foreign periodicals printed in the United States sets out its object in a sort of compassion of American faith as follows: "To help preserve the ideals and sacred traditions of this our adopted country," the "United States of America," to revere its laws and inspire others to respect and obey them, to strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of "civic duty," in all ways to aid in making this country greater and better than we found it.</p>
