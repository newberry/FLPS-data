   <p>In the Fifteenth Ward we have four hundred Scandinavians, most of them Republicans. A meeting was called here to discuss the matter of candidates for the coming elections. It is hoped to elect more Scandinavians to office.</p>
   <p>A committee was set up consisting of the following: Charles Sundel, C. Stromberg, A. G. Lundberg, and Dr. Paoli. John Anderson, publisher, proposed that the organization be called "The Scandinavian Republican Club of the Fifteenth Ward." This is the first all-Scandinavian political organization ever to be formed here. It is hoped that some good men will be nominated at the coming election.</p>
