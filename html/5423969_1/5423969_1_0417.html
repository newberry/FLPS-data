   <p>Your article in yesterday's edition of the Scandinaven is the height of intolerance.</p>
   <p>It is to the credit of the wealthy Nina Zandt that she wishes to marry August Spies "in the shadow of the gallows," as you term it.</p>
   <p>I am neither a Socialist or Anarchist, nor do I agree with either party, but I do know that according to the Constitution no one has the authority to stop the marriage, and with all due respect to your Norwegian sheriff, I think it is the height of ignorance, intolerance, and stupidity for him to try to stop the marriage.</p>
   <p>And as for your drivel about Norwegians and Germans, let me say we are Americans, and Americans only. You with your internal strife only retard progress <span class="page-break">2</span>and cause racial hatred.</p>
   <p>I know that all decent and right-thinking people are in sympathy with Mr. Spies and Miss Van Zandt, and besides, Mr. Spies has not been proven guilty. It is clear that the entire Haymarket affair was a frame up.</p>
