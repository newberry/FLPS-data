   <p>The American Federation of Labor is still growing rapidly and steadily while the Knights of Labor, which was so powerful a few years ago, is no longer heard of. The Federation is building upon the labor unions, and experience has shown this to be the secure and natural foundation.</p>
   <p>The discussions during the annual meeting in Louisville present much of interest. Thus it is noteworthy that Mr. Gomper's statement criticizing compulsory arbitration seems to express the general attitude within the organization. The workers stand for the principles of negotiation and conciliation. If a strike cannot be prevented or settled this way, it would be of but slight use to turn to compulsory arbitration, in their opinion. Undoubtedly they are right in this. Compulsory arbitration is but a doubtful means for the settling of disputes, and only rarely does it produce lasting peace.</p>

   <p>The resolution concerning trusts adopted by the annual meeting is very moderate. The original motion offered had labeled trusts a great evil; this motion was voted down by an overwhelming majority. The resolution which was adopted recommends to the workers the study of trusts and monopolies from the economic point of view, and urges the workers to organize as energetically as possible.</p>
   <p>A number of the foremost labor leaders in the country have for a long time held the opinion that the so-called trusts do not hurt the workers. The mighty Federation of Labor has adopted practically the same point of view. At former annual meetings the organization had taken a vigorous stand against trusts. The resolution adopted on the present occasion thus actually means that the Federation of Labor has adopted a completely new attitude in this matter.</p>
   <p>The socialist delegates propounded several motions expressive of their attitude. Thus, among other things, they voiced a proposal for a co-operative order of society. All of these motions were voted down with overwhelming majorities.</p>

   <p>The same fate befell a proposal for the organization of a department of labor in Washington. One delegate made the statement that he would prefer having Mark Hanna take care of the interests of labor than a number of the so-called representatives of labor who have been chosen to look after the welfare of the workers.... There may be some good reason for such a statement. Many people pose as the spokesmen of labor and earn their bread in an easy manner by doing so. When the workers shake off these parasites, they will have taken a long step forward.</p>
   <p>On the whole, the meeting in Louisville created a good impression. The deliberations were conducted in a thoughtful manner and good common sense was manifest. The resolutions passed combine moderation and firmness.</p>
   <p>The Federation of Labor is the mightiest exponent of the rights of labor in America. It is governed in a manner to make its activities of great value not only to the workers but to the country as a whole.</p>
