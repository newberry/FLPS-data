   <p>The various street railway companies have held their annual meetings. The people will be glad to know that their gracious masters, the said street railway companies, are still doing well. They have enjoyed a high degree of prosperity during the past year and look toward the future with expectations of increasing dividends. Eighteen per cent is a truly magnificent return on capital received as a gift from the community.</p>
   <p>It may be held that the people ought to have received something adequate in return for gifts large enough to make and support scores of millionaires. But, inasmuch as the royal donations were made by servants and agents of the City, to pay fare and curse (sic) are the only privileges left to the people. The companies will collect the former, leaving it to the sovereigns of suffrage to collect the latter in the manner most agreeable to themselves.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, fresh franchises are granted in rapid succession by the City Council, <span class="page-break">\2</span>to serve as cornerstones for another batch of millionaires created by water, which in a short time will be as substantial and glittering as the purest gold.</p>
   <p>The patrons of the Halsted Street line will be overjoyed to observe that the North Side Street Railway Company heads the list of dividend earners. If they cannot share in the profits themselves, it will afford them great satisfaction to know that they have not been drenched nor had their ears and noses frozen in vain, and that their nickels have been put to such excellent use.</p>
   <p>And while the silent process of piling up new dividends is going on, the part of the community that does not earn dividends should unite in contemplating the glories of our local self-government and admiring our collective ability to protect our interests in the management of the public affairs of this great city.</p>
