   <p>The Norwegian-Danish Typographical Union, Local 272, held its annual meeting yesterday. The new executive board is of the kind that will lead Local 272 with care and forethought. To the new board were elected: C. M. Nielsen, president; H. Larson, vice-president; and three delegates to the Allied Printing Trades Council.</p>
   <p>The new board is militant, progressive, and aggressive, and the Union is now sure to go places.</p>
