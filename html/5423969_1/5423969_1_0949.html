   <p>The executive council of the Dovre Club, the only Norwegian political organization in Chicago, is actively engaged in its work for the coming presidential election. Most of our important and outstanding Norwegian citizens are active in this organization. Birger Osland was elected president for 1920; Osland pledged that some real good work would be done this year. Hans Oftedahl, Andrew Hummeland, John P. Hovland, Peter Cederstrom, Ole Gullicksen, Carl Bauer, and O.O. Kraboe are all actively engaged in the political work of the Club.</p>
   <p>The first thing Osland did was to remove all the members of the executive council who held positions of any kind with the city administration. Osland said: "Either the gentlemen now working for the city will abide by the laws of the organization and resign from the executive council, or I will resign."</p>

   <p>So, today, the Club is again cleared of political elements that have an ax to grind.</p>
