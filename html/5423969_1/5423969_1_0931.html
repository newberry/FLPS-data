   <p>The Norwegian Non-Partisan Dever League has been very, very busy for some time trying to put over their candidate.</p>
   <p>Einar Graff is the chairman of the League. A Committee of forty-two well-known Norwegians has been set up. We mention a few: Carl Bauer, Andrew Hummeland, Knute Rockne, Captain Jens A. Doe, Dr. Adolf Doe, Herman Arnesen [of Skandinaven.], Finn Mathiesen, Chas. C. Peterson, Sigwald Asbjornson, Otto Clausen, and Hans Oftedahl. Well, good luck! Time will tell.</p>
