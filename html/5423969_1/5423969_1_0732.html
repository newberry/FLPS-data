Mr. Thoresen was formerly a cornice maker but took up the metal ornament work when he engaged in business for himself in 1893.</p>
   <p>He came to America in 1879. He was born in Christiania, Norway, Sept. 20, 1867. He was apprenticed to Price &amp; Kaufman to learn cornice work. At eighteen he had mastered his trade and was offered the foremanship in one of the largest cornice shops in Chicago. He started in business for himself at 816 North Western Avenue. He was favored by securing a contract for all the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>cornice work for the Board of Education, and in the meantime Mr. Thoresen devoted a great deal of study to designing of metal ornaments. In 1897 he abandoned the cornice business and devoted all his facilities to the making of sheet metal ornaments. The demand for these ornaments increased so much that Mr. Thoresen was obliged to seek larger quarters, and to meet his requirements he erected a new building at 419-21 West North Avenue. The family resides at 50 Columbia Street.</p>
