   <p>The Dovre Club, a Norwegian organization, at a recent meeting adopted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"The members of Dovre Club, comprising a section of Chicago's electorate, herewith express our dissatisfaction with the present Democratic city administration. Several scandals have occurred in recent years, and taxes have increased without the taxpayer having received corresponding benefits. The Democratic party rule in local politics has been made possible because of lack of unity among the Republicans, and we, the members of Dovre Club, together with other patriotic citizens, will therefore do everything in our power to bring about a much needed change for the better. With this purpose in view we pledge our support to the Republican candidate for mayor, Chief Justice Harry Olson, and also the candidates for city treasurer and city clerk, Charles H. Sergel and John Sihan, respectively."</p>
