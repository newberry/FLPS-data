   <p>At a meeting of the regular Republican Club in the sixth precint of the Seventeenth Ward, held on Tuesday evening, November 20 ... the following officers were elected: president, Mr. H. A. Tronson; vice-president, Mr. F. Anderson; secretary, Mr. Enoch Strom; treasurer, Mr. H. F. Schau.</p>
   <p>A minority of the members, most of them office seekers, met the same day at Wolf's Hall on Milwaukee Avenue to nominate their candidates. The Scandinaven element has taken the steps indicated above mainly because they are dissatisfied with the manner in which the almighty Mr. Burke, his obedient follower, Mr. Fred Erickson, and their hangers-on have manipulated the affairs of the Ward in their own interests. Thus a bitter fight between former friends is now in progress, and it is expected that at the election of leaders for the entire Ward at Scandia Hall on the coming Tuesday, a large number will be present and a lively discussion will take place. All <span class="page-break">2</span>Scandinavians who wish the Seventeenth Ward to be governed in an honest, unselfish manner, undominated by professional politicians,.... are urged to be present at the meeting.</p>
