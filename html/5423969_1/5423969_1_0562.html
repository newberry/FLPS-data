   <p>There has been a great deal of protest because the city wants to change street names.</p>
   <p>The Danes resent the change in the name of "Dania Avenue," and the Norwegians protest the change in "Christiania Avenue."</p>
   <p>We object to this changing of names; if the "Common Council" persists they will find that every one will protest.</p>
