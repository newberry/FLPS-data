   <p>If you own real estate in Cook County, go at once to the Board of Assessors, 82 Fifth Ave., where you will be informed about your present property assessment. If you find the valuation too high, go to the Board of Review, 76 Fifth Ave., and give your reasons why the assessment of your property is too high and why it ought to be reduced.</p>
   <p>The present assessment will be in force for four years. If your property is overvalued and you do not get it corrected now, you will have to pay tax based on the inflated valuation for four years. But to get the matter straightened out, you must apply to the boards mentioned before August 10th. After that date it will be too late.</p>
