   <p>Dear Sir: Dancing may or may not be a true enjoyment--it depends on how it is used.</p>
   <p>I believe dancing to be no more morally destructive than any other innocent game, providing it is used right. Dances where every breath is stained with intoxicating liquor, dances where all moral laws are abandoned, dances where all kinds of profanity prevail--such dances have ruined many a brave boy and man; such places should not be found in a community of enlightened people, although they exist even among church people.</p>
   
   <p>I believe dancing an innocent pleasure if conducted at respectable places and by respectable people. But we must not change night into day and day into night because that is contrary to the laws of nature, and penalty for the violation of these laws is sure to come. Neither should dancing be indulged in to such an extent that the dancers are soaked with perspiration--then it is no pleasure, but more like an Indian war dance.</p>
