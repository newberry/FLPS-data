   <p>We believe Chicago should erect a memorial to Garfield in one of our parks or on one of our boulevards. Garfield was loved by all, rich and poor alike. The cost of such a monument could easily be covered by taxes. For example, a park tax could be levied. We hope the City Fathers will think this matter over, and that they will get into action soon.</p>
