   <p>"Practical education molds the character and gives power and influence essential to usefulness and success in life". (Extracts from an address in Danish, by Niels A. Jensen, [Dane])</p>
   <p>All schools that have been pushed by their progressive friends and supporters to a point above the common level, like the State Teachers' Training School, will have a potent influence upon its students and the people around. Everywhere summer schools are largely attended. In our own state in 1895 and 1896 there were fifty summer schools in session and enrolling nearly six thousand students, which is the entire teaching force of the state. These schools have done and are doing a vast amount of good. This has been the general verdict of the superintendents and the students who have been attending.</p>
   <p>The influence of the instruction given at the State Training Schools is felt by all and is wonderfully inspiring to the teachers. A thirst for knowledge is created and the refreshing fountain is opened by the able instructors who--as the Hon. W. W. Prendergast states it--like Moses, smite the rock and lead the followers through the wilderness. The teachers are getting broader views, clearer ideals which should lead them to work for a cause honestly, unselfishly, and diligently, to teach the children that they live in a country made free and upon soil consecrated by the blood of patriots, and that their duty is to preserve these blood-bought privileges by brave and unselfish living. In short, we should teach ideals as high as possible; but let us also teach that as our fathers directed the army on the battlefield for the liberty of our Republic and the unlimited suffrage of the millions, so it is heroic for the present generation to lead a campaign against filth, corruption, and vice, which are destructive to our well-being physically, intellectually, and morally, and in disharmony with the laws of education.</p>
   <p>The point is to give the boys and girls such training as will enable them to earn a living. In other words, they must be equipped with a knowledge of matter and force, and with a command of their own minds and muscles, that they may become respectable citizens and helpful to the nation.</p>
   <p>As Wendell Phillips well said: "The influence which we may have in a community springs from a thorough training of the faculties." The question is: How can a teacher be of most help in mental and manual training? This and similar questions arise in the mind of an honest teacher. An entirely different list might suggest itself to an experienced instructor, and still another to an indifferent teacher in the country. I think it is for the discussion of all such questions that the Teachers Training School is intended.</p>
   <p>I venture to present a few of the ideas which in my opinion, will characterize the educational work of the future, whether we are to have in mind the needs of a single school or those of a country. First of all, if I mistake not, the formation of habits is one of the great aims in education. As Todd says, "Men's character may be said to be a bundle of habits," and character makes the man. It is the formation of habits more than anything else that lifts the infant from the state of subjection. The facility of controlling the movements of the body helps the child to master his impulses instead of being mastered by them. A habit, in other words, is a mode of self-control in some definite direction. Hence the great point to be arrived at, says Smiles, "is to get the working quality well trained." It was mental cultivation, practice, and discipline by which the late Robert Peel got his powers that rendered him so illustrious an ornament of the British Parliament. It is not the tools that make the workman, but the trained skill of the man himself. Again to quote from Todd: "The object of education is to discipline the mind in all its parts, to show when to find tools, and how to use them." This was the glory of the mind of Watt, Isaac Newton, and the late venerated Porter.</p>
   <p>The next thing to remember is sympathy and personality, which result in interest and attention. Attention leads to discrimination and association which are essential to intellectual development. If the teacher succeeds in arousing the interest of the child she may assist him to form such habits as those of Jeremiah Evarts, who by his regularity and thorough methods always accomplished more than he expected during the day. Then, and then only, is a man truly a man; when he reaches this point he reaches his humanitas, or as the Roman puts it, the fullest and most harmonious culture of all the human faculties and powers. He will see his ideal, that which he was created to be, and can be trusted to serve our time.</p>
   <p>We all agree in the duty of the people to labor and help those less favored in life. But the duty of scholars to educate the masses is still more imperative in a republic, since a republic entrusts the state wholly to the intelligence and moral sense of the people. Conduct and not culture is the basis of character and the source of strength. Let us follow the example of London, the landscape gardener, and let each one of us ask himself or herself: What can I do to benefit my fellow men? What may we do to warn our people of the wrong road which ends in disgrace, imprisonment, and moral collapse? I emphatically answer, with the Commissioner of Education, "by educating the children".</p>
