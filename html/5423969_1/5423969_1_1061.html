   <p>A recent enactment of the legislature provides for six additional judges for the Circuit Court, making a total of twenty Circuit Court judges to be elected in June. At the present time the entire West Side of our city with its large population has but one Circuit Court judge. The Twenty-eighth Ward Republican organization has endorsed Judge Oscar M. Torrison of that Ward for one of these new judgeships. His eight years' experience on the municipal bench has made him familiar with the habits, customs, and conditions of all classes of people. His record on the bench as an able, broad-minded, and conscientious judge is well known to the public.</p>
   <p>The Dovre Club, which was organized for the purpose of advancing good government and selecting good men for public office, heartily seconds the endorsement of Judge Torrison for the new Circuit Court judgeship, and urges all citizens to give him their active support.</p>
