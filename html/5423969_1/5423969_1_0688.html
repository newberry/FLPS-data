   <p>The abrupt closing of twelve of the thirty mills operated by the American Steel and Wire Company, and the consequent flurry on the stock exchanges, undoubtedly have intensified the popular distrust of trusts and strengthened the widespread demand for antitrust legislation. But what is more to the point, Mr. Gates has taught us a valuable lesson as to the true aim of such legislation.</p>
   <p>The public sentiment against industrial combines has been gathering strength from year to year and has placed a series of more or less stringent laws upon our statute books. But these laws are all but worthless because they are the upshot of hopeless groping in the dark. The lawmakers attempted to deal with problems but imperfectly understood, and hence, enacted laws that were either inoperative or harmful.</p>
   
   <p>Whether it be wise or even possible to restrict, by means of legislation, combinations formed for purely industrial purposes is an open question. But the imperative necessity of emancipating the large industrial organizations from the influence of unscrupulous speculators has been clearly demonstrated by the recent maneuvers of Mr. John W. Gates. The trust manipulator himself is not of that opinion. "Our company," he says," is running this business without any need of explaining. We shut down our mills and we open our mills when we see fit."</p>
   <p>Mr. Gates will presently discover his mistake. His associates have already compelled him to make explanations, and the public will exact more. Mr. Gates stands unmasked as an enemy of the people, as a beast of prey upon society, sacrificing with the light heart of a highway robber the welfare of thousands of working people and the happiness of their homes; and, likewise, the savings of thousands upon thousands of honest investors. Such things do need "explaining". Mr. Gates and others to whom trusts are, first of all a convenient vehicle for stock jobbing,must be taught that they cannot shut down and open their mills when they see fit, for stock jobbing purposes.</p>
   <p>The value of this object lesson will not be lost either upon the people or upon the Congress. To oust the stock gambler from the councils of our large industrial organizations will be the first and foremost aim of antitrust legislation. Unless that can be done, there can be no assurance of industrial stability and peace. But it can be done. Remove the veil of secrecy; let the full daylight fall upon the books; make the responsibility of the directors commensurate with their immense power, and the trust will become a bonafide industrial organization that will stand or fall according to its merits or demerits as such.</p>
