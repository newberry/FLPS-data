   <p>The Chicago Scandinavian Socialists have started a summer colony at Fox Lake. Dr. Carl Sandberg, the well-known Socialist leader, has donated the land.</p>
   <p>This gift was greatly appreciated by the "Comrades" who all need a place to rest after their tiring organizational work. A great number of Danish and Norwegian Socialists are already sleeping, reading, or fishing at the colony. It pays to be a Socialist these days.</p>
