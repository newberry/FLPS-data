   <p>At a labor demonstration last week, a well-known Norwegian labor agitator, also "demonstrated". An Irish "Cop," though the demonstration was peaceful, decided to break it up. The "cop" picked on one Norwegian friend, knocked him down, kicked him, and yelled, "This will teach you, you damned Swede". The floored man only laughed and said: "Ha, ha, the yoke is on you, I vas a Norwegian all the time". That's good old Norwegian wit. Even though our friend was banged up quite a bit, he could still "yoke".</p>
