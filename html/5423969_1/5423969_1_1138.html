   <p>The "Scandinavian Democracy" of Cook County held its annual election yester day at 2425 West North Avenue. It is quite interesting to note that the organization has a membership of several thousand, composed of Swedes, Danes and Norwegians. The organization is twelve years old, and it has shown itself to be a political force. It can, to a degree, control the local politicians.</p>
   <p>The meeting was successful in two ways: first, several important resolutions were passed; and second, the new executive board is better organized to function internally and politically. The new board is as follows:</p>
   <p>N. T. Nilsson, president; Thor. J. Benson, first vice-president; Martin Zatterberg, second vice-president; Carl Olsen, third vice-president; H. H. Egkild, recording secretary; John Danielson, financial secretary; Alfred Rasmusen, treasurer.</p>

   <p>Board of directors: Eugene Olsen, J. N. Tilton, Girard Ellingson, John Jacobsen and Christ F. Grueener.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, several Finns and several Icelanders joined the organization.</p>
