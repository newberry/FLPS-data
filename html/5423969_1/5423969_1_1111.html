   <p>As Skandinaven has mentioned on several occasions, there has long been strong sentiment among the residents of the West Side for the removal of the City Hall to that part of the city. It is being taken for granted that something must be done in the near future to provide more space for the various city departments and that an up-to-date building for such purpose must be provided. Since the West Side is the most important of the three sections of the city, both as to area and population, it has been the opinion of many that the building to house the functionaries of the city government ought to be located there. It has been urged that the removal of the City Hall to the West Side, if the location were suitably chosen, would place it much nearer to the real center of the city than it is at present. The location of the present building is too far to the east, considering the rapid development of the West Side.</p>
   
   <p>The question is of immediate significance to property owners and citizens in general on the Northwest Side, as will appear from the following statements from prominent men in the district, collected by reporters of Skandinaven: President Paul O. Stensland, of the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank, said: "The idea....that the City Hall ought to be located on the West Side appears reasonable because of the fact that the West Side is the largest section of the city and holds a greater population than the North Side and the South Side combined. Another reason is that if the City Hall were moved to the West Side it would cut down, to some extent, the enormous preferments now enjoyed by the downtown district. This preferment has been created through the crowding together, within a few blocks, of colossal business houses as well as all the public buildings....The removal of the City Hall to the West Side would constitute an important step in the direction of extending the business district....This would greatly benefit our city as a whole."</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Anton Petersen of the firm A. Petersen and Company says: "A large amount of business is concentrated about the City Hall. This has been the case where the building is located now, and it has been to the advantage of a few and to the detriment of many....The removal of the City Hall to the West Side, the largest of the three sections of the city, would be of advantage to large numbers; it would help spread throughout the city the mass of business now heaped together within a few blocks. I favor the placing of the City Hall on the West Side."</p>
   <p>Dr. N.T. Quales said: "As a resident of the West Side for a number of years I am naturally in favor of any improvement that can be had in that part of the city. But just as 'all roads lead to Rome,' so do all the traction lines in Chicago lead to the block bordering on Clark, Washington, LaSalle, and Randolph Streets. In agreement with the old democratic motto, 'the greatest good for the greatest number,' I advocate the retention of the present location of the City Hall."</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Hans Nordahl, of the firm Nordahl and Olsen, thought it would be advantageous to have the City Hall moved to the West Side, and that Union Park would be the true central location....The same opinion was expressed by Mr. O.C. Land, 344 Milwaukee Avenue....</p>
   <p>Mr. O.A. Thorp made the following statement: "For purely practical reasons I am of the opinion that it would not be advisable to move the City Hall to the West Side. The South Side has become the center for all traffic, and the offices of the city administration should be centrally located; that is, at the center of the city's traffic. It is also desirable that the offices of the city, the county, and the Federal governments should be located closely together....Considerable inconvenience has been caused already by the placing of certain of the courts on the north side of the river. The South Side, north of Van Buren Street, is the heart of Chicago; to that section all streetcar lines are directed; in that section the offices of the city government ought to be located."</p>
   
   <p>Mr. A.P. Johnson, president of Johnson Chair Company, was in favor of moving the City Hall to the West Side....Comparison between Chicago and other large cities in America and Europe will disclose that while Chicago has but one center, and that one monopolizing most of the city's business, other large cities have several. The West Side is the section of Chicago which has been the stepchild of the city. The City Hall ought to be moved to that section; then the banks and large business houses will follow, and the general business will soon be doubled.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: A number of other prominent Norwegians were interviewed in regard to the question. All of them except one were in favor of moving the City Hall to the West Side, but no new arguments were advanced by them.]</p>
