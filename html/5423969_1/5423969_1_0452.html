   <p>A protest was sent to Scandia,and we herewith publish the same:</p>
   <p>"We see in the latest issue of Sangerhilsen (Singers' Regards) that negotiations are being made with "foreign" steamship companies about passage for the American Norwegian Singers' League to Norway, we protest against this, because we believe that they should sail under the Norwegian flag. We recommend that the rank and file members in the various singing societies affiliated with the League discuss this issue, and demand, as Norwegians, that the group sail under Norwegian colors.</p>
