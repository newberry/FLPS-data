   <p>There seems to be a tendency among young people to overlook their unfitness for the profession they prepare themselves to enter. This tendency may be partly due to the fact that while young we are inclined to cherish rather high ideas as to our capacity for adapting ourselves to anything that may strike our fancy.</p>
   <p>There are, however, other reasons. One, we believe, lies in perverted ideas in regard to the relative merit and respectability of the various useful pursuits of life. Many seem to think that the professions of law, ministry, medicine, teaching, etc. are the only occupations worthy of a person's best efforts, while the mechanical trades and agriculture are often looked upon as inferior, something to fall back on in case we fail to get into the so-called higher vocations of life.</p>
   <p>It is an error to think that true success consists in entering a certain profession We may all be workers in the vineyard and have a common end in view, although our <span class="page-break">2</span>work may be difficult, but if we perform the task assigned to us faithfully and well, be it ever so humble, we are truly successful and deserve as much credit as those who have been assigned to the more difficult task of pruning the vine stock.</p>
   <p>A successful life does not necessarily consist in great deeds, but it rather consists in doing little acts of kindness, in speaking words of comfort to cheer the afflicted, and in doing with all our might that which we are able to do. A prominent minister once said: "It is a sin to spoil a good farmer, and make a poor preacher out of him". It often happens that parents in easy circumstances will, for instance, prevail upon a son who feels no inclination or calling to study for the ministry. The motives in such cases may be good, though they seem erroneous, but they often originate in the idea that such a calling is more respectable than others, or that it is meritorious in itself, notwithstanding the fact that the person is unfit for the mission.</p>
   <p>We often hear such expressions as: "He is only a farmer". But the farmer has a noble mission which, when well performed, is as honorable and deserves as much <span class="page-break">3</span>credit as a well-performed service in any other vocation in life. The intelligent farmer's home has been the source from which the best material for nearly all honorable pursuits of life has been gathered in the past, and we hope it will continue to be so in the future.</p>
   <p>Therefore, do not imagine yourselves to be above the common walks of life, even though you shall have attended some higher institution of learning for a year or two. I think the columns in this paper are very interesting, and would like to hear from others on this subject. Let us hear from you.</p>
