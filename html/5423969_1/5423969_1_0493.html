   <p>The Svenska Kuriren appears to think that the Skandinaven ought to have permitted Mr. Sherhard's misstatements to pass unnoticed. Says our contemporary in part:</p>
   <p>"Our esteemed contemporary, the Skandinaven, is in a bad humor because an English writer in McClure's Magazine said that Dr. Fridtjof Nansen (a Norwegian) is Dr. Sven Hedin's (who was born in Sweden) countryman. The Skandinaven is rather critical of the innocent fellow who made a mistake regarding Dr. Nansen's nationality and accuse him of being a fraud and a cur.</p>
   <p>"Now, suppose this same 'our' and 'fraud' had stated that Dr. Hedin was Dr. Nansen's countryman, would that still have provoked the ire of the Skandinaven?</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We doubt it very much. Andree, the Swede, was often called a Norwegian by the American press; yet we never heard the Skandinaven make any complaints.</p>
   <p>"We would suggest that since the population of either of the Scandinavian countries is rather insignificant in comparison with the rest of the civilized world, and even in comparison to the population of the United States, we lay ourselves open to ridicule when we, too often, insist upon the recognition of our different nationalities. We do not think we are mistaken in asserting that this petty quarrel may sometimes attract a rebuke of the most undesirable kind."</p>
   <p>The allusion to "petty quarrels" is out of place in this connection. The only controversy in which this paper has been engaged in these columns deals with a notorious liar concerning indisputable facts. Few foreigners have been more hospitably received in Christiania than this fellow Sherhard; but as soon as he <span class="page-break">3</span>had turned his back upon the city he published the most outrageous slanders and calumnies against its people. His despicable behavior was exposed, and in order to take revenge, the cur now attempts to rob Norway of her Nansen, insofar as he is able to do so with his poisonous pen. This fresh evidence of Sherhard's hostility to everything Norwegian is resented by the Skandinaven, in much the same way as the Kuriren would, and ought to, resent similar misrepresentations which show animosity to Sweden.</p>
   <p>The Kuriren, it appears, expects the Skandinaven to "make complaints" against current misstatements prejudicial to the Swedes. As far as this desire is concerned, it may be said that the Skandinaven is anxious to avoid doing anything that, justly or unjustly, might be construed as encroaching upon the field of its Swedish colleagues, who naturally regard it as their business to guard Swedish interests and protect Swedish interests and protect Swedish honor. Yet the Skandinaven has, on some occasions, ventured to raise its voice on behalf of the Swedes in the interest of truth and for the good of the Scandinavians in general. The Kuriren may be <span class="page-break">4</span>able to recall at least one instance of this kind--"Ralph's Rot on the Swedes," an article that brought forth a confession from the editor of Harper's Weekly that the grotesque article, complained of by this paper, "was a careless bit of writing and a careless bit of editing".</p>
   <p>If Andree has been represented as a Norwegian this paper is not aware of it. But if is well known that when Dr. Sven Hedin first began to attract the attention of the American press he was mentioned as "the Norwegian explorer" or "the Norwegian traveler". The Skandinaven did not approve of this particular "bit of annexation," and in its issue of February 23, 1897 published the following correction:</p>
   <p>"The staid and usually reliable Scientific American speaks approvingly of the excellent work of 'the Norwegian traveler, Sven Hedin'. With the permission of its esteemed contemporary, the Skandinaven desires to state that Sven Hedin is <span class="page-break">5</span>not a Norwegian. He is a Swede. For the present, at least, Norway is perfectly satisfied with the laurels won by her distinguished son and traveler, Dr. Nansen."</p>
   <p>A copy of this paragraph was forwarded to the Scientific American. Since then the American press has generally permitted Sven Hedin to be a Swede.</p>
   <p>Does the Kuriren still doubt the readiness of the Skandinaven to "make complaints" of misstatements prejudicial to Swedish interests or [affecting Swedish] sensibilities?</p>
