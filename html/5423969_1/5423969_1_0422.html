   <p>Older people are always complaining about the younger generation: The young people are far from being mentally, physically, and morally what they were during the youth of their elders, etc. But, as far back as we have been able to study the history of the human race, this condition has always existed, so that it is only natural to hear these complaints.</p>
   <p>Had these accusations against the younger generation contained even the slightest grain of truth throughout the ages, the human race would now be in a terrible state. Constant retrogression for so long a time would place us by now on a plane lower than that occupied by the world's first human.</p>
   <p>Moreover, naturally enough, while age is criticising and condemning youth, youth is laughing up its sleeve at the presumption of the older people who think they so thoroughly understand humanity in general and youth in particular, but who at the same time seem to be oblivious of altered situations in <span class="page-break">2</span>life and living conditions.</p>
   <p>Is old age right? Is youth right? History alone holds the solution to the age-old controversy between the two. As we understand history, humanity has been steadily advancing in every way, and in every branch science is making far greater strides than ever before since the beginning of time. Comparatively young men and women are listed among the great minds in science, literature, music, art, mechanics, etc. Through good times and bad it is the youth of the nation that has come through with the remedy and the leadership in every case.</p>
   <p>A great deal has been said and written about retrogression, depressions, etc., but even during the time when conditions were the worst, a new force was being developed that eventually lifted humanity to a higher plane than ever before. It is the spirit of youth that has created the spirit and fighting qualities of the worker whereby the oppression of the poorer classes by the rich has been lessened, and the living standards have been raised from a status of slavery and serfdom to a much higher, though far from perfect, plane.</p>

   <p>To those who argue so strongly in favor of the former generations and the "old thinkers," we ask, "What did their thinking develop that has not been vastly improved upon and surpassed by those of a later age?" It is said that necessity is the mother of invention. We would paraphrase this to read, "Oppression, patiently endured, is the mother of liberty." All through the ages there have been times of depression and oppression, and it is during such periods that great minds have developed so that at the opportune moment, the clear, clean thinker has led men to better things.</p>
   <p>Newton discovered the law of gravity by observing an apple falling from a tree, and Watt discovered the power of steam by watching a teakettle boil over. These two commonplace incidents had been viewed by generation after generation without rousing the interest of one individual; nor did such observations awaken the inventive genius that would or could develop wonderful results from simple or crude beginnings, as has been done by later generations.</p>
   <p>We now (almost hopelessly) appeal to both old and young: Drop your attitude <span class="page-break">4</span>of intolerant criticism and ridicule toward each other! Let sober age and enthusiastic youth work together for greater and better things. The sage advice of age and experience properly coupled with the energy and exuberance of youth is the only power that will bring order out of the present social chaos.</p>
