   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>The young people of today will be called upon sooner or later to fill positions in the social and business world. Therefore, we should try to learn the best ways to fill the vacancies, so we can be proud of them in the years to come. Some may learn faster, have greater chances, and may succeed better than others; but by making a good effort to learn to be honest and true, even if they are not so well educated, they will all stand a good chance of succeeding.</p>
   <p>Some boys think they will have a good time while they are young (that's what they call it), and will later settle down to business. But many have lost good opportunities because they were noted for being full of devilry and mischief, and so <span class="page-break">2</span>they are not to be trusted as quickly as boys who do have good reputations.</p>
   <p>Not that boys should be silent and dull; boys are not built that way. But they should think for themselves, as it is for themselves that they are making a good record which benefits them in every way. Wherever a person applies for a position of any account, his character is referred to, and the clearer the record the better the chance.</p>
   <p>I myself am not an angel, but I have a good character, which is due largely to strictly heeding the advice of my parents, not because I wanted to be better than other boys, but because I had to and I am thankful for it today.</p>
   <p>But at the same time, this can be overdone if the young people are kept penned up, as you may call it, especially when the parents are working people and have little time to be sociable. Let the young people learn to be sociable and to be well-mannered ladies and gentlemen, so they will not feel confused and out of place in good company.</p>
