   <p>The press has of recent date contained reports of a paper, "How to Abate the Saloon Evil," read at a public gathering by the Reverend F. W. Straw. The reverend gentleman is an uncompromising prohibitionist and his paper is a typical prohibition argument. It is typical also in its superficiality in dealing with unpleasant facts, as, for instance, the conditions in such prohibition communities as Maine and Kansas, as well as in its loose and reckless assertions and charges. It is as amusing as it is novel to learn from the lips of Mr. Straw that "high license some years ago was considered to be a cure-all"--unless we are to understand that this absurd idea was safely locked within our own head. Equally groundless is the assertion that the dispensary system of South Carolina is a modification of the Gothenburg system. The truth is that these two methods of dealing with <span class="page-break">2</span>the liquor problem have nothing at all in common.</p>
   <p>In dealing with the effects of the Gothenburg system in Norway and Sweden, Mr. Straw exhibits a disregard of truth that is amazing. "The result in Norway," he says, "has been a great number of charitable organizations growing up around the saloon men's families, until the scandal grew so great that beginning with the present year the profits are to go to the state."</p>
   <p>That is all this preacher of the gospel and teacher of truth has to say about Norway's experiment with the Gothenburg system. The facts, briefly stated, are as follows:</p>
   <p>In 1871 the Gothenburg system was introduced in Norway for the purpose of restricting the consumption of spirits (it was not made applicable to wines and beer). The law provided that the net profits were to be devoted to "objects of public utility," exclusive of such undertakings as are supported by public taxes. The cities were left free to adopt or not adopt the new system, <span class="page-break">3</span>as they might choose. A law of 1894 provides that in cities where spirits are sold, "the liquor association" is to have a monopoly of all retailing of spirits, unless the people, men and women, decide at a special election to establish prohibition for the ensuing five years. It is further provided that the net profits are to be controlled, one part by the association as before, another by the city government, and a third by the state--all profits to be used for purposes of public utility.</p>
   <p>What are the results? The number of bars in Norwegian cities has been reduced from 501 in 1871 to 130 (one to every 4,000 inhabitants) in 1898. The [per capita] consumption of spirits has decreased from 2.8 liters in 1871 to 1.2 liters in 1898; and the sum of twenty million crowns, representing net profits, has been distributed for various objects of public utility, such as homes for old people and orphans, evening schools, industrial schools [in Scandinavia these schools were established to teach mechanics, and not, as in America, for reform schools], libraries, art galleries, public parks, missions, <span class="page-break">4</span>homes for sailors, homes for drunkards, temperance societies, and other similar "charitable organizations growing up around the saloon men's families".</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to review in detail Mr. Straw's statements as to Sweden; it is sufficient to say that he is equally unreliable whether he deals with Sweden or Norway. His sweeping assertion that "Sweden is one of the most drunken countries in Europe," is an outrageous slander upon an honorable and progressive nation. The latest reliable statistics show the annual consumption per capita of alcoholic beverages (spirits, wines, and beer) reduced to units of alcohol to be as follows:</p>

   <p>The Gothenburg system has been in force in Finland, Norway, and Sweden for about a generation. It is not established in any other country. As the table shows, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden are the most temperate countries on the list. Yet Mr. Straw has the assurance to proclaim that the system has been "a failure" in Norway and Sweden.</p>
   <p>Mr. Straw evidently knows absolutely nothing about the operation of the Gothenburg system; his misinformation on the subject appears to have been gathered from the columns of the New Voice. But his lack of firsthand knowledge does <span class="page-break">6</span>not excuse the reverend gentleman. He knows what the Good Book says about bearing false witness against his fellow men--and there is no exception in favor of ministers; he knows, or ought to know, that the New Voice is utterly unworthy of credence; and he ought to know that a lie does not cease to be a lie by being repeated by a minister of the gospel.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: This editorial started a storm of protest in nearly every foreign-language newspaper in Chicago, especially the Scandinavian organs. The list published on the consumption of liquor per capita in the different countries was proven to be incorrect. For example, there was a week-end stream of people from Finland into Norway and Sweden; these visitors consumed much of the spirits accredited to Norway and Sweden.</p>
   <p>In the case of Denmark, the figures should be about ten liters. But it was pointed out that Swedes from Malmo and Gothenburg crossed the sound into Copenhagen by the thousands on Saturday and Sunday, for the sole purpose of <span class="page-break">7</span>"consuming" liquor. In the south the Germans would visit Esbjerg for the same purpose. It was stated that most of the spirits "charged to a nation" were consumed by nationals of some other nation. The discussion lasted for months.]</p>
