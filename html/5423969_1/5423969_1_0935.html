   <p>p.2....................The primary election is over. Merriam is the Republican choice for mayor and Harrison the Democratic. The real fight is now on, and the April election will show whether Merriam's ability to "smash the machine" will carry him through to a final choice by the voters. Scandia does not hesitate to come out for Merriam as being far better fitted and with a record that is spotlesly clean as compared to the record of graft and corruption, which Harrison has consistently been making for himself and his political bedfellows.</p>
   <p>Forward looking, honest voters cannot but see which of the two candidates will, when elected, put the city and the taxpayers' interests above all else during the coming four years. A vote for Merriam is a vote for decency, efficency and right.</p>
