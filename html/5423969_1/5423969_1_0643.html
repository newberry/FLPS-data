   <p>Charles M. Schwab, president of the United States Steel Corporation, is in Europe at the present and has put in a week at Monte Carlo, probably for the purpose of studying the business methods in vogue at that famous, or infamous, industrial establishment. With the respect due to a trust king the cable has faithfully chronicled his daily winnings and losses for the edification of the American people. It appears that Mr. Schwab has been pursuing his studies in up-to-date gambling with his customary energy and success; the climax was reached on Sunday when he is said to have performed the feat of breaking the bank in addition to the Sabbath.</p>
   <p>At the request of Andrew Carnegie, his associate in the steel corporation, Mr. Schwab has cabled a denial of the report of his "sensational gambling." This denial, which amounts to an admission of the fact of gambling, is not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>likely to prove satisfactory to the hard-headed Scot who, whatever may have been his faults, does not owe his success to gambling, but to hard, unremitting work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schwab is a man of a radically different type. His industry and ability cannot be doubted; but the country is full of able men who have not been so successful as Mr. Schwab simply because they have not been favored with equal opportunities. The truth is that the career of Mr. Schwab is interwoven with the element of chance or "luck". His first substantial promotion was due to the accident of a sympathetic voice and a taking rendering of popular songs that fell soft and soothing upon the ears of his chief, the sick steel king, Carnegie. Since then his rise has been rapid until he was placed at the head of the gigantic steel trust.</p>
   <p>Since his elevation to the presidency of the steel corporation, Mr. Schwab has <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>favored the people with his views upon important public questions. He has instructed young men how to achieve success--permitting them to believe that the instructions were merely the epitomized lessons of his own life. Before numerous gatherings of businessmen he has discussed modern industrial conditions, especially the principles and merits of concentration and combination. Upon his return from Europe he will be in position to enrich and spice his discourses with illustrations of his experiences at Monte Carlo. Knowing, as every thinking man does, that gambling in any form is one of the greatest obstacles to the success of young men, Mr. Schwab may emphasize this truth by pointing to himself as the conspicuous exception. And when he again speaks to businessmen on trusts, he may, with his Monte Carlo lessons fresh in his mind, truthfully say that, while Monte Carlo is the greatest gambling trust in the world, the modern industrial trusts, as organized and conducted in the United States and other countries, present the strongest and most perfect union of advanced methods in gambling and business. And should anybody be rash enough to dispute his assertion he might appeal for succor <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to his worthy colleague and rival, John W. Gates of Chicago, who knows perhaps as much about trust making and gambling as Mr. Schwab himself.</p>
   <p>But the people who behold these great captains of industry stake, upon the turn of a card, thousands of dollars that they have not earned in the sweat of their brows--they may say, with Mr. Heire, the unique character in Ibsen's play, "The League of Youth," "It is a great comfort to see your money so well spent."</p>
