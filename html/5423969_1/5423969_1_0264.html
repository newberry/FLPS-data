   <p>At the district meeting of the United Norwegian Church, issues of great importance were discussed and several resolutions were passed.</p>
   <p>One point on the agenda, the question of the saloon traffic, caused a great deal of discussion. Reverend Jens C. Roseland opened the discussion. He was followed by several of the pastors present. A resolution, reading as follows, was introduced and passed:</p>
   <p>Resolution in Regard to Saloon Traffic</p>
   <p>1. The Chicago District of the Norwegian Lutheran Church in meeting assembled, February 25-27, hereby declares its unalterable opposition to the liquor saloon, and we stamp the saloon as an unmitigated evil that exerts a cursed influence upon the home, the state, and the church.</p>

   <p>2. The conference therefore exhorts all its members and members of its churches scrupulously to refrain from visiting or patronizing saloons.</p>
   <p>3. As American citizens it is our duty to seek the welfare of the state, and by expedient methods, not contrary to God's word, to work together to the end that the abominable saloon traffic may be utterly abolished.</p>
   <p>4. We urge upon the state legislature to incorporate the county feature into our present local option law.</p>
   <p>5. The conference urges upon all citizens, at the spring election, to cast their ballots in favor of the banishment of the saloon.</p>
   <p>The Committee:</p>
   <p>Jens C. Roseland</p>
   <p>L. A. Vigness</p>
   <p>George T. Rygh</p>
