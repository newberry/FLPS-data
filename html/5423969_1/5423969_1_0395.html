   <p>Mr. Thompson shows a decided preference for the schoolma'm above any other class of women. Now, unfortunately, I have never possessed the necessary accomplishments for obtaining or holding a position as a teacher, but I fully realize that a teacher occupies a very responsible position in society and that we should always be ready to praise her efforts and give her due honor and consideration. Certainly, none of us feel disposed to criticize Mr. Thompson for praising the work of the schoolma'm; we all entertain similar ideas in greater or lesser degree.</p>
   <p>But what, actually, is the social problem that Mr. Thompson has apparently so successfully solved to his own satisfaction? He is evidently not in search of the ideal schoolma'm, but is, or has been once upon a time, in search of an ideal wife, and he now wishes to impart some of his valuable experience to others.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>I do not wish to cast any discredit upon the profession of the schoolma'm, but I must frankly confess that, in my estimation, Mr. Thompson exhibits a greater amount of cheek and audacity than is usually found among social reformers of his class. He positively declares, "without any mental reservation," that in seeking for an ideal wife, "the schoolma'ms should inevitably be given the first consideration in making a choice." Schoolma'ms frequently get married, and it would not seem strange to anyone that Mr. Thompson should see fit to choose his "ideal" from their ranks; but it does seem strange, indeed, that he utterly ignores the many virtues that are found in women of other callings in life, and even finds occasion to speak of them in a derogatory way, and to dismiss them as ignorant and narrow-minded. We can well imagine how such assertions, entirely unfounded, strike the tender feelings of many a good cook or seamstress who is humbly and faithfully trying to supply those things that may call forth the sunshine of happiness, and cause it to be reflected upon the countenance of everyone around her.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thompson appeals to common sense. I wish to ask him to bring his common sense into play, and to tell us in what respect his favorite class is better <span class="page-break">3</span>fitted to maintain a good and happy home than a representative of any of the other classes that he mentions. Now, anyone who possesses just a little common sense and is willing to reason can readily see that there is a vast amount of difference between the home and the schoolroom. The work of the schoolma'm may resemble that of a mother in a few things, but in a great many things of equal weight and importance her work bears no relation to the happiness of the home. Is it not a fact that the work of the domestic, the dressmaker and the dishwasher stands more closely related to the duties of an ideal wife than does the work of anyone else, schoolma'ms not excepted? Not only the success and happiness of the home are dependent upon the work of these three classes, but even the success of a schoolma'm, as she performs her work in the schoolroom, is entirely dependent upon them.</p>
   <p>Then why should Mr. Thompson throw so much discredit upon these classes, and give the schoolma'm all honor for perpetuating the principles laid down by our forefathers? Does he really think that this precious inheritance would long be preserved, if it were not for the faithful and effective work of the domestic, the dressmaker, and the dishwasher? Does he really think that a <span class="page-break">4</span>few dry facts, gained through the study of history, literature, and so forth, and stored away in some corner of his ideal schoolma'm's head, are going to aid her in overcoming the various obstacles that she may possibly meet with in a home? Don't build too much upon these things; you may rue it when it is too late.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thompson says that Patrick Henry did not gain much knowledge by looking into the potato kettle. The potato kettle is not everything in a well-regulated home, but a home does not have everything unless it has a well-regulated potato kettle. Patrick Henry possibly did not gain a great amount of knowledge in his home, but he, as well as all of our truly great men, gained something of far greater value, something that forms good clean character, which can only be built up under the influence of a good home. You may praise the knowledge necessary for obtaining a second- or third-class certificate of a schoolma'm, and yet it will always remain an inadequate factor in the maintenance of a successful home. I simply ask you to place your multiplication table and table of logarithms alongside a table of well-prepared and tastefully arranged food, and then let anyone judge which of these will exert the greater influence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>It is useless to call one's attention to the fact that there are other accomplishments necessary in the formation and maintenance of a happy home than simply the ability to tell who was the first President; there are other duties than simply sharpening lead pencils and whitewashing blackboards. Yet, in the face of these self-evident facts, Mr. Thompson places these many good qualities and praiseworthy accomplishments beyond all consideration, and positively asserts that, in seeking an ideal, the garland of honor should be placed upon the head of a schoolma'm in preference to anyone else.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thompson evidently would think it disgraceful that his ideal should spend any of her time in the kitchen or the dressmaker's shop. Now, does he mean to say that, by reason of his favorite schoolma'm's knowing the particulars concerning the death of Sitting Bull, his bread will be of better quality, his butter possess a finer flavor, or the aroma of his coffee be more inviting, or does he mean to say that these attainments in a home are of no value? I do not mean to infer that it is impossible for a schoolma'm to become a good housekeeper, but we have every reason to believe that in preparing herself for her chosen profession, and later in following it, she will not pay any particular <span class="page-break">6</span>attention to domestic cares, and consequently cannot develop much in that direction.</p>
   <p>You talk about the development of the finer senses and the ability to talk intelligently along the various educational lines. But humanity is generally so constituted that these finer qualities are dependent upon one's physical being, and, consequently, in order to nourish these higher thoughts and finer feelings, one's physical wants must be supplied.</p>
   <p>The success and happiness of the human family is dependent upon all classes who pursue an honorable course; it is simply ridiculous for anyone to show contempt for one class and to honor another. The more one thinks of it, the more ridiculous it seems. For an illustration, we will suppose that Mr. Thompson's ideal was not the possessor of these ordinary and valueless accomplishments of the domestic and the dishwasher, as he seems inclined to put it, but instead was the possessor of what in his estimation constitutes a highly cultivated mind that can see and appreciate the beautiful and the sublime. Now, what would be the result if a ten-year-old boy should enter the dining room about <span class="page-break">7</span>six o'clock, with the expectation of getting a good supper, and, on finding that the table had not been cleared since their last meal, would enter the parlor and there find his mother deeply absorbed in reading Shakespeare or Dickens? Could she satisfy him by quoting select passages from either of these famous authors, by calling his attention to the Stars and Stripes in some part of the room, or by begging him to notice the glowing sunset and the beautiful colors of the rainbow? Will any of these things satisfy or even please him? No! He will simply cast a hasty glance at things in general, leave the room, and hasten to find one of his comrades, whose mother possibly never possessed the necessary ability to teach school. He will accompany him to his home, enjoy the hospitality there, get a good square meal, and feel satisfied. This is only human nature. When we return to our home after a day's work, possibly tired and hungry, the music of the frying pan and the sight of a well-arranged kitchen seem just as dear to us as the finest selection that may be rendered upon the piano. The latter is good, but the former must come first.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thompson apparently thinks that the term "education" involves only such <span class="page-break">8</span>knowledge as may be obtained from books. But education comprises something more than this. Every member of society who faithfully applies himself to the furtherance of a good cause is a truly educated man or woman. All classes are doing work of vital importance, and all are entitled to receive their due honor. It is, therefore, absolutely unreasonable to bestow honor upon one class of society at the expense of another. We will do well to bear in mind always that "Honor and fame from no condition rise", but that these are only a reward for an honest and faithful effort governed by a good intention. In closing, Mr. Thompson, we city girls should have some chance.</p>
