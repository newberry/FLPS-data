   <p>Whereas, The Scandinavians of Chicago by their experience in their respective native lands have had sufficient proof that municipal ownership is correct and practical; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Many candidates of the major parties support the policy of municipal ownership; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The Republican platform and the candidate for mayor on the Republican ticket favor further concessions to the traction companies and, as a result of these concessions, would give to these corporations control of these properties for at least a generation; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The Democratic Candidate for the office of mayor is opposed to <span class="page-break">\2</span>granting to the traction companies any concessions and will demand the purchase of said properties by the city at a reasonable price or immediate confiscation thereof; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The Scandinavian Nonpartisan Municipal Ownership League of Chicago is of the opinion that the program of the Republican party and its candidate for the office of mayor will prevent municipal ownership of the traction properties, while the Democratic party and its candidates will immediately begin to acquire the above-mentioned properties; be it therefore</p>
   <p>Resolved, By the Skandinavian Nonpartisan Municipal Ownership League of Chicago that we endorse Judge Dunne's candidacy for the office of mayor of Chicago, and that we request every Scandinavian voter to vote for the said [Democratic] candidate.</p>
