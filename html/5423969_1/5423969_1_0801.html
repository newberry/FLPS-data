   <p>Sweden is now the arena for a battle between labor and capital that, in proportion to the forces involved, is the most violent any country has ever witnessed. The fight is a national calamity for Sweden, and its consequences may well be comparable to those of a war. In one respect it is worse, for the struggle constitutes a civil war of the most vicious type.</p>
   <p>For a considerable period, negotiations proceeded between the employers and the workers, but so great was the bitterness and ill will prevailing that common sense could not find a hearing. The employers decided on a lockout, and the workers replied with a general strike.</p>
   <p>As the cable informs us, none of the parties will yield. The king tried to reason with both sides, but without success. Matters have reached a point <span class="page-break">\2</span>where a fight to the finish seems inevitable. And the results of such a fight have already appeared: distress among the workers, paralysis of business, and a hatred and bitterness between the classes which may last for a generation or more. And finally, when distress and despair have put an end to the patience of the people and to their willingness to sacrifice, then crime and violence will make their entrance.</p>
   <p>If modern society is to enjoy peaceful development, the state of war between capital and labor must be superseded by an arrangement by which it would become illegal to engage in a labor war until every means for peaceable solution of the dispute had been exhausted. Justice and common sense must be substituted for force and passion.</p>
