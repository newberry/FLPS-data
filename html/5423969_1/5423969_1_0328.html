   <p>Yesterday, a nine-year-old boy, Richard Miller, was found in an alley completely drunk and nearly frozen, with a half-empty pint of whisky in his pocket.</p>
   <p>This is getting to be a daily occurence especially in the downtown district. We wonder where these minors buy the liquor or who gives it to them.</p>
   <p>The law which passed not so long ago prohibiting the sale of intoxicating beverages should be enforced.</p>
