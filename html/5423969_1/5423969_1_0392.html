   <p>Often we have heard the remark from an experienced person. "Better die an old maid than marry a man who you are not sure will be true to you after marriage." Better never to marry than wed someone who would neglect and leave you to the tender mercies of the world. We have seen cases of girls, good, true and lovely, who have left their homes, the homes they love, to take up an abode with the man they love and who they think loves them. In a year or two he tires of her; his life becomes monotonous (as all things will if we do not do something to change them); he no longer sees the beauty in her face. Her hands, perhaps, are not so white as they were the day he married her, and he seeks other company.</p>
   <p>We ask: Can any man expect the women he marries always to stay the same? It cannot be. Beauty will fade, but underneath the outer layer there lies something deeper, the heart, true as steel, as true as the day he married her. Her loving patience, her untiring devotion to the man she loves never fade; they remain the same.</p>

   <p>We cannot for all our life see why some women are so obedient and kind to their husbands, when the latter actually do not deserve it. It puzzles us; it is the depth of love. We know of one instance of a wife who is perfectly lovely. She married the man she loved and to all outward appearances he also loves her, that is, when he is sober. Drink has led him astray. He stays out late at night. He does not think of the wife at home watching and waiting for him. She becomes nervous and worries. "Oh why does he not come?" He whom she calls lord is enjoying himself in company which she would not endure. He arrives home at last. The clock strikes one. She sweetly asks, "Where have you been?" He answers, "Oh, out having a good time." Do you think the average women would endure such action? We think not.</p>
   <p>Physically, woman is weaker than man, but not mentally. She has a right to her own thoughts and actions. We would, I am sure, try very hard to find a remedy for a man like that. Some people say a woman cannot be independent--that she must depend chiefly on the "stronger" sex. We do not think so. She can be independent after marriage as well as before. It is how you start in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>when you marry, that determines how your future life will be. If we follow the beautiful words, "Bear and forbear, love one another, do unto one as ye would the other do unto you", then all would be well. How much nicer to follow the Christian life! How much nicer to see two pulling together in the right path, and how bad to see one pulling the wrong way while the other struggles bravely onward and upward alone.</p>
   <p>But how intolerable to see the wife meekly bow to every word or command the husband may utter, as though she were a slave! I dread to think of it being thus. I would much rather see the other side, the bright and loving side; but we do not always see it. Such cases actually exist.</p>
