   <p>Those of our people who are not living too far away from the vacation school in the Washington School building ought to send their children to the school. It is true that one-half of the term is already over, but new pupils will be admitted at any time.</p>
   <p>No books are used in the vacation schools; all the instruction is practical. Many useful things are being taught the children there; the girls learn to cook, to sew, and to repair clothes. The boys learn cabinet and carpentry work, modelling, etc.</p>
   <p>The principal informed us that children from Scandinavian homes are the best pupils. They try to learn while some others, such as the Italians, prefer to play.</p>
   <p>Send your children to the vacation schools. They will find it interesting and at the same time learn things which will be helpful to them as long as they live.</p>
