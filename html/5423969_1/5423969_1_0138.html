   <p>There is a blemish on the escutcheon of Chicago's Norwegian colony. After years of endeavor we finally succeeded in having the Norwegian language admitted as an optional study in our high schools, but when examinations for the position as Norwegian instructor were announced, not one candidate volunteered. Can it be that none are competent, or is it simply a lack of proper interest in the cause?</p>
   <p>Examinations were held and appointments were made of Swedish, Bohemian, Spanish, and Polish instructors, while Norwegian, Italian, and Hebrew, will not be available at the opening of this school year. Another examination will be announced before Christmas, and it is sincerely hoped that at that time enough interest will be shown so that we may offer the Norwegian instruction for which we fought so hard to obtain.</p>
