   <p>The Luther College Club held its annual get-together. This yearly festival is always of great interest. The ranks of the graduates of Luther that met annually are thinning out; one by one the old ones die. The school's graduates are now spread all over the nation, but each big city has its Luther College Club, where the old-timers meet to discuss the old college days.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Luther College Club was organized in the 90's; it is now over twenty years old. It is said that the college yell and the college colors originated in the Chicago Club.</p>
   <p>It was quite interesting to hear these middle-aged and old men give the Luther yell with a gusto that many of the younger students could not equal.</p>
   <p>A war-song was written to a well-known Norwegian tune, and the song became very popular, but no one knew the author. Prof. J. C. M. Hansen, librarian <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>at the University of Chicago, tried to find out who the author was. He succeeded but refused to divulge the name of the author, who is now a Chicago judge. Well, we can guess.</p>
   <p>One of the pastimes of the members of the Club is to rib one another on the individual accent of each member. They carefully make notes of each error, such as ya for yes, yump for jump, etc.</p>
