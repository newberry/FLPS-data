   <p>There is a small group of businessmen between Erie Street and Ashland Avenue on Milwaukee Avenue who have petitioned against the erection of an Elevated structure on Milwaukee Avenue. The reason is that they believe people will use the Elevated trains to travel to the South Side to trade.</p>
   <p>We think that they are wrong in their attitude. An Elevated line on Milwaukee Avenue would increase the sale of real estate as far north as Armitage Road and as far west as Craigin village.</p>
   <p>People living quite far west on Lake Street claim that property values have already increased.</p>
   <p>We want to go on record as of the opinion that the Elevated lines should be built.</p>
