   <p>The Republicans take advanced ground on the great question of popular education. Their platform of this year contains the following plank on education:</p>
   <p>"We recommend to the next legislature the passage of such legislation as may be needed for the establishment of a system of rural and urban graded schools wherein as much instruction in the elements of agriculture, home economics, and manual training may be taught as it is possible to give, and the granting of liberal appropriations to encourage the development of such a system; and for the accomplishment of this work we recommend the creation of a rural state school board whose duties it shall be to foster and direct the establishment of such a system.</p>
   <p>"We favor the extension of agricultural schools and the teaching of branches <span class="page-break">\2</span>of scientific agriculture in the common schools throughout the state, to the end that we may conserve the great natural wealth of the soil, encourage agriculture and add to the wealth and prosperity of the people. We recommend that the system of secondary agricultural schools, consisting of the schools of agriculture, extended from time to time as conditions demand."</p>
   <p>As will be seen, the aim here set forth is to provide a better and more useful schooling for the children on the farm. In the neighboring state of Wisconsin, Captain W. M. Lewis, one of the Republican candidates for the gubernatorial nomination, makes a similar demand on behalf of the children of the cities. At a meeting of the Racine-Milwaukee [Republican Club], he gave an outline of his views on the leading issues of the day, including the question of popular education. We are now, he said, awakening to a new sense of brotherhood and a broader understanding of the rights of people. We are beginning to realize the mistakes of the past, and we can now see that the common good demands that we repair much of the damage <span class="page-break">\3</span>that was done in former years in the name of development. And he added: "To undo some of the things we have done, and to recast the public policy of a great state is a large task." Captain Lewis then proceeded to discuss the needs of industrial workers and their children, saying in part:</p>
   <p>"The program of work to be done might properly begin with an effort to broaden the opportunity of those who work, both by providing proper training and by providing against disabilities arising from the accidents of industry.</p>
   <p>"In our system of education we have provided for the training of young men and women who intend to enter learned professions. We have provided instruction for the budding lawyers, and courses in medicine for doctors in embryo. We have provided colleges of agriculture. We maintain at public expense schools of engineering. We even use public money to pay for the maintenance of schools of music. But these are for the few, and not for the many.</p>
   <p>"Not every young man can enter the legal profession or become a doctor, or <span class="page-break">\4</span>even an engineer. Some of them must work in the shops. Someone must do the world's work. Much of this work requires a high degree of skill and long years of apprenticeship. Surely our plan of education could be improved by making ample provision for the industrial education of those who must earn their living in the ranks of the skilled workers."</p>
   <p>That our great political parties and leading public men realize the necessity of better schools for our children is a victory for common sense, and evidence of a broadening understanding of the new problems we have to meet. We have spent vast sums of money in building up our educational system, and have also accomplished some great things in this field. We have fine and costly school buildings, excellent laboratories, and some good teachers, though most of our teachers seem to have been built on the alarm clock principle; and our children and young people get some benefit from their schooling. Yet it must be plain to any careful and close observer that our schools do not meet the needs of the young generation of our day. Our public schools lag far behind those of the Scandinavian countries, Germany, and other progressive countries of Europe; they are less practical, less <span class="page-break">\5</span>up-to-date, than corresponding schools abroad, and the teaching is not what it should or could be.</p>
   <p>The great weakness of our schools is that the children and young people are taught useless things and false standards of life. The instruction is not built upon the life and experience of the child; it does not foster respect for the work of the child's parents if they happen to be plain people who live by the sweat of their brows. The young people are pulled up by the roots, and come gradually to look upon their surroundings and conditions as something not worth their while. Hence their aim is to get away from any and all work that might soil their hands. They are thus weaned from work that is waiting for them with fair reward for honest efforts, instead of being fitted for pursuits that promise certain success. And what is the result? A host of more or less "well-educated" young people who think they are too good to work, but not always too proud to beg, and who are dissatisfied with themselves and everything else and no use to anybody.</p>
   <p>A more hard-headed, practical education is the most important of all necessary <span class="page-break">\6</span>reforms. The Republicans have blazed a path for such a reform, and Captain Lewis has shown that city children have equally strong claims upon practical training for what is likely to be their life work. Together, these utterances form a complete program for a reform of our system of popular education, than which none is more necessary or more far-reaching in its effects upon the welfare of our country and the happiness of our people.</p>
