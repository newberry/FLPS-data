   <p>The Chicago Luther College Club held its annual meeting last Tuesday evening at the LaSalle Hotel.</p>
   <p>Twenty-seven former Luther College students were present, among them such well-known figures as Reverend Alfred Johnson, M. O. Johnson, and M. O. Ylvisaker, the president of the Club.</p>
   <p>The chief topic of the evening was, "Shall we erect a library building at Luther College?" J. C. M. Hansen and Dr. Ludvig Hektoen, members of the Luther College alumni, and the library committee, pointed out the necessity of such a building. They maintained with great emphasis that if the building were not decided upon, there was a distinct possibility that the valuable books, documents, and paintings at Luther would eventually be lost. The library at Luther has doubled in size during the last year or two; it now houses one of the largest collection of Norwegian books in America, being surpassed in this respect <span class="page-break">\2</span>only by the Harvard University Library and The Library of Congress. Including Bishop Bang's library, Luther College has 30,000 volumes, 4,000 of which are in the museum.</p>
   <p>A committee was set up to handle the financial end of the matter. The committee consists of such able men as Reverend N. M. Ylvisaker, Dr. Torrison, Dr. M. A. Unseth, Reverend J. O. Tweten, J. G. Steensland, and Karl T. Jacobsen.</p>
