   <p>Many valuable contributions to Scandia come from the pen of Olaf Ray. He writes:</p>
   <p>"The Social Democrat of March 21st contains a violent attack on the proposal that the city council take upon themselves the responsibility of promoting a living wage and congenial working conditions for city and public utility employes. The Socialists have preached the living wage theory for years, but when another group approaches the same end via another path, they (the Socialists) are up in arms against the proposition.</p>
   <p>"We approach a question with the idea of gradual, though permanent, betterment; and we are willing to change the method to achieve the ultimate end, but the Socialist group wants to reach the end in one grand headlong rush that may easily wreck not only the purpose-but the Party as well. We, on the other hand, find it safer and better to build around the hill than to gather at the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>hill and try to argue it out of existance. They order the hill to get out of the way or seek to blow it up; we would rather go around and prove the old saying that 'the longer way around is the safer way home.' The Socialist appeal to the worker seems inconsistent in this instance, where the idea back of the whole proposal is for the betterment of the man who works for his living, regardless of whether he swings a pick and shovel or pushes a pen."</p>
   <p>"If one would eliminate an evil, he must first destroy the source, or make such corrections as are found necessary. Why not, then, start the correction of city affairs in the council, and include necessary action regarding public utility abuses? One who becomes violently radical on a subject finds it impossible to work with practical people, and in the majority of cases, they (violent radicals) are so in love with their faith in the correctness of their own imaginings that they become totally blind."</p>
