   <p>The Knights of Labor warned Mayor Harrison that if he did not pass [sic] ordinances in favor of labor he would be defeated in the next election.</p>

They have now more than five thousand assemblies throughout the country, and are organizing additional assemblies right along. There is no doubt but they will be a factor in the next national election, especially if they indorse the new National Labor party.</p>
