   <p>The Seamen's Union held its twenty-second annual dance at Scandia Hall last Saturday evening. The attendance was large and it was easily understood why the sailors, after having spent a long season at sea, were anxious to have fun together in a gay, respectable manner. Mr. John C. Rossow's orchestra played throughout the evening.</p>
