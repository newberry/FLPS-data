   <p>In looking over some recent copies of Skandinaven, I came across Halvar Olesen's article entitled "Temperance, A Nuisance". Of course Mr. Olesen does not mean that temperance is a nuisance, but rather the methods that the temperance people use. I must acknowledge that there is more truth than poetry in his assertion. The present condition of the liquor traffic as well as other commercial articles of dissipation is carried on in a ruinous way for the sake of individual gain, and will end in ruin.</p>
   <p>Max Nordau thinks every so-called civilized nation will be crazy by the year 2300; and then from what we see around us we may often be justified in thinking that the human race will be extinct long before that time.</p>

   <p>If we do not soon adopt some scientific way of living, our race will no doubt go the same way that the now extinct races have gone before us. A social and commercial system whose principles is "One's prosperity is another's ruin," cannot preserve any race.</p>
