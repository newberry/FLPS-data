   <p>Editor Scandia:</p>
   <p>The writer craves the editor's indulgence once more regarding the now famous case of Erickson vs. Olson sisters. It is only to be hoped it does not reach such an age as Jaindyce vs. Jaindyce in Dicken's "Bleak House".</p>
   <p>With a Bjornsonsque attitude, Mr. Alfred O. Erickson stands, a statue to the spirit of Comstockery, prejudice and provincialism.</p>
   <p>By stretching the imagination to the farthest point, one is all at sea as to where these dialectians can be such a menace to mankind in general and the Norwegians in particular.</p>
   <p>It seems to me that such agitation as Mr. Erickson stirs up would tend to make large sales for the Olsons' new book "Just for Fun".</p>

   <p>Some time ago a similar campaign on a large scale boosted the sales of Dreiser's "The Genius" and Cabell's "Jurgen".</p>
   <p>Raquel Meeler with her Spanish dialect songs, Balieff with his ridiculous English in "Chauve Souris," Nazimova with her pidgin English, Gertrude Lawrance, Beatrice Lillie and the hordes of Jewish, German, and Irish dialect comedians--what will now be their fate?</p>
   <p>Those prefering "Hail, Hail, the Gang's all here"--or its equivalent, are quite welcome to their taste.</p>
   <p>Intolerence and reactionism run rampant throughout the world, but it will finally run its ridicoulous course.</p>
