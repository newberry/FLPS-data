   <p>It is said that at the present time more children in high school study Latin than any other subject except algebra. The Latin course is a study of the structure of a language, a branch of philology, instead of a study content. The child has no lively interest in the life of the people whose language he studies. The translation method interferes with the growth of the vernacular. Instead of broadening the pupil by the possession of two languages, the effect upon him is that his English becomes a mixture of Latin and modern forms. To satisfy a normal desire for self-expression, the pupil has a tendency to break away from this hybrid into slang or bombast. The high-school student can never think in Latin, and therefore his translation work is usually very poor.</p>
   <p>A language is something in which one feels and thinks about living, present-day questions. Latin is antiquated in content and can therefore never perform such <span class="page-break">2</span>a function. It is and always must be a dead language, a shadow, instead of a reality. The study of Latin introduces the youth to a heathen spiritual life, which may have a demoralizing influence on him.</p>
   <p>It puts dry, formal, empty study into that period of a youth's life when he most strongly needs intellectual and emotional food.</p>
   <p>In high schools modern languages ought to be studied instead of dead languages A modern language expresses a living reality and is acquired beyond the translation stage; and thus the child may actually have two languages in which he can think and express himself freely.</p>
   <p>In linguistic study the best results are obtained only when the pupil can think in the language and speak it fluently. Such command of a language is a straight road to many intellectual fields not open to those who speak only one language.</p>

   <p>Most pupils who study Norwegian in our high schools are children of Norwegian parentage, who in their households acquire a little knowledge of this language before they enter school. With some knowledge of the language before they enter school. With some knowledge of the language before taking it up as a study in school they can, other things being equal, accomplish two or three times as much as they would be able to accomplish if studying a language entirely strange to them. With such basic knowledge they ought after a few years' study in high school to be able to read and write and speak the language quite fluently. If the same pupils study German or French or any other language that is entirely strange to them, they will never be able, in the same length of time, to learn more than the mere rudiments of it; they will get only a smattering which they will entirely forget within a short time after leaving school.</p>
   <p>Reasons Why Children Sould Study Norwegian</p>
   <p>If pupils of Norwegian parentage study Norwegian in high school, they add to the store of knowledge which they already have and leave school enriched by <span class="page-break">4</span>the possession of a language which they have mastered, and which they would entirely forget if they had not taken it up as a course in high school. This will be of great practical value to them subsequently, whether they enter business or learn a profession. They who can speak to a man in his own language are more likely to get an audience than they who cannot do so.</p>
   <p>One who really knows the Norwegian language may read the vigorous Norse literature in the original, and enjoy it in a way that he never could if reading a translation.</p>
   <p>The first generation of Norwegian-Americans ought not to grow up unacquainted with the rich literature, folklore, and national music of their parents. This great heritage should not be surrendered as soon as the emigrant is transplanted to American soil. Let him keep what is good. It will be a valuable asset when the melting pot begins to perform its work, the formation of a new race in America. There is nothing un-American or unpatriotic in holding this view.</p>

   <p>Making Norwegian an elective study in the high school on a par with German and French will create a new relationship between parent and child in Norwegian households. The children will have greater regard for their ancestors, and therefore they will have more respect for the opinion of their parents and obey them more willingly than before. They will no longer feel that their parental language is inferior to the other, cultural languages. They will not, as is frequently the case now, be ashamed to admit that they are of Norse parentage. They will be as proud of their ancestors and their language as German children are of theirs.</p>
   <p>The study of Norwegian will build a new bridge between Norse households and the school. The parents will have a new interest in higher education. Gudrun and Ole will be permitted to remain in high school until they complete the full course of study. After all, the sacrifice necessary to keep them there is not now so great as it seemed before.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>It is said that colleges and universities will not accept Norwegian for credit in admitting students. This is not altogether true. Many of our best colleges and universities teach Norwegian and accept it as a credit for admission.</p>
   <p>But the primary function of the high school is not to prepare for college. Only a very few high school graduates are fortunate enough to attend college. Most of them, after being graduated from high school, have to earn their own living; and the high school should prepare them for this as well as is possible.</p>
   <p>One of the functions of the high school is to satisfy local wants. A rural high school should not attempt to do the same work that a city high school does; and not all city high schools should try to do precisely the same kind of work. Local demands ought to be considered.</p>
   <p>If a particular community has a large Norwegian population, there is no good reason why instruction in that language should not be given if the <span class="page-break">7</span>Norwegians of that community desire it. But if the Norwegian people want Norwegian in the high schools, they must encourage their children to study the language. They must not expect that others will encourage them to do so.</p>
