   <p>As regards the question of whether we will get Norwegian teachers for our high schools, the prospects are bright and we may see classes in Norwegian at our high schools as soon as they reconvene after the Christmas holidays. Last fall there were no applicants for the position of teacher of our mother tongue, but now we have the application of Absalour Erdahl, a graduate of St. Olaf College, at Red Wing, Minn., and a student at the Illinois University, where he has been preparing himself for the coming examinations of the Board of Education. Professor Flour, with whom Mr. Erdahl has been studying, speaks very highly of this young man's ability, and we sincerely hope that no new obstacles will be put on the way of those wishing to learn Norwegian. All that is needed now is for parents and students to show their interest by enrolling in the classes.</p>
