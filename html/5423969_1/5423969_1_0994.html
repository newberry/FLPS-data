   <p>Members of the "Dovre Club" (Norwegian-American Republican Club) met at Cedric Hall on Thursday last and unanimously declared their support of Theo. Roosevelt for president in spite of the Republican affiliation and Roosevelt's party now being the Bull Moose. The "Dovre" resolution reads in part: "Roosevelt for President, and Deneen for Governor! was the decision made at the Primary. "Dovre" backs this decision 100%."
