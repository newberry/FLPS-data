   <p>The convention of the American Association of Teachers was recently held in Denver, Colorado. A number of speeches were delivered on a variety of questions relative to the schools, and the speeches caused considerable discussion.</p>
   <p>As far as one is able to gather from the present rather meager reports, our leading educators are beginning to realize that the educational system of our country is not at all what it should be. Sharp criticism was leveled against the present system of college education, or, rather, against the spirit prevailing among the youth seeking a college education.</p>
   <p>A prominent professor of the University of Chicago stated that a thorough education is no longer the chief aim of this type of youth. The idea seems to be to cheat one's way through college, to get a diploma to flaunt in people's faces; <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the attainment of knowledge is a minor matter. His statement was challenged, but, on the other hand, he was not at all alone in his attitude.</p>
   <p>The most important branch of the educational system, however, is not the schools of higher learning, but the public schools. Of these, Mr. Edwin Cooley, former superintendent of schools in Chicago, says that they completely fail of their purpose. "We are educating," he said, "two million children to fill the job now held by President Taft, and thirty million children are being educated for no purpose."</p>
   <p>In this he was completely right; he might have used still stronger words without being guilty of exaggeration. Most of the two millions are incapable of any good work at all, until they get rid of much of the nonsense they learned in the high schools. A large number of the thirty millions are trained for less than nothing at all, because they are being educated away from honest work instead of for honest work; yet honest work must ever be the main job for most of us.</p>

   <p>The American system of education, with its wealth of impractical fads in keeping with the prevailing spirit of gambling and commercialism, would have spoiled the country if we had not had the immigrants. They have done the greater part of the very necessary labor in America during the past fifty years.</p>
   <p>Signs of the dawn of a new era are at hand, however. Our country has every requisite needed to develop the best and most practical school system in the world, and if only our eyes are kept open for the shortcomings prevailing, we may have reasonable hope that the mistakes will be corrected.</p>
