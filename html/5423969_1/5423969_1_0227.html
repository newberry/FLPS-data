  <p>Mr. Hauman G. Haugan, who donated a considerable sum last year to finance the summer vacation for boys of the Christiania Orphanage, has again shown his generosity and bigheartedness. He recently donated five thousand dollars to the Lutheran College endowment fund, the largest individual sum given. Professor [H. G.] Stub, of the school, has, during the past fifteen months traveled, all over the United States on a one-man campaign to raise a fund of two hundred thousand dollars as an endowment. This task was undertaken by Professor H. G. Stub in answer to a challenge by J. J. Hill, of railroad fame, who promised to donate fifty thousand dollars to the fund if the Lutheran Church would raise two hundred thousand dollars. The optimism, courage, and unflagging zeal of the professor has carried him over the top; he has not only raised the amount set but an additional thirty-six thousand dollars, which will be used to pay the debt of the Church. The endowment fund of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars (including J. J. Hill's fifty
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> thousand dollars), will be invested so as to bring an annual income of twelve thousand five hundred dollars, to be used for a College extension program, remodeling refurnishing, etc. In raising this vast sum singlehandedly, the valiant professor has completed a gigantic task worthy of a dozen good men, and Norwegian America owes him a debt of gratitude which it can never repay. Words fail us--we can only say, "Thank you and well done".</p>
   <p>We cannot, in justice, dismiss Mr. Haugan with the simple mention of his donation. This grand friend is a typical Norseman, energetic, a deep thinker, a man with a vision and the heart to bring about the realization of the vision. Any worthy cause can depend upon the help of this outstanding member of our Chicago Norwegian-American colony.</p>
