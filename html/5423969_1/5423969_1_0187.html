   <p>The Chicago Luther College Club celebrated the graduation of a number of Chicagoans last night at the University Club. The delegates to the pastors conference of the Norwegian Synod were invited; all of the delegates are graduates of Luther College. The festivities began about six o'clock, and the older alumni had an opportunity to meet former classmates and to get acquainted with the younger set.</p>
   <p>The president of the Chicago Luther College Club, Reverend N. M. Yluisaker, delivered a warm and well-appreciated speech of welcome. He stated that all of those present were college boys once again, and all titles must be forgotten.....The only exception being the dean of Luther College, who was the guest of honor. Mr. J. M. Hanson, librarian of the University of Chicago, was toastmaster, and what a toastmaster! He was the wittiest of the witty, especially when he introduced speakers who had been in his class.</p>
