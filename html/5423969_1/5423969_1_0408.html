   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"There has been quite a lot said about nearly every topic of interest to us young people in the young people's department of the Skandinaven; but not one subject has occupied so little attention, though it is of such vital importance to us boys, as the question: What kind of girl should we marry?</p>
   <p>"Now, we find the girls making a lot of noise about tobacco, intoxicating liquor, and the language question. As to the language question, I believe that in our press we should write in Norwegian. As for the other two, I believe there is a habit that is worse than either, and which is generally overlooked though it is found quite extensively among the girls. Why not point out their shortcomings too? Surely, they do not consider themselves exempt from criticism.</p>
   <p>"Now let me explain what I am endeavoring to get at. When a boy gets the 'dangerous' notion into his head that he wants to select a 'better half', the first thing that he should think of, if he is an intelligent boy, is a schoolma'm.</p>
   <p>"But if he be narrow-minded, then my advice is, do not attempt to bring one of this kind in, as he is more than apt to meet with disappointment. But, again there are altogether too many of us boys who throw ourselves away by going into partnership with girls who are unable to read and write. I mean the country girls; the city girls are no good, anyway, whether educated or not. The modern schoolma'm should inevitably be given first consideration in making the choice. They are clever, plucky, smart, but first and last, they are well-educated, which is the basis of civilization. They have patience to spare, because while working at their vocation, it has been tried and tested every day for months, which is plain to anyone who knows the first thing about a school room.</p>
   <p>"Why should not these precious creatures come first? Why should a smart and bright young man marry ignorance when there are so many schoolma'ms who are candidates? I know a country where there are girls raised at the very doorsteps of schoolhouses who can hardly write their names. A young man using tobacco can find a legitimate cure for the habit, but when it comes to ignorance in the way of neglected education among the girls who have such splendid opportunities in a land where free schools are as numerous as they are necessary, then I, for one, draw the line as far as excuses go.</p>
   <p>"I do not maintain that all boys are well-educated; but I do hold that a boy, with reason, has a right to demand that his 'better half' should possess a good school education. Why? The girls of our rural districts have fifty chances to every one the boys have to avail themselves of our schools.</p>
   <p>"With the comparison just mentioned in view, we find, as far as knowledge goes, the balance of credit is in favor of the boy. Talk about tobacco, alcohol, etc. may be all right; but remove the beam out of your own eye first. If you have no education keep still about the Indian weed at least. Do not abuse us poor fellows in scathing language when there is a grave and lamentable defect in your own make-up. I do not use it, still, I believe the limited education predominant among the fair sex throughout the urban parts of our country, is by far the worse of the two.</p>
   <p>Boys, I say again, remember the schoolma'ms when you intend to 'enlist'. You have no use whatever for a girl without education. I know I have not. A schoolma'm is what you want. They will say there are not enough to go around; but there is no reason why you should marry ignorance.</p>
   <p>"Now, girls, do not dig up flaws in the make-up of us boys, but look after your own fences first."</p>
