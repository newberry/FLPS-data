   <p>The ticket presented by the Republican County Convention might have been worse; it might also have been far better. It is not the work of accident; as it appears now, it is the fruit of careful planning by the party leaders. From top to bottom, the ticket is the result of the wishes of these men.</p>
   <p>Considered from the point of view of the honesty and ability of the candidates selected, the present ticket is similar to most of its predecessors: some of the names on the ticket are very good; but the ticket also contains names which should not have been given place on it. The Convention evidently was giving primary consideration to the importance of giving to the various nationalities proportionate representation on the ticket. Of course, the Irish were not forgotten; are they ever forgotten where there is a question of distributing jobs? The Germans, too, received everything which they could demand, and <span class="page-break">2</span>then some. Also the Swedes are satisfied, and with good reason.</p>
   <p>When, however, the question arose as to meeting the just demands of the Norwegians, the Convention, or rather the Republican leaders, said no. As mentioned before, the Norwegians had only one candidate, Mr. Peter M. Balken, who sought the nomination for a position as County Commissioner. It is a comparatively unimportant office, but it was all that was asked by the Norwegians.</p>
   <p>Several changes were arranged for in the composition of the County Board, and for this reason it would have been comparatively easy to find a place for Mr. Balken. But the Republican leaders said no. They found place for a former bartender and agent for the Louisiana Lottery; but not for the honest and able Mr. Balken. It was found suitable to nominate a contractor of the type of Mr. Burke; but it did not seem suitable to nominate an honest man who would have had an eye solely to the welfare of the County.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians will weigh the matter of these nominations and then decide what <span class="page-break">3</span>to do. Skandinaven does not like this new disregard of the just claims of the Norwegians, and the paper believes that the majority of the Norwegians will take a similar attitude.</p>
