   <p>At the conference of the Norwegian Lutheran Synod, the educational program was discussed. The educational committees of Luther College, the Lutheran Seminary, the Lutheran Normal School, the academies, and the Ladies' Seminary considered the various school problems for the coming year.</p>
   <p>The finances of the Synod were likewise discussed.....Reverend H. V. Hustvedt was elected treasurer by acclamation.</p>
   <p>It was decided to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Luther College.....Latin has been added to the four-year course in languages, and a three-year course in Norwegian has been instituted.</p>
   <p>The Lutheran Seminary received a donation of $6,500; of this amount $5,000 was a gift from Johan Rosholt.....The committee resolved that the course at the Seminary <span class="page-break">2</span>should be extended to six years instead of five, and that the summer school be made a permanent part of the normal branch.....</p>
   <p>It was decided to publicize the Ladies' Seminary.....It was found that more women missionaries were needed, and it would therefore be necessary to broaden the work of the Ladies' Seminary.</p>
