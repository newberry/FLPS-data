   <p>The Erie Branch of the Tabitha Hospital Society passed the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Because a certain group has viciously and unlawfully stolen the power in the Tabitha Hospital Society; and, Because this group wishes to raise finances through lotteries, dances, and the sale of intoxicating liquors, we have unanimously resolved to withdraw in a body from the Society."</p>
   <p>The Erie Branch is the first to take this step; will others follow?</p>
