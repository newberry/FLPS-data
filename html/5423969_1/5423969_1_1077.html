   <p>Tomorrow, then, is the day of battle over the new charter of Chicago. The vote, as people will learn, concerns not only the city itself, and not the rest of Cook County.</p>
   <p>In a question such as the present one, everybody ought to make his opinion felt. If the new character is adopted, the form of government for the city will have been decided for years to come. And also, the question of who is to rule the city, will have been decided for years to come. The new charter gives the politicians a hold on the city even more complete than at the present time. Up till now, the politcians have been thrashing the people merely with little whips. Under the proposed charter, they will be using the Russian Knout. It is up to the people whether the politicians are to have this dangerous power. Many of the working-men will have difficulty in getting to their polling places on this occasion, since they are not getting the legal "time off," but it is to be hoped that as many as possible will vote.</p>
   <p>Chicago needs a new charter, but in order to get a good charter the
    <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> present proposal needs to be voted down.</p>
    <p>Proponents of the proposal claim that the legislature will not bother about Chicago again for years to come. They have no authority to speak in behalf of the legislature; their assertion is an insult to the legislature. Anybody will know that the assertion is nonsense.</p>
    <p>Use your vote tomorrow!</p>
    <p>The question at issue is the rights of the common people, or, rather, what remains of their rights.</p>
    <p>Vote as early as possible. The polls open at six o'clock in the morning. Be at the polls at the opening hour!</p>
