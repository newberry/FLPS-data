   <p>"Dovre Klubben", the Norwegian Republican Club of the 27th Ward, held an important meeting at Kimball Hall on Thursday evening, Oct. 19th. Due to the desire of Dr. Quales to withdraw from the West Parks Board, Gov. Deneen intends to appoint and outstanding Norseman to succeed him. The recommendation of "Dovre Klubben" will, no doubt, determine who is to be the new appointee.</p>
