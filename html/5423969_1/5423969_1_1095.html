   <p>Citizens who depend exclusively upon the Harrison newspapers and Mr. Harrison's speeches for information about the traction question as an issue in the pending campaign, have been led to believe that Judge Hanecy and Mr. Harrison represent radically different policies. The speeches of the Republican candidate and his terse and explicit statements of his position have been suppressed or garbled in order to keep people in ignorance.</p>
   <p>The truth is, as well-informed voters know, that Judge Hanecy is pledged to a policy that is not only more practical but also more favorable to the cause of the people than is that of Mr. Harrison. To be sure, it is difficult to say exactly where Mr. Harrison stands. His utterances have been as vague and hazy as those of Mr. Hanecy are clear and definite. He has talked volubly around the question but has said very little that has been to the point. Assuming <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that the pledge of the Municipal Voters' League, which he has signed, is an adequate expression of his convictions, the franchise policies of the opposing candidates compare as follows:</p>
   <p>Harrison's Platform</p>
   <p>"I believe that the following conditions should apply to all grants or extensions of street railway franchises:</p>
   <p>"The terms shall in no case exceed twenty years; all franchises to a given corporation shall expire at the same time; no franchise for branch lines shall run beyond the time when the franchise for the main line expires.</p>
   <p>"The city shall receive a fair percentage of gross receipts.</p>
   <p>"Fares for the crowded hours of the day shall be reduced.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"The council shall retain power to make reasonable regulations of the service.</p>
   <p>"The city shall have the right to acquire ownership of the lines at the end of the grant at a price representing the fair value of the tangible property of the companies for railroad purposes.</p>
   <p>"All franchises shall provide for uniformity and publicity of accounts.</p>
   <p>"The companies shall expressly waive all claims or rights under the so-called ninety-nine year act.</p>
   <p>"I believe that the foregoing principles should apply to grants to all public service corporations."</p>
   <p>Hanecy's Platform</p>
   <p>"I will compel the traction companies to pay the people full and fair compensation <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>for the privileges they have or may get in the streets of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"No franchise will be granted for a longer period than twenty years.</p>
   <p>"I will compel the traction companies to furnish better facilities and more of them for the public.</p>
   <p>"I will compel the traction companies to give transfers to carry the passengers to their destinations for one fare.</p>
   <p>"I will compel the traction companies to give the people lower fares.</p>
   <p>"I will send men to examine their books and thus ascertain at what rate they can afford to carry passengers. Then I will force them to institute that rate.</p>
   <p>"As mayor, I will veto any ordinance that does not give to the people these rights.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"In the present state of our civil service and of public affairs generally, I am not in favor of immediate municipal ownership. The object of municipal ownership is to give the people the best service at the least expense to them. Municipal ownership would make many places for political adherents of the administration in power, but this does not commend itself to the people. If the city has the right to regulate and lower fares, the chief object of municipal ownership is attained without any of its risks or uncertainties. That the city has the power to regulate fares was determined in Rogers Park Water Company versus Fergus, decided by me in 1898."</p>
   <p>The plain people, especially all people of small means, will have no difficulty in making their choice between these platforms. Mr. Harrison is academic, Hanecy practical. Harrison gives expression to theories, Hanecy talks business. Harrison tells what he believes, Hanecy states what he will do. Under the law, franchises cannot be granted for longer terms than twenty years, and as a matter of course and necessity both candidates will comply with the law in this respect.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Harrison demands the Council shall retain power to make reasonable regulations of the service. This demand is superfluous. Under the decision rendered by Judge Hanecy in 1898 and now affirmed by the Supreme Court not even a boodle council could barter away the right.</p>
   <p>Harrison demands a fair percentage of gross receipts for the city (?) and reduced fares during the crowded hours of the day. That is all he has to say concerning compensation and the quality and the price of the service.</p>
   <p>Hanecy will compel the companies to pay the people full and fair compensation, to furnish better facilities and more of them, to give universal transfers and lower fares, the rate to be determined by the actual cost of the service; and he will veto any ordinance that does not give the people these rights.</p>
   <p>There can be no doubt that Hanecy's policy is the better for the people. Mr. Harrison's plan will not give the people lower fares or better service. If <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>the compensation is to be paid to the city in the form of gross receipts, there will be more money for City Hall gangs to squander, but the people will get no benefit whatever from it: they cannot obtain the cheapest and best service under such an arrangement.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, under Judge Hanecy's plan the compensation will be paid direct to the people in the form of better facilities, lower fares, and universal transfers. Every home, every worker, every school child, every shop girl, every section of the city, and especially the outlying districts, will share equally in the benefits under this arrangement; while under Harrison's plan political retainers and hangers-on will be the sole benefactors.</p>
   <p>The other planks in the Harrison platform are mere buncombe. The ninety-nine year act is dead and buried. Municipal ownership is merely an academic question. Not even the most sanguine optimist expects such rapid improvement in our municipal government and conditions generally that the city would be ready to assume <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>the ownership and operation of our interurban railways in twenty years. In this respect also Judge Hanecy's policy is the safer and better. It will "attain the chief object of municipal ownership without any of the risks and uncertainties".</p>
   <p>Harrison's scheme is unpractical and weak; it would benefit the "gang", but not the people.</p>
   <p>Hanecy's policy is practical and strong. It would give the people what they need and want: effective control of the street railways, full compensation, cheap and adequate service; it would "save the streets" to the people in the best and broadest sense of the term.</p>
