   <p>Editor of Skandinaven</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: An article headed "A Malicious Falsehood" in the September 25 issue of your paper has been called to my attention. The article reflects upon the Northwestern Emigrant Agent and its publisher, myself. I write simply to inform you that to place anything "malicious" in my humble little paper has ever been farthest from my mind. In fact, I have always striven to avoid anything of the kind. Therefore, while I feel greatly flattered that such a large and eminent publication as yours should even notice my paper, the criticism is undeserved. I beg to inform you that the article in question was a digest of one which appeared previously in the Minneapolis Times, and I looked upon it merely as a rather interesting item. If you really think that the said article was malicious,I wish to heartily assure you, a representative Scandinavian of the Northwest, that the alleged malice was purely unintentional on my part. I trust that you will in a few lines give my paper credit for this apology if, you can consistently do so.</p>
   <p>Regretting that any article I have published, even though innocently used, should have caused any ill feeling whatsoever, I am,</p>
   <p>Your respectfully,</p>
   <p>J. V. Daniels.</p>
   <p>Until Mr. Daniels' apology has been published in "my paper" in due form no "credit" is due.</p>
   <p>Mr. Daniels claims to be the publisher of the sheet in question; but the paper itself says that it is published by the Emmigrant News Company. Inasmuch as it takes more than one person to make a "company", either Mr. Daniels or "my paper" must be fibbing. Some may assert that both are guilty of this sin--that neither Mr. Daniels nor any "company" is the real publisher.</p>
   <p>Mr. Daniels says he looked upon the falsehood "as merely a rather interesting item". Whether it was true or false was a question that did not bother him. He is now anxious to use the Times for a shield. But is it not a fact that Mr. Daniels wrote the "interesting item" for the Times and later transferred it from the Times to the columns of "my paper".</p>
   <p>Mr. Daniels knows as much about the people in the "little villages of Scandinavia" as does the average Scandinavian farmer about the little villages of Roumania or any other country where strong Jewish settlements are found. If the average Scandinavian farmer should state, in a real or alleged newspaper, that such Jewish villages are "plentifully sprinkled with mental wrecks", there would be prima facie evidence of bad faith on his part and he would be a liar and a malicious slanderer. And that is exactly Mr. Daniels' position. The character of the article coupled with Mr. Daniels' lack of knowledge of life in the Scandinavian countries are prima facie evidence of bad faith.</p>
   <p>This paper shall look for a retraction that will retract, for corrections that will correct, and for apologies that apologize.</p>
