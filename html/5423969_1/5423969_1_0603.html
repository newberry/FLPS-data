   <p>Rebates, free passes, and overcapitalization are three of the worst abuses within the railroad world here in this country.</p>
   <p>The granting of rebates has been a dangerous evil in the business world. Through the simple means of rebates, railroads have been able to kill competition both between individuals and cities. Ordinarily, the effect has been to strengthen the strong and destroy the weak. Theodore Roosevelt has done more than any other individual to kill the rebate nuisance.</p>
   <p>By means of free passes, the railroads have been able to acquire undue influence over legislators and other public officials, including judges. This abuse, too, has been checked or eliminated through legislation, federal as well as state.</p>
   
   <p>The question of overcapitalization is now well on the way toward solution. Individual states--Wisconsin, for example--have accomplished a good deal in this direction, and the Federal Government, too, is awake to the situation. President Roosevelt had constantly hammered away at the problem, and President Taft, in his inaugural address, declared that it is important to have laws adopted soon to prohibit overcapitalization in the future. It is to be hoped that Congress will adopt such a law when it convenes in the fall for its regular session. We are progressing.</p>
