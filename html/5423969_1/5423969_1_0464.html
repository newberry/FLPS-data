   <p>The editor of the Danish weekly Revyen [The Review] tries to increase his prestige by calling his paper Danish-Norwegian. His knowledge of Norway is less than nothing. He is absolutely ignorant of Norway's geography and history. He has published the following news item:</p>
   <p>"In a gale near Roraas [Norway] 35 men and 60 boats were lost in the harbor."</p>
   <p>So he alleges, notwithstanding the fact that Roraas is at an elevation of 6000 feet in the mountains.</p>
