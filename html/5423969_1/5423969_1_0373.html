   <p>Dear Sir: The opening of a department for the young people in your paper has met with high appreciation and is a most commendable undertaking, which will add still more interest to your splendid paper.</p>
   <p>A writer in Skandinaven of June 23rd asks "Is dancing right?"</p>
   <p>This is a great social problem which requires a calm and deliberate consideration.</p>
   <p>Amusement is just as essential and imperative to proper development of body <span class="page-break">2</span>and mind as is food and clothing. Why? Because it is founded in human nature</p>
   <p>What kind of amusement is most natural and will give the best recreation to mind and body?</p>
   <p>Let me suggest dance for a while.</p>
   <p>Dance, I believe, is the most natural because it has followed man through all ages as far back as history can penetrate and down to the present time, when it has become one of the most popular amusements of society.</p>
   <p>What is dance? It is simply keeping time to music with bodily motion. Very simple, is it not? Shall we then encourage it after it has been condemned from the pulpit and family circles, as far back as you and I can remember? I say, yes. No other amusement gives a better recreation, because dance is the natural offspring of the heart; its harmonious movements help develop perfect grace in all our bodily motions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Physicians have given their opinions that it is the most healthful of all exercises, bringing into play and gentle action all the muscles of the back and limbs, and exhilarating the mind and the brain by cheerful, inspiring music and agreeable accompaniment of beauty.</p>
   <p>Now, young readers, it is not my object to uphold all kinds of dancing. Like all amusements it is abused: excess, late hours, and profligate associates make it fall into disrepute. But I believe that where enjoyed moderately, it is a beneficial pastime. It would be a proper idea to build halls for the young to dance in, with strict rules against late hours, excessive dancing, and the use of liquor. That would bring young people of both sexes together, which would do much towards raising their moral standard, as a youngster will never use vulgar or profane language in the presence of a lady, but on the other hand will develop the good and gentle qualities of his nature.</p>
   <p>A prominent pastor once asked: "What better company do you want for your boy than that of a good girl?" Women always temper society with grace and softness, <span class="page-break">4</span>and so in the dance hall.</p>
   <p>Closing my letter, I will thank the Skandinaven for the opportunity it is giving the youth, hoping that much good may result from the discussion in these columns.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>A Young Reader.</p>
