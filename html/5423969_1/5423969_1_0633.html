   <p>President Roosevelt's Decoration Day speech in Indianapolis has stirred the attention here and abroad to an unusual degree. It is not easy for a man who speaks as much and as often as President Roosevelt to say anything new, or to repeat what has been said before in a manner which compels people to listen. But the whole country has been listening to the latest speech by the President although it is merely a resume of statements he has made on earlier occasions concerning the railroad question, or, rather, about the relation of the federal government to the railroad corporations.</p>
   <p>In a matter like this, two objectives must be kept in view. First, illegal actions by the railroad corporations, in the past, must be punished; second, necessary reforms must be undertaken and carried through in such a manner as to disturb the business life of the nation as little as possible, and avoiding <span class="page-break">2</span>interference with the healthy development of the railroad systems of the country. In his speech, the president discusses both these phases of the question. He repeats, what he has often emphasized before, that the government is not carrying on a war against railroads or railroad men who are striving to obey the laws and to conduct the railroad business for the benefit of the people and the shareholders instead of making them the playthings of Wall Street spectulators. He states that the vast majority of railroad men in the country are capable and honest men, and that our railroads as a whole, in spite of the many instances of abuse and of infractions of the law, are worth more than the total of their stock value and their mortgages.</p>
   <p>Money is needed for improvements, and people may safely invest their money for such purposes, if only they have assurance that the money is to be used for the right end.</p>
   <p>The objective of these statements was to put at ease the financial interests here and abroad, and it is evident that the objective has been reached.</p>

   <p>But at the same time the President took a forward step in regard to the question of governmental control of the railroads. He declared that such control must be intensified and extended by new laws. First of all,the government must get reliable information about the actual value of the roads, Second, the government must supervise the refinancing of the railroads in order to ascertain that the new capital is used for new buildings and other improvements, and for nothing else.</p>
   <p>The national government should supervise the railroads as closely as it now supervises the national banks. Mr. Roosevelt is not at all doubting the power of the congress to enact laws necessary to this end. The constitutional authorization for this he finds in the paragraph giving the congress the right to build and supervise post roads. Since all the railroads are mail carriers, the railroads belong, according to the president, in the category of post roads. This view was expressed some time ago, by an attorney in Louisiana. As is easily seen, it is very broad in its applications. The President has adopted this view, and it <span class="page-break">4</span>is probable that the majority in the cabinet share his opinion on the matter.</p>
   <p>As regards the question of new legislation concerning control of the railroads, the President's speech in Indianapolis is more far reaching than any of his earlier utterances. It is evident that the cry from Wall Street has not intimidated him, that he is not minded to stop half ways, but that he will continue his course, as hitherto. And it is a remarkable fact that the most prominent railroad men in the country are in agreement with him. This shows what a radical change has taken place in the conception of these questions in but a few years. One railroad president declares that nine-tenths of the people are in agreement with the President. We believe his is right.</p>
   <p>The conviction is also speedily gaining ground that Federal control must supersede State control must supersede State control completely in this matter. Divided control can only breed weakness and confusion. There are many who still cling to the old doctrine of state rights, but their number is dwindling. If we are to get uniform, systematic, vigorous, and able control of our railroads, the states must retreat. Even in the south, this view is gradually being accepted.</p>

   <p>This presidential speech will form the centre of the platform at the coming election. The railroad policy - is the dividing issue.</p>
