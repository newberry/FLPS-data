   <p>There are two groups of people here in Chicago who should have something to say on the recent Russian revelations.</p>
   <p>Speak up, Dr. Karl Sandberg [Norwegian], Juul Christensen [Dane], and Niels Kjaer [Dane]!</p>
   <p>First comes the Radical Socialist group, which has been praising the Bolsheviki (and rightly so) and seeing in the "proletarian revolution" which brought Lenin and Trotsky into leadership the one beneficial episode of the Great War.</p>
   <p>Well, they do not believe the rumors that the proletarian revolution was <span class="page-break">2</span>a sham, bought and paid for by the general staff in Berlin; nor do they believe that Lenin and Trotsky are and have been German agents and therefore agents of the most sordid brand of imperialism, nor that every move of the Bolshevik game was made at the instance of Germany for the express purpose of reducing Russia to impotence. They still hope to bring Bolshevism to America.</p>
   <p>Another group, also represented among the Scandinavians, includes the "experts" (?) on Russian affairs, those amusing gentlemen [Kvist, Olsen, etc.] who have complained that the western powers "did not understand Russia," who have talked learnedly of the Slavic temperament and of the difficulties of an agricultural country at war and have insisted that though the Bolshevik government very probably is crooked, we should recognize it in order to win it from its ways and to keep in touch with Russian affairs.</p>
   <p>We wonder what the gentlemen expect from the Western powers, whose only <span class="page-break">3</span>thought is to crush the Bolshevik revolution, and how they expect an entire people to change a political line because of them.</p>
   <p>So far both groups have maintained a dead silence. But it is not yet too late to speak. Begin; gentlemen! You have the floor.</p>
