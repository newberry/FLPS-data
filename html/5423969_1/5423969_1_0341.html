   <p>The Daily Jewish Press [sic] has made a sudden switch from Merriam to Harrison. The editor, who was a Republican presidential elector in 1908, explains that he has taken this step to protect the Jewish merchants on the West Side who keep their places of business open on Sundays. He is afraid, he says, that Mr. Merriam, if elected, would compel them to close on Sundays, and thus interfere with their business.</p>
   <p>If it were in doubt, it would have been easy for the Daily Jewish Press to find out whether it need harbor any fears on this account. A direct question put to Mr. Merriam would undoubtedly have brought a direct, straightforward answer. But it is difficult to see how any observer of fair intelligence can be in doubt on this point. The public record of Mr. Merriam in connection with his specific statements and pledges during the present campaign prove conclusively that it would not even occur to him, if elected, to interfere with the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>business of the Jewish merchants. The apparent insincerity, or over-nervousness of our contemporary, is further emphasized by its professed horror at the alleged hypocrisy of the so-called "Farwell knock".</p>
   <p>Mr. Farwell's opposition to Mr. Merriam on questions concerning the handling of the liquor problem is an old story which anyone who really wants to know the facts can easily ascertain for himself. But the Press, apparently, did not care to be troubled with looking up the facts; evidently it was much easier and more agreeable to accept the Harrison campaign claim that Mr. Farwell's statement was made to order and for the purpose of allaying the fears of the "personal liberty" people. And having accepted this view, the Press exclaims:</p>
   <p>"Was there ever a clearer case of hypocrisy proven? Does Mr. Farwell think that the people who love personal liberty can be blindfolded in such manner? Does Farwell think that the great foreign population of Chicago which has <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>come from European countries will trust their rights and liberties to a man like Professor Merriam just because Farwell says he is against him? The foreign-born citizens of Chicago are too intelligent to be misled in such a way."</p>
   <p>The silliness of the question betrays the great travail of its birth. But if it is brave enough to print such nonsense, the Press is entitled to the honors it will bring. However, when it assumes to speak for the foreign-born citizens of Chicago in general, the Skandinaven desires to state that the Daily Jewish Press holds no brief for the Norwegians of this city. They really know some-thing of political and personal liberty, because their fatherland for some hundred years has had the freest constitution of any country in Europe, and because Norway is a pure democracy and a leader in political and social reforms.</p>
   <p>In common with other good citizens, the Norwegians of Chicago are foes of waste, graft, and incompetence in our city government. Realizing that Chicago, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>now as much as at any other time, needs an honest, able, and fearless man of progressive views in the mayor's chair, they support Alderman Merriam with practical unanimity. They are surprised at fellow citizens who permit themselves to be misled by this will-o' -the-wisp that parades under the name of "personal liberty". Anyone who cares, knows that personal liberty is in no danger in Chicago, whether Merriam or Harrison is elected. The question at issue, in so far as these two men and their respective policies are concerned, is not personal liberty, but good or indifferent government.</p>
   <p>The "personal liberty" advocates are seeing things in broad daylight. They are working themselves into a frenzied hysteria on the slightest provocation, or no provocation at all. An outsider who did not know that the majority of these people are good, law-abiding citizens might be tempted to believe that the very existence of Chicago and its government depends upon beer-guzzling.</p>
   <p>It is time that these well-meaning citizens cease to advocate a "personal liberty" that means that everybody else must think and act and live and eat and <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>drink and sleep and snore and otherwise do exactly as they do in all matters, or suffer political death. Unless they are ready to concede others the same liberty they demand for themselves, they cannot consistently pose as champions of any kind of liberty, but will become a foe to real liberty and a menace to good government.</p>
   <p>All good citizens, "personal liberty" people as well as other people, will serve themselves and the city best by voting for Charles E. Merriam for mayor.</p>
