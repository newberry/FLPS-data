   <p>The city has finally decided that larger sewer pipes should be installed throughout the city.</p>
   <p>We are happy to see that the Sewer Department and not the Health Department is at last waking up.</p>
   <p>But the sewerage system is way behind the growth of the city. Many sections are not yet served by even an inadequate system. And what is worse is the fact that streets are paved before the sewers are installed. This is a waste of time and money.</p>
