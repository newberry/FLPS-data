   <p>Dear Sir: The first thing I read in your paper is the youth column. I believe your idea is good.</p>
   <p>The letters and articles on dancing were very timely. The main argument against dancing is that the youth get into bad company, many start to drink and to fight. The girls are often led to do things they should not do, and learn vices that are bad for their health. And last but not least, the church is against dancing. The youth must have better pastimes.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>M.</p>
