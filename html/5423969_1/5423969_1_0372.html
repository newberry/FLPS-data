   <p>Mr. Editor: I appreciate your invitation to our youth to write in your columns, and I will give you my opinion of dancing.</p>
   <p>I do not believe that dancing will hurt the youth, but I do believe that it should be prohibited because:(1) It does hurt them because of late hours, [they catch] colds because of perspiration;(2) It leads to drink, bad company, vulgar language, etc.</p>
   <p>Why not, in place of dancing, give the youth music, discussions and youth clubs?</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>A. T.</p>
