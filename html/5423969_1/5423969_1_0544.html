   <p>On Saturday there was a new election of directors for the World's Fair. All directors but five were reelected. One of those turned down was Paul O. Stensland. He was the only representative of the Scandinavians on the World's Fair Committee. We were only allowed one representative. The Scandinavians are very upset over this. There are more Scandinavians in Chicago than Irish, but we seem to be nobody. We don't know the reason why, but we feel it is a national disgrace. We were treated like stepchildren.</p>
