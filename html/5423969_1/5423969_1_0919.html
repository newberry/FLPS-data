   <p>"The late 'Popocratic party' [derisive term applying to those Democrats who supported the platform of the Populist Party in 1896], having lost the 'Pop' part of its name, has adopted a more appropriate prefix, and it is now the 'Anarcratic party'.</p>
   <p>"The A B C of the Democracy of 1896-97 is:</p>
   <p>Altgeld--Anarchist;</p>
   <p>Bryan--Bombast;</p>
   <p>Coxey--Communist;</p>
   <p>Debs--Demagogue."</p>
   <p>This [quotation] is probably intended to be witty; but it is no easy matter to discover where the wit comes in. [The term] "Anar-cratic" is nothing but silly <span class="page-break">\2</span>drivel, devoid of sense or meaning. It is best not to "monkey with Greek" when you know nothing of the language. The "Democracy" does not need any prefix in order to indicate its kinship to Anarchy. Both are reared on the same foundation. "The least government possible is the best government possible" is the cardinal principle of the Democratic party and of Anarchism. It may interest the Literary Bureau [of the Republican party] to know that the Republican party bears a similar relationship to socialism.</p>
   <p>John P. Altgeld is not an anarchist; he is a socialist. Illinois never had a governor who wanted to govern more than he did. He was bound to boss and rule everything and everybody. None of his appointees dared sneeze unless they received his special permission, and every democrat in Illinois was supposed to learn from him what to think and what not to think, or whether he was permitted to think at all. His management of the state's finances was extremely bad, resulting in widespread corruption throughout the state. And yet, with all his mistakes--mismanagement of the public funds and other faults--many Republicans regard him as a better governor than his Republican successor.</p>

   <p>Bryan is a bombastic. But if the Literary Bureau thinks that Bryan is all "Bombast," it is making a mistake. He is the most eloquent, if not the most powerful, champion of a cause that a year ago received the support of some six million American voters, and he may be chosen to oppose William McKinley in 1900.</p>
   <p>"Gen." Coxey is unduly honored by the assumption that he knows anything about communism.</p>
   <p>As for Debs--he would represent nothing but demagogism if he were speaking and acting in bad faith. But because it is he, we must assume that he is sincere and means well. However, he is a rather ignorant and unbalanced dreamer whose power for good or evil is a thing of the past.</p>
   <p>It will be much safer for the Literary Bureau to present specific facts rather than indulge in irresponsible witticisms that lack nothing but wit.</p>
