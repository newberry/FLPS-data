   <p>The Scandinavians of Ward Seventeen held a meeting last Wednesday evening at 219 Grand Avenue, concerning today's primary election. The intention is to try to break the present Republican political machine, and the general opinion was that the only way to do this is to work for the election of Judge Orrin N. Carter as governor of Illinois. In the second district of Ward Seventeen, where the majority are Scandinavians, it is felt that there is no doubt the Judge Carter will get a majority of the votes cast. It was decided that the Scandinavians choose their own committeeman in order to deprive the Republican machine of its power. The Republican machine has ruled the Ward for many years. Appeal was made to all Scandinavians to vote today, and to mark their ballots for Judge Carter.</p>
