   <p>Dear Sir: We all know it is a sin to dance; but there are other things that are just as bad as dancing. Take for instance the use of intoxicating drinks. Every young girl should make up her mind not to associate with young men who are under the influence of intoxicating drinks. Let us have more pride about us than to associate with such. In most cases the girls are just as much to blame as the boys; the girls keep company with them just the same if they are intoxicated, so the boys think it is all right. Most boys would prefer the girl's company to that of the bottle. If they found out that they could not associate with both, they would prefer the girls and quit drinking.</p>
