   <p>It has been proposed that elevated railroads be built in Chicago. The common council has been petitioned for permission to erect same.</p>
   <p>1. South Side and Blue Island Elevated Road Company with a capital of three million dollars. The line to run from Market Street and Van Buren to Lake Street, on Lake to South Water Street and on Dearborn Street south to city limits.</p>
   <p>2. North Chicago and Evanston Elevated Railroad Company, with a capital of two million dollars, to run from the river at North Wells along Lincoln Park to city limits.</p>
   <p>3. West Chicago Elevated Railroad Company, with a capital of three million <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>dollars, to run from the river at Madison Street west to city limits, with branch lines on Ogden and Milwaukee avenues.</p>
   <p>We join in the general protest against the erection of these proposed railroads. We have learned that in New York the building of these "El" roads spoiled the neighborhoods in which they were built, and decreased the value of real estate tremendously.</p>
   <p>We want to point out that Madison Street, for example, would have to close more than two thousand stores, and would no longer be a business street.</p>
   <p>These "roads" would only be of value to "real estate speculators" who are stuck with worthless property in the suburbs.</p>
