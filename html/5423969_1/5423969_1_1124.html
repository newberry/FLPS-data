   <p>The Chicago's Norwegian colony now has two members on the School Board, Mr. Sethness and Mr. Sonsteby. Under the circumstances it should not be difficult to have one or two of the city's new higher schools named in honor of a great Norwegian. Every other nationality in Chicago has had schools named for their heroes or big men; the Germans have their Gothe, Schiller, Mozart and Wagner; the Italians their Dante; the Danes their H. C. Andersen; the Polish their Kosciusko and Copernicus, and the Swedes their Linne.</p>
   <p>It should soon be the turn of the Norwegians but nothing seems to have been done to bring this about. True, we have grade schools named for Ole Thorp and H. A. Haugan but these men were honored as good citizens of Chicago, not as Norwegians. The names we desire to perpetuate among our younger present and future generations are those of real great men: Bjornson, Ibsen or Edw. Grieg, men who are world famous for accomplishments in their respective fields, and <span class="page-break">2</span>whose contributions are such as live forever in the memory of man. We, in whose views runs the blood of the ancient vikings, will back our two representatives to the utmost in any effort they may put forth to perpetuate the memory of our great compatriots.</p>
