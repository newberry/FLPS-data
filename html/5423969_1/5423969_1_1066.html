   <p>The Progressive Party in Chicago inserted a very good plank in their platform for the spring election. We refer to the following statement:</p>
   <p>"Employes of the city of Chicago are entitled to a rate of pay sufficient to secure for them a decent standard of living, and they should be paid at least semi-monthly."</p>
   <p>The Party also demands that all corporations establish an adequate page rate for all employes, and [urges] city supervision of rates.</p>
   <p>And this sounds fine; the idea and the theory are good, but the actual enactment and application of the idea and theory is the big doubt. This section of the platform, proposed by Olaf Ray, was accepted by the Central Committee, and Progressive aldermanic candidates are bound by the platform; but, to repeat, will they apply the idea?</p>
