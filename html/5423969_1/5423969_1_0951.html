   <p>The Norwegian Republican club of the 28th Ward has been, as usual, campaigning a great deal for some of the so-called Republicans running for various offices in the ward and in the congressional and senatorial districts.</p>
   <p>At a rather stormy meeting last week, the following board was elected: S. Matson, president; N. C. Bye, Andrew Ericson, and I. P. Houland; vice-presidents; M. A. Michaelson, secretary; W. Mogensen, treasurer; A. Satrang, and Charles Dahl, sergeants at arms.</p>
   <p>We have often wondered why so many vice-presidents are necessary on an executive board. Also, why the necessity of two sergeant at arms. Well, maybe they need the two "policemen" to keep order.</p>
