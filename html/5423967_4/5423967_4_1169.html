   <p>In order to get first hand information about the Baptist movement among the Russian immigrants of Chicago, I visited on Sunday, August 22, 1937, the First Russian Baptist Church of Chicago, at 2646 Ogden Avenue. I intended to interview Rev. N. Siberiakoff, the pastor of this church, but he happened to be visiting some other religious gathering, and nobody knew when he would return. When I came to the meeting place at 2646 Ogden Avenue, a Bible Study Class for adults was being conducted by Mr. Jacob P. Nemirovich, Senior Deacon of the church. After the meeting I asked Mr. Nemirovich to give me some information about the history of the Baptist movement in the Russian colony. He could give me better information than Rev. Siberiakoff, the pastor, as the latter has resided in Chicago only since 1935, whereas Mr. Nemirovich has been a resident of Chicago almost continually since the year 1914. Mr. Nemirovich gave me the following information: (The interview with Mr. Nemirovich lasted about 1 1/2 hours).</p>

   <p>Biography. Yakov Pavlovich Nemirovich was born in Russia. in the province of Grodno, Pruzhansky county, in the village Yalova, in 1896. In Russia he had only attended the parochial school in his village. In 1913 he emigrated to America, and came to Chicago. Here he joined the small Russian community of Evangelical Christians of which Rev. Kyusev, a Bulgarian, was at that time a preacher. In 1914 Mr. Nemirovich went to New York. There he joined the Russian Baptist community. He returned to Chicago in 1918.</p>
   <p>For some time Mr. Nemirovich resided in Wheaton, Ill., where he graduated from the public school. After that he studied two years at the Wheaton Academy (a high school). Later he came to Chicago and has been active in the Baptist movement. He is now the senior deacon of the First Russian Baptist Church.</p>

   <p>History of the Russian Baptist Community in Chicago. The origin of the Russian Baptist community in Chicago is intimately connected with the history of the spreading of Protestant Evangelical Christianity among the Russian immigrants of Chicago. One of the first, if not the first, to spread these teachings was the Bulgarian preacher Kyusev who for some time had been working with the American Baptists. In 1913 he organized in Chicago a small community of Russian Evangelical Christians. They held their meetings on Halsted, near 17th street. In 1914 or 1915 there came from Russia to Chicago several Russian Baptists who joined this small band of Evangelical Christians. But soon some dissensions arose. The reason was that the Baptists insisted on accepting new members only after having ascertained that they had experienced a real conversion and were leading a truly Christian life, while the Evangelical Christians were not as strict in observing this rule. There was also another reason: The Baptists desired to have the rite of the "breaking of bread" performed every Sunday, while the <span class="page-break">4</span>Evangelical Christians held that it should be performed only once a month.</p>
   <p>These dissensions led to a secession of the Baptists. They formed a separate community under the leadership of the young Russian Baptist Schubert. The preacher Kyusev remained with the Evangelical Christians. The Baptists held their meetings on Throop Street; the Evangelical Christians remained on Halsted, near 17th street, and later moved to 14th street, between Union street and Jefferson street. After the secession of the Baptists the community of the Evangelical Christians experienced for some time great difficulties. Things began to improve, however, after they had invited a good preacher from New York, by the name of Yaroshevich.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile the small band of Russian Baptists was increasing. (Unfortunately, Mr. Nemirovich could not give me any exact figures as to its growth). The Baptists moved their quarters from Throop Street <span class="page-break">5</span>to the corner of Division Street and Hoyne Avenue. In the beginning of the year 1918 the preacher Schubert left Chicago, and Marusich took his place.</p>
   <p>In the spring of the year 1918 the well known Russian Baptist preacher, Rev. W. A. Fetler, came to Chicago. He succeeded in reconciling the Chicago Russian Baptists with the Evangelical Christians. The two communities were again fused into one. Yaroshevich remained preacher. The meetings of this larger group were held in a building situated on the corner of Hoyne Avenue and Division Street.</p>
   <p>There remained, however, a small group of strict Baptists who held separate meetings on 14th Street, between Union Street and Jefferson Street. Their leaders were Shipul, I. P. Memirovich, and Victor Narkevich. Narkevich soon left for Milwaukee, and his place was taken by Ivan Kolesnikov, who had come from Canada, and later (about 1925) by Jacob Prigodich. The place of meetings was moved first to <span class="page-break">6</span>the corner of Damen Avenue and Evergreen Street, still later to 1607 S. California Avenue, and ultimately, in July 1936, to 2646 Ogden Avenue (near Douglas Park). Since 1935 Rev. N. Siberiakoff, who has come to Chicago from California, is the pastor of this Russian Baptist community which has joined the American "Chicago Baptist Association" (with headquarters at 203 N. Wabash Avenue) and is called now "The First Russian Baptist Church of Chicago, Ill." It has now about 30 regular members.</p>
