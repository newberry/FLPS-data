   <p>The agency of Krestross (The Peasant's Russia) declares that the protests of the workers in Russia are increasing. The disorders arise not only from economic conditions but from political grounds as well. The Russian laborers strike not only because of their dragging, starving existence, and because they are working for the government bureaucracy and communists (not only Russians, but also foreigners) for a mere pittance, but also because in the country, there is present unbearable political pressure, the most black oppression, that cannot be compared with any that exists in any of the capitalist countries.</p>
   <p>The disorders of the laborers are increasing in all of the industrial centers. For this reason the central committee of the Vserossiiskaia <span class="page-break">\2</span>Komunisticheskaia Partia (The All-Russian Communist Party) sent to those centers several responsible communists, who, as before, attempted to feed the workers with the usual promises, and to frighten them with "the preparedness for attack on the U.S.S.R. by the International Capitalists". But the workers answered to all of these threats that the capitalists would not attack the U.S.S.R. now because the Bolsheviki are at present very close to them and are their best friends.</p>
   <p>Neither the workers nor the peasants are afraid of war, for they and others say: "Let us only have rifles in our hands, then we will find out what kind of enemy shall be destroyed first of all."</p>
   <p>The latest decrees of the government about reorganizing the methods of supplying the workers with provisions and necessities, that is that they should be transferred to the administration of the mills, did not improve the situation. For example: the commissariat of labor submitted to the Sovnarkom (The Soviet of People's Commissars) a report on the results of <span class="page-break">\3</span>the latest decree concerning the transfer to the administration of the mills of the duties of supplying the workers with necessities. This report explained that the majority of the government distributing stations for workers were deprived of any possibility of fulfilling their duties not only because of the lack of co-operation from the sources of supply, but also because of the general food crisis. Meanwhile, the liquidation of the workers' distributing stations and the transfer of the duties of supplying the workers to the administration of the mills only provoked additional conflict between the workers and the administration of the mills.</p>
   <p>The result of this report was a decision to consolidate the duties of the workers' distributing stations with the administration of the mills.</p>
   <p>According to the information received, the All-Russian Central Socialist Party Union (sic) received from Moscow professional circles innumerable reports that a new law regarding workers' fines provoked only increasing <span class="page-break">\4</span>conflicts within government industries, reducing production. The workers, who previously during their frequent absences, had gone to the nearest villages in order to obtain their rations, now, with the inducement arising from the new regulation concerning workers' fines, and irritated by the minor delays in the distribution of supplies, rebelled and did not come to work. The professional unions in the provinces interceded to substitute, until the liquidation of the general food crisis, the discharge of the workers with a recommendation that they be fined two days' wages for the second day of absence, and a motion was passed to double the fine for the third.</p>
   <p>The declaration that the delivery of manufactured products would affect only those leading workers who had maintained their leadership for not less than two years, provoked the eighth general strike in a year at the large Nizhne-Dneprovskii Metallurgicheskii Zavod Imeni Dzerdzhinskogo (The Lower Dnieper Dzerdzhinskii Metallurgical Works).</p>

   <p>The investigation of the cause of the general strike of the textile workers in the middle of last November, in the Bogorodskii district of the Moscow province declared that the strike was provoked by illegal deduction of provisional rations as for instance: during thirteen days the workers, except for receiving a two pound loaf per day, and two remittances of potatoes of two pounds each, did not receive any other food.</p>
   <p>The peasants' uprising had a mass character. Recently, the revolt of the Buban Cossacks in the Kuban province resulted in entire villages being banished to the North, to concentration camps, and last week a revolt of the peasants in Siberia burst out, and to crush it an army of 20, 000 men was dispatched there.</p>
   <p>All these facts show that the Bolshevik regime is maintained only with the support of bayonets. But it cannot exist by bayonets very long. At present, the bayonets point towards the workers and peasants, but soon they may turn against the Bolsheviki.</p>
