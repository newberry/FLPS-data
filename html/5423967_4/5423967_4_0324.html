   <p>There are, in the United States, many groups and special committees whose aim it is to bring aid to political prisoners in various countries. The Italians collect funds to aid political prisoners in Italy; the Spaniards are helping political prisoners in Spain; the Germans collect money to aid their countrymen in prison for political offenses. There are Socialist committees, Anarchist committees, Communist committees and others, soliciting funds to aid political prisoners.</p>
   <p>A few years ago there existed in Detroit, a Russian committee to aid political prisoners and political exiles in Russia. It is to be regretted that this committee has ceased to exist; hence, the Russian political prisoners are forgotten men. No one collects any funds or does anything else to improve the lot of those dying a slow death in Bolshevik prisons and in Siberian exile. And, once they are forgotten by their own countrymen, they <span class="page-break">\2</span>cannot expect any help from anywhere, as all the existing committees are concerned with aiding only their own racial or national kin.</p>
   <p>In no other country in the world are there so many political prisoners as in Soviet Russia. In other countries there are scores, hundreds or thousands of political prisoners, but in Russia there are hundreds of thousands of these unfortunate people, suffering most horrible indignities in addition to hunger and disease. They perish from starvation, from cold, from heavy forced labor and from various maladies and infections.</p>
   <p>It would seem reasonable to suppose that the Russian group in America would undertake some truly heroic measures to ease the lot of the victims of Bolshevik despotism; but, alas, nothing is being done in this direction, not even as much as is being accomplished by the Italians, the Spaniards, or even the Bulgarians, whose number in this country is indeed small as compared to the number of Russians in America.</p>
   <p>It is futile to attribute our lack of interest to the hard times or to the <span class="page-break">\3</span>poverty of our people. The same hard times are being experienced by other national groups, and yet, these other groups are achieving outstanding results in their efforts to aid their political prisoners, while we do nothing.</p>
   <p>This indifference on the part of our people in America toward the suffering of political prisoners and exiles in Russia cannot be excused, either, by the fact that an overwhelming majority of our group is anti-Bolshevik, and always talks of the necessity of a "decisive struggle with Bolshevism". It is obvious that those living in America cannot fight Bolshevism in Russia by active participation in the struggle. But they can aid indirectly by giving financial and moral support to those engaged in the actual fight against Bolshevism in Russia.</p>
   <p>It is hoped and desired that the former Detroit committee will return to life, and will again raise money for the aid of political prisoners and political exiles in Soviet Russia. But, if this committee has been completely dissolved, it is then necessary to organize a new committee of persons who enjoy the full confidence of the entire Russian group in this country. We <span class="page-break">\4</span>have no doubt that an appeal issued by such a committee would be answered promptly, if not by the entire Russian group, at least by its foremost and most prominent members.</p>
