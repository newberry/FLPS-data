   <p>In order to make easier the transportation of Russian political emigrants desiring to return to Russia there has been organized recently in Chicago a Conference consisting of representatives from fifteen Russian revolutionary and political organizations. The chief aim of this Conference is the issuing to political emigrants desiring to go back to Russia of papers certifying that they are bona fide political emigrants. Such certificates are necessary for the local Russian Consulate. The Russian Provisional Government ordered the consulates to give tickets and all necessary assistance to those Russian political emigrants who wanted to be repatriated. And in order to be sure in each individual case that the person applying for such aid is really a political emigrant, the consulate put itself in communication with the local organizations for the purpose of creating a center where all the information wanted could be obtained. Another aim of this Conference is the moral defense of those wishing to be repatriated and of their interests at the time of their departure.</p>
