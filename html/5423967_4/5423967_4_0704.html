   <p>When asked what he knew about the Russian "officers Union of Chicago," its origin, activities and present state, the General gave the following information: this union was organized in Chicago in 1925 on a non-political basis (having nothing to do either with Russian or American political parties) exclusively with the aim of mutual aid and the keeping up of the old Russian military traditions.</p>
   <p>As the majority of the Russian ex-officers had settled in New York, and those who had come from the Far East-in California, only a few Russian officers had come to Chicago. So the Union had comparatively few members--never more than 22. In spite of that some good work has been done by the Officer's Union while it was in existence. Over $3,000.00 were sent to Europe to give relief to Russian invalids and about $1,500.00 for the relief of the children and orphans of Russian emigrants in Europe, chiefly in Poland, Yugoslavia and France.</p>
   
   <p>The Union had no regular headquarters. Gen Cheslavsky was its president for eight years. At present the Russian "Officers Union" has been captured by the Chicago group of "Mladorossy" ("Young Russians,") a monarchistic organization with fascistic tendencies. Since this happened the Union has been more or less dormant. Its temporary president is Captain Roman Homko. No elections of a regular president have yet taken place.</p>
