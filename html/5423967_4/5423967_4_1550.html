   <p>On Thursday 24th, the Russian airplane "Strana Sovetov" (The Country of the Soviets), with fliers Shestakov, Bolotov, Fufaev, and Sterlingov, landed in Chicago. The fliers arrived at Glenview, at the Curtiss airport, where they were greeted by a large crowd of both American and Russian people. The fliers were in an excellent condition, even though they had fought hardships in their flight to Chicago and conquered a terrible hurricane. On their way here, the heroes and the ship survived despite considerable trouble. The fliers thanked the Americans for their cooperation and they were also grateful to the Russian Colony for their brotherly welcome.</p>
   <p>On Friday, October 25th, a luncheon sponsored by the American Aero-Club will be given in honor of the Russian fliers at the Palmer House.</p>
