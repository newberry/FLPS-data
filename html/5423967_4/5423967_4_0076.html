   <p>From this editorial we learn that four persons, Gubarevich, Krivoi, Kutsko and Flour were elected to represent the Chicago organizations in Philadelphia. These four were all Communists, and were elected by Bolshevist organizations that had nothing to do with mutual aid. No delegates representing the real non-partisan societies of mutual aid of Chicago were mentioned in the report of the organizing committee.</p>
