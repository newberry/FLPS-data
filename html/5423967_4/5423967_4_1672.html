   <p>Not very long ago we received a monthly periodical issued by the American Medical Association, Archives of Pathology, in which Dr. Nedzelnitsky has his new educational work printed under the title "The Spread (Breeding) of the Typhus Germs in the Gall Bladder, and Their Danger in Connection with the Change of Climate."</p>
