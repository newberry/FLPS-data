   <p>The Russians who have gathered at the 14th convention of the Independent People's Society are sitting quietly, in a dignified way.</p>
   <p>Forty-nine delegates from the various branches of the society have come to Chicago in order to solve the problems which have arisen in connection with their organization, "so that all should feel satisfied, and everything would be peaceful, quiet and done in a brotherly spirit."</p>
   <p>They elected a chairman.</p>
   <p>He proved to be a clever, serious and intelligent man. He knows how to conduct the sitting. No unnecessary shouting or commotion; no empty, useless talk. Everybody talks to the point, rationally and seriously, and, which is most important, after having thought over what he has to tell, so as not to lead the organization into a blind alley and not to offend anybody.</p>
   
   <p>Everything is done and said in a brotherly,friendly way. True, somebody spread the rumor, entirely without foundation, that a split had occurred in the society; but all the delegates blamed the person who had spread this rumor, and declared that there was no such split and that nobody intended to cause one. The delegates had gathered in order to strengthen the organization, to unite its members by still stronger bonds and to enlarge it, if possible.</p>
   <p>In the order of the business of the day the question about the debt of the orthodox parish of the Independent Society had to be considered.</p>
   <p>The question was solved.</p>
   <p>It was resolved that the parish need not pay the interest on the loan which had been accumulated during the current year.</p>
   <p>"We do that because we want to act in a brotherly way so as not to harm anybody."</p>
   
   <p>But at the same time it was said that the society has to pay the death benefits to the families of deceased members, that therefore the funds of the society must be increased and that because of this it is necessary that the parish which could dispose now of the interest should also help the society if the parishioners do not want to "sit on somebody else's neck."</p>
   <p>The next question in the order of the business of the day was the election of a new Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to leave in their offices the members of the old Board, as they deserved to be trusted and respected because of the good work they had done and the honest way in which they had taken care of the business and the interests of the society.</p>
   <p>This resolution passed by the delegates was a slap in the faces of those trouble-makers who had spread the rumor that "the members of the old Board of Directors are causing dissensions leading to a split."</p>
   <p>The society trusts those whom it had elected; and it is impossible "to shut other men's mouths; lot them go on with their useless babbling. Nobody listens to them."</p>
   <p>This peaceful and businesslike atmosphere was disturbed by just one discordant note: it was the speech of the priest Zheltonoga, who started to speak about the business of the organization, but as he went on began to discuss what is going on now at the Russian Orthodox Mission, and accused the Russian Herald, saying that this newspaper does not support us.</p>
   <p>But all that did not concern the convention. The delegates were discussing the business of the society. As to the attitude of the newspaper, Russian Herald, towards the society, that attitude is well known to all the members of the latter. It would be hardly fair to accuse this newspaper of not giving any support to the Independent Society.</p>
   <p>The priest left the session, saying that some business was forcing him to go and wishing that the work done by the convention would be profitable for the society.</p>
   <p>The parting was friendly.</p>
   <p>Towards five o'clock the session was adjourned; the next will take place on the following Sunday. The constitution and by-laws of the society will be revised, and, if necessary, some of the clauses which have become obsolete and sometimes even hamper the growth of the society will be amended.</p>
   <p>Such changes in the constitution have to be made carefully, after due deliberation. If the elimination or alteration of certain clauses can be really useful to the society, will attract new members and expand its activities, such changes can be welcomed. In such a case proceed with the amendments.</p>
   <p>But if these changes may do some harm, better do not start them.</p>
   <p>Consider well all the pros and cons. Without disputing and quarreling, with respect to the opinions of your opponents, discuss those things which are useful to the society and those that are harmful and hinder its activities, and only then make a decision.</p>
   <p>Nobody is going to decide for you. You have to do it yourselves.</p>
   <p>Be independent; do not be swayed by the influence of individuals who think about themselves, not about the society; do not listen to advice given to you either by the reds or the whites; act as your own reason and your own understanding of public welfare prompt you.</p>
   
   <p>If you have been able to create and to make grow your own Independent People's Society, you will also be able to to expand it and to carry on its business independently, without being tutored or bossed by anybody.</p>
