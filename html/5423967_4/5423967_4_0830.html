   <p>The last convention of the delegates of the R. N. M. A. S. [Russian National Mutual Aid Society], held in Chicago, has shown definitely that the bosses of this Society are working,without being urged, for the destruction of the R. U. M. A. S. [Russian United Mutual Aid Society]. After all, what worth has the resolution, adopted by the convention, for the unification of these two societies without proper consideration and discussion of this subject? And, generally, what is the value of all the decisions reached by the convention?</p>
   <p>The tenth convention of the R. N. M. A. S. appealed to the common members of the R. U. M. A. S. and the R. I. M. A. S. [Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society] to fight for a union of all these societies based on the principle that Bolshevism is the only true class organization, and this fact the convention did not even try to conceal. "Expose and fight to the finish the upper layer, the top of the R. U. M. A. S. and the R. I. M. A. S. and supporters <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the Roosevelt program," cried the Communist delegates at the convention.</p>
   <p>The acceptance of this Bolshevik program, however, would lead to the inevitable and complete ruin of both the R. U. M. A. S. and the R. I. M. A. S. These societies by their very structure cannot and may not embrace any political program. Yet, the R. N. M. A. S. [Communist organization] is striving openly for the destruction of all other Russian societies and is, therefore, the worst enemy of these societies, especially of the R. U. M. A. S. where evil forces have been operating secretly for some time. The R. U. M. A. S., instead of halfhearted and naive attempts to establish harmony, should undertake all measures to defend itself against the attack of this dishonest foe, the R. N. M. A. S.</p>
   <p>The tenth convention also asks the branches of the R. N. M. A. S. to establish contact with the rank and file members of the R. U. M. A. S. and the R. I. M. A. S., urging them to take up the fight for the union with the R. N. M. A. S.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>But both the Russian United and the Russian Independent mutual aid societies have their legally elected boards of directors, which are responsible for the affairs of their organizations during the period of time between conventions; and questions pertaining to the union or anything else should be directed to these boards. Therefore, the appeal to the rank and file members of the R. U. M. A. S. to fight for the union with the Communists, without regard for the board, appears to be plain impudence and an attempt to arouse the common members against those whom they themselves elected as officers of their organization. By this means the agitators are endeavoring to bring unrest and dissension into the ranks of the R. U. M. A. S.</p>
   <p>The printed report of the tenth convention plainly reveals the complete lack of any productive work, with regard to the mutual aid business, during the entire session. Instead, a number of violent resolutions, demanding that the high officials of the R. U. M. A. S. and the R. I. M. A. S. be exposed and conquered, were passed. The resolutions contained solemn vows to defend the U. S. S. R. [United Soviet Socialist Republics] and the International Defense <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Society, to work for the solidarity of the working classes, complete agreement with the Negro Youth Movement, and Union with the Jewish, Hungarian, Italian and other foreign-language organizations, except the Russian ones. What, then, are the real results of the tenth convention, and, in this connection, what is the future of the R. N. M. A. S.? All this should be known to the members of the R. U. M. A. S.; they should understand what the union of their Society with the Communist-held R. N. M. A. S. holds for them, and what the Communist political platform, under the leadership of the local dictator of the Third Internationale, the Red "crown prince" and politician, Shklar, means to them.</p>
   <p>From the many documentary articles that appeared in the Jewish, Hungarian and English newspapers, articles not refuted by the Bolshevik press, it appears that the largest Jewish organization, the Arbeiter Ring, which has tens of thousands of members, threw out from its ranks all Communist thieves and burglars for their dirty and harmful work, which was intended to ruin the organization. These expelled members of the Jewish organization have been joined <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>by a similar Hungarian group, excluded from the Hungarian society for their harmful work. Likewise, they have received into their fold the Italian Communists who were also expelled from the Italian organization for the same reasons. Later other Red national groups joined them and they formed a united Bolshevik organization under the name of the International Order of Workers [International Workers' Order].</p>
   <p>The dictator of the R. N. M. A. S., Shklar, having decided that the members of the R. U. M. A. S. were sufficiently dulled by the Bolshevik propaganda work, began to act. Without asking the membership's approval, Mr. Shklar presented to the tenth convention of the R. N. M. A. S. in Chicago a resolution calling for the unification of the Society with the International Workers' Order. What an important and intricate step in the life of the organization! A detailed consideration of all the facts involved in this union should have been required not only by the convention, but by all branches of the organization. But Mr. Shklar, like all dictators, did not allow the resolution to be discussed or objections expressed, so the tenth convention <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of the R. N. M. A. S. "unanimously" accepted the resolution for the union of the Society with the I. W. O. Strictly speaking, it is not even a union, but rather an annexation, as any fusion of two organizations requires the formation of a special committee to work out the conditions, concessions, compromises and other details. Here the annexation, "enslavement" is the more exact word, was accomplished under the guise of union.</p>
   <p>By the way, according to the reports of the Bolshevik press, it appears that the largest group in the notorious I. W. O. is the Jewish section which is many times larger than the R. N. M. A. S., which is itself, according to its membership, even smaller than the Hungarian and the Slovak sections. It is evident then that members of the R. N. M. A. S. will be but a small minority in this International Workers' Order, and will be deprived of all privileges.</p>
   <p>In many local unions of the American Federation of Labor, where the majority is Italian, all important questions are discussed in the Italian language.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>In those locals where the majority is Jewish, the meetings are conducted in Jewish. Similarly, we can expect that the International Workers' Order will conduct its meetings either in bookish English, little understood by the majority of the Russian members, or in Jewish, which is completely strange to the Russians. Thus, the R. N. M. A. S. members will have no choice other than to agree to all decisions made by the bosses of the I. W. O. The Order will confine its demands on its R. N. M. A. S. members to signatures on all kinds of resolutions, to all kinds of dues and taxes, to subscriptions for various publications, and to "voluntary contributions." The funds of the I. W. O. are shamelessly squandered by such bosses as our Shklar. That this is true is easily seen from the printed report of the Order for the year 1932, in which the comrades boastfully speak of their great "charitable work" in that year. "During that year", crow the bosses, "the I. W. O. gave ten thousand dollars to striking miners; twenty thousand dollars to the International Defense Society; and tens of thousands of dollars (they are even afraid to say how many thousands) were spent to promote the labor movement. Besides, from twelve to fifteen hundred dollars <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>are spent every month for our own different publications." So boasts and brags the I. W. O. of its "charitable activities," conducted at the expense of the starving workers, who are made still more miserable by both capitalist and Communist taxes.</p>
   <p>It was gathered from newspapers, even the Communist newspapers, that there were many thieves and robbers within the International Defense organization and in other Communist organizations, commissions and committees. Yet the I. W. O. is still giving, without any authority, tens of thousands of dollars "to promote the labor movement." And where is the financial report of the expenditure of this money?</p>
   <p>Into such an organization Mr. Shklar has driven the Russian National Mutual Aid Society. Now he would also like to pull the Russian United and the Russian Independent mutual aid societies in the same direction, where he could get control of them. Then he would expand his "good work" at the expense of Russian workers who must toil hard for their pennies.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Instead of concentrating all his effort in uniting the R. N. M. A. S. with other Russian organizations, whereby they might work for the common good, and conduct their affairs in one language, Mr. Shklar promptly fused the Society with the I. W. O., which was strange in spirit and strange in language, and which was composed of intolerant elements thrown out of other organizations. However, Mr. Shklar is not interested in thr vital affairs of the Russian workers. He is interested only in money, in the large funds, from which he can draw without any accounting or supervision, "to promote the labor movement." This, of course, is only a screen to cover personal gains of the would-be Communist leaders of the ignorant masses. It is plain now that the R. N. M. A. S. treasury will begin to crack. However, if the R. N. M. A. S., by its lack of backbone and firmness, allows itself to be overrun by the Communists, this should serve as a lesson to the R. U. M. A. S. and the R. I. M. A. S. It should show them how important it is to know how to defend their own interests and to drive out from their midsts all dictators like Shklar and others of his ilk.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Citizen members of the R. U. M. A. S.! As a result of the resolution of the tenth convention of the R. N. M. A. S., your homes will be visited by members of this organization, who will try to persuade you to join the I. W. O. Do not drive them away, for they, through no fault of their own, do not know what they are doing. Instead, explain to them where Mr. Shklar leads them. Inspire them with the courage to demand a report of every dollar spent by Shklar and his henchmen. Point out to them that the expenditure of thousands of dollars, without even a hint of the exact figures, supposedly "to promote the labor movement" but actually to enrich their own pockets, arouses great suspicion and doubt as to the honesty and decency of the bosses from Novyi Mir [Russian Communist newspaper].</p>
   <p>In any case, we do not doubt that members of the R. U. M. A. S. will be able to defend by energetic measures the interests of our glorious Society. The harmonious and well-teamed work of all members of the R. U. M. A. S. during recent years; the faultless and sincere respect it enjoys among the Russian colony; the complete absence of wreckers and provocateurs in our ranks--all <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>this indicates that the R. U. M. A. S. stands in the right road to a bright future. Let us demonstrate our unity in action, let us double our ranks, and then all honest, independent and brave elements of the Russian colony will follow us.</p>
