   <p>Dr. Chadovich was chairman of the convention of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, RNzOV, which opened last Saturday and ended Sunday evening. Mr. Sabinsky and Mr. Gapanovich were elected to the presidium. The convention was very successful and accomplished what it had set out to do. Mr. A. Pasiuk was elected president in place of Mr. Volos, the incumbent, who had resigned from the position after declining to accept renomination. Mr. N. Kozak was elected permanent secretary, and Messrs. Dziayko, Volodkin, Suatikova, Bernov, Erin, Volos, Vdovich, Zhogalsky, Parada, Yushko, Sabinsky, and Piatnitza were chosen to be directors.</p>
   <p>There was one unpleasant incident, particularly for the Bolsheviks. The convention of RNOV [Translator's note: Russian People's Mutual Aid Society], which had just closed its sessions in New York, had sent its delegate to the <span class="page-break">2</span>convention in the person of Mr. Nikolaiuk, a member of the Central Committee. Mr. Nikolaiuk was to greet RNzOV's delegates and to tie a knot of "closer friendship" with the members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, and to establish over them the dictatorship of Deviatkin and his clique.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nikolaiuk received a very chilly reception from the delegates. The convention unanimously refused to honor his credentials and rejected his request to have the floor in order to explain his position. When the uninvited delegate protested, he was bodily thrown out of the auditorium by the doormen.</p>
   <p>"We want no such guest delegates," shouted the delegates.</p>
   <p>A detailed account of the proceedings of the convention will be given in the succeeding issues of Rassviet.</p>

   <p>[Translator's note: RNOV is a mutual aid society with strong Bolshevik leanings. For a number of years, it has attempted, by boring from within, to capture control of RNzOV, an organization similar in character but very strongly opposed to Bolshevism.]</p>
