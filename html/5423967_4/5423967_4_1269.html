   <p>Russian-American communists have been telling people for many years that the proletarians of the world have only one fatherland, the USSR. Even those who had become naturalized American citizens, before they became "class conscious," considered themselves citizens of the Russian fatherland. Many of them wanted to rid themselves of the capitalist oppression in America, and to go to the "proletarian state," to take part in the "great" socialist construction which is being carried on there under the leadership of the Communist party.</p>
   <p>But as long as a preponderant majority of the Russian-American communists remained and still remain ignorant and illiterate, the proletarian state accepted them unwillingly, and some of them were not admitted at all, and were told that they were not needed there, and that a good Russian proverb applied to them: "Good neither for a candle to God, nor for a coal poker to the devil." For <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that reason, the Communist leaders began to open schools for these ignorant and illiterate people, and began to give them a technical education.</p>
   <p>All this, however, came to naught. Some of the communists could learn nothing in these schools and were compelled to remain in bourgeois America; others managed to learn a few things and began to emigrate to the USSR. However, as soon as they stepped on the territory of the proletarian state, they were bitterly disappointed in it, and after living there for a few weeks or months, they tried to return to the "American capitalist hell". At present there are in America thousands of such refugees from the proletarian state. Some of them began to tell the truth about the USSR, and others (those who have relatives in Russia) did not dare to reveal the Bolshevik deceit.</p>
   <p>This, of course, greatly disturbed the Bolshevik leaders and they began to carry on agitation against going and coming to and from Soviet Russia, under the pretext that a real communist should fight for the establishment of the Bolshevik <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>dictatorship here in America--should fight for the transformation of this country into the second proletarian state. The Bolshevik leaders knew all the time that these illiterate communists who knew nothing about the American people or the English language, could exert no influence whatsoever upon social movements in this country. The pretext was given only for the purpose of keeping the flock together, under Bolshevik control, because this flock assures the leaders of a decent living.</p>
   <p>Now matters have gone so far that the communist leaders have begun to preach in favor of naturalization. A bureau has been established in the editorial offices of Novi Mir [Translator's note; Communist newspaper in New York], to render assistance to those communists who wish to become citizens of the United States, viz., for those who agree to recognize capitalist America as their own fatherland.</p>
   <p>The conclusion must, therefore, be drawn that for the Russian-American communists there are two fatherlands: one is the USSR, for propaganda purposes, and the other is America--for their own personal welfare.</p>
