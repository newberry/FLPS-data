   <p>The convention called by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society was set for July 13. Not long ago the society celebrated the 12th anniversary of its existence. The Independent Society and the St. George's Brotherhood, which is attached to it, did a great deal for the benefit of the thousands of members of the big Russian colony of Chicago and suburbs. Who for these years helped the hundreds of widows and orphans, unemployed and sick workers? Who, not minding any hard work and hindrances in their way, continue to strive to the unification of our separated lines on non-partisan ground? The Russian workers of Chicago are members of these societies.</p>
