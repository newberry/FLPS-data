   <p>During the last few months there have been heated discussions in the pages of Rassviet concerning nationalism. It seems to be the time now to give this question a definite explanation, and to come to some general conclusions.</p>
   <p>The supporters of nationalism, as well as those who favor internationalism, feel they are right in their opinions, and that they have the correct solutions to national problems. One must say, however, that both groups are far from the right solution of the problems. In the first place, it is difficult to understand on what grounds the internationalist can denounce nationalism. Also, there is no reason for the nationalist to deny all the tenets of internationalism. Both these concepts supplement each other, and they both have an immense value in regulating human affairs on a world scale.</p>
   <p>There are two theories concerning the national questions, theories which are opposed to each other. On one side, there is extreme nationalism, denying all the international contributions to human civilization, and scorning all international amenities. On the other side there is internationalism, denouncing any and all national differences among the peoples of the world. But these two extremes are only theories. The life of nations goes forward despite all theories, of which it takes no notice.</p>
   <p>The well-informed internationalist, with common sense, cannot deny nationalism, because the very existence of internationalism depends on nationalism. Any international body or organization is composed of various national units. With the disappearance of national groups, internationalism would automatically disappear.</p>
   <p>The internationalists fight chauvinism and reaction as elements of extreme nationalism. But, from this, one should not infer that nationalism is harmful, or that all national characteristics of a people should be drowned in the sea of internationalism. Every nation appeared on this globe as a result of natural processes over long periods of development, and was not created artificially. Therefore, it is only natural that every nation should desire to preserve its own culture for future generations. It is true that, in our modern times, the culture of one nation overlaps and blends with the culture of other nations, but each nation has its own outstanding national characteristics and cultural achievements, which will always distinguish that nation from all others. Every branch or every domain of culture always retains the marks and the distinctive features of its national source.</p>
   <p>Some of our Russian national traits appear in our national dances. The Russian Ballet and the Moscow Art Theater enjoy world fame, although they are both distinct products of Russian culture. Russian operas are the product of Russian poets and composers. Russian songs are peculiar to the Russian people. Russian literature and poetry were created by Russian writers and poets, and were based on the life of the Russian people, with all their native psychological traits and peculiarities. Russian music will always remain Russian. The Russian language, with the aid of which we express our thoughts, our ideas, and our experiences, is for us the most priceless tongue, and no other tongue can ever take its place. The land from which we obtain our subsistence is our national property.</p>
   
   <p>A progressive, forward-looking national consciousness has always opposed, and will continue to oppose, all despotic systems of government. Such national consciousness now shines brightly in our Russian group in America, which so unitedly and so strongly opposes Bolshevism. Notwithstanding the fact that the older Russian immigrants in this country have lived here for more than twenty years, they have preserved in full force their love for the Russian nation and for Russian culture. Therefore, it is quite natural that the Russian group in America should take so deeply to its collective heart the present suffering of the people in Russia.</p>
   <p>We are now witnessing the operation of two arbitrary systems of government--internationalism in Russia, and Fascist nationalism in Germany and Italy. Just as Fascist nationalism has made millions of people unhappy in Germany and Italy, so has Bolshevik internationalism brought ruin and destruction to millions of people in Russia.</p>
