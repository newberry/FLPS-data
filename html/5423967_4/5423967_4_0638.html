   <p>The emigration of Russians to America has been going on for many years. There are Russian colonies in different countries of North and South America. The largest of these colonies is in the United States, Canada comes next; then Argentina, Mexico, and finally Brazil, Uruguay and other countries. In all these countries there are no less than a few hundred thousand of Russian people (not including in this number immigrants from Russia who do not belong to the Russian nationality). The Russian-Americans, most of whom in their native country were tillers of the soil, peasants, are turning to the soil also in the new country, and become small farmers or farm laborers. The Russian toilers remain laborers when they come to America. In short, the Russian-Americans belong to the working and unfortunate classes who are interested in the approaching anarchist revolution. The Russian-Americans, if put together, would <span class="page-break">2</span>make one large city or a small country, larger, perhaps, than some of the autonomous republics of the U.S.S.R. (such as Karelia, Armenia, or the Buriat Republic). Thus, the Russian-Americans, if put together, could be a power which would be able to develop culturally and maintain national independence. But, scattered in small groups over different countries of the vast American continent, they are lost among other nations and denationalized. Naturally the question arises: is it necessary for the Russians in America to be denationalized, or should they preserve their nationality while becoming Russian-Americans? Public servants, who are going to foreign countries in order to escape from political persecutions, resist denationalization because of their hope of returning to their native country at the first favorable opportunity. Thus, there was the red political emigration from Russia after the revolution of the year 1905, and the white political emigration after the year 1917. Such immigrants, feeling themselves to be guests in the foreign country, have at heart the interests of <span class="page-break">3</span>their native country, and do not participate in the political life of the country they live in. These people are Russian patriots. There is, however, another category of people: those who consider any country, where they can make good, as their mother country. For such people the national question does not exist. They are cosmopolites. Coming to another country, they hurry to become citizens and denationalize themselves. Finally, the last category are the internationalists. Internationalism strives to establish a just, mutual respect among the nations, and recognizes the right of national self-determination of all the people. As the internationalists demand respect for the rights of all nationalities, they naturally demand that their own nationality should be respected by other nations. Therefore internationalism does not favor denationalization. Cosmopolitanism, accompanied by denationalization, is rooted in the inclination to adapt oneself to any surrounding conditions, and therefore does not harmonize with the psychological characteristics of revolutionists. The psychology of adjusting oneself <span class="page-break">4</span>to surrounding conditions is the very opposite of the revolutionary spirit. One who is just trying to adapt himself to surrounding conditions usually does not care for anybody's interests but his own. Finally, internationalism, which impels the Russian immigrants to stand for the right of national self-determination, serves likewise the interests of the American revolution. The fight of the dispossessed against the monopolists, joined to the fight of the Russian-Americans for their national self-determination, should hasten the breaking down of the strongholds of American domination, and the striking of the hour of the anarchist revolution.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Russian immigrants in America should not only take part in the general struggle of the working class against the capitalists, but should also resist with all their might denationalization. The <span class="page-break">5</span>American republics were founded by daring conquerors. They engulf all those nationalities that yield to denationalization (those belonging to the white race), and reject those that do not yield (those belonging to the black, red, and yellow races).</p>
