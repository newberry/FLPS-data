   <p>From the statistical data published by the government it is seen that the Russian colony in America shows a noticeable tendency to seek naturalization. During the last fiscal year, 146,331 certificates of citizenship have been issued. The first place belongs to the Italians, 27,321 persons; next come Poles, 25,993; from the British Empire, 21,420; Russians, 14,938; then Germans, 6,879; Czecho-Slovaks, 6,003; Frenchmen, 891; etc. Thus the Russians occupy the fourth place. The long wandering in foreign lands and the absence of hope of the return to Russia is beginning to drive them into the offices for naturalization.</p>
