   <p>Last Friday, April 24th, at 1902 W. Division Street, with the hall packed, a joint meeting of the Russian-American and Russian American citizens clubs took place. Since there were many serious questions to be tackled in regard to the amalgamation of the two clubs, this meeting aroused a great interest among the Russian colony of Chicago. Many members and friends were present from among the "Independents'; members of the club "Znanie," and parishoners of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Leavitt Street and of the Church of the Transfiguration and other organizations; representatives of the press, and well known artists from the Russian colony, and a few communists.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. J. Erin, chairman of the Russian-American Club, who moved to elect the presiding officers of the meeting. Of the nominated candidates the following were elected: Dr. L. Pertson, chairman, and G. Wallace, secretary. Then they proceeded to elect the new executive committee. Mr. Antsiferon motioned not to elect a new one, but to unify the administration board, of both clubs. Mr. Erin recommended to elect immediately a new executive committee. Mr. Erin's motion was carried, and it was decided to elect a committee of nine members.</p>
   
   <p>Many candidates were nominated to the office of chairman, Mr. V. A. Kishun was elected by a majority of votes by closed ballot. Mr. V. J. Sabinsky (President of the Board of Directors of the "Independent" Society), and Mr. Velikiy (former member of the Board of Directors of the Russian-American Club) were both unanimously elected, by open ballot, vice-presidents; Mr. Volos was unanimously elected secretary; Mrs. Mary J. Moravsky, assistant secretary; Mrs. N. Dolgun, treasurer; Mr. Kusmitch, financial secretary; J. F. Erin and V. N. Olesuik, members of the administrative board. Mrs. Michailovsky, Mrs. Vorob and Mrs. Antsiferov, were elected to the auditing committee.</p>
   <p>The membership of the new club is about 250; the address is 1902 W. Division.</p>
   <p>G. N. Volos,</p>
