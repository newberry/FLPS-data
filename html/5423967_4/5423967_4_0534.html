   <p>The differences and misunderstandings between parents and children have always existed and will always exist everywhere. The older generation will always treat all plans and undertakings of the younger generation with a certain amount of pessimism and distrust. Young people, on the other hand, will always regard their parents as old fogies whose worn-out ideas stand in the way of and hamper the progress and development of the youth. Neither family life nor community life is immune from the divergent points of view separating the older generation from the young people.</p>
   <p>The acuteness of this mutual opposition could be softened and its sharp angles smoothed out by mutual concessions, and deeper understanding and wise indulgence on both sides.</p>
   <p>Nothing perhaps can bring parents and children closer together than common interests and common work for one and the same ideal. For us Russians in <span class="page-break">\2</span>America, for our older generation and for our young people, this ideal should be none other than a united effort in behalf of our Russian organizations. Our youth participates in the activities of our organizations, but not to the extent it should. The Russian mutual aid societies in Chicago have on their membership lists some Russian-American young men and young women. However, they form but a small group when compared with those Russian-American young people who are not members of any Russian organization. Our youth should be especially well represented at our conventions and annual meetings. At such meetings, our young people would have a good opportunity to become acquainted with the problems of the Russian group in America, and would get used to our way of conducting meetings and discussions. Frequently at such meetings, important decisions are reached by the delegates. In most cases, however, these decisions are never realized, because of the slowness, the lack of energy, or the lack of ability among the older members of our organizations. Our young people with their optimism and energy, enhanced by ability and some training, would probably be better able than their elders to transform many plans and decisions into actual accomplishments.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Our young men and young women could organize their own branches of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. Here they would have ample opportunity to make their own decisions and realize their own plans and desires. They would have a chance to prove their value to the community. The future belongs to the youth. A better future for the entire Russian group in America can be achieved, however, only by close co-operation between the Russian-American youth and the older Russian generation in this country. The continuous development and the strength of Russian organizations in America depend solely upon our sons and daughters. But it is up to the parents to bring up their children as Russians, to influence their conduct and their attitudes so that they will gladly and willingly join the Russian organizations and will not shun participation in the work of their fathers.</p>
   <p>We all agree that it is necessary for the Russian-American youth to know how to speak, read, and write the Russian language. We are certain that those Russian-American children who were not taught their native tongue will reproach their parents when they grow up and find out how important it is to know one's <span class="page-break">\4</span>native tongue.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, as the strongest and culturally most advanced Russian organization in America, should extend its aid to the Russian-American youth by providing our young people with proper facilities and opportunities for learning the Russian language and absorbing Russian culture. The Society could establish a Russian high school. Such a high school would be a strong attraction for Russian boys and girls in Chicago and vicinity, and no doubt would receive loyal support from Russian parents. In this way the organization would markedly increase its junior membership and at the same time would give a new boost to the Russian cause in America.</p>
   <p>We believe that by the common effort and united action of the older and the younger Russian generations in America we could strengthen and develop the Russian organizations in this country. This would enhance our position among the national groups in Chicago and would win greater respect for the entire Russian group in America.</p>
