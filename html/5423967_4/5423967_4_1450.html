   <p>I have a desire to express my opinion concerning the articles written by Minsky Muzhik. I wholly support the thoughts of Lomot and many of the others mentioned in Muzhik's articles. My proposal is that these articles be translated into English and published in pamphlet form. This pamphlet would open the eyes of thousands of Americans who have not actually observed Bolshevism at work and being applied to life. I am not a rich man, but I am ready to donate two dollars and sell at least one hundred copies for such a worthy cause. I presume that other readers are of the same opinion.</p>
   <p>We will be benefiting the community if we accomplish this objective in the very near future.</p>
