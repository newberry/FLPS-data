   <p>The oldest and strongest Russian organization in Chicago, the Independent Society, cannot be charged with the fault of lagging behind the "new" organizations.</p>
   <p>This society is constantly working strenuously.</p>
   <p>Its Insurance Department is getting larger and richer; the Building and Loan Association is also growing.</p>
   <p>In the school of the Independent parish evening entertainments and lectures are often given.</p>
   <p>The presidents of the Society, the Brotherhood of St. George and of the other branches of the Society proudly say:</p>
   <p>-We are working! Our membership increases. On November 23 the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Brotherhood of St. George arranges an evening entertainment with a large and interesting program.</p>
   <p>Among other artists there are going to participate in this entertainment the talented singer of the Russian Opera Vlodimir Svetlov and Miss Dayen, a singer of the same opera.</p>
   <p>The well known comic actor Arigoni with his family will also be on the program.</p>
   <p>The proceeds from this entertainment will be used for a useful purpose: for relief to the widows and orphans of Russian immigrants.</p>
