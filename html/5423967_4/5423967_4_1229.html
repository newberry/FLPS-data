   <p>The first question which each foreigner thinking of accepting American citizenship must ask himself is: Am I to remain in America, and have I definitely decided that for the rest of my life the United States shall be the country of my abode, or do I feel that my future and the future of my children is over there, in my faraway native land?</p>
   <p>Any immigrant, as a rule, comes here without any definite intention of remaining here for a long time. Quite frequently he leaves his wife and children behind him. In most cases he possesses a piece of ground to which he hopes to return, or he cherishes the dream that conditions in his native country will change for the better and in accordance with his desires. But in seven out of ten cases he decides to remain here. Without noticing it himself he acquires American habits--of dress, of living standards, of work, and of amusements. He sends for his wife and children. His children go to the American school and very rapidly acquire American habits, both good and bad. If he is single, he marries and becomes the founder of an American family. With passing years his ties with his native country weaken, although in his heart attachment to the land of his birth continues to burn. His work is here in America, his children grow up here, his daily interests are American. Even prier to his decision to give up the idea of returning to his native land, the chances of his doing it or wanting to do it had always been diminishing. Without being conscious of it he becomes in fact, if not legally, an American. Of course, it is not easy to give up old hopes. But in the problem of new citizenship this question must be considered frankly and realistically.</p>
   <p>If, however, the ties with the native land remain strong, and the immigrant has the quite definite intention of going back to it and remaining there, there is no sense in his changing his citizenship. As a matter of fact, he cannot even do it, for the intention of remaining permanently in the United States is one of the basic conditions of naturalization. Even the right of a naturalized citizen to visit other countries is limited to two years' residence in his native land and to a five-year period in any other foreign state.</p>
   <p>By accepting American citizenship a foreigner absolutely and fully gives up his former citizenship. This has to be done without any reservations and quite definitely. He becomes part of the American people. Together with certain privileges the foreigner on becoming an American citizen accepts certain responsibilities for the future of this country.</p>
   <p>His new citizenship does not mean that he should forget his old country, his language, and his traditions. The history and the traditions of America are still young. His greatest gift to his adopted country may consist in handing over to it something of his own older culture. Naturalization means, however, that the immigrant has recognized that his future and the future of his children lie here, in America. In his petition for American citizenship the foreigner declares that he intends to reside in this country permanently. When he takes the oath he swears to defend the United States in all conflicts with other countries and to defend and support the Constitution and the other laws of this country.</p>
   <p>In justice to himself, to his native land, and to America the immigrant considering the problem of citizenship should ask himself and answer for himself this question: Do I intend to remain in this country permanently?</p>
