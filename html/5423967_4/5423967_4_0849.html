   <p>The Humboldt Park school of Rnzov Russkoye Nezavisimoye Obshchestvo Vzaimoposachi (The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) will hold its first concert and ball on Sunday, January 1, 1933.</p>
   <p>There will be a very interesting concert program. Those entertaining will be Wasiliy Lisitskiy who has appeared several times on a radio station with his instruments. On a heretofore unknown instrument, the Flaksoton he will play several Russian folk songs accompanied at the piano by Valerian Shepelewich. The Christmas tree, beautifully trimmed with colorful lights, will decorate the occasion. It will be a joyous event for the children, and we can recollect our own childhood, although many of us in our childhood did not know what a Christmas tree was. There will be good music for dancing. We are sure that everybody will have an enjoyable time.</p>
