   <p>I admired and respected Ivan V. Lazarev, his great talent, his experience and creative efforts in glorifying the Moscow Art Theater, the pride of Russia. Those protagonists of true art had to labor for our happiness, knowlodge and enlightenment, through decades of hardship and privation, without any motive of persoral gain; and this they did without any appreciation on the part of the young generation.</p>
   <p>He was a generous man and pure of heart. He understood the soul of the Russian peasant and was fired by love of true art and the desire to serve it. Men such as Ivan Lazarev do not die. They become immortal through their creative labors. The seed of beauty which is cast by them to the four corners of life, brings forth the enlightened understanding that widens the path to beauty of life and thus assures the immortality of their creative thoughts.</p>
   <p>Ivan Lazarev, one of the leading actors of the Moscow Theater Co., has left the ranks of the creators of earthly beauty, but his spirit remains with us always.</p>
