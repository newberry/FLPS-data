   <p>Dr. H. R. Krasnow of Chicago has started a new medical publication in the Russian language. It is a popular medical monthly magazine devoted to enlightening the Russians among the laity concerning hygiene and sanitation, and also to explaining the evil doings of quacks.</p>
   <p>We note from its pages that Dr. Krasnow is editor in chief; Dr. G. Frank Butler, contributing editor; Dr. Moses Sahud, associate editor, and N. A. Spiegelglas, D. D. S., secretary.</p>

   <p>The first issue is a neat-appearing little journal, and it should accomplish a great amount of good. A publication of this sort placed in the hands of our new immigrants would add greatly toward a better hygienic condition and would help in Americanizing our foreign-born citizens. The Illinois Medical Journal wishes the editor a full measure of success.</p>
