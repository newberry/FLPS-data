   <p>In the absence of the chairman of the Russian-American Democratic League, Mr. V. Kishun, the annual meeting on March 12, 1935, was called to order by I. F. Erin, the vice-chairman. Mr. Erin immediately explained the reasons for Mr. Kishun's absence. In his explanation he said that Mr. Kishun, despite repeated requests by the executive committee to issue a call for the annual meeting for electing new officers, flatly rejected such proposals.</p>
   <p>After such refusals Mr. Kishun was forewarned by the same committee that if he, in his capacity as a chairman, did not issue a call for the meeting, the committee itself would call the meeting on its own initiative. To this warning Mr. Kishun gave no heed.</p>
   <p>But when the executive committee scheduled the annual meeting for March 12, of which action Mr. Kishun was advised by a registered letter and through publication of a notice in the newspaper, Mr. Kishun began to intimidate members over the telephone, and also to threaten members of the executive <span class="page-break">\2</span>committee with dire consequences if they dared to attend the scheduled meeting. Mr. Erin was told by Kishun that he (Kishun) had already hired bums to beat up the vice-chairman. He (Kishun) also threatened the newspaper Rassviet because the paper dared to print the notice without his consent.</p>

   <p>The speakers condemned Mr. Kishun's conduct toward members of the League.</p>
