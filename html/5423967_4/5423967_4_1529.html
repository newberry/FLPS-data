   <p>In today's issue of Rassviet there are printed excerpts from letters of those banished in Russia. From these letters it can be seen that by the latest Decret (decree) of the passport system of the Soviet Government, the politically banished of the socialistic empire live at present in an actual police empire.</p>
   <p>Now the number of exiles will increase. Up to the present time, in Moscow, Petrograd, and other industrial cities, only those individuals who were in prison or in exile for their political convictions were forbidden to live, but now all persons of private professions will be exiled from these cities. For this class of citizens, the Soviet Government has established Cherta Osedlosti (definite boundaries).</p>
   <p>In the soviet police empire, hundreds of thousands of exiles and prisoners exist. The reason for this is that in this empire the people are sent to jail and are banished for their convictions. The bolsheviks fix the heaviest punishment not upon criminals, but upon anarchists, socialists, revolutionary workers and peasants.</p>
   <p>The society, organized to aid the exiles and prisoners in Russia, informs us that many of the Russian anarchists have already been banished for over ten years. "Some of them are repeatedly taken to prison, four, six, and even eight times; and not because they participate in some mutinies or plots against the present administration, but solely because they profess ideas in opposition to the present administration.</p>
   <p>"In any other country, similar cruelties would be fiercely branded. But it is different in 'Communistic' Russia where no one dares to protest, if he does not wish to shars the same destiny. Some day, we hope that the dreadful 'human documents' will be recovered and preserved for the future generation, in order to prove what occurred behind the somber walls of the prisons and within the dull places of the exiled of bolshevik Russia.</p>
   
   <p>"There is the possibility that such documents are destined for extinction, because if the outrageous and absurd persecutions of the anarchists in Russia is not stopped in the near future, there is a danger that all of them will perish and will not be able to relate to their friends what they underwent.</p>
   <p>"In the snowy deserts of the North there rise more than one human tragedy already which the world will never know anything about.</p>
   <p>"People perish, they are slowly destroyed, cell by cell, organ by organ, wasting sorrowing youth in the stony cells, and no one knows when this horror will end.</p>
   <p>"People are tortured, and killed just because they dare to have their own convictions, and place freedom above the tyranny of the party, which in the name of socialism, precipitated the population of Russia into a new slavery, and by force closed the mouth of any individual who tried to unveil the truth--of any individual who had the courage to refuse to deal with lies."</p>
   
   <p>The Soviet Government dooms the banished to death by starvation; it is needless to mention the jailers who put them through all possible tortures and jeers.</p>
   <p>The "cultured" Europeans and Americans, however, do not protest against the bolsheviks' brutalities, and do not come to the aid of the Russian people who are perishing in bolshevik jails and in bolshevik places of exile.</p>
