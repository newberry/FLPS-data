   <p>Russian immigrants scattered all ever the world represent an extremely heterogeneous conglomeration when you consider them from the political viewpoint. Among them, there are monarchists, republicans, socialists, anarchists, Fascists, National Bolsheviks, and other political groups. All these groups, with the exception of a very small group of Bolshevik supporters, are anti-Bolshevik. They all agree and readily understand one another when questions arise concerning present-day Russia. Each group feels that the liberation of Russia from the barbarous yoke of Bolshevism is the sacred duty of every Russian, regardless of his political views.</p>

   <p>But when they begin to consider the question of what is to follow Bolshevism, then they no longer speak the same language and they no longer understand one another. Each group pictures the future of Russian according to its own lights. More than that, each group or party, has its own program for the future construction of Russia. Some of the groups, however, think that the will of the Russian people ought to be considered, while others are intent on subjecting the people to their own will.</p>
   <p>All of these programs, however, are nothing more than soap bubbles, which will burst hen the immigrants see Russian after the downfall of Bolshevism. If the Russian people are to shed any more blood, it will not be spilled so that some immigrant group can seize power, or some immigrant dictator can take the place of Stalin. The Russian people will not shed their blood in order to substitute one evil for another. They will fight only for the purpose of establishing a better social order on the ruins of Bolshevism.</p>

   <p>from this point of view, the letters of a Red Army commander, which are being printed serially in the magazine Chasovoy, are particularly interesting. His latest letter was written in February of this year, and, therefore, reflects fully the present sentiment in Russia.</p>
   <p>The Red commander writes that a bitter struggle between the Russian people and the scoundrels in the Kremlin is unavoidable. Nevertheless, he fore-warns the emigres and says that the new revolution in Russia will be carried out under the banner of "freedom and popular rule," and not with the aim of restoring the old order or of establishing a Fascist dictatorship. For this reason he advises the White officers to break away entirely from the past.</p>
   <p>"The revolution," he says, "was not a riot. It was a manifestation of the natural indignation of the people against an inept ruling class and its mismanagement in the conduct of the war. We fight against Bolshevism because it distorted this revolution, betrayed the interests of Russia, outraged the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>religious beliefs of the people, and polluted their ideals. We solemnly declare that we shall rebuild Russia not with the aim of restoring the old prerevolutionary regime, but in order to build a me Russia, borrowing all the good features of the old regime, disregarding the currents of our times."</p>
   <p>In an appeal to all Russian immigrants who may be drawing up plans for the future construction of Russia, The Red commander says: "It's unbearably painful to think that people live by vain hopes and draw up plans according to beautiful ideals and dreams which are unsuitable for present-day Russia."</p>
   <p>At present in Russia, the new revolution is planned to run along the following lines, he says: Industry is to remain under government control, and the private property of the peasants is to be returned to them in conformance with agreements regarding the establishment of "free collective farms". Free commerce is to be re-established and the eight-hour work day guaranteed.</p>

   <p>As far as political problems are concerned, the national order is to be established in conformance with the will of the people, expressed freely in a referendum. Of the whole system of governement instituted by the Bolsheviks, only the freely elected soviets are to be retained, heading freely organized collective farms. To all peoples living in the present Soviet Union, the widest possible autonomy is to be accorded in order that the entire country may be converted into a "Free Peoples' Federated State". This is the path which will be taken in the forthcoming Russian revolution, according to the Red commander.</p>
   <p>Whether such a plan is satisfactory to the Russian emigres or not, the new revolution will realize some now program of social reconstruction, and will not embrace the antiquated formula of the Russian immigrant groups. For this reason, the Russian anti-Bolshevik immigrant circles would act very wisely if they ceased to engage in controversies regarding plans for the future reconstruction of Russia, and would listen more attentively to the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>voice of the Russian people, and would come to their assistance in the hour of need.</p>
