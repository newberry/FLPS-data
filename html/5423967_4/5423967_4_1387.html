   <p>Russian immigrants scattered all ever the world represent an extremely heterogeneous conglomeration when you consider them from the political viewpoint. Among them, there are monarchists, republicans, socialists, anarchists, Fascists, National Bolsheviks, and other political groups. All these groups, with the exception of a very small group of Bolshevik supporters, are anti-Bolshevik. They all agree and readily understand one another when questions arise concerning present-day Russia. Each group feels that the liberation of Russia from the barbarous yoke of Bolshevism is the sacred duty of every Russian, regardless of his political views.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>But when they begin to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the question of what is to follow Bolshevism, then they no longer speak the same language and they no longer understand one another. Each group pictures the future of Russian according to its own lights. More than that, each group or party, has its own program for the future construction of Russia. Some of the groups, however, think that the will of the Russian people <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to be considered, while others are intent on subjecting the people to their own will.</p>
   <p>All of these programs, however, are <span class="gap">[gap]</span> more than soap bubbles, which will burst hen the immigrants see Russian after the downfall of Bolshevism. If the Russian people are to shed any more blood, it will not be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> so that some immigrant group can seize power, or some immigrant dictator can take the place of Stalin. The Russian people will not shed their blood in order to substitute one evil for another. They will fight only for the purpose of establishing a better social order on the ruins of Bolshevism.</p>

   <p>from this point of view, the letters of a Red Army commander, which are being printed serially in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Chasovoy, are particularly interesting. His latest letter was written in February of this year, and, therefore, reflects fully the present sentiment in Russia.</p>
   <p>The Red commander writes that a bitter struggle between the Russian people and the scoundrels in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> is unavoidable. Nevertheless, he fore-warns the emigres and says that the new revolution in Russia will be carried out under the banner of "freedom and popular rule," and not with the aim of restoring the old order or of establishing a Fascist dictatorship. For this reason he advises the White officers to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> away entirely from the past.</p>
   <p>"The revolution," he says, "was not a riot. It was a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the natural indignation of the people against an inept ruling class and its mismanagement in the conduct of the war. We fight against Bolshevism because it distorted this revolution, betrayed the interests of Russia, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the <span class="page-break">\4</span>religious beliefs of the people, and polluted their ideals. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> solemnly declare that we shall rebuild Russia <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the aim of restoring the old prerevolutionary regime, but in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to build a me Russia, berro<span class="gap">[gap]</span> all the good features of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> disregarding the currents of our times."</p>
   <p><span class="gap">[gap]</span> an appeal to all Russian <span class="gap">[gap]</span> who may be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> drawing up plans for the future construction of Russia, The Red <span class="gap">[gap]</span> says: "It's unbearably painful to think that people live by vain <span class="gap">[gap]</span> draw up plans according to beautiful ideals and dreams <span class="gap">[gap]</span> unsuitable for present-day Russia."</p>
   <p>At present in Russia, the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> revolution is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to run along the following lines, he says: Industry is to remain under government <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, and the private pr<span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>easants is to be returned to them in confor<span class="gap">[gap]</span>nce with agreements reparding the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of "free collective farms". Free commerce is to be re-established and the eight-hour work day guaranteed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>As far as political problems are concerned, the national order is to be established in conformance with the will of the people, expressed freely in a referendum. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> system of governement instituted by the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> collective farms. To all <span class="gap">[gap]</span> peoples living in the present <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Union, the widest <span class="gap">[gap]</span> be accorded in order that the entire country may be converted into a "Free Peoples' Federated State". This is the <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
   <p>which will be taken in the forthcoming Russian revolution, according to the Red commander.</p>
   <p>Whether such a plan <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the new revolution will <span class="gap">[gap]</span>realize some now program of social reconstruction, And will not embrace the antiquated <span class="gap">[gap]</span> For this reason, the Russian anti-Bolshevik immigrant circles would act very wisely if they ceased to engage in controversies regarding plans for the future reconstruction of Russia, and would listen more attentively to the <span class="page-break">\6</span>voice of the Russian people, and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to their assistance in the hour of need.</p>
