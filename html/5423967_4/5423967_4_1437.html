   <p>The Bolshevik newspapers very often print statistics which are supposed to reflect the economic and cultural development of the USSR and the corresponding decay of the capitalist countries. All this data is publicized by the Bolsheviks in order to show the starving Russian workers and peasants that in the near future the USSR will overtake the capitalist countries, that is, it will reach the stage of well-being which the capitalist countries enjoyed during their most prosperous years. And when such a stage of prosperity is reached, then the workers in the USSR will enjoy the same living standard as was enjoyed by workers in the capitalist countries that are now in a process of decay.</p>
   <p>From such an analogy, one receives the impression that the final goal of the Bolsheviks is to attain not a socialist but a capitalist order of society. For that reason all their agitation against capitalism is futile. There are, however, several phases of Bolshevik economics which they scrupulously avoid <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>mentioning. These aspects of the social and economic life are really the ones in which the capitalist countries are immeasurably advanced as compared with the USSR.</p>
   <p>Bolsheviks notice only the sins and crimes of others, and are silent about their own. This can be explained by the fact that their psychology is similar to that of the Hottentots. For instance, they quite frequently allude to the persecutions suffered by revolutionaries in the capitalist countries, to the horrible capitalist prisens, and to the mass murders in the capitalist states, but they either justify or conceal their own crimes.</p>
   <p>Just recently the Soviet newspapers reported that the USSR was getting ready to publish a five-volume history of the political prison, the hard labor camps, the [political] exiles, and the terror in the territories of the White Armies and Interventionists during the Civil War.</p>
   <p>This will make interesting reading, but the work would be more valuable if a sixth volume were added, devoted to the Bolshevik jails, concentration <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>camps, and places of exile. But there will be no such volume because Bolsheviks regard their own prisons as good institutions and not as bad ones.</p>
   <p>We see the name situation with regard to executions. Pravda of January 19, cites figuras on the number of executions in capitalist countries. This data is printed to justify the recent mass executions in the USSR. However, the figures given do not favor the Bolsheviks. According to this newspaper, during the years 1932-33-34, there were ninety-three executions in Germany, twelve in Austria, thirteen in Spain, two hundred and fifty-seven in Poland, one hundred and fifteen in India, and twenty-eight in the United States. Since capital punishment in the U. S. A. is inflicted only on murderers, we have to assume that the Bolsheviks included murderers and spies in the ranks of "fighters for the revolution". And yet the figures given are not impressive at all, and, besides, they cover a three-year period, whereas the Bolsheviks, at the time of the Kirov murder, executed one hundred and seventeen men for that single crime.</p>
   <p>The data printed by Pravda, therefore, appears to be counterrevolutionary, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>for it shows that not one capitalist state kills as many people as the Bolshevik state does. And if the Bolsheviks were to publish the complete data on all their executions since 1917, it would probably show that more people have been executed than were previously killed in a century. Of course, such figures will not be published, for this kind of statistics would make the most convincing indictment against the Bolsheviks.</p>
