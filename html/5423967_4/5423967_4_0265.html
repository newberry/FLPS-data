   <p>A meeting for the defense of Fedorenko was held in Chicago, December 4, at the Walsh Hall, Milwaukee Avenue and Noble Street. About 2,500 Russians and Jews assembled. The most important speakers were J. Czaki, H. Anielewski, and H. Altschuler.</p>
   <p>Federenko, a Social Democrat who was formerly a Representative in the Duma, is under arrest in Canada and attempts are being made to give him up to the Russian government. The Russian government accuses Fedorenko of murder and, if he is given up, he might be hanged. It is because of this that the defense meetings are being held.</p>
