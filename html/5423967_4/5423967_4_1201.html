   <p>The American Russian Orthodox Youth Association, otherwise known, "The Aroya Clubs", is an organization established among the youth of the Russian Orthodox Church of America for the purpose of upholding and defending the religion brought to this country by its fathers and mothers. Further, this organization was established to preserve the genius, language, traditions and customs of the Russian nationality; to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to their church and their country; to combat wayward and atheistic influences; to promote social, literary, musical, dramatic and athletic endeavors among the Russian Orthodox Youths.</p>
   <p>With its geographical location centered in the middle-west, mainly in the Chicago area, Leontiy, Russian Orthodox Bishop of Chicago, is the Spiritual Adviser. This organization has chapters in Milwaukee and Kenosha, Wisconsin, Joliet, Illinois, Gary, Indiana Harbor, Hammond and East Chicago, Indiana and Chisholm, Minnesota, in addition to several chapters in the city of Chicago. The Chicago chapters are located at the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Cathedral, 1121 North Leavitt Street, <span class="page-break">2</span>St. Michael's Russian Orthodox Church, 1700 West 44th Street and SS Peter and Paul Russian Orthodox Church, 51st and South Western Avenue.</p>
   <p>The history of this organization traces back to the fall of 1929 when at Gary, Indiana a group of young people were inspired with the idea of forming an association of such clubs. The next important event of this organization occured on October 5th, 1930 when a convention of these newly formed clubs was held at the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Chicago. The persons instrumental in forming this association were His Grace Bishop Theophilus then bishop of the Chicago Diocese (at the present time Metropolitan of all America and Canada), Archimandrite Timon of Chicago, Very Rev. B. Kedrovsky of Gary, Very Rev. A. Vyacheslavow of Chicago, Very Rev. P. Semkoff of Chicago and Attorney S.S. Parfenoff of Gary.</p>
   <p>Thru the courtesy of the St. Tikhon's Russian Orthodox Society, located at 1121 North Leavitt Street, Chicago, this new organization received space in the Russian Publication "OUR WAY" (Nash Put) to publish its news (1930-1934). Messrs. Daniel Kuzemchak and Joseph Daneluk were elected as editors. At the present time THE AROYA JOURNAL (begun 1934) with Mr. Michael Barilla, editor, replaces the original publication.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Mr. George Motel of 4933 South Rockwell Street, Chicago Illinois was elected the first president of this organization. Mr. Michael J. Grisak, 341 Monroe Street, Gary, Indiana is the present president.</p>
   <p>The Aroya Clubs, in addition to promoting an annual convention, an annual basket-ball tournament, various social, literary, dramatic and miscellaneous events, fosters a plan under which cards of congratulation, condolence, etc., are sent to persons of the Russian Orthodox Faith in the Chicago Diocese.</p>
   <p>Although this organization was established to preserve the Russian language, The Aroya Clubs are very instrumental in supporting the idea of replacing the Russian language with the American in its church services.</p>
   <p>We preserve language in this manner. The child is taught the Russian language by its parents while still an infant. When this child grows to an age when it can understand more it is sent to a Russian school usually conducted by the minister at a church during evenings and summer vacations. When the same child, now a young man or woman, joins an Aroya Club it continues to use the Russian language because many of our discussions are carried on in Russian. Russian songs are a great past-time among the <span class="page-break">4</span>Aroya members. The Aroya Club has a great influence on its members to continue with their mother tongue all thru life. The Club creates a Russian atmosphere among its members.</p>
