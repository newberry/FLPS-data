   <p>Dear Comrade:</p>
   <p>After having suffered tremendous losses through the world war, and having made almost superhuman sacrifices to preserve the gains of the revolution, Russia finds itself face to face with a terrible calamity - Famine.</p>
   <p>An extensive area, one of the most fertile regions in the country, with a population of twenty millions, has been hit by a drought. As a result the crops are a complete failure.</p>
   <p>Thousands are dying from starvation. Tens of thousands are fleeing from their homes in search of food. But there is no food.</p>
   <p>In Russia relief committees on a large scale have been organized. In England, Germany and other countries the workers are doing everything in their power to help the starving millions.</p>
   <p>Committees to collect funds for starving Russia have been formed in many cities <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the United States. The money collected by our Chicago Committee will be used for the buying of food.</p>
   <p>Donate as much as you can, do everything within your power to send bread to the starving millions and to save the Russian Workers Republic.</p>
   <p>Russian Famine</p>
   <p>Relief Committee</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>I. F. Erin</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
