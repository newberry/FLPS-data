   <p>Russian people living in America, who have not seen the horrors of the revolution, regard it lightly and do not see that it means the systematic extermination of the Russian nation.</p>
   <p>Terrorism, disease, hunger, and abortions encouraged by the Bolsheviks, have destroyed over ten million Russian people. Over three million were ordered to leave the country. Emigrants and refugees were forbidden to come back to their native land.</p>
   <p>The destruction of the Russian nation is being carried out with astounding <span class="page-break">2</span>consistency. We clearly visualize the following picture: Religion destroyed, churches polluted, priests shot down by the thousand, and those alive driven into jails. The growing new generation, children, brought up in a spirit of depravity. Parents deprived of the right to supervise their offspring; children and adolescents turned over to the Comsomal and to Octobrists, where free love is preached as per prescription by the licentious old woman Kolontai; and venereal disease is rampant.</p>
   <p>Workingmen, bound to the job and without proper nourishment, become afflicted with tuberculosis; they die gradually. Peasants taxed beyond endurance, deprived of the right to manage their farms, Commissars gathering the crop and sending the grain abroad.</p>
   <p>Teachers, technicians, engineers, physicians, and magistrates destroyed <span class="page-break">3</span>in greater part, and those alive becoming objects for derision as an amusement for Communists. Schools closed, and Communist schools busy with international songs and laudation of red-chief-heroisms.</p>
   <p>Factories, mills, mines destroyed, and production carried on by primitive methods, without application of technical devices. Over 1,500,000 unemployed; and as a crown to all these achievements by the Bolsheviks, there are 800,000 uncared-for children, wandering over Russia, engaged in stealing and in prostitution.</p>
   <p>And all this is going on when Communists spend yearly one hundred million in gold, supposedly for world revolution, but actually for acquiring palatial villas abroad, and for debauchery, surrounding themselves with unbeard-of luxuries. Besides, in Russia proper, 400,000 rubbles are spent annually for the support of the Communist Party.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It is being hammered into our heads that during the tsarist regime the nation suffered; but the fact remains that in those days one could be engaged in any occupation he chose, and live wherever he cared to live.</p>
   <p>Then punishments was meant for thieves, robbers, law-breakers, political criminals; but now, with Bolsheviks ruling, one is made to do their bidding. People may live only where the Bolsheviks will permit them to live, and those who protest against robbery, murder, and theft, are severely dealt with.</p>
   <p>Only a few days age the Communists themselves admitted that Hersch Zinovievich-Apfelbaum had organized in all the tsarist palaces of Petrograd a commune consisting of his own relatives. He "nationalized" the very best soil and turned it over to his kin, previous storekeepers, gamblers, speculators. Now this scum owns the heritage of the Russian people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>This is how Russia is plundered; this is how the people's wealth is given over to Jews.</p>
   <p>To the Russians it was merely promised, but to the Jews it was actually given.</p>
   <p>Not land possessions alone, but the whole of Russia, the entire Russian wealth went into the hands of Jews.</p>
   <p>The best land of the Crimea, of Little Russia, the Don, and Kuban, is taken away from the Russians and given to the Jews.</p>
   <p>All of commerce, all the factories, the mills, are taken from the Russian people and given to the Jewish nepmen.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The Russian nation is deceived, disgraced, and with Satanic spittle they spit into the soul of the Russian people.</p>
   <p>The Russian workingmen and peasants have been transformed into bendsmen of the Jewish International. They die, they starve, they are slaughtered, while the Apfelbaums possess millions, was fat and kick; and they quietly laugh in their sleeves at the dumb peasants who submit to carrying aliens on their backs.</p>
   <p>This is what proletarian dictatorship, freedom, equality, fraternity, gave to Russia. We have been served, and we continue to be served a lie wrapped in nice words!</p>
   <p>Freedom, equality, and fraternity, dictatorship of the proletariat, workmen and peasants power all this is just a snare for the trusting <span class="page-break">7</span>people! In reality we see the dictatorship of Leiba, frotsky-Bronstein, of Rosenfeld-Kamenev, of Hersch-Apfelbaum-Zinoviev, of Dzerzhinsky, of Nakhamkes-Steklov, of Dzhugashvili-Stalin, and other aliens.</p>
   <p>The Russian workmen and peasants are slaves of the International! Nationalization and struggle with capital are merely sign-boards behind which murderers and robbers hide.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviks promised to abolish money, and now they have divided the loot with the capitalists and have instituted a money system.</p>
   <p>Russian people! You know already the worth of nice words. Many of you no longer believe the Bolsheviks, the Socialists, and you have repudiated politics; but all this will not save you from vegetating in a strange land. The road to your native land is closed to you. Your families are <span class="page-break">8</span>under the yoke of the International.</p>
   <p>For a struggle with the Bolsheviks an alliance has been organized in America. Its name is The Unity of Russia. The Chicago division of this alliance informs you, as a Russian, of the aims and tactics promulgated by it.</p>
   <p>The activity of the Chicago division of the alliance 'Unity of Russia' is defined by a charter issued by the Government of the United States, and this charter permits:</p>
   <p>(1) Publishing of newspapers, magazines, books, pamphlets, and appeals.</p>
   <p>(2) Opening of branches of our alliance throughout America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>(3) Defending the American Constitution from Communist encroachments.</p>
   <p>(4) Conducting agitation against Communists.</p>
   <p>(5) Propagating nationalistic ideas and Christianity. Availing itself of this permit the division of the alliance has decided on the following program for 1926:</p>
   <p>(1) Publishing a daily paper in Chicago with a nationalistic tendency.</p>
   <p>(2) Organizing weekly free lectures on Russian history, literature, and technology, and arranging musical evenings.</p>
   <p>(3) Supplying to those who desire it, information about conditions in Russia.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>(4) Defending with all means the laws of the land which gave us hospitality and protection.</p>
   <p>(5) Giving full protection to the Russian Orthodox Church, and to those professing Christianity.</p>
   <p>(6) Collaborating with all the Russian Nationalistic organizations.</p>
   <p>(7) Refusing membership to Jews, and to persons whose parents professed the Jewish religion.</p>
   <p>Those who join our alliance are accorded its protection and defense in government and community institutions of the United States of America. The protection of our alliance is that of an organization recognized by the United States Government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">11</span>
   <p>The Unity of Russia Alliance stands for a nationalistic Russia, for a Russia for Russians, for equality before the law of all classes of the Russian population.</p>
   <p>The Chicago division of the alliance for the unity of Russia invites you to enter your names in the list of its members, and to give assistance through personal participation, or financial aid, in its enterprises, which require expenditure of money.</p>
   <p>Those who wish to assist with money will please direct same by mail to Mr. M. F. Papooga, 1121 N. Leavitt Street, Chicago, Ill. The alliance also accepts these applications for membership, on Sundays, between 12 and 2 P. M.</p>
   <p>Applications for membership and payment of dues are also accepted in <span class="page-break">12</span>the office of Attorney S. S. Parfenoff, 1634 Broadway, suite 210, Baker Bldg., Gary, Ind.</p>
   <p>Our alliance does not permit anybody to inspect its membership list, and thus our members' relatives, living now in Russia, are not subjected to danger.</p>
   <p>Russian people! Enough of insults from an international gang, insults to yourselves and to Russia! Consolidate all of you around the alliance for the Unity of Russia! Organize yourselves and prove that you are Russians and you love your native land.</p>
   <p>Russia is our land and we, and not Jews, should rule there!</p>
   <p>The international gang lays its hand on us even here in America. Judge <span class="page-break">13</span>for yourselves: they try to seize the churches in America, even as they seized them in Russia. All the 'Russian' papers advocating Bolshevism and supporting a revolutionary democracy are published not by Russians. Russkii Golos, Novoye Russkoye Slovo, Novyi Mir, and Russkii Viestnik are all swarming with Jews; there are no Russians there.</p>
   <p>This is why we must have a Russian paper to stand watch over Russian nationalitistic interests, to serve these interests, and truthfully to describe all that is going on in Russia.</p>
   <p>We must know the truth about our country and about the gang which leads our country to ruin! But those aliens will not let us have the truth; it pays them to lie because by doing so they can accomplish their insidious designs.</p>
   <p>What is Russia to them? Nothing! Even her name they blotted out, <span class="page-break">14</span>substituted for it the ridiculous letters U. S. S. R. But for us, Russia is our native home, our land, and our dominion!</p>
   <p>Let us stop praising the red executioners who ruined Russia! We should rather recall those who built her!</p>
   <p>Remember this, Russian people!</p>
   <p>Consolidate around the Alliance for the Unity of Russia. Struggle for our outraged honor! For perishing Russia and the Russian nation!</p>
   <p>With us is God omnipotent and omniscient, Who leads Russia through trials to penitence, and to a new, bright life.</p>
   <p>Powerful countries like Russia cannot die. Russia will arise, yet in <span class="page-break">15</span>order that she could do so, we ourselves must apply all our will, our heart, our brain, and sacrifice at least some part of our possessions, and when it becomes necessary, give also our very life.</p>
   <p>(Signed) For the Unity of Russia</p>
   <p>Chicago Division of the Alliance.</p>
