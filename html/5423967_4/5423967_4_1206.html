   <p>Russian-American youths are beginning to develop a great interest in those doings of their fathers which are connected with the large Russian center on Wood Street created by the older generation. The evening of entertainment arranged by the Young People's Club on Wood Street bears clear testimony to that effect. Last Saturday the People's Auditorium at 917 North Wood Street was filled to overflowing with young people of Russian parentage. The female sex predominated at the gathering, and this fact should be called to the attention of the young masculine element, which, it appears, is lagging behind.</p>
   <p>The young people's entertainments on Wood Street that are being arranged from time to time by the two young people's clubs in St. George's parish are becoming more and more popular. The younger generation, it seems, is gradually <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>taking over the functions hitherto fulfilled by its parents.</p>
   <p>In the concert part of the program the children's chorus of R. I. M. A. S. under the leadership of Mr. A. Grishaev sang Russian popular songs, and their talented interpretation evoked a great deal of enthusiasm among the young people. Our well-known dancer, P. Gribova, drew the attention of the entire crowd with her brilliant performance of a Spanish dance, which she had to repeat at the insistent demand of the guests. Dr. Nedzel, acting as master of ceremonies, drew a great deal of laughter from the audience by his sharp and witty comments on the performers.</p>
