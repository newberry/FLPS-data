   <p>During the turbulent years of 1920 and 1921, an organization on Soviet Russia Medical Relief was organized in Chicago under the chairmanship of Dr. J. B. Hassin. The purposes of that organization, according to Dr. Hassin, were medical relief for the suffering Russians.</p>
   <p>Medicines, physicians supplies, dental supplies, books, and clothing were sent from Chicago,as well as other places in America, to Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. B. Hassin stated that in 1921 an epidemic of malaria and typhus was taking hold among the natives of Soviet Russia, and lacking in medical supplies they appealed to their brothers living in America for help in combating these diseases.</p>
