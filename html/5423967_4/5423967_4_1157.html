   <p>On September 28 the Most Rev. Bishop Alexander Alaskinsky conducted High Mass in the Chicago Greek-Orthodox Russian Church. The day was warm and clear. Russian immigrants from Chicago and suburbs came in great number to pray with the favorite Father, and to hear from his authoritative lips news from dear homeland. The solemn reception of the bishop was about ten in the morning. At the church entrance, M. Adamovich, church warden, stood in readiness to greet the dear guest with bread and salt. In the simple but sincere words of the warden one heard true joy and pride in the fact that he, as church warden, had the happy lot to greet the great worshiper of the Russian Orthodox Church. Upon entering the church, the local priest met the Domini amidst wonderful singing of the Chicago Orthodox Russian choir.</p>
   <p>No, no other service can surpass a prelate service. Like the emissaries of the Russian Grand Duke Vladimir, I, too, have been in many American churches, and like them, I, too, shall say that nowhere have I seen such beauty, such magnificence, such solemnity, such divine singing, and such resplendent order.</p>

   <p>During services the giant voice of the father archdeacon shook the foundations of the church. A bishop's service is a harmonious combination of something great, solemn, and soulful: The wise and marvelous relationship between the archdeacon's thundering voice and the still, small supplicating singing, which lifts the souls of the worshipers far, far into the heavenly heights where the weary souls find so much solace that they would prefer to hold on forever to those heights, farther away from terrestrial agitations.</p>
   <p>Long will tarry in the soul of the Russian people the memory of that moment when the master gave instruction to the Russian people. Long have been flowing the golden words from the lips of the Russian Domini, but when he began to describe the torments of our mothers and sisters, the fathers and brothers, flung by destiny into far away America (they) could no longer contain themselves and tears of longing after sisters and brothers, who must bear the whole weight of this terrible war, and who must offer up for their country everything that <span class="page-break">\3</span>is dear to a human being: life, home, freedom, honor, were flowing freely.</p>
   <p>After the service had ended his Eminence desired to conduct evening services in the second Russian church in Chicago, on 44th Street. The parishioners of St. Michael's Church heartily greeted the bishop and gave a beautiful rendition of the good old home prayers.</p>
   <p>On October 1st the bishop conducted services in Gary, Ind., where the Russian colony greeted him enthusiastically.</p>
