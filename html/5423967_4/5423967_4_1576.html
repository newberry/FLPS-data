   <p>The question of these two peoples closely related to each other both by blood and by spirit is still being discussed in the colony. There is no such nook in the colony where one would not hear people talk about White Russia and about the Russian and White Russian languages.</p>
   <p>Almost all members of the Russian colony reject the White Russian language and accept the Russian language.</p>
   <p>What kind of language is it? You hear that question asked everywhere. People are trying to foist that language upon us, but what for? These people want to substitute a poor language, used only by a few persons, for a language so rich, so beautiful, so musical!</p>
   <p>In letters from White Russia it is communicated that attempts are being made there to propagate the White Russian language. But these attempts <span class="page-break">\2</span>do not bring the expected results. All the young people, and even the old men and women who are not illiterate, are inclined to speak Russian, to read Russian books, to sing Russian songs and to enjoy Russian music.</p>
