   <p>This news item relates that among the Russian Socialists and non-partisan elements there is developing the idea of establishing permanent quarters for their several activities and naming it the Russian National Home. The Russian Section of the Socialist Party took the initiative in renting such quarters, the very same section which voted assistance to the Society for helping those in exile in Russia, and also gave assistance to the recently organized Society ZARYA (DAWN). By concerted efforts it is hoped that a house will be rented where all organizations (progressive) will feel at home. This house, besides serving as a meeting place "for all our organizations will also have room for the Russian Socialist School. It is also desirable to have the library of the Socialist Section open daily in this home. Also rehearsals for skits and chorus singing can here take place. It will be a house of several rooms so that meetings and classes of several organizations may be conducted simultaneously. This Center will cement and foster a closer friendship between the spiritually related groups."</p>
