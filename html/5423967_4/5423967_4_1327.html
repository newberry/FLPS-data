   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>The Russian Consulate in Chicago requests you to print in the next number of your paper the following announcement: In the name of the Russian Embassy in Washington.--In connection with the extreme circumstances of the present time, in consideration of the state defense, the Minister of War, Kerensky, has ordered stopped until further orders, the action of the established privileged order of giving out passports to Russian political emigrants for return to Russia. With the opening of the borders of the Russian State the entrance of the Russian political emigrants will be permitted on the same basis as the entrance of all other Russian citizens. Inquiries should be sent to Petrograd about each political emigrant. Only upon the reception of a satisfactory answer will passports be given out. Permission of the Central Government to enter the borders of the Russian State can be expected if the causes for the return to Russia are found to be weighty enough. Therefore the conferences and Committees of political emigrants are invited to mention in their references, if they find it necessary, the special conditions, which demand an immediate departure of some emigrant, to Russia.</p>
   <p>Consul-General: A. Volkov</p>
