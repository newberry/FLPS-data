   <p>Everyone expected that the Russian fliers would get an exceptionally warm welcome in the center of the Russian colony of New York. But to our sorrow this expectation was not justified, and in comparison New York remained far behind the other cities. Reports which appeared in the pages of Russian New York newspapers, show that 30,000 people came to welcome the fliers at the Polo Grounds.</p>
   <p>At first glance this looks fair; 30,000 people is a population of a small town, but for the city of New York 30,000 at the celebration and welcome of the Russian fliers who achieved a heroic flight is a small figure. At the time when the Russian heroes were in Chicago over fifteen thousand people out of a population of 30,000 Russian inhabitants of that city attended the celebration.</p>
   <p>In New York, there are about 200,000 Russians (Russian Jews not included) and out of the 200,000 only 30,000 came to welcome the fliers - which is <span class="page-break">2</span>approximately one sixth of the Russian population in the City of New York. The cities of Chicago, Gary and Detroit sent one half of their population to welcome our fearless compatriots, and New York only one sixth; and that placed the city of New York far behind the other cities in America.</p>
   <p>In connection with the arrival of the Russian fliers to America, several curious incidents occurred full of childish humor. Someone called the fliers "Soviet fliers," others objected and said that they were "Russians." It was unnecessary to waste time for such arguments. Shestakov, Bolotov, Fufaev, and Sterlington are such names that it would be very difficult for anyone to declare that they are not Russian.</p>
   <p>"Just the same the fliers were sent by the Soviet Government," replied those who called them "Soviet fliers," Right you are!. But would you <span class="page-break">3</span>call any American flier sent by the Republican Government of the United States a Republican instead of an American... Certainly not... So what is the use of arguing!?...</p>
   <p>In one of the small towns the Russian people favoring the Soviet Government remarked with pride that at their reception for the Russian fliers, the chief of the local Police was present as the representative of the city, and that the orchestra of the children's school played the Russian National Hymn. A pompous occasion indeed!</p>
   <p>It is possible that in the eyes of some people the presence of the Chief of Police was a great honor. But we do not think that it was regarded as such by the fliers. The Chief of Police, certainly, might be a respectable gentleman, but the point of it is that the police was, as usual, sent not to welcome the heroes, but for an entirely different purpose, which we need not talk about... It is well known.</p>

   <p>As to the Russian National Hymn, there must have been some mistake.... What would happen in Moscow, if they should happen to hear the pupils of a soviet school play the "Russian National Hymn"?.....</p>
   <p>Surely, in Moscow, they would not compliment the players nor those who induced them to play the hymn.</p>
   <p>But...to every cloud there is a silver lining. Evidently in this city they called the hymn of the internationalists a Russian National hymn! "Wake up, hungry slaves of all the world, branded by the curses..."Which is somewhat different!</p>
   <p>In connection with the arrival of the Russian fliers to America, the organization of the Friends of the Soviet Union decided to shake up the Russian immigrants and present to the flyers tractors, as gifts <span class="page-break">5</span>to the Russian peasants. For this scheme, the Friends collected money. According to a rough estimate, the Russian colony gave from fifty to sixty thousand dollars for these tractors. Our colony never has refused to raise money for a good deed. The Russians of Chicago contributed twelve to fifteen thousand (including admission tickets to the celebration), Gary - about one thousand, the city of New York about forty thousand -probably more. The Russians in California also gave money generously for these gifts.</p>
   <p>All in all fifty to sixty thousand dollars were given to the Friends, who as yet have presented only fifteen tractors. It is understood that this is not enough since fifteen tractors cost less than fifty thousand dollars. From the rest of the money, the Friends will present the peasants in U.S.S.R. with something valuable and useful. We expect to hear about this in the future.</p>
