   <p>To many Russians in America, this question has become a topic of daily talk and argument, and continues to agitate the minds of men and women of our colony. One hears many answers to this question. All these answers can be easily expressed in one of two words, "Yes" or "No". Those who say "yes" and those who say "no" give their own reasons for their views. The difficulty, however, lies in the fact that the opinion of neither group is based on logical thinking, but on their emotions.</p>
   <p>One thing is certain, and that is that the question of the return of Russians from America to their homeland has many angles and many complexities. Therefore it deserves our close and most serious attention.</p>
   <p>The Russian worker, "tiller of the soil," because of economic conditions, or political persecution, or mistreatment at the hands of landowners or government officials, was forced to emigrate to America, where he could breathe the air of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>freedom and improve his economic status. In other words, his aspirations to liberty and independence, his hopes for a better life and happiness, have driven him out of Russia, and have brought him to America.</p>
   <p>But, even in America, the Russian immigrant has not found what he has been looking for. From the wide steppes of Russia, where he spent his youth, he was transferred into the sweatshop or into the smelly factory of the large American city. Then the European war broke out, and later the Russian revolution. The hearts of the Russian immigrants became gladdened, "Back to our home, where there now is liberty and independence!" Soon, letters began to come from those who had returned to Russia--sad letters, pointing to one fact, that life was impossible in Russia. Many of those who left America for their homeland after the revolution came back to the United States, all saying, in one voice, "There is no real living in Russia".</p>
   <p>Then many Russians in America began to ask themselves, "What shall we do? Shall we return to Russia in spite of all the disadvantages, or should we make up our <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>minds to call America our home and rearrange our lives accordingly?" This wavering mental attitude interfered with their economic pursuits.</p>
   <p>In Russia, at the present time, there is an acute shortage of almost everything needed for the sustenance of life and of culture. The Bolsheviks had put their heavy hand upon everything that made life bearable. If those Russians who intend to return to Russia think they will find comfort, independence, and freedom of action there they are gravely mistaken. They will find hunger, want, and coercion by the dictators, who measure everybody and everything by one and the same yardstick. Let those who dream of the Soviet paradise abandon their fantastic dreams and hopes, as they will be shockingly disillusioned when they come in actual contact with the Soviet realities. It is much better for them to remain here, in bourgeois America, and make their plans for continuation of their residence here, and at the same time participate in the American workers' struggle for better life in this country.</p>
   <p>But those in whose breasts the flame of revolution is still burning--those who <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>still possess enough strength, energy, and courage, and who are ready and willing to fight against overwhelming party domination and face most cruel privations and hardships, and work in the only conditions possible under the dictatorship--those men can go to Soviet Russia and there exert their efforts to help the Russian people in overthrowing the cruel Bolshevik dictatorship.</p>
   <p>Only those should go to Russia who dedicate themselves, and their life's work, to fighting capitalism and its power to the bitter end, and to bringing about a complete liberation of the working classes from their yoke. In Russia, the heavy billows of the revolution have not yet subsided, and there are more chances for success than in our conservative and inert America.</p>
   <p>The soft-bodied dreamers who wait for happiness and the "Soviet paradise" in Russia might better remain here, for Russia needs only the revolutionaries--men who can build, upon the ruins of the dictatorship, a new and free society of peoples.</p>
   <p>"Let this cup pass from me," prayed Christ upon the eve of his crucifiction.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>And as this cup of suffering did not pass from Christ, so it will not pass from those who intend to return to Russia. Let those who desire to go to Russia meditate well before reaching their decision.</p>
