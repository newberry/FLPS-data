   <p>Announcement of two lectures to be given by the well known Russian writer G. D. Grebenshchikov, to be given on January 9 and 10, 1933. The themes are "The Truth, Sacrifice and Hope of the Russian People," and "Holy and Rejected Russia." The lectures will be illustrated by screen pictures.</p>
   <p>Note: From an article by Mr. I. Raskatov, Rassviet, Jan. 19, 1933, containing an account and criticism of the first lecture we learn that Mr. Grebenshchikov dwelt exclusively on the bright side of the tsaristic regime in Russia, ignoring entirely its dark side, showing thus an entire lack of understanding of the causes of the Russian revolution.
