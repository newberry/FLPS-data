This struggle between the Russian non-partisan organizations and the Bolsheviki was going on in Chicago, New York, Detroit, and all other cities where there are considerable Russian immigrant groups.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the Communists, though at that time they were already very unpopular among the great majority of Russians, succeeded by skilful intrigues in sending four delegates to the convention, with mandates, the validity of which was disputed by the commission which was examining <span class="page-break">2</span>the mandates in Philadelphia. A number of Communist delegates from other cities was also rejected by the commission. The Bolsheviki, seeing that they were only a handful against the great majority of the other delegates, tried to disrupt the convention, but did not succeed. The non-partisan delegates decided to call immediately a meeting, eliminating the Communist obstructionists and the unification was achieved and enthusiastically cheered by all those present.</p>
   <p>The Russian organizations for mutual aid in Chicago and the newspaper Russian Herald and Rassviet, voicing the sympathies of the great majority of Russians in Chicago, sent greetings to the delegates in Philadelphia who had brought about this unification. The Bolsheviki, in spite of all their intrigues, were entirely defeated.</p>
