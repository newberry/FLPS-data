   <p>One cannot help congratulating the campaign against medical quacks in Chicago, and against joints which are spreading venereal disease here.</p>
   <p>If we are to accept physicians' statements, then the number of people suffering from venereal diseases here is enormous. So enormous that in no city in the Russia of old was there such a great number of people suffering from these diseases.</p>
   <p>It is a disgrace that a city so progressive in cultural attainments should be gripped to such an extent by these diseases.</p>
