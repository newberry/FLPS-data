   <p>Artists who are not preceded by their fame, gerecrally find <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in a difficult position toward the public. They <span class="gap">[gap]</span> first <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Mastery of instruments is not any longer rare today, and the public must be convinced that the artist is a master <span class="gap">[gap]</span> it is willing to hear him.</p>
   <p>It is not surprising under surprising those <span class="gap">[gap]</span> circumstarces, that the concert <span class="gap">[gap]</span> last right in the now Chicago theater, by the Russian pianist, Mme. Annette Bssipoff, did not draw a large crowd, but there were a great number of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> teachers in the audience.</p>
   <p><span class="gap">[gap]</span> . Annette <span class="gap">[gap]</span> is an excellent <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and in certainly not inferior to Alice Topp or Anna Heslig. She played to perfaction the Andante and the Impromptu from: "Rose wade" by schubert, as well as Schumanns's <span class="gap">[gap]</span>" and "Les doux Alouettes", a composition by <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, Director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music.</p>
   <p>The public awaited with special interest her interprotation of Chapin. Her requtation to be the best interpreter of this composer does not seem to us to be justified. Her playing lacks the necessary power to render the stormy ideas of Chopin.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Mrs. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> lived up to the expectations of her audience. The only thing lacking seemed to be power, and this was perhaps due to the almost empty hall.</p>
