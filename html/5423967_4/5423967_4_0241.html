   <p>The foundation of a Russkiy Narodny Dom (Russian House of the People ) in Chicago is mentioned. It is not stated, however, when and how long such an institution has been in existence.</p>
   <p>Note: As far as I know there have been only unsuccessful attempts by the Russians in Chicago to create such an institution. D. S.</p>
