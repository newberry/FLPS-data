   <p>The keeper of the Patriarchal See, the Metropolitan Serghey of Nizhniy-Novgorod, issued an appeal in which he writes: "We thank the Lord God for His infinite mercy which He has bestowed on our Orthodox Church. We thank the Soviet government for, the attention which it pays to the spiritual needs of the orthodox population. Let us take an oath that we shall not forfeit the high trust which the Soviet authorities have put in us. We regard the U. S. S. R. as our fatherland, whose joys and victories are also ours. Such blows at the U. S. S. R. as war, the boycott, the murder in Warsaw we regard as blows aimed at ourselves. While remaining orthodox Christians we are aware of our duty to be loyal Soviet subjects, not because of fear, but from the bottom of our hearts. Those who hope that the Soviet regime is only something accidental and will not last long do not interpret correctly the signs of the times. Such accidents do not happen. In everything the hand of God is seen. Those who are inimical to the Soviet authorities should leave the Church."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>As the last sentence is aimed chiefly at those Russians who have emigrated to foreign countries, this appeal says further:</p>
   <p>"We order those clergymen who have emigrated from Russia to give us a written pledge of their absolute loyalty to the Soviet authorities in their Social work. Those who will refuse to give such a pledge will be removed from their priestly office and will have to appear before the Court of Justice of the patriarchate. We are sure that the expected Council of the Church will condemn such bearers of the church authority, who tear to pieces the vestment of the Church, and will endorse our decision to establish friendly relations between the Church and the Soviet government."</p>
   <p>This "Appeal" has been signed by one metropolitan, 4 archbishops and two bishops who constitute the Temporary Supreme Synod. The Soviet government, in order to show its gratitude to the dignitaries of the Church who had put their signatures under this document, allowed them to call a Council of the church. At this Council a patriarch will be elected and a permanent Synod will be reestablished.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Thus the struggle between the Church and the Soviet government has been offically liquidated. The heads of the Russian clergy have "capitulated" and have recognized the U. S. S. R. as their fatherland and the Soviet government as an authority emanating from God.</p>
   <p>The editor commends this document, and the following is a short summary of his comments.</p>
   <p>He says that this "Appeal" will put a great many Russians in a very difficult position from which they will find it very hard to extricate themselves. The Russian Orthodox Church was always considered to be the protagonist of the tsaristic government and that social order which existed under it. Those who wish the restoration of that regime regarded the Orthodox Church as their best ally in the struggle against the communistic regime. The dignitaries of the Church and the priests who have been the victims of their faithfulness to the old regime and had therefore been tortured and killed were regarded and honored as martyrs. Now this very Church turns round and says that its <span class="page-break">4</span>priests have to be loyal to the atheistic Soviet government, or else they will be removed from their offices. Such a sudden radical change in the attitude of the ruling hierarchy of the Church will be astounding for its supporters, and they will have to solve the question: which of the two attitudes of the Church towards the bolshevistic regime is the right one-- the former or the new one, which dictated the "Appeal?"</p>
   <p>The editor solves this question in the following way: from his standpoint (which is not the religious one)--this change of attitude should not astonish anyone who understands the essential nature of the church and the state. Both are there essentially, says the editor, for the purpose of holding the people in fear and subjection. So in this respect at least the Orthodox Church and the atheistic bolshevistic government are at one. The subjugation of the people by a ruling minority is realized in the best way when the government and the Church are cooperating with each other, and not fighting one another. So some sort of understanding between these two <span class="page-break">5</span>ruling powers should have been expected to be realized sooner or later.</p>
   <p>The editor thinks, however, that this recognition by the Church of a professedly atheistic government and the agreement of the latter to restore to the church the right of having a permanent Synod would alienate many orthodox believers from the Church and many militant atheists from the Soviet government.</p>
