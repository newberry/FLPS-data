   <p>For a long time the most active members of the Society RNzOV have advocated and preached the necessity of having a more or less commodious place for meetings and entertainments. Our men with wide horizons even spoke of erecting a large building with an assured income from rentals, which would include several commodious halls adapted for various needs of the Russian colony in Chicago, office rooms for Russian businessmen, and a number of apartments. Let us hope that some day the Russian colony in Chicago will build its own People's Home, which will become the home of Russian culture.</p>
   <p>The Independents [Translator's note: Independents are the members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society known under the initials RNzOV] from Wood Street have laid the foundation for creating a Russian cultural nook in the city of Chicago. In the newly created building several entertainments have been held already. The desire of the Russian people to unite <span class="page-break">2</span>is great, and the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society must do everything in its power to unite the Russian colony. This unification can be accomplished only on the basis of a single national culture and of a common language. It is necessary that Wood Street should become the cultural center for the Russian people in Chicago; however, we must do a great deal to accomplish this.</p>
   <p>The task of first order is to open up a library with a collection of Russian books. The beginnings to this endeavor might be laid by one of our branches. A sum of money appropriated for this purpose will lay a firm foundation for the continued effort in the necessary direction. Later on it is inevitable that we shall receive support in the form of contributions, both in money and books, from private persons, and we are certain that in a year or two Wood Street would take pride in possessing a Russian library. This library would be added to gradually, and enriched by new gifts and new contributions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>in money. Thus, the creation of a library on Wood Street is indispensable for many reasons. A great many young people of Russian parentage are longing to acquaint themselves at least with the culture of their ancestors, and this acquaintance can be gleaned only from the storehouse of Russian books. The youth will come in groups to read our books and periodicals. Many of them will like to take home a book they want, or to seek out some information. The Russian youth would acquire a habit of visiting our cultural center, and spending his leisure hours in the Russian Home. He would seek answers to the burning problems of life in the great works of Russian writers and philosophers; he would quench his thirst from the springs of native Russian culture, and once he is imbibed with the Russian culture he will never leave us.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, by adding young blood to its ranks and by adding young, educated members, will enhance its influence to such an extent that it will have its sway among other Slavonic peoples, <span class="page-break">4</span>and will command attention from American officialdom. The mayor will come to us not only for laying cornerstones for our churches, but also for our Christmas and Easter festivities. He will come to our annual convention. The Society's interests, therefore, will be well looked after in the city hall; we shall have our own men in high places. Only by having proper representation in the governing bodies shall we attain the full stature of American citizenship, of citizens who know the country wherein they live, and who know the laws.</p>
   <p>Whenever a group of Russian youth gathers on Wood Street and starts a discussion on political, national or social problems, whenever it raises questions of Russian art or science, a Russian book should be handy to give some answers or yield information. For the dramatic club we shall acquire additional Russian pieces, dramatic works, and comedies. For the library we shall assign separate quarters not connected with other rooms in our building. We have to create for our youth a proper environment and atmosphere, so that boys <span class="page-break">5</span>and girls may enrich their school knowledge and develop themselves.</p>
