   <p>A few weeks ago the Russian-American Democratic League was organized in Chicago. Three nationalities compose the League's membership: Russian, Ukrainian, and Carpatho-Ruthenian. The League is formed of the representatives of these national groups in different wards in Chicago and surrounding towns. The chairman of the League is V. A. Kishun; the secretary, P. Rozdilsky. All members of the ward committees belonging to these three national groups become directors of the new organization. The League has already organized ward clubs in ten Chicago wards and in three surrounding towns.</p>
   <p>The Russian-American Democratic League has for its purpose the formation of a political and cultural unit of the Russians, Ukrainians and Carpatho-Ruthenians living in Chicago and vicinity. The League becomes a part of the All-Slavonic League, at the head of which are: Mr. Kerner (Czech), the district attorney; Professor Szyrnezak (Pole), and other prominent Slavic leaders.</p>
   <p>The third regular meeting of the League, held on January 23, was attended by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>about fifty representatives from various city wards and from neighboring towns. At this meeting there was also present Mr. Miroslavski (Pole), assistant to the state district attorney, and chairman of the All-Slavonic League. Mr. Miroslavski made a speech of welcome, in which he expressed the readiness of the All-Slavonic League to co-operate with the Russian-American Democratic League. The meeting was of a rather stormy character, but much was accomplished, nevertheless, and the meeting was generally regarded as very successful. It was decided to apply for a charter, to find permanent headquarters, to strengthen and enlarge the membership by campaigning in the wards, and to form a youth section within the organization. Also a resolution was passed giving a vote of confidence to Mr. Kishun, as chairman of the League, and approving his work for the organization. The meeting elected a delegation of five persons to negotiate with the publishers of Rassviet for the printing of the reports and other material pertaining to the activities of the Russian-American Democratic League in Chicago.</p>
