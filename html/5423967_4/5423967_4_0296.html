   <p>The Chicago Society for Aid to Emigre Children wishes to advise Russian colonists of the city of Chicago and vicinity that on June 19, sorting, disinfecting, and packing of the articles collected for the children of Russian emigres will take place, and the first shipment of the donated articles will be on the way to Europe in a day or two. Therefore, the Committee asks all donors to bring their articles to the collecting station at 1121 North Leavitt Street before that date.</p>
   <p>Those who are unable to bring the articles personally may telephone M. Maximova, and a man will be sent to pick up the bundles.</p>
