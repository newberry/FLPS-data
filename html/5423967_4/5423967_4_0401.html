   <p>Dear countrymen! More than a million of Russian workers and peasants are in captivity in Germany and Austria. Many thousands of captives of Russians, Frenchmen, Englishmen, and Serbians are in the military camps. The pay of the Russian soldier is very small in comparison to the salary of the soldiers of other nations; the relief paid by the Russian government to the soldiers' families is very low. Before the war Germany used to purchase half of its bread, meat, and other food articles on the foreign markets, but now Germany is cut off from the rest of the world by the army and navy of the Allies, and cannot get any goods from other countries. In consequence of that Germany is in great need and is suffering famine, and the prisoners who are kept in military camps have to endure still greater hardships. The captives are in great need, especially the Russian captives. The French and the <span class="page-break">2</span>English prisoners of war are helped by their relatives, by societies, but the unfortunate Russian captives are just forgotten, and there is nobody to help them. And our brothers are in great need, and thousands of them are dying from famine. Brothers, these facts are not invented by us; they are gathered from communications sent by French and English soldiers and from the tales of wounded soldiers returning from captivity. In order to ease the burden of their unfortunate countrymen the Russians in Switzerland and Holland have organized committees for aid to the Russian prisoners of war, with no distinction of nationality and religion. But this aid amounts to nothing, because Russian captives number more than a million, and Russians in Switzerland and Holland are very few and many of them are in need themselves. In America where there are so many Russian immigrants, nothing yet has been done for their captive brothers. Not long ago Mr. Oberutshev, the chief secretary of the Central Committee for Aid of the Russian Military Captives in Switzerland, arrived to Chicago. Mr. Oberutshev came here with the special purpose of acquainting <span class="page-break">3</span>the Russian immigrants and American society with the misery of the military captives. The work of Mr. Oberutshev was not in vain. In New York, Boston, Detroit, and in many other cities non-partisan committees for the aid to prisoners of war were organized and began energetically to collect contributions and to arrange many affairs for the benefit of the prisoners. Now, friends, such a committee has been organized in Chicago also. It includes the representatives of all partisan and non-partisan societies and organizations of Chicago and suburbs. All of them are unified by the ardent desire to help their brothers as much as possible and within their powers to ease their material and spiritual wants. All of them hope to have material and moral support of all the Russian colony. The committee appeals to you now for that support. Give all the help you can! Come all and bring your friends and acquaintances with you to the great general meeting which will be devoted to the consideration of the needs of the prisoners. We intend to arrange a great show and ball. We hope that we will meet you all there. The names of all who will help will be published in the Russian papers. The collected <span class="page-break">4</span>money will be sent to the Swiss and Dutch committees for the purchasing of clothes and products for the Russian prisoners of war. In conclusion, the committee once more appeals to you with a request to help it in its hard task.
