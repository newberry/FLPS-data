   <p>Last week, in the state of Connecticut, Ivan Rudenko, a Russian immigrant from the province of Volyn, committed suicide. He did it because he was homesick. He left a wife and two children. He shot himself. what was the immediate impulse which caused him to commit this terrible action? What prompted him to kill himself?</p>
   <p>There is only one answer to this question. Rudenko fell a victim of the decree about the closing of the frontiers of Russia for separate individuals who want to be repatriated.</p>
   <p>During the last two years Rudenko yearned to return to his native country. His beloved wife was begging him in every letter in the most touching terms to go home as soon as possible. She was writing letter after letter. Poor Rudenko was getting nervous. He was thinking: How on earth can I go to Russia under the present circumstances?</p>
   <p>In order to comply with his wife's legitimate request, Rudenko assiduously begged the Soviet authorities to allow him to cross the frontier of the U. S. S. R. But the Soviet authorities refused to grant his that permission.</p>
   <p>His wife continued to write letters imploring hi<span class="gap">[gap]</span> to return.</p>
   <p>But the frontiers of Russia remained closed, and Rudenko could not move. Ultimately, Rudenko received a letter in which his wife threatened him that if he would not hurry to come back, she would willy nilly marry somebody else and forget him.</p>
   <p>Such words from a wife whom he loved affected Rudenko so, that he became quite despondent, seized a revolver and killed himself. How can all this be explained? What title should be given to this tragedy? Who should be held responsible for that ghastly suicide committed by a Russian immigrant in America?</p>
   <p>The responsibility for this tragical suicide of a Russian in American falls entirely on the senseless decree about the closing of the frontiers of Russia for separate individuals who want to be repatriated.....</p>
   <p>Over the frontiers of Russia hangs a gloomy fog which bars any access to them and locks out any separate individual who would like to cross them.</p>
   <p>And on white sheets of paper are being written with tears letters from wives, children, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and brothers-in-law; a wail is heard, reaching husbands, sons and brothers in America: "Come back to Russia, help us. There are not enough workers to till the land."</p>
   
   <p>They have hung locks all along the frontiers of Russia and do not want to listen to all these wails. They have their own senseless politics. They have decreed that Russian citizens in America will not be allowed to return to the U. S. S. R. until "Uncle Sam" will have bowed to them, the Soviet rulers, and recognize them as the legitimate government of Russia.</p>
   <p>Through their guilt are suffering hundreds of thousands of Russians in the United States and Canada, who for some reason are forbidden to enter Russia. What kind of policy is that?</p>
   <p>For us Russians in the United States and Canada this is a slap across our face given by the Soviet government - an insult which we do not deserve...</p>
   <p>There is a limit to everything. However, in spite of all kinds of tribulations of our relatives and friends in our native country, we do not see an end to this closing of the frontiers of Russia, and we are still unable to go there freely.</p>
   <p>Our requests and our complaints to the Soviet government about not being allowed to return to our native country are not being considered by anybody. Some Russians have already lost their patience....</p>
   <p>Going to Russia with a commune is inconvenient. One who does it must have a certain amount of money decreed by the commune. Besides if you travel with a commune, you have to go to the place chosen by this commune. You cannot reach the place where your home is.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us demand a complete, unrestricted opening of Russia's frontiers to all Russian immigrants.</p>
