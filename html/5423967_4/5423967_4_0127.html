   <p>There are many Russian organizations in Chicago. Each of them has its own definite aims: one is occupied with aid to Russia, another with the opening of schools, a third has as its aim enlightenment, and so forth. Among these organizations only the People's Independent Society, in addition to other aims, also takes care that the people of Russian origin in case of misfortune can find the necessary aid. For this aim the Independent Society established a fund of mutual aid and insurance. They were created in consequence of daily needs. As with people of other nationalities, so the Russians are exposed to different misfortunes:one gets crippled by a machine, another gets sick during his hard work, the third loses his normal sight and so forth. Many such workers are left without any means for their existence. Also the families of many deceased Russian people are often left without any means. Each member of the Independent Society who pays $1.80 monthly, in case of sickness or misfortune receives weekly five dollars for a six-month period. In case of death the family receives $800. This society does not limit itself to this work only. Through the efforts of the members of this society the only (Russian) paper in Chicago, Free Russia, was established. This paper defends the interests of the Russian colony and the Russian workers in America.</p>
   <p>The society has spent on this paper many thousands of dollars and much work. Besides this, the society has a school. Russians! Join the People's Russian Organization. Insure yourselves in it; protect yourselves against misfortune and secure relief for your family in case of your death. Insure your children in it. All nationalities are supporting such organizations. Support your organization.</p>
