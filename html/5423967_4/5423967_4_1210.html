   <p>There was a time when we old immigrants never bothered ourselves with the problem of the Russian youth in America. This problem, which has become a most pressing one, never even entered our minds before--it was not of any importance to us. But the time has come when it rises before us in all its gravity, and it is impossible for us to evade it, whether we want to or not. Our young people demand an answer to the burning question: What will they be after we are gone? We have to find an appropriate answer, and not sometime in the future but right now, for this question is of imminent importance.</p>
   <p>Not so long ago, perhaps only ten years ago, we entertained different hopes and cherished other aspirations. At that time we had no intentions of becoming permanent residents of this country. Moreover, we never expected that we should leave our motherland forever and live in a faraway and strange country the rest of our lives; hence, the question of the future of our young <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>generation, of course, was entirely irrelevant and stood outside of our program for the future.</p>
   <p>This was a grave error on our part, the correction of which will be most difficult. But we must correct it at all costs; otherwise, all that we have done and will do in the future will perish; our Russian name will disappear from the American scene. For that reason we must exert all our efforts and ability toward making our youth the guardians of Russian culture and customs in a foreign country.</p>
   <p>How can it be done and who shall undertake this difficult mission? Neither one person nor even a small group can hope to undertake this task with any success. This can be done by only such an organization as RNzOV. Only this Society can undertake the job and carry it through successfully.</p>
