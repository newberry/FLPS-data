   <p>Mr. V. Levkovich was the financial secretary of the Rassviet and an active member of Branch 15 of the Independent Society for Mutual Aid, in Chicago. On Sunday, February 12, 1933, he was found bleeding to death on the porch of his house, located at 742 E. 105th Place, Pullman. Before dying he told his wife that it was a Russian, Constantine Malakhovsky, who had inflicted a mortal wound to him with a knife. It has been suspected that three more Russians, Nestor Kravchenko, Emelian Pyesenekov, and S. Pior had participated in the attack on Mr. Levkovich. All these four men were arrested and indicted, but in spite of the fact that these men told conflicting stories of the murder, evidently lying and trying to produce the impression that it was not a premeditated murder but the result of a brawl of drunken people, all the arrested men were freed because it was found that their guilt could not be established in an uncontrovertible way.</p>

   <p>Yet it is known to the Russians living in Pullman that all the four men suspected of this murder were enemies of Mr. V. Levkovich belonged to the most lawless and violent class of Russian Bolsheviki, hated Mr. Levkovich because of his anti-Communist activities in Russian organizations and had previously threatened to ill-treat him because of his fearless denunciations of the intrigues and acts of the Bolsheviki that were doing a great harm to such non-partisan Russian organizations as the Independent Society of Mutual Aid.</p>
