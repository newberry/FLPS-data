   <p>The Russians in New York, especially those represented by the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society, have made great strides forward in their many-sided activities during recent years. The Society got rid of all hostile elements trying to ruin the organization from within at the command of the Communists, although it risked a great loss in its membership. But this was a wise procedure. After the shock of the purge subsided, the ranks of the organization, though smaller, became more compact and more strongly united. Soon afterward, the ranks were filled with new members, and today the membership of the Society is larger than it was before the purge.</p>
   <p>The organization then adopted a course of intensive activity in several directions, with the most satisfactory results. The Society acquired a large community farm; organized a strong youth department, directing its youth activities into proper channels; began to publish its own organ; introduced a new insurance system; and worked out new plans for the educational and cultural activities of the organization. All praise and credit is due the men heading this great Russian organization in the East.</p>
   <p>But not only the New York Russians have forged ahead. We Russians in Chicago have also accomplished a few things of which we can be justly proud. Our Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is likewise one of the largest Russian organizations in America. Our headquarters on Wood Street, the base of the Society's operations in the Middle Western states, is getting stronger every day. A new Russian building is now being erected next to our present quarters; it will house a church, national home, and a school--all under one roof. The work is going on with full speed, and soon will be finished. Even those of our fellow Russians who have embraced the Communist doctrine, and who are hostile to our organization and to everything non-Communist, stare with amazement at the growing structure, a sign of the power and influence of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society over Russian people.</p>
   
   <p>The Independent Society, too, has been threatened by inside enemies, by Communist members of the organization, but it has succeeded in warding off their attacks. Some of these enemies have been forced to leave the organization; others are still on the roster, but are being watched.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has also reorganized its children's department and has laid the foundation for its rapid development.</p>
   <p>New insurance rates have been adopted, in accordance with the decisions made at the twenty-third convention of the Society.</p>
   <p>The educational work conducted by the organization is developing quite satisfactorily. The Society maintains several Russian schools for children. The School Council is composed of well-qualified men. One sad feature of the school problem is the fact that Russian parents are not sufficiently interested in our schools and are rather negligent and indifferent about getting their children to learn their native tongue. This indifferent attitude of Russian parents toward their children's acquisition of the Russian language is all the more heartbreaking when one realizes that Russian is becoming more and more popular throughout the world. Thousands of Americans, Japanese, and Germans are studying it.</p>
   <p>The Russians in Chicago have also achieved some gains in political life. Last year we organized the Russian-American Democratic League for the purpose of giving our young generation the opportunity to enter the political life of the city, state, and nation. Today, this organization has nearly one thousand members and twenty branches, located in various parts of the city. The Russian-American Democratic League has established political contacts with the city, county, and state authorities and political leaders. It offers free aid to Russians living in Chicago and vicinity on such matters as citizenship, immigration problems, taxes, unemployment, relief, etc. On August 19, the League held a large picnic, which was attended by several thousand people. Many speeches were made. Prominent city and state authorities were present. Other Slavic groups also sent representatives to the picnic as a token of the solidarity of all Slavonic groups in the Chicago area.</p>
   <p>It is comforting to observe how the "Red fog" which threatened our national existence is lifting gradually, revealing the bright horizon of a better future for the Russian group in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
