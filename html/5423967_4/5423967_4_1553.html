   <p>The White Russians belong to the family of Slavic nations and occupy a territory of about 350,000 sq. km., in the upper part of the Dnieper, the Dvina and the upper and central parts of Niemen. Everywhere on this territory the White Russians live in compact masses and constitute an unquestioned majority of the population.</p>
   <p>The World War which brought about the emancipation, freedom and independence to many European nations, terminated for the White Russians in a partition of their national territory among three states, Soviet Russia, Poland and Latvia. There are at present about eight million White Russians in Soviet Russia on a territory of about 250,000 sq. km., over two million in Poland on a territory of about 100,000 sq. km., and about 200,000 souls in Latvia on a small territory. In addition to this there are about one million White Russians in Siberia and over one half million immigrants in the United States. Therefore there are twelve million of White Russians in the world.</p>
   <p>Regarding religious affiliations, four-fifths of the White Russians are Greek Orthodox and one-fifth are Roman-Cathclic.</p>
   <p>The civilized world does not know much about the regeneration of White Russian people, because before the World War, under the influence of Russia, they were classified as Russians. The 19th century witnessed the national awakening of the White Russian people. Notwithstanding the great oppression on the part of the Russian Government, and in spite of the strong religious influence of Poland, the White Russians laid down the foundation for their national emancipation. At that time the first White Russian organizations were formed, White Russian books were published, and after the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1905, the first White Russian newspapers were edited. At that time also the activity of White Russians began to be felt in the political field.</p>
   
   <p>White Russians joined in the general demand for the reconstruction of the Russian Empire on the basis of territorial autonomy. The aspiration of oppressed nations within Russia was to transform the Russian Empire into a federation in which white Russia was to be an independent unit. However, the return of the reaction in the following years held back the development of the White Russian movements and aspirations. It held it back but did not annihilate it.</p>
   <p>For, when as a result of the Russian Revolution in 1917 the Czarat fell and with its fall fell the chains of slavery of the Russian State. The White Russian movement of regeneration went quickly forward. The first general White Russian Congress called at Minsk in March 1917 was not satisfied with the former White Russian demand for White Russian autonomy within the Russian federation, but it went a step further and created the White Russian Ceneral Committee which exercised governmental functions on the entire White Russian territory. Other White Russian political organizations, such as the Central Council of the White Russian organization, the Military White Russian Council, the Great White Russian Council and others were grouped around the said Committee. Since then the work of organizing and preparing the White Russian people for a complete political independence of White Russia was conducted with great enthusiasm and energy.</p>
   <p>As a result of this work, an all-White Russian Congress was held at Minsk from the 18th to the 31st of December, 1917. This Congress was attended by the representatives of the entire White Russian territory, numbering 2,000 persons, including among then representatives of the western portion of White Russia which at that time was under the German military occupation.</p>
   <p>The Congress did not conclude its work because the Russian Bolsheviks, who came into power, occupied the eastern parts of White Russia including the city of Minsk and dispersed the Congress. A new period of constant struggles began. However, when the German troops evacuated the western portion of White Russia, the Council of the White Russian People's Republic proclaimed complete independence of the White Russian state.</p>
   <p>This political step was of immense consequence to the White Russian nation because the call of independence since then became the leading thought of the whole White Russian political movement. However, not-withstanding the popular feeling and aspirations regarding the independence of White Russia, on termination of the World War and evacuation of the Eastern Front by the German army, White Russians again fell into a whirlpool of struggles with its western and eastern neighbors, and finally the eastern part of its territory was incorporated into Soviet Russia and the western portion into Poland. The peace treaty between Poland and Soviet Russia concluded at Riga in 1921 confirmed this state of affairs.</p>
   <p>Already at the first occupation of the White Russian territory in 1918 by Russian Bolsheviks, the latter reckoning with the strivings and aspirations of the White Russian nation at the conference of the Russian Communist Party at Smolensk on December 28, 1918, recognized in their own interest to promulgate the White Russian Soviet Republic. The Bolsheviks at that time clearly stated that they did it with a view of making use of the White Russian movement for independence so as to facilitate the conversion of the White Russian people to the Bolshevik cause and to secure to themselves a degree of influence for the White Russian masses. There is no doubt that these considerations are decisive also today in the Bolshevist policy towards the White Russians.</p>
   <p>After the Bolsheviks came into power in the eastern White Russian territory and upon conclusion of the peace treaty at Riga, the White Russian Socialist Soviet Republic as established by the Bolsheviks with its seat of government at Minsk comprised only 110,000 square km., with 4 1/2 million inhabitants. The remaining territory with five million people was attached to the Russian Soviet Republic, and this constitutes an undeniable proof that the Bolsheviks do not intend to satisfy the aspirations of the white Russians, but make small concessions to them in order to wield their influence for their own purpose. Notwithstanding these facts the white Russian national movement increases steadily in the Soviet White Russia. The cultural work although necessarily proceeds (sic) along the Bolshevik lines, has made great progress. Primary, secondary and higher schools are chiefly white Russian. Science and art are developing.</p>
   <p>As already mentioned, the western portion of the white Russian territory is within the boundaries of the Polish state ever since the Riga Peace Treaty was signed. According to the official Polish statistics of September 31, 1921, there were in Poland 1,172,955 White Russians. However, undoubtedly many white Russians of Roman-Catholic faith were registered as Poles, Polish constitution and a series of laws passed in pursuance thereto, as well as the treaty on national minorities signed by Poland at Versailles were supposed to be the guarantees for free and unobstructed development of White Russians in political, cultural and economical fields. These laws and international guarantees were in reality scraps of paper. Not one of these laws came into force as far as White Russians were concerned. Thus in the most important domain, that of education, the discrimination against White Russians is the most striking. In the entire Polish state there is not one White Russian school of governmental status, five mixed Polish-White Russian schools are not being taken into consideration. The widespread demand of White Russians for the establishment of the White Russian schools remain unanswered. The taxes collected from White Russians help the establishment and maintenance of purely Polish schools which constitute the means of Polonization of White Russian. Invariably no permission for the establishment of private White Russian schools is granted. And if exceptions are made, then again it is impossible to obtain the conformation of the teachers. In the primary schools in the White Russian territory the teachers are Polos imported from Poland, whereas White Russian teachers remain without employment and without means for for earning a livelihood in their profession.</p>
   <p>Parish and district community organizations exist only on paper in White Russian territory. Everywhere mayors are appointed by Polish authorities and they make use of their subordinate administrative and police organs for the benefit of their masters. Not even the heads of parishes are elected by the population but are appointed by the mayors. Parish councils face dissolution if they act independently. Parish and district councils have to abide strictly by the orders of mayors. If any of them dare to act independently in a way that does not please the authorities, they are persecuted and often arrested.</p>
   <p>All the political administration is in the hands of Polish officials, brought chiefly from purely Polish provinces: Congress Poland and Western Galicia.</p>
   <p>White Russians are not permitted to take part in the administration. Imported officials not acquainted with local conditions and requirements of the population, treat the White Russians badly and the higher authorities tolerate this.</p>
   <p>The economic policy of Poland does injustice to White Russians and constitutes a means of their exploitation. Even in pre-war times, the condition in the White Russian territory which is now incorporated in Poland were very abnormal. Although this territory is very large it includes comparatively very little arable land, for most of it are forests and marshes. Owing to this concentration of population in arable parts of the territory, the density of population compares with that in the ethnographical Polish territories. This condition is made worse by complete lack of industry so that on small plots of arable land the agricultural population is crowded and this situation reduces the farmers to the poor agricultural proletariat crying to make out a living from their dwarfish farms. To make things worse, at least one half of the arable land belongs to the large land proprietors, who are chiefly Poles. The population in effect is no more than servants of these large estates. Even during the Polish (sic) rule the lack of land was severely felt in the western part of White Russia. This caused large emigration of White Russians to the United States and Siberia. At present under the Polish rule the situation has become almost tragical. The war and its resultant devastation, and later inflation led White Russians to a state of extreme poverty. Up to the present time 50c of the devastated farms were not rebuilt. A large part of the population is still living in hovels. It would seem that the highly advertised agrarian reforms would improve matters at least partially and would ameliorate the terrible agricultural and social conditions in Western White Russia.</p>
   <p>These hopes were not realized. Although these agrarian reforms were carried through, the land taken away from large land proprietors were given exclusively to Polish civil and military colonists brought from the west. Owing to this the situation is much worse today than it was before the war. Said agrarian reforms and consequent colonization brought about the unemployment of the farm laborers who prior thereto found employment on large estates. As a result the army of small land owners and farm laborers was augmented by hungry agricultural proletarians, which increased internal fermentation in that part of the country. The situation seems hopeless because Polish authorities turn a deaf ear to all warnings and complaints on the part of representatives of the White Russian people, and they seem not to see what happens or takes place in the present White Russian territories. They evidently are of the opinion that mechanical repressions and thoughtless suppressions of every symptom of White Russian national life will serve the purpose and will take the place of the needed fundamental and radical reforms without which there never will be any peace and normal life on White Russian territories.</p>
   <p>The White Russian population neither expects nor counts on any miracles, but desires to continue its struggle for a better tomorrow. To this end it does not shirk the work, taking examples from other nations which clearly teach that there is no power in the world which would push back into the darkness of slavery a nation which has started a new life.</p>
   <p>The above is the speech delivered by the White Russian Deputy, Fabian Yeremicz, in the Polish parliament as reported in Natio No. 12, January-February, 1927, a magazine printed in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Poland, in the interests of minorities in Poland.</p>
