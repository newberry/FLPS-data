   <p>In two months the twenty-fourth Supreme Congress of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society will gather in Chicago. As usual, at this Congress, reports from the local branches will be read before the delegates. In these reports the branches reveal to the delegates their activity and accomplishments during the year, for the benefit of the Society as a whole and for the Russian colony in America in general. The branches report the number of new members taken in, particularly the young ones.</p>
   <p>These are the questions and issues which interest us the most at the present time:</p>
   <p>Only two months remain before the Congress will convene. What news will the delegates bring, what joys to gladden the hearts of the members of the Central Administration, who work without stint, with sacrifice and without any thought of personal gain?</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>During this year the Central Committee has carried out reforms of great importance. A firm foundation has been laid under the Society by the introduction of new forms of insurance. These reforms are of considerable importance to the Russian colonists in America.</p>
   <p>Members of R.I.M.A.S., the rank and file of the Society, do all the work in the organization themselves, in their own language. They administer their affairs the way they desire and enjoy complete freedom of action, and yet enjoy complete economic security and a guarantee on a par with the best American insurance companies.</p>
   <p>We have more than once pointed out the fact that premiums in R.I.M.A.S. are somewhat lower than the payments in American concerns. We believe that all active and advanced members of all branches of R.I.M.A.S. have done all in their power to explain to the Russian people, in their respective localities, the importance of the reform undertaken and carried out by the Central Committee this year.</p>
   <p>If there is some work that remains to be done, and if there are some details in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the plan which are not clear to the masses, we advise you to hurry up, and, during the two months preceding the convening of the Congress, to do everything that is possible to bring about a much closer unification of the Russian people in America.</p>
   <p>If all the active members of the organization, scattered among the branches of R.I.M.A.S., will take up the task energetically, we are certain that the family of our members will grow immensely this year.</p>
   <p>We hope that speeches and reports of the delegates at the approaching Congress will throb with vigor, with success of work done, and with determination to proceed full steam ahead. The delegates will undoubtedly awaken great, untouched reservoirs of energy hidden among the members of the Independent Society. There is, we are sure, much strength and youth among our people, and they will be revealed in all their glory to gladden the friends of our organization and to frustrate the evil-doing of our enemies.</p>
