   <p>In Washington the subject for discussion and thought is whether or not the Soviet government should be given official recognition by this country. Of course, the American Government is not afraid of the Bolsheviks. The fact that the Bolshevik dictatorship is oppressing and tyrannizing the Russian workers and peasants does not seem to disconcert our Washington officials very much. All that they are interested in are the potentially large commercial orders from the Bolsheviks, who skillfully use this factor as bait and as their chief argument for the recognition of the Kremlin masters. Naturally, the Reds are very generous in making all kinds of promises, but Washington, naturally, demands more real proofs that the recognition of the Moscow government by the United States will bring real, not imaginary, benefits.</p>
   <p>But there are also in Washington those enthusiasts of Bolshevik recognition who are ready to believe the word of the Reds, to accept their promises as pure gold, <span class="page-break">\2</span>even to offering them huge credits in exchange for their valueless promissory notes--all to promote the development of commercial relations with the Soviets.</p>
   <p>These enthusiasts do not seem to realize that these commercial relations will bring nothing but loss to the American people. The Bolsheviks are ready to take all American surpluses of manufactured goods, which are enormous; but, they want to buy on credit and pay for these surpluses some time in the future--which means never. Such commercial relations with the Soviets would only mean dumping our goods into a bottomless abyss. With present economic conditions in America as they are, and with millions of unemployed in urgent need of the necessities of life, it would be inexcusable stupidity, bordering on crime, to give away our surpluses which might be used here in America. Only heartless persons who are not in the least interested in the welfare of the American people are capable of refusing to aid our American unemployed in meeting their daily needs, in order to satisfy the Bolsheviks and load them with benefits.</p>
   <p>The possibility of the recognition of the Soviet government appears to serve as a <span class="page-break">\3</span>subject of lively discussions among the Russian people in America. One of the leaders of the Social Revolutionists in America, F. C. Maysvetoff, recently read a report in New York, advocating the recognition of the Soviets by the United States. He calls his arguments "the arguments of the opponent." [Translator's note: the Social Revolutionists oppose the Soviet government.]</p>
   <p>In his report Mr. Maysvetoff points out that the Bolshevik dictatorship had a destroying influence on the progress of the international social revolution; that Bolsheviks no longer differ from any other bourgeois state; that their foreign policy is similar to that of the old Czarist regime of Russia; that the Bolsheviks fall upon their knees before stronger states, while, at the same time, grabbing the smaller nations by the throat; that the Soviets are following a policy of aggression; that they conclude agreements and treaties with fascist governments; and that the Soviets are to blame for the fascist revolution in Germany.</p>
   <p>In general, Mr. Maysvetoff was not very flattering to the Bolsheviks, for he <span class="page-break">\4</span>characterized them as villains, scoundrels, adventurers, and stranglers of the Russian people. Nevertheless, in the opinion of Mr. Maysvetoff, these villains and thieves should be recognized by the United States. And by what right? On the strength of the fact, continues Mr. Maysvetoff, that after the recognition of the Soviets by the United States, it will be easier to obtain true information about Soviet Russia and from Russia; and, thus, it will become possible to re-establish relations with the people of Russia, making the relations more close and friendly.</p>
   <p>All these calculations are not true, however, The presence in Moscow of an American envoy will not add anything new to the information about the Soviet regime, which is known already by the entire world. And insofar as Anti-Communist propaganda, foreign excursionists into Russia, and Russian immigrants are concerned, one can be certain that even after recognition, the U. S. S. R. will not allow "undesirable" foreigners and "White Guard" Russians to enter the Soviet Union.</p>
   <p>The complete, unconditional recognition of the Soviets by the United States <span class="page-break">\5</span>Government will only benefit the Soviets, and tighten the Bolshevik noose all the more around the neck of the Russian people.</p>
