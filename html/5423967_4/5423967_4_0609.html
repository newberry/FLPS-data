   <p>In truth it is not clear to me, why the editors of Rassviet decided to print the article of S. Zhukov, and to devote a special editorial to the said article.</p>
   <p>If time permits and if we were willing, it would be possible to find in the Russian-American press hundreds of exactly similar articles, on the same subject, with the same thought, criticism, desire, hope, and conclusion. And with the same actual results.</p>
   <p>Therefore,[let us]dedicate this article not to the individual letter of S. Zhukov, but to the countless authors who write many such ineffectual articles on the same shop-worn theme: why do such conditions exist in the Russian colony?</p>
   
   <p>Three or four years ago, I had printed in Rassviet an article on this theme under the frankly pessimistic heading, "Without a Future."</p>
   <p>Since that time I have spent years of work in the various social organizations of the Colony. I believe that the experience gained during that period gives me the right to express myself with even more frankness and exactness in offering my answer to this question. For this privilege I paid a sufficiently dear price.</p>
   <p>Where is the root of this evil? What are the reasons for the existence of such conditions in the Colony? And why could not those who tried to answer, who so helplessly indicated third-grade motives, see and discover the chief and main points? Why, after all, are the conclusions and wishes of these authors so extremely futile, so empty of results? Why is it that every time all efforts to break down this vicious circle lead us inevitably and implacably to those fatal words of the poet:</p>
   
   <p>"Suzhdeny Vam blagie poryvy,</p>
   <p>No svershit nichego ne dano."</p>
   <p>["Fate blesses you with honorable</p>
   <p>impulse, But does not give you</p>
   <p>the means to achieve."]</p>
   <p>There is not only one root of this evil--there are several.</p>
   <p>First of all: the Colony is segregated from the rest of the world, and therefore what invariably develops with any segregated group, happens here--the Colony becomes isolated from the social welfare work of the rest of the world, from its thought, from its emotional attitude and from[its concept of] problems. For the Colony, as for one of Gorki's heroes in his drama "Na dne" [The Lower Depths], "nichego ne nuzhno" (nothing is needed).</p>
   <p>I often attend the American workers' meetings, lectures, and debates. For the past few years, I have noticed among them many new faces. They are of different ages. The halls and auditoriums which, not long ago, were comparatively empty are now filled with men and women. They listen attentively, and ask sensible and reasonable questions. Those of different opinions listen with due respect and tolerance, (by the way, the communists here too are exceptional). Everyone feels that something wrong has occurred in the world at the present time, and therefore it is necessary that each person develop his understanding in order to broaden his viewpoint.</p>
   <p>But what about our Colony? It remains outside. It is completely absorbed in its own prittle-prattle. The labor movement does not interest the Colony. The lectures on such themes are not well organized, and even if they are, they are not attended. The topics of today, agitating the whole world, after all do reach the Colony, but arouse no one and finally only annoy and divert the colonist from his regular habits and subjective reflections.</p>
   <p>Therefore, with futile effort, we seek the explanation for our evils within the boundaries of the Colony, as for example S. Zhukov and hundreds of other writers have done.</p>
   <p>All the matter boils down to is the fact that we must break this vicious circle, we must cease to be only a "colony", cease to be some sort of a lost island where the "Robinson Crusoes" of a wrecked ship have settled.</p>
   <p>The trouble is not that we have several organizations instead of one, not that we have five or ten newspapers instead of one. The trouble lies within these organizations which do not have a healthy social life. They make no attempt to clarify us on the great questions and problems of the contemporary era; they do not invite us to participate actively in the workers' movements but instead they substitute badly arranged and stupid meetings characterized by intrigue, quarrels, disorderly debates, by idle talk, and reactionary blowing and prattling of "patriotic ideals".</p>
   <p>Debate is the very essence of society. To our Colony it seems new, but in the cultured nations of Europe, existing for centuries with a free political life, there developed long ago an irrefutable axiom--the theory that from the clash of various opinions, truth is born. It is imperative that debates should be held around important social questions, with practical discussion of the problems relating to the movement for the liberation of labor. Then, and only then, will our debates by their sense and by their form become more valuable, and cease to resemble the old famous argument between Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Nikiforovich, immortalized by M. Gogol--a dispute which started because one of the above-mentioned gentlemen called the other "Gusak" (The gander).</p>
   <p>Debate in the name of great ideals, participation in the solving of great problems, elevated human beings, forced the weak to try to rise to the level of the strong, gradually eliminated coarse impulse and indecorous behaviour in the development of society and in the quarrels of the press. But where great practical problems are unknown, there life inevitably reverts to the swamp, and from the swamp inevitably grow those rotten, poisonous blossoms about which countless authors write daily. That is why I consider the reasons offered as basic causes, existing independently, to be of third-rate importance.</p>
   <p>But now I come to the second root of evil. For the purpose of understanding why such conditions exist in the Russian colony, and why our social life is rotting, it is absolutely necessary to increase our knowledge. In justice, we have the right to demand from the writers about whom I am talking, that they be responsible for the development of our enlightenment, that they must increase the number of lectures, reports, debates, libraries, discussion clubs, so that the social life of the Colony might become active, and becoming active, would gradually be raised to a higher level.</p>
   <p>To this end, the responsibility, naturally personal and moral, and the obligation to support all sorts of valid educational movements, fall on such authors as S. Zhukov and others. And so the second root of the evil appears before us. The social needs and the realities of life prove that the authors of[this type of]criticism and the critics of the sins of others are found wanting in time of need. Where they should stand and firmly defend the need for enlightenment, where it is essential that they encourage and protect social workers, there the critics suddenly are silent. Why? I, myself, would like to know the answer to this question. To make the case clearer, I shall take a concrete example: the program edited by Rubakin for R.O.O.V. Russkoye ob'edinennoye obschchestvo vzaimopomoshchi (Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society). Which one of the critics penned a defense of this great social and educational movement? Who of the hundreds of writers took the effort to discover whether such an enterprise could, or could not be developed? Which one of them rebelled and protested in the press when so-called old colonists appeared at the meeting and declared, to their shame, "We do not want those Rubakins",--or again when another reputed "social worker" at the large meeting of the organization, after hearing the report of the educational program founded on the Rubakin system, stretched himself to his full length and thunderingly asked, "Will we get more money from it?"</p>
   <p>The critics were silent. They are silent even now. Such being the case, would it not be better to begin with self-criticism? Then we probably would find out why the colony has so few voluntary social workers.</p>
   <p>Here is another example: in the same copy of Rassviet of December 19, next to the article of S. Zhukov, there is an article by D. Onatskovskiy. It is an attack upon the "Zdeshnie chekisty" (Local chekists). Such articles are printed by the hundreds. But where were the authors of these articles when an attempt was made in the Colony to organize an honest, non-partisan but revolutionary organization to combat the Bolsheviki. The initiators who accepted all the burden of the organizational work were helpless, without support, without protection from the insults pouring in on them.</p>
   
   <p>This is a result of our vicious circle. Not participating in any practical venture of large social or political significance, the Colony is uninterested, and on the whole unmindful[of the fact]that theory without practice has never been of value or interest to anyone or anything. And not possessing this knowledge which widens the social horizon of the human being, the Colony not only cannot understand, but cannot even see the breadth and importance of these social problems placed by the modern era before all humanity and before each individual. And when some one who is eager to break this vicious circle appears, the same critics are the first to cry out "only without your leadership or politics", the stereotyped phrases which also end the article of D. Onatskovskiy.</p>
   <p>Forgive me for using such bitter and caustic words. I swear that they are not prompted by malice, but I confess that they are prompted by grief, resulting from many painful[experiences]and observations of the social workers in our Colony.</p>
   
   <p>There is one root remaining, the third "root of evil". It is bolshevism with its degenerating influence upon the colony, and the profound disillusionment of the colony in it. But this attitude cannot be used as justification by those who think that the world is wholly Bolshevist and cannot see other paths of social service and other doctrines. And this narrow horizon, again cannot be forgiven.</p>
   <p>It is customary to talk about the ignorance of the people in tzarist Russia. But no matter how difficult it is at present in America, we will always have opportunities for learning, for self-development, for participation in the preparation of a new life. It is time to drop the various pretexts which only indicate spiritual apathy, negligence, and mental inertia.</p>
