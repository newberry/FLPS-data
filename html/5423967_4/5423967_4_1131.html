   <p>There is in existence in Chicago a Russian community of Evangelical Christians.</p>
   <p>This community consists of 70 members who own a church bearing the name of House of the Gospel (Dom Evangheliya). (Note: This church is still in existence, and is situated at 2127 Crystal St. D.S.)</p>
   <p>The office of presbyter of this church is held by the Rev. John Johnson, a Russian immigrant. When the writer of this notice asked him about the difference between the sect of Evangelical Christians, the Russian Orthodox Church and other sects, Rev. Johnson gave the following answer: "The peculiarity of the Evangelical Christians is this, they do not accept any of the church dogmas and ceremonies." (Note: This is probably a misunderstanding of the author <span class="page-break">\2</span>of this notice of what Rev. Jonnson told him. The Russian Evangelical Christians share with all Christian churches many of their dogmas; they do not accept, however, the elaborate church ceremonies of the Russian Orthodox Church. Their service is very simple, similar to that of the Baptists, the Congregationalists, and other Protestant sects. As regards teachings, their chief peculiarity is that they do not believe in the baptism of infants, and accept into their community only persons who have been truly converted. They do not insist, however, on the ceremony of baptism as strictly as the Baptists do. D.S.)</p>
   <p>The Evangelical Christians are very strict as regards purity of life; they do not smoke, nor drink intoxicants, nor swear. Those who do not observe these rules lose their membership.</p>
   <p>The Community consists exclusively of workmen. They publish a magazine entitled the Liberator (Osvoboditel). Every two weeks they arrange free <span class="page-break">\3</span>forums at which various questions are discussed. There are several such communities in America, numbering altogether about five hundred members. There are besides other similar communities having a membership of five hundred or six hundred.</p>
