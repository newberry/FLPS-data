   <p>The Russian boys and girls organized as a unit of Branch Number 18 of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society held their first picnic last Sunday. Besides the young people, there were many members of the older generation, who, by their presence, wanted to show their appreciation of the work of the younger generation.</p>
   <p>It was interesting to note that while the young people entertained themselves by playing ball and by dancing, the older people, gathered into small groups, indulged in conversation, recalling the old events and experiences and predicting the new. There were no incidents of insobriety, no rough language.</p>
   <p>About seven o'clock in the evening, as is customary at all our picnics, the speakers began their speeches. Mr. Volodkni was the first speaker. He praised the Russian youth for their work and for their cultivation of the Russian language and Russian traditions. Mr. Raskatov, the second speaker, explained the meaning and importance of the Russian contributions to world culture in the realm of such arts as music and literature. He also stressed the necessity for the Russian-American youth to master the Russian language as a key and a guide to Russian culture. Mr. Olesiuk and Mr. V. Pasiuk, the latter a chairman of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, urged the Russian-American boys and girls to join the benefit organizations of their fathers and thus assure the continuity of the Russian language and Russian culture among the second Russian generation in America.</p>
   <p>The picnic was a great success. It brought considerable financial gain to the lean treasury of the youth department of Branch Number 18 of the Independent Society, and it gave much moral satisfaction to the fathers and mothers who attended the picnic.</p>
