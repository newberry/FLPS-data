   <p>In the previous issue of the Byelorusskaya Tribuna, in the article "How Did this Begin?" T. Korablinov recalls how in 1921 an idea developed of organizing the White Russians in the United States. The office of the Byelorusskaya Tribuna is in possession of the constitution of White Russians and Little Russians' Alliance in Grand Rapids, Mich. (Ustav Tovarishchestva Byelorussov i Malorussov v Grand Rapids, Mich.), published in the Russian language and in the form of a pamphlet, in the printing shop of the New York newspaper Sviet, in 1914. The constitution, however, was adopted by the organization on the 20th of April, 1913. At that time the committee of the organization consisted of P. Adamski, A. Lenski, and O. Kotovski. Thus the White Russian movement in the United States has been in existence for over fifteen years.</p>
