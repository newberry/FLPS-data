   <p>Communist newspapers printed in the Russian language are scared by the news from Washington that negotiations are going on between the American and the Soviet governments regarding the deportation to the Soviet Union of those Communists in America who were born in Russia.</p>
   <p>According to the report of the Secretary of Labor, there are at present on the government deportation list eighty-eight Communists deportable to Russia. These Russian communists could not be deported before, because the United States Government had no diplomatic relations with the Soviet government, and did not recognize the Soviet regime. Because of this fact the Soviet government refused to receive the deportees from the United States, and even after diplomatic relations between the two countries were re-established the situation remained as before, for during the talks of Mr. Litvinov, the Soviet Commissar of Foreign Affairs, with <span class="page-break">2</span>Mr. Roosevelt no mention was made of the deportation question.</p>
   <p>Lately, however, because of increased Communist activity in this country, the Washington Administration has decided to send back to the Soviet "paradise" all those American Communists who were born in Russia, and who advocate the establishment of the Communist system in America. For the time being there are eighty-eight candidates marked for deportation to Russia, but soon there will be more, as Washington is now considering deportation not only of non-citizen Communists, but also of those who have acquired citizenship yet are engaged in Communistic agitation.</p>
   <p>It would seem that the negotiations now in progress between Washington and Moscow concerning this important question should not worry the Communists, but should rather make them glad. However, reports that the negotiations in Washington are proceeding smoothly have filled many Red prophets with fear and even panic. It appears they are so afraid of the Bolshevik bliss that they would give anything to save themselves from deportation. They have just made an appeal to <span class="page-break">3</span>to all American workers to organize meetings and send telegrams to Washington, protesting against the proposed deportation. And yet these same Red heroes, even those who are American citizens, have impudence enought to proclaim to the credulous that Soviet Russia is their dearest and most beloved country, and that its institutions are the paragon of liberty and justice. Conditions in Soviet, Russia, they say, cannot be compared with American slums, unemployment and capitalistic slavery. But, at the same time, they cling to the last thread of hope that they will be allowed to remain in this "capitalistic hell," as they call America.</p>
   <p>One should not wonder at this strange behavior of the Russian-American Communists facing deportation to Soviet Russia. They know too well what kind of prosperity and happiness is awaiting them in the Soviet land. They know it from those Russian Bolsheviks who have succeeded in escaping from the Soviet bliss to "slave-driving, capitalistic America", and who unanimously declare that Russian peasants and workers are in a much worse condition than the American unemployed. All American Communists are "kulaks" and capitalists in comparison with Russian <span class="page-break">4</span>peasants and workers.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that when they find themselves actually facing deportation to Soviet Russia, the Russian-born American Communists will appeal to American courts, and will cite the American Constitution to save themselves from deportation to their "promised land"--Soviet Russia.</p>
