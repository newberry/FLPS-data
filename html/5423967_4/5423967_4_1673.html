   <p>Sad as it is, it has to be pointed out that the ranks of the progressive and radical members of our colony are getting thinner. Year after year, day after day our best men depart from us to the land of eternal rest. Whether the death be a natural one or due to some untoward circumstance, it matters not. We lose them in either case and with each succeeding death we who remain behind are affected by their loss more and more poignantly and feel orphaned.</p>
   <p>The number of Russian immigrants in America who have gone to the land of eternal rest is too great. They occupy a place in the cemeteries of all the cities of our second temporary fatherland, and one has something to say about every one of them. Each one has an individual life history. Many of them led a solitary, secluded life. Their death was hardly noticed by their compatriots, and consequently affected them little. However, when we lose men or women who did not live for themselves but worked continuously and disinterestedly for the good of society, when such truly useful work lasted not one or two years but for several decades, one feels in losing <span class="page-break">2</span>them as if a part of our own life had gone from us.</p>
   <p>Our late fellow worker Vasily Khomich was one of these men. He played a not insignificant role in the political and social life of this country, especially in the Russian colony of the city of Chicago. During the last few years, however, he somewhat retired from public activities. This happened for several good reasons. First of all he may have become disappointed in the success of the Russian revolution; in the second place the apathetic and negligent attitude of the Russian colony towards all kinds of organizing and public work was disheartening; and in the third place his personal life was beset with financial difficulties.</p>
   <p>Vasily Khomich was born in a family of poor peasants in the province of Grodno. Like most of us he also came to the United States of America as a young man, in 1912, hoping to return soon to his peaceful native village. But an evil fate decreed for him another course in life which proved to be too rough for such an artless and simple rustic.</p>
   <p>Still while working through this path, Khomich developed into a man of strong <span class="page-break">3</span>will and this new nature opposed the old slavish one vanquished by the new man.</p>
   <p>He had won a victory but did not feel quite free yet, being surrounded by a multitude of slaves living in a state of utter mental darkness, and he had to go to his grave under such conditions - a new man, and yet outwardly a slave among other slaves.</p>
   <p>Like most of us V. Khomich, when he came to this country, was an illiterate, intellectually backward youth. Though young and frail he had to work in the stuffy atmosphere of factories and plants. Being used to the freedom of vast fields, he could not easily adapt himself to this infernal life. In spite of such a sudden change in his life, he did not lose courage; he overcame all pessimistic moods, started to fashion himself into a sturdy daring man, into a fighter, and devoted himself entirely to the service of the cause of labor. Since the first years of his life in this country Vasily Khomich began to educate himself and to read. He became interested in <span class="page-break">4</span>organizations. Lectures, meetings, assemblies and forums became his hobbies. Later he began to make speeches himself and to encourage the people to fight the age-long oppression and to gain a better lot and those rights which should belong to every man. Who among the Chicago Russians does not remember the late fellow worker Khomich? He could be met anywhere, talking, discussing or voicing some appeal. The people were willing to listen. They loved him and trusted him because they felt the sincerity and honesty of his convictions, his impulses, and his revolutionary spirit. V. Khomich's activity was not limited to Chicago alone; he also visited other places. From 1916 to 1926 he belonged to the Industrial Workers of the World. While Khomich was a member of the organization of the IWW he worked in several of its branches. He worked in mines, in the timber regions in North and South Dakota, and everywhere he carried on propaganda and succeeded in being a good agitator.</p>
   <p>Vasily Khomich had a good command of the English language and therefore could often address American audiences.</p>
   <p>Many of us remember the Russian IWW newspaper Golos Truzhenika (The Voice of <span class="page-break">5</span>the Toiler) which flourished for a period of ten years. This paper was much indebted to Vasily Khomich. During the last years of its existence it was Khomich who almost alone bore the whole burden of editing and publishing this paper. He did the work of a typesetter, a translator, a corrector and a distributor. Observing Khomich at work I had often asked myself: where does this somewhat handicapped man find so much energy and such iron will?</p>
   <p>However, an end comes to everything; for there is a limit to all things. Ultimately everyone becomes tired, exhausted. This very thing befell our fellow worker Khomich. He became tired and exhausted. On the one hand he was lonely. He perceived how his former friends had abandoned him, becoming absorbed in the cares of their own life.</p>
   <p>On the other hand the economic conditions of his life were steadily becoming worse, more and more unbearable. Moreover the Russian revolution had taken a course which he had not foreseen. All these circumstances forced him to adopt a course of action which did not agree with his feelings and ideas. He was forced to work with people who had nothing in common with his principles and views or were even inimical to them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Whatever views Vasily Khomich may have held during the last years of his life, it cannot be denied that the work he has done for the labor movement should be regarded as very valuable. Among the Russians living in America, many owe him a great debt of gratitude. It was his influence that made many read, think and fight for the rights of man. When witnessing the burial of Khomich, I was extremely sorry to see that only a very small number of people came to his funeral.</p>
   <p>However, more pleasant thoughts arose in my mind when I saw that at least this small group (fifty or sixty persons) was deeply affected by sorrow when at last it was time to bid the last farewell to our fellow worker Khomich. Around his grave, with bowed heads stood many old members of our colony and several public men, among them the well-known Russian actor A. Pokatilov, Mme. P. Maksakov, a singer; Orlovsky, an attorney; P. Yurkevich, A. Skopin, and a number of other persons unknown to me.</p>
   <p>Khomich was not a religious man and therefore he was buried without any religious rites.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>S. Volodkin made a funeral speech in which he briefly characterized our late fellow worker's meritorious activity and said how sad and painful was Khomich's early death. Volodkin was unable to finish his speech, it was interrupted by his own sobs. He stepped aside from the grave and for a long time could not control his feelings. He was not alone in his sorrow; all those present had visible tears and when the coffin was lowered into the grave sobs were audible. A true man had gone from us.</p>
   <p>What irony of fate. Khomich's old mother is still alive in Russia! He was her only son and was helping her to the best of his ability.</p>
   <p>What will the poor woman say, what will she feel when she learns of her son's death?</p>
