   <p>There has begun a spiritual revival among Russian groups in the United States and in Canada. There is evidence of new life among the Russians in America. They are gathering in promising numbers at lectures, theatricals and meetings. New organizations have come into being. Youth clubs are active. Our Russian schools show a great improvement in attendance. Russian books and newspapers attract more attention than they did before.</p>
   <p>This new life among our people has its reasons. In the first place, the economic conditions in the country as a whole have improved considerably. This fact unquestionably has a good effect upon the economic life of our people. In the second place, there has been a decided spiritual awakening among the Russian people.</p>
   <p>There are now some signs which unmistakably point to the fact that the Russian group is beginning to understand that it has been traveling on the wrong road, one leading in the opposite direction to the true aims of the group and that this is why the Russian group has accomplished nothing, and cannot point with pride to any achievement resulting from its united effort.</p>
   <p>At last the Russian people have opened their eyes and understand that at the base of all their non-accomplishment has been bad leadership--leadership usurped by adventurers and charlatans. These false leaders, as soon as they entered the political, economic, and cultural arena of our public life, began to break our unity, our solidarity; to set individual against individual friend against friend; to attempt to split the Russian group from the inside. They fed us, not on truth and reality, but on substitutes of doubtful value. [Translator's note: By "false leaders" the writer means the Communist agitators who have wrought much havoc in the life of the Russian group in America.] Thus our group has been descending lower and lower on the ladder of general civilization.</p>
   <p>The awakening has come none too soon, for the Russian groups in many cities in America have found themselves sunk up to their necks in the mire of political, social and economic theories and Utopias ardently promulgated by their false leaders. Now however, all political questions are consigned by the Russians to the farthest corner of their collective mind, as they are now conscious of the fact that their interests as a racial group in this country are of more importance than world politics, as interpreted by the Red agitators. This dawning realization of our people is meeting with more and more favor, even among our Bolsheviks, who were but pawns in the hands of their leaders. They now realize the importance of safeguarding our racial values in America. Many of them have ceased to follow blindly orders of local Red leaders. One proof of it is the fact that in Chicago and in other cities Russian Bolsheviks have improved their conduct. During lectures and public meetings they now behave like human beings; they listen carefully to the speaker, without displaying anger and beastly instincts toward their opponents, as was their custom in the past, in accordance with the orders of Red leaders.</p>
   <p>Probably, also, they have grown tired of the empty and irresponsible tongue-waggingof these Bolshevik leaders, foreign to them in spirit and in extraction. Many of these people, duped by the Red agitators for a long time, now understand that what people need most is education. They see now that without education nothing can be accomplished, that without education it is impossible to spread even one's own ideas, for no one wants to listen to an uneducated, ignorant man.</p>
   <p>It is true that we are only at the beginning of this turning point in the community life of the Russian group. But it is remarkable just the same. It proves that the Russian people are beginning to understand one another. With understanding, sooner or later will come the moment when the Russian group will be united, and when its good name, now fallen, will rise on high again.</p>
