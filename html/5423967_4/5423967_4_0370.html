   <p>The concert of the Cooperative Russian Restaurant for the benefit of the hungry orphans of Russia had a colossal moral and financial success. All the Russian dramatic, vocal, and musical talent of our city answered the call of the committee for the arrangement of this concert. All the amateurs of the Russian theater for a long time prepared for this concert, while the undertaking itself was energetically advertised among the Russian colony; the paper Free Russia had put its pages at the disposal of the committee. All the Russian organizations had also actively concurred to the success of the enterprise; all amateurs of the Russian theater, well prepared, appeared to perform their program.</p>
   <p>The program of the concert was very rich in interesting numbers, and, thanks to the exemplary order, was started and finished at the proper time. All the numbers of the program were brilliant. The large Schoenhoffen <span class="page-break">\2</span>hall was overcrowded with people. The public was enthusiastic.</p>
   <p>Besides the enjoyment, the public was also in sympathy with the idea of the arrangement of the enterprise. The committee of the concert, having understood the right mood of the public, decided to take up a collection for the benefit of the hungry orphans in Russia, which gave $81.60. Dancing followed the concert, and continued till late at night, while business at the counter with beverages and sandwiches was very lively. The proceeds of this concert were $740.30; thus the concert of the Cooperative Russian Restaurant, for the benefit of the orphans in Russia, was a great moral and financial success. It will remain for long in the memory of the Chicago Russian colony, and the orphans of Russia will be thankful both to the organizers of this evening and to the visitors for their great help. The Cooperative Russian Restaurant, in its turn, expresses deep thanks to all the artists and amateurs, who took part in our concert, and also to all visitors. The Cooperative expresses special thanks to the artists of the Russian opera, Dylov, Godunov, Mamonov and Andreyevsky, for their help in making this concert a success.
