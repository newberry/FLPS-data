   <p>The forthcoming recognition of the Soviet Union by the United States, together with the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries, puts before the Russian-Americans a series of very important and timely questions. The solution of these questions presents a momentous problem, and delays may cause a severe blow to the whole colony.</p>
   <p>The question of recognition in itself is purely theoretical, as far as our colony is concerned. The whole problem of the recognition of the Soviet government by this country has extremely important international ramifications, and the specific weight that could be brought to bear upon the matter by our Russian colony in America, or even by all Russian emigres in the world, is infinitely insignificant and unimportant as compared with the international implications.</p>
   <p>In quite a different light and in a different class stand the questions that will come up as a result of the recognition of the Soviet regime. And to the <span class="page-break">2</span>forefront comes the question of the right of asylum for our immigrants. The right of asylum, however, is not the only question that will arise after the Soviet government is formally recognized by the United States. Questions will come up which have to do with the citizenship rights and privileges as applied to political refugees, as well as questions of civil law pertaining to family relations, insurance, property-ownership, and inheritance. All these questions will require much time and work on the part of the American Government, and, no doubt, legislative acts of Congress. It is important that the Russian colony be prepared for all these questions.</p>
   <p>But the most timely and, at the same time, most important question is that of the right of asylum for our immigrants. There are many people in this country for whom Soviet recognition will represent a direct threat. According to the opinion of those well acquainted with immigrant problems in this country, there are about five thousand persons for whom the recognition of Soviet Russia will be a direct blow, as they will find themselves under the threat of deportation to the Soviet Union. On the other hand this threat <span class="page-break">3</span>may not be regarded as imminent, because in this country the last word belongs to the all-powerful public opinion. Therefore it is necessary to mobilize public opinion. This should be done in advance, so as to prevent future sacrifices and even unnecessary fears.</p>
   <p>It is necessary, therefore, to acquaint the American people with Soviet law, especially as it regards citizenship, immigration, and emigration. It should be pointed out who, according to Soviet law, may be accepted as a full citizen with all privileges, and who can only be regarded as a semi-citizen, with limited civic and political rights and privileges. Furthermore, we should acquaint ourselves with the history of this particular problem and with the way it has been settled in European countries. Thus we shall be able to avoid repetition of the same difficult and very complicated experiences through which our Russian emigres have passed in other countries. All these things should be properly presented to the American public. It is also necessary to enlighten the American as well as the Russian public as to the history and actual practice of these matters in pre-war times. This <span class="page-break">4</span>enlightenment will prove very interesting and very instructive to the American public.</p>
   <p>In this undertaking the Russian-Americans will have natural allies and supporters in other national groups, the members of which will also, in many cases, feel the blow of the new regulations. This applies especially to such national groups as the Ukrainian, the Jewish, the Armenian, the Georgian and other groups, whose place of origin is now within the Soviet borders.</p>
   <p>But the whole problem reaches far beyond the limits of the question of the right of asylum alone. Here and now we have the opportunity of demonstrating to the American public what the Soviet law really is, particularly since the Anglo-Saxon people do not like generalities in the domain of politics, but can be strongly influenced by actualities, facts and experiences. The well-known case of the English engineers who were prosecuted by the Soviet courts in Moscow, and the very recent arrest of an English newspaper correspondent in Nazi Germany have done more to inform and influence British and American public <span class="page-break">5</span>opinion than all the agitation of our colony during the entire period of its existence.</p>
   <p>In order properly to influence American public opinion and obtain desirable results, it is necessary to plan our action according to certain well-thought-out principles, and not just beg for favors and mercy. The foremost objective is to retain the right of refuge, and to maintain the inadmissibility of deportation and extradition. The present-day sense of law and righteousness in the democratic countries cannot be reconciled with the monstrous possibility of giving away people to be subjected to Soviet "justice," for at present there are no regular courts of justice in Russia, even for criminal trials. The law-conscious democracies cannot even be reconciled to the fact that in Soviet Russia a criminal can be sentenced and punished outside and above the regularly constituted courts of justice. In the case of deportation or extradition of a criminal, he would be subject not only to a supplementary sentence, but also to some unknown punishment arbitrarily meted out.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>If the whole problem is properly formulated, and properly presented to the American public, then its force will have a far-reaching effect upon the American mind; and only then can we expect practical results.</p>
   <p>Our activity in this direction can be helped to a large extent by progressive groups of Russian-Americans. The voice of these, heard many times on many matters concerning our life and affairs in America, and supporting non-recognition, will be recognized as authoritative by the American public.</p>
