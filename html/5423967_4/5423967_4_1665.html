   <p>Mr. Ivan F. Erin, by extraction a Don Cossack was born in Stanitza (Cossack Village) Glazunov, province of Don, of a poor Cossack family. In Russia, Mr. Erin received little education except that which he received at home and in the army.</p>
   <p>He was brought up in a small village, and during his youth he worked together with his father as a husbandmen. At the end of his military service, he had decided to leave the ranks of the Cossacks. To him Cossack life was very dreary and lonesome and eventually he was attracted to public activities.</p>
   <p>During the year 1910, Mr. Erin, left the Don Province and settled at Kovno, where his elder brother was established, as one of the prominent civic leaders of the North West Region. During his residence at Knovno, Mr. Frin decided to migrate to the United States in order to improve his financial standing. He arrived in the America in 1913, and at once headed for Chicago, where he <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>now resides. In 1915, he became a member of the Russian "Znanie" Club; the earliest Russian cultural and educational organization of Chicago. Znsnie Club began its cultural-educational activity by organizing: a chorus, a string orchestra, a dramatic circle, evening classes, concerts, shows, lectures and educational excursions. The "Znanie" Club succeeded to draw in its ranks all the cultural Russian elements and to organize the Russian People's University of Chicago. The latter during a period of over two years had more than two hundred students in its classes. The classes of the University were very well equipped, where the Russian youth acquired general knowledge. They studied the Russian language, the automobile business, electricity, geography, physics, chemistry, mathematics, agriculture and other subjects. In the "Znanie" Club, Mr. Erin, for the greater part of the time occupied the office of chariman, while in the "Russian Peoples' University" he held responsible postions on the Board of Directors, Board of Trustces and almost in all the committees. When the Russian Peoples' University was liquidated for reasons of political <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>friction, Mr. Ivan Erin together with the students moved to the premises of the Russian Technical Society. He holds as heretofore the same responsible positions and continues in his cultural-educational activities. He was never interested in politics and has always opposed its presence in the schools, but in this he did not always succeed.</p>
   <p>In 1922, while he was with the Technical Society, together with other students, he organized a Russian Cooperative Restaurant, which appeared to be the first economical venture of the Russian organizations in Chicago. This restaurant operates successfully up to the present time. In 1928, Mr. Ivan Erin, together with his close friends organized a new "Znanie" Society (50th branch of "R O O V A", Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society of America) where he worked as president of the organization. In the year 1929 Mr. I. Erin, joined the initial organization group of the Russian-American Club in Chicago, and was elected to the office of one of the Vice-Presidents of the Club, in which he takes active part, in the cultural and educational work.</p>

   <p>We have mentioned some of the work done by these organizations, where Mr. I. Erin has labored hard for the welfare and education of the Russian toilers. But this is not all. Mr. Ivan Erin repeatedly tackled more serious problems. For instance, the organization of the Russian Peoples' Home and similar projects. He had to spend not a few sleepless nights in working out plans, and in writing appeals and projects; which went unheeded in our colony. Besides this, he was active in our colonial affairs, taking part in the general colonial conventions at New York; and the conventions of the Russian Technical Society. He had the honor of representing the Chicago Russian colony at the reception of the Extraordinary Mission of the First Russian Revolutionary Government (Provisional Government). Together with Professor Borodin he organized a group of instructors to study the packing and cold storage business and gained considerable knowledge in this industry. After the completion of the courses Mr. I. Erin, wrote several articles of valuable information in regard to the Chicago Stock Yards and the labour conditions there.</p>

   <p>One cannot but praise the work of Mr. Erin; a tireless civic leader in the field of charitable assistance to the Russian people. If one were to enumerate all the organizations, conferences and committees in which he participated, in which he was the central figure, it would make another long list.</p>
   <p>When the war swept Russia like a tornado, and threw scores of thousands of inhabitants into exile creating whole armies of refugees, who found themselves without shelter and food, Mr. Erin sounded the alarm and organized committees and conferences to help these refugees. He also organized committees for the assistance of the Russian prisoners in Germany, the starving people in Russia, and for the Russian orphans, etc. It seems, there was not a single calamity that had afflicted the Russian people, to which Mr. Erin, did not respond by participating actively in the relief of these sufferers. For these reasons we speak of him as the most "tireless worker in the field of public activity."</p>
   <p>Mr. Erin, despite his limited education, is a fair orator and writer. In his speeches and articles one feels his sincerity. Constantly he sounds the call <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>to union and education. He is a man truly and whole-heartedly attached to his public work.</p>
