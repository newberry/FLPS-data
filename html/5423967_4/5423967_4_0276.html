When we came to Chicago we found there a very active non-partisan organization of Russian Socialists and Socialist sympathizers of all shades of political opinion, working under the name of Relief Society for Political Prisoners and Exiles in Russia. It collected large amounts of money that went to the victims of tsarist oppression in Siberia, penitentiaries, and other places of exile and imprisonment. The leading spirit of this organization was M. Stolar, at present city editor of Moscow News. Others active included F.
