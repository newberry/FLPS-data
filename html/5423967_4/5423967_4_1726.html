   <p>In Moscow, G. Zinoviev died suddenly at the age of forty nine. Whether he died from natural causes, or passed away to another universe with the affectionate co-operation of Stalin's agents, the GPU, is not of any particular importance. The large spider gobbled up a small one, and thus ended a drama of life.</p>
   <p>Zinoviev passed into non-existence, castoff, outraged, dishonored, dethroned, just as did L. Trotsky and other oppositionists.</p>
   <p>On the crest of the October Revolution he nearly reached the top of the soviet government Olympus.</p>
   <p>Holding the office of president of the Communist International, Zinoviev <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>eagerly spread the flame of the World Revolution, wasting enormous sums of the people's money.</p>
   <p>But from his endeavors to spread the universal fire, with the exception of piteous sparks and small disturbances, nothing resulted. The Soviet Treasury, however, dwindled.</p>
   <p>At the Kremlin, they finally realized, that Zinoviev was a poor "spiritualist" and unable to produce the spirits of the Revolution.</p>
   <p>The rapid descent of the giddy career of the omnipotent "Leader of the World Revolution" began.</p>
   <p>They removed him from his office as president of the Comintern; demoted him from his position as Governor General of Leningrad. Dark days descended upon Zinoviev.</p>

   <p>Zinoviev had influence at home and abroad; he was known by the proletariat throughout the world; Zinoviev had great ambitions; he even aspired to inherit Lenin's throne, which brought him into conflict with another aspirant, L. Trotsky, and for this reason he sided with him in the battle against Stalin.</p>
   <p>The struggle was led chiefly over every possible thesis and antithesis at the assembly of the Communist Olympus. Zinoviev's thesis, just as his former orders to establish revolutions in various countries at certain set times, had no success. Stalin placed them under cover. Nothing resulted from the thesis opposition.</p>
   <p>The next step of Zinoviev was to go over to illegal opposition which consisted of groups of these or other leaders who were distrusted. Zinoviev jumped from one group to another. He united with Trotsky, Kamenev, Burharin, Rakovsky, Radek, secretly hoping for a palace revolt, and being detected in this, cowardly denied relations with Trotsky, Kamenev and others of the same opinion in order to escape severe punishment.</p>

   <p>After tasting the luxuries of the life of a dignitary statesman, Zinoviev shuddered at the thought of a jail, or exile to "distant lands." He frequently confessed and at the same time, cursed himself. This self punishment by the former "leader of the proletariat of the world," amused Stalin who encouraged Zinoviev to do this by inflicting light penalties.</p>
   <p>The chameleon, Zinoviev, was on the tip of the tongue of the whole-world. He confessed his sins, and swore to be faithful to Stalin until death, and at the same time, went over to the opposition. L. Trotsky described him as a "whipped dog". Zinoviev passed his time in an insignificant statistics' office, working at a position not suited to the former leader and inspirer of the world-wide fire. He recently was found guilty in the so-called Rutin Case, a plot by the Comsomol Party against Stalin. Zinoviev with Kamenev and other oppositionists again were expelled from the Communist party. Once more Zinoviev found himself outside of the noble communist ranks in the position of a simple being.</p>

   <p>Death relieved Zinoviev of the necessity of another confession. His world career is over, no more does another insane man exist, who had dreamt of turning the world upside down, and who caused great harm, suffering and sickness to the Russian people.</p>
