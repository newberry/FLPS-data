   <p>On February 2, on the occasion of the acquisition by the Orthodox parish in Hammond of St. Nicholas' Church the members of the parish arranged a celebration. Services were conducted in the newly purchased church by the Right Reverend Bishop Leonty of Chicago and Minneapolis in the presence of clergy from other Russian churches in near-by cities. The celebration was crowned with a big banquet. The large church was filled to capacity by those who came to share the joy of the Russian people in Hammond.</p>
   <p>The church services were made more beautiful by the singing of the local choir under the direction of Mr. Ruzemka. The choir was originally organized and trained by the Reverend Ivan Zheltonoga [of Chicago]. Part of the choir [at the special service]had been brought from Indiana Harbor, and it sang beautifully. An address appropriate for the occasion was delivered by the Reverend M. Yugas, who came to the celebration with the entire membership of his church council. A number of the members of his parish were also brought by the Reverend Mr. Nedzelnitsky, who came all the way from Minneapolis. The sermon was delivered by our esteemed Bishop Leonty of Chicago and Minneapolis.</p>
   <p>After the services Bishop Leonty, in company with the other clergy, went to the parish house for rest and friendly talk with the members of the parish. After a while the arrangements committee with Attorney A. S. Ivans at its head invited all the guests to the banquet table. The banquet was begun with the Lord's Prayer, which was sung by all present in Ugro-Russian.</p>
   <p>The dear women members of the parish had excelled themselves in preparing a series of very savory dishes. The tables actually were groaning under the weight of food and drink. The guests paid due attention to each dish. Our American guests, the Mayor of Hammond and other city officials, marvelled at the culinary skill of our Russian housewives in Hammond. When the banquet was half finished, speechmaking began. The toastmaster, Attorney A. S. Ivans, had skillfully arranged his program. The first toast was proposed by our beloved guest, Bishop Leonty. Then telegrams were read from Mayor E. Kelly of Chicago and from the daughter of the Reverend I. Zheltonoga, who could not attend the celebration, since he has been away from the State of Illinois for some time. A brief speech was made by the Reverend Mr. Kedrovsky, who handed ten dollars to the church committee, a donation from generous parishioners of the Russian church in Gary. Later on speeches were made by I. Ivans, the Mayor of Hammond, and others. After the speechmaking a collection was taken for the benefit of the church.</p>
   <p>Toward evening the Right Reverend Bishop Leonty left for Chicago, but the other guests remained. The joy of the Hammond people was very much in evidence when the banquet hall was entered by a delegation from St. George's parish, of Wood Street, Chicago. The men from Wood Street brought greetings and donations to the parish in Hammond. I cannot refrain from expressing my own personal gratitude and mentioning the enthusiasm which greeted the words spoken by Mr. V. Olesiuk, the old and active member and organizer of the Chicago parish.</p>
   <p>All the speakers, workers, donors, and organizers of the celebration were rewarded with applause. The banquet lasted long after midnight. There was no desire on anybody's part to leave. The spirit of a great and solemn holiday prevailed among the guests.</p>
   <p>I personally and the parish in Hammond express our sincere thanks to our friends for their participation in the celebration and for the help which they rendered to us, to all Russian newspapers and their editors for the free advertising space given to us, and to all our singers and fellow churchmen. But our main thanks go to our dearest friend, Bishop Leonty, for he was the person who made our celebration so successful in every way.</p>
