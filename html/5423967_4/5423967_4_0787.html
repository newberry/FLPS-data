   <p>A few months ago the board of directors of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society succeeded in effecting a big deal. As a result of persistent efforts by the directors, the St. Vladimir Fraternity joined the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society as Branch No. 22.</p>
   <p>We regard this event as a great accomplishment and a long step forward in our work, because this may be the beginning of a new era for our Russian organizations, when smaller fraternities and groups begin to see the advantage of membership in the larger Russian organizations. We received many greetings and congratulations from our members and from nonmembers upon this occasion. Almost all were happy over this union. There was a small group who were not satisfied, because they thrive on disunion and stir up quarrels among our members here in Chicago. Also displeased was that portion of the St. Vladimir Fraternity which had decided to join an out-of-town Russian organization, located far away from Chicago.</p>

   <p>The new Branch No. 22 of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society will serve as a seed for the growth of sentiment for the future complete unification of all Russian fraternities, clubs and smaller societies into one strong organization. But we must give the new branch time to become stronger and more independent financially. Branch No. 22 may expect aid and assistance, above all, from the old members of the Independent Society. The new branch still needs substantial support. It cannot live on praises and expressions of welcome alone.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow Branch No. 22, our new group, is holding its first social reception and entertainment in the Russian-American Club, located at 1902 West Division Street. All members of the R. I. M. A. S., especially those of Branches No. 4 and No. 30, should be present at this party. By their presence they will contribute to the support so indispensable to this, the youngest branch of our organization. When the new members see us all there they will be very much pleased, and more determined to work hard for the good of our common national organization, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. They are expecting us at their reception. Shall we disappoint them, or shall we be there to give assistance to our younger <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>brothers? We shall see tomorrow.....</p>
   <p>It is desirable that not only the members of the R. I. M. A. S. be present at this meeting, but also all those Russians who heartily approve of the St. Vladimir Fraternity's joining the stronger Russian organization. Let us all be there, and let us spend an evening together in a friendly chat, and in consolidating our good beginning in the work of uniting the scattered divisions of our organization.</p>
   <p>Let us by facts convince our enemies in all camps, including the Pittsburgh camp and our local Bolshevik camp, that we have achieved unity, co-operation and brotherly understanding, so that they may become ashamed of their vile work intended to bring ruin and destruction to our national life in America.</p>
