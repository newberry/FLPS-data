   <p>Comrades! The Chicago conference of the revolutionary organizations calls upon all the workers to boycott the undertaking which will be given on Saturday, December 18, by the so-called 'Medical Society for the Aid of Soviet Russia,' and also to refuse the above society, as at present organized, any moral or material support. The causes that originated this boycott are the following:</p>
   <p>On the request of the conference of the Chicago Russian revolutionary organizations to examine the books and to control the existing society in the future, the latter categorically refused to grant this request, declaring that it has nothing to do with the workers' organizations and that it is responsible only to the New York main office. This refusal proves only once more that the rumors concerning individuals who are after profits are well grounded. Many different businessmen <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>making contributions for the relief of Soviet Russia wearied and tired of the blockade. All the money is received in the name of one person, Mr. Drake. If we take into consideration that many contributions, if not most of them, are received from individuals without signature, then it will be clear that under such circumstances there is no guaranty that the money will go for medical needs in Soviet Russia. Therefore, the demand of the Chicago conference to control the sums received and paid out is quite natural. Our problem is not to destroy medical aid to Soviet Russia, but to make it impossible for irresponsible individuals to profit by this money. Therefore, by your boycott force the unworthy to keep their hands off the society's, and especially the workers' pockets.</p>
