   <p>Due to the extremely critical situation existing among the Russian orphans abroad--most of them are the children of Russian emigrants who fled from the Bolshevik regime--a call has been sent to all countries for immediate help to these victims. This call for help also reached Chicago.</p>
   <p>In June of 1933, in Chicago, a group was formed of persons interested in the cause, and it was decided, following the example of other cities, to organize a society for the purpose of aiding the children and orphans of Russian emigrants. The society actually was founded in October of 1933. On November 18, 1933, the society held its first entertainment for the benefit of the orphans, and the results, both materially and morally, were good. The net proceeds from the evening amounted to $45.20. In December of 1933, $25 of this sum was sent to the children's orphanage at Gapovo, Jugoslavia through the Amalgamated Trust and Savings Bank under receipt #55520.</p>
   
   <p>In 1934 the society gradually began to develop its activity. New members began to join the organization and the work began gradually to take form. It is necessary to notice in this connection that besides the members, a lively interest in the work of the society was taken by the Russian artists living in Chicago. They always willingly and without remuneration, assisted in arranging and presenting the musical parts of the programs. The clerical staffs of the Russian churches and the organizations affiliated with them, played an active part in the affairs of the society. Bishop Leonty, of the Chicago diocese, at the society's request, accepted the honorary chairmanship. With his permission and on his recommendation, collections were made in the churches under his jurisdiction. His Grace, Bishop Leonty, has generally taken a very active part in the affairs of the society, which began to receive donations, membership fees, etc.</p>
   <p>On May 20, 1934, a second concert was arranged which was also well attended. The net proceeds for the benefit of the orphans amounted to $64.50. On October 21, the "Day of the Russian Child" was celebrated. During the day, $111.01 was collected.</p>
   <p>Besides the benefit evenings, the society collected donations on subscription lists, in the churches, etc. During the year 1934 the society raised $353.55, of which $96.47 went for expenses. From the net balance, $25 was sent to the tuberculosis preventorium in France, through the Amalgamated Trust and Savings Bank. This institution takes care only of tubercular Russian orphans. To the children's orpahnage in Dubno, Poland, $25 was forwarded through the same bank; in September of 1934, $50 was sent to the same institution. Altogether during the year 1934 the society sent $175 to various children's institutions in France, and the balance, left on deposit with the society on January 1, 1935, amounted to $82.08. From this amount, $15 was sent to Poland and $15 to France, during this current year. It was decided to send $25 to the orphanage in Vilno, Poland, where forty Russian orphans are cared for, and $10 to the Aphon Monastery, in Greece.</p>
   <p>The question may arise as to why so much money was sent to institutions in Poland. The answer is that Poland harbors the largest number of Russian orphans. They flee there across the border after their parents are either shot or exiled to concentration camps on Solovki [island prison camp in the Black Sea], or other places, and the children are left homeless and uncared-for. Besides, the districts where these institutions in Poland are located, suffered floods, epidemics of typhoid, and other afflictions. The money sent there was forwarded in haste to save the lives of more than four hundred children, who were near death from the cholera epidemic. From all the institutions, acknowledgments were received with thanks for the money sent by the society. We have also received several new appeals for help.</p>
   <p>At present the society, besides collecting money, is engaged in collecting discarded clothing, which will be shipped to the orphans. There is a desperate need of clothes and shoes. The society carries on its work honestly and [its policies are] above reproach. No one receives any remuneration for his work. The expenses are incurred only when they are absolutely necessary. All the financial accounting is done very accurately under the constant supervision of a special committee. All expenses are accounted for by receipts. All business meetings are open to the public.</p>
   
   <p>The society appeals to all tender-hearted Russians to join its ranks and to help alleviate the suffering of the unfortunate innocent victims, the Russian orphans.</p>
   <p>All inquiries should be addressed to Madam Maksimov 1708 West Chicago Avenue. She will forward all information.</p>
