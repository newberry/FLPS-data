   <p>I am captivated by the articles of the tourist who signs himself "Minsky Muzhik". I feel the same as he, because I lived through all he describes before my flight from Russia.</p>
   <p>In my opinion it would be a very desirable thing if his articles were published in English and all other languages as well as in Russian. Russians are either familiar with them or else would not believe the author anyway. As poor as I am, I am willing to send my dollar immediately for this worth-while purpose. We must open foreigners' eyes to all the misdeeds being perpetrated by the strong-arm men from the Kremlin.</p>
