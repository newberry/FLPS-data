   <p>The first page of this pamphlet is devoted to a message from Pres. Wilson and Frank R. Wilson, Director of Publicity, War Loan Organization, Treasury Department.</p>
   <p>It also contains an appeal to the Russians. The war must be won; if Germany wins then might will prevail over right. If Germany wins all the rights to which Russians in this country are accustomed will be cancelled. If Germany is defeated people in Europe will get a chance to live a free life. Money is needed to defeat the Kaiser. If the Russians do not buy they are not 100 per cent Americans. Then the terms of the Loan are set forth in considerable detail.</p>
