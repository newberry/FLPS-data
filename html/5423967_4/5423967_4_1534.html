   <p>On January 3, 1932, Baliev's Revue, "The Bat," will be presented at the Selwyn Theatre.</p>
   <p>When "The Bat" was shown for the first time in Europe and America, it was highly acclaimed by theatrical, musical and art circles.</p>
   <p>The modern staging of this revue imppressed upon one the richness of the scenery, the splendid acting, and the performance of various musical numbers, so that it was hardly possible to concentrate one's attention on some particular feature of the program.</p>
   <p>The whole presentation was inspiring and breath-taking: the aesthetic pleasure one derives from "The Bat" is such, that one wishes, it may never end. When the curtain dropped after the last number, the audience was reluctant to leave the theatre.</p>

   <p>Nikita Baliev, the director of the company, and its distinguished "master of ceremonies,"had aroused the admiration of the audience by his witty humoristic remarks in connection with the world's current, national and political events.</p>
   <p>We hope that the present star performances of Baliev's "Bat" will be another triumph of vocal and dramatic art, especially of Russian art.</p>
