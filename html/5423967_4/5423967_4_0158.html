   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, with offices at 917 N. Wood St., was re-organized in 1930. It discarded its previous name of 'Russian National Orthodox Society' (which is extinct) for that of 'Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.' This organization, in the words of Mr. Kozak, is of a fraternal character, with sick and death benefits for its members. It has a membership of about 1,700 in Illinois, and it has also branches in the states of Indiana, Michigan, and Marylad. The headquarters are in Chicago. The Russians realize the importance of this organization very well, and are joining its ranks at every opportunity. This order has paid out during its existence $200,000 in death benefits and approximately $125,000 in sick benefits. The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is non-partisan, and members are accepted regardless of their political affiliations. Death benefits range from $250 to $2,000, depending upon the amount each member pays in to the order. The society's membership <span class="page-break">2</span>consists of 95 per cent Russians and 5 per cent Poles. This organization is interested, both morally and financially, in the affairs of the Russian Publishing Company, publishers of the Russian daily newspaper, Rassviet.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nicholas Kozak, who is the secretary of this organization, came to the United States in 1903, and has been a resident of Chicago, with his family, since his arrival. The president of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is Mr. George Wallace.</p>
