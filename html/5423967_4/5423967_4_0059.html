   <p>As it is very often asked by new members of the Russian National Orthodox Society, and by the people in the colony, when and in what circumstances our society was organized, I, as an old member of the Russian National Orthodox Society, want to share my memories with the readers, (to tell) all that actually happened, and answer some of the questions.</p>
   <p>In 1912, - exactly on Easter, - there was a great congregation of people at the Church of the Holy Trinity on Leavitt Street, which contributed a large collection amounting to about $600. The church committee counted the money and turned it over to the priest Vladimir Alexandrov, who on the second day of Easter announced from the pulpit that the collection <span class="page-break">\2</span>during the Mass amounted to $500, not $600. After the services the church committee demanded the priest to hand over the book-keeping records for revision. The priest not only refused that, but threw at the parishioners some very insulting words. Besides that, he, as the president of the St. Nikolaevsky Brotherhood, announced the expulsion from the brotherhood of all the parishioners who distrusted him; also his desire to have new elections of all the executive members of the brotherhood and the parish. This offended many members. Members of the St. Nikolaevsky and Holy Trinity Brotherhoods were very much disgusted about it, and they began making plans as to how to protect their interests.</p>
   <p>Finally the brothers came to the following conclusion: in order to become independent and not to permit the priest to act as chairman, and of his own free will to expel members from the brotherhoods, they have to unite forming together a (new) brotherhood.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>As they said so they did. But here all was not pleasant. As soon as the members of both brotherhoods had gathered at the school room of the church of the Holy Trinity and opened their meeting with a prayer, the furious priest broke into the hall and began chasing out the executive members of the presidium, using very harsh words and demanding that they leave. The members did not move. The priest then called the police, and with their aid, forced them to vacate the school.</p>
   <p>A part of the parishioners, realizing their right, did not go home, but moved their meeting into the Columbia Hall, then located on Division Street. Lectures by amateur speakers had begun, and all were in favor of organizing both brotherhoods into one under the name of St. George the Conqueror. The majority of members expressed their desire to separate from the present society and to organize a new one, which consequently <span class="page-break">\4</span>was named the Russian National Orthodox Society. It is hardly possible not to mention the energy of our committeemen, who called the rebellious members to order and peace. The first to express his views on the situation was Mr. Michael Semenowich Pasiuk, who at that time was the president of Holy Trinity Brotherhood.</p>
   <p>He maintained that the parishioners expelled from the parish and societies should be organized. "We have no place there where we were expelled. We should, from now on, work independently of those who remained on Leavitt Street. We can satisfy our religious needs without them. Perhaps they will not give us another priest, but we will find an avenue of escape from this difficult situation." Later other members of the committee expressed similar views. They were Michael Omelianchik, bank cashier, the secretary, and other members of the Holy Trinity and the St. Nicholas brotherhoods; in their ranks were also brothers who became our leaders, John Putilowsky and Joakim Tzekalo.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>John Putilowsky, who died in 1927 in Chicago, spoke about uniting into one independent organization. Here are approximately his words: "We left Leavitt Street, or to be more exact, they chased us out of there, but this is not all. They, with their mean schemes, will dog out steps. But we should not worry, as our future is ahead of us. We should conduct ourselves as it is befitting orderly people, lead a sober type of life, strive towards education and light. Our enemies are not asleep; they will attempt to do away with us by denouncing us to the authorities, and will disrupt our work. But we are not going back to Leavitt Street. We are 300 strong, and we have nothing to fear. The American law will protect us." Long live the name of John Putilowsky, he was an energetic peasant; there should be more of this type. Joakim. Tzekalo has helped our work very much. (At present he resides in one of the Eastern states.) He said, "Where you are treated humanely and are not cheated, there you should go, but where you are being thrown out, let your feet not step <span class="page-break">\6</span>there again. We have been thrown out, and I insist that no matter how we may be coaxed, we shall not return. We have been saving cent by cent, and what answer did we get when we asked to go over the financial accounts? We were insulted. We left, and now we will find a building; we will buy it, and will pray and learn where we will not be interrupted." At this meeting executives were re-elected for the next term.</p>
   <p>The priest Alexandrov, having learned that our attempt to get organized was successful, invited us to have a meeting at the church on the pretense that we are Christians. We trusted him, but when the time for opening the meeting arrived, the priest called the police. Opening the meeting at the church, the priest presumed that no one would dare to raise his voice out of respect for the church, but when he began appointing to the church committee people who would serve him, the people rebelled, and that started a disturbance in the church. The police began to fulfill their duties. Many of the parishioners received blows with a crucifix; <span class="page-break">\7</span>sixteen people were arrested by order of the priest.</p>
   <p>Thus ended our reconciliation. Dissatisfaction grew. In view of the arrests many had suffered materially. Soon after our brotherhood petitioned the archbishop, Alexander Nemolowsky, in New York, to send us a new priest. The archbishop suggested that we repent. On the second petition the archbishop threatened us with spiritual repressions. But the more intolerable the clergy became, the more we organized and strengthened. We bought a building for a church, and Joakim Tzekalo was elected president of the parish. He obtained a priest for the church. The first priest was Timofey Peshkov, a very conscientious and energetic person. Through him on Wood Street,the present location of all main organizations of the Russian National Orthodox Society, life has begun. Lectures began and we opened our own school. New brotherhoods came into being and branches of our mutual aid society, which aids its members in case of sickness; the Russian National Orthodox Society also assists <span class="page-break">\8</span>widows and orphans. All property is in the hands of members of the Russian National Orthodox Society, and the priest is appointed by the society. In this we differ from the parish on Leavitt Street, where the property belongs to the clergy and the people are compelled to agree to all that the clergy prescribes for them. In our case the people can dispose of the property as they find fit.</p>
   <p>In the sixteen years we lived through some very difficult times - the time of the Russian revolution, but at present our national organization is developing and being strengthened. The Russian National Orthodox Society contains more than ten branches. Many of the branches are growing very rapidly. Good work is done by the first branch, that of St. George the Conqueror, the president of which is Dimitri Michalchik; cashier, Rodion Poleshchuk; secretary, Andrei Gapanovich. Incidentally, it is <span class="page-break">\9</span>well to mention that the first committee of this section was formed sixteen years ago with Michael Paciuk as president, Michael Omelianchik as cashier, and Gregory Baka as secretary.</p>
   <p>However, about the present activities I am not writing; this is taking place before the eyes of contemporaries.</p>
