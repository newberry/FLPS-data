   <p>This editorial discusses the relations that have been established between the great majority of the Russian immigrants and the Russian Communists. What the author of this editorial says concerns the Russian groups existing in all large cities where there are many Russian immigrants; consequently, it holds good also for Chicago. The editorial contrasts the attitude of the Russian-American Communists towards the 1st convention of Russian organizations in Philadelphia, in 1926, with their attitude towards a similar convention in New York, in June, 1927. In the first case the Russian Bolsheviki tried to send a great many delegates to the convention in order either to capture it or to disrupt it if they could not make it subservient to their political aims. They experienced a crushing defeat, could not achieve either result, and had to acknowledge themselves beaten. This affected very strongly <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their attitude towards the convention called in July, 1927, in New York. This time the Communists did not send any official representatives to the convention, though there were a few delegates who seemed to be in sympathy with Communism; but these kept very quiet, while at the convention in Philadelphia the Communists, agitated, shouted , violently attacked their opponents in their speeches, interrupted those who did not agree with them, and proved in general to be quite intractable. But such a disgraceful behavior did not help them, and now they have evidently understood that the great majority of the Russians regard them as undesirable intruders who, for the sake of their party politics, are ready to disrupt an undertaking which is obviously absolutely necessary in order that the Russians workers in the United States would improve their economical and social status.</p>
   <p>The chasm, dividing the Communists from all the other Russian immigrants <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>who form the great majority of all Russian colonies in the United States - this chasm is growing wider and wider. All Russians see now that the Communists have at heart only the interests of the ruling bureaucracy created by them, and not the real interests of the Russian people. And this is so not only in Soviet Russia, but also in the United States, where the Communists want only to boss all the Russian organizations. As an illustration of this loss of popularity by the Bolsheviki among the Russians, the editorial points out the fact that the Federation of Russian Schools, that had been created by the Communists in Chicago, had entirely lost its popularity and was on the verge of disintegration. The bureaucratic and spying propensities of the Communists have entirely alienated them from the rest of the Russians.</p>
