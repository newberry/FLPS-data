   <p>Only recently the Bolsheviks considered themselves one-hundred-per cent internationalists and called all Russian people, from whose tongues occasionally slipped the words "nationalism," or "patriotism," as counter-revolutionaries.</p>
   <p>By now the situation in Russia has radically changed. If formerly it was dangerous to preach patriotism, now it's even more dangerous to appear in the role of an anti-patriot. This abrupt about-face, of course, is explained by the fact that the Bolsheviks themselves have turned from anti-patriotism to rabid patriotism. They have become such great patriots that the bourgeois type of patriotism is regarded by them as something that is obsolete and inferior in quality. Bourgeois patriots, according to their declarations, are not even fit to shine the shoes of the great patriots of the Bolshevik variety. For that reason the Bolsheviks are ready and willing to teach the bourgeois world "genuine" patriotism.</p>
   <p>The Moscow Newspaper Pravda, in its issue of March 19, writes the following of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Soviet patriotism:</p>
   <p>"Soviet patriotism is the fiery feeling of unstinted love, absolute devotion to our country of socialism. It springs from the sense of deep responsibility for the country's fate and its state of defense. It has its origin in the hearts of the whole Russian people. Ideas of Soviet patriotism nourish and sustain heroes and millions of brave fighters, who are always ready with mighty blows to fall on any enemy and wipe him off the face of the earth. With mother's milk Soviet patriotism is imbibed by the child. Our youth is brought up and taught to love our country; and it is our duty to bring up new generations of Soviet patriots for whom the welfare of the country will stand above all, even above personal life.</p>
   <p>"All riches and acquisitions of science, as well as all possibilities of technique, may be used for a clear and absorbing presentation of Soviet patriotism.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>With the greatest care, skill and knowledge, we nurse as a tender plant this great, unconquerable, fiery spirit of Soviet patriotism. How much strength, youth, heroism, touching beauty, and movement there is in it. Soviet patriotism is burning in our country with a great flame."</p>
   <p>Such a hymn to patriotism has hardly ever been written by a bourgeois. This is quite understandable. The same newspaper states that bourgeois patriotism is only a caricature of the real (Communist) patriotism, that the peoples of bourgeois countries never were and never can be truly patriotic.</p>
   <p>"Patriotism of the bourgeoisie," writes Pravda, "is a patriotism of capital, rents and high interest rates. The bourgeoisie has natural feeling of attachment to the native country but has converted it into a currency, and let it out on the stock exchanges in order to intensify exploitation, and to confuse the people groping in darkness. The bourgeoisie offer for sale everything that yields <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>profit, including their patriotism and the interests of their respective countries."</p>
   <p>Such a great upset occurred in the brains of the Bolshevik heads! Not two years have passed since the same men were imprisoning Russian patriots or punishing them with death, and now in the domain of patriotism they are surpassing even the bourgeoisie, while giving them instructions on the true spirit of patriotism.</p>
   <p>Why, then, has such a metamorphosis taken place in the Bolshevik heads?</p>
   <p>Why, all of a sudden, have they become preachers and advocates of patriotism making pale even the brightest form of bourgeois patriotism? Why do they worship only patriotism and not nationalism spite the fact that these terms are closely interrelated?</p>
   <p>We shall answer the last question first. The Bolsheviks cannot speak of nationalism <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>in the terms they employ with reference to patriotism for two fundamental reasons: first, because the Soviet Union is composed of several national, formally independent republics and does not consist of homogenous people; for this reason they would have to speak of several nationalisms in order not to offend any of the national groups, but since many nationalisms cannot be consistently preached at one and the same time, the Bolsheviks preach none. Then how can the Bolsheviks preach any nationalism when the Communist International, actually governing Russia, is composed of different criminal international scum. Of course, it is understood that these international hoodlums cannot preach any kind of nationalism, be it Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian or any other.</p>
   <p>Quite different is the case with patriotism. The Bolsheviks may preach patriotism without violating any of the precepts of their great prophet, Karl Marx. Marx, as is well known, belonged to the people, who, like gypsies, have no country. Therefore, Marx said that the mother country is that country wherein man can live the best. We shall not find fault with such statements. If men <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>have no country they have a perfect right to consider the country in which they can live best their own.</p>
   <p>International Bolshevik flotsam began to profess "fiery love" toward Russia for the same reason. As long as the Bolsheviks felt that their tenure on the country was only temporary they could not be patriots. They had to be very careful. Suppose that in the course of two or three years after establishing the Bolshevik rule the dictators would become patriots and then would fall. Then it would be quite improper to spit on the country which only yesterday they had "loved so ardently."</p>
   <p>Seventeen long years have passed since the Bolshevik revolution. The international Bolshevik octopus by this time has sunk its tentacles so deeply into the flesh of the Russian people that it considers its regime to be firmly stabilized and permanent. And the important fact is that this scum of the earth fares quite well in Russia; it holds the power and suffers no need. Many of the Bolshevik <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>leaders have risen from total obscurity to places of prominence; and, if this is the case, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the Bolsheviks proclaim Russia as their own mother country and turn into superpatriots.</p>
