   <p>In both Houses of Congress a bill has been introduced which proposes to deport all undesirable aliens, to register all persons not citizens, and to establish a system of strictly selective immigration. In the Senate the bill was introduced by Senator Reynolds, Democratic Senator from North Carolina and in the lower House by Congressman Starnes, Democrat, of Alabama.</p>
   <p>The chief aim of the bill is to secure more work for American citizens, to expel from the country foreigners who violate the laws, and to free Federal,State, and private agencies of the expense of supporting foreigners in need of assistance. Such were the purposes of the bill as they were explained by Senator Reynolds himself.</p>
   <p>According to the provisions of the bill all foreigners are to be registered in post offices. On and after July 1, 1936, all foreigners found <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>guilty of committing crimes or of carrying concealed weapons are to be deported; to those who desire to enter the United States a system of intelligence tests is to be applied; and the existing quotas are to be reduced to one tenth of their present size.</p>
   <p>"On the basis of the most reliable information," declared Senator Reynolds," it is known that one out of every five or six inhabitants of the country partly or wholly depends on the assistance of the Government of the United States, and despite the fact that such conditions have existed for several years, we still tolerate millions of foreigners in our country."</p>
   <p>Reynolds also said that thousands of foreigners receive aid from Federal, State, and private charity organizations, and that thousands of others perform work while American citizens remain unemployed.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the Senate Committee on Immigration, Senator Coolidge, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Democrat from Massachusetts, has already held several conferences concerned with the problem of immigration restrictions. He says that in the near future he will call his committee to work out "an all-embracing bill". He also said that he has received strong support in his stand on the immigration question. If we are to believe his words, he was literally swamped with letters and telegrams demanding that limits be set on immigration, and that undesirable aliens should be deported.</p>
   <p>"I stand for registration of the foreigners in the country," declared Coolidge. "So far we have only been guessing how many foreigners there are, and what they are doing. They must be registered. We must know all about them. They enjoy all the privileges of our citizenship without assuming any of its responsibility.</p>
   <p>"As long as work cannot be found for the millions of people who at present are idle and subsist on the help supplied by the Government, it would be unwise to admit new workers to compete with the unemployed."</p>

   <p>Farther on Coolidge declared: "In America there are many immigrants who have lived here for years and have not taken any steps toward becoming citizens of this country. At the peak of the immigration [wave] they came to this country in large numbers and formed their own settlements in the large industrial and commercial centers. It is obvious that when all these foreigners were employed, there was no inducement for them to prepare for citizenship, despite the fact that opportunities for it were offered through our school system."</p>
   <p>In the last month, according to Coolidge, a tendency to acquire citizenship rights has been observed among foreigners who hope through such rights to receive old-age pensions, unemployment benefits, and other advantages afforded by social legislation. He also declared that the Townsend plan enjoys great popularity among foreigners. According to Mr. Coolidge many foreigners are supported by the taxpayers of the country merely because employers in giving work give the preference to citizens.</p>
   <p>In Congress there are influential groups which intend to adopt severer <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>measures for the purpose of ridding the country of foreign communists. Several bills already have been introduced intended to facilitate the deportation of persons engaged in activities or preaching directed toward the violent overthrow of the United States Government.</p>
