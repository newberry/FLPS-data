   <p>Mr. President:</p>
   <p>On June 20 of this year I sent you a telegram asking you not to recognize the Soviet government. At that time the Russian immigrants all over the United States--hundreds of thousands of them--were sending protests, in which they were fervently appealing to you not to recognize the Moscow cutthroats, and to save the Russian people from starvation and from death.</p>
   <p>On July 11 of this year I received a reply to my letter from the State Department, office of the affairs of Eastern Europe, to the effect that the proposed recognition of the Soviet government was still an open question. Now again this same question is causing much anxiety.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In Europe, the League of Nations is discussing the famine in Russia which caused the death of millions of people. The chairman of the League of Nations' council, Mr. Movin Kell, has in his hands many documents proving the lamentable condition of the unfortunate Russian people, suffering agonies unparalleled in the history of mankind. He can confirm my statements.</p>
   <p>The ninety million Russian peasants and workers who are still alive have been brought to cannibalism by the Soviet government. Contagious diseases, such as plague, scurvy, typhoid and leprosy, in addition to famine, are decimating the population, young and old, and completely devastating large areas in Russia. You are witnessing now the slow death of a great and once rich and cultured nation, a faithful ally through centuries, and a worthy confederate of the working people in America. The International adventurers who grabbed power in 1917 and occupied the Kremlin have shown, during the sixteen years of their regime their complete lack of ability to manage properly the economic life of Russia. The whole country is in ruins. It has been pillaged by the archthieves of the Kremlin. All things having any value they have traded or sold <span class="page-break">\3</span>abroad. They have taken the clothing of the people; they have taken from them their last loaf of bread. Hungry women and children have been executed on the spot by Red soldiers for taking one stalk of rye from the fields.</p>
   <p>The tactics and the entire policy of the so-called "Communists" are directed toward one point--the dictatorship of the entire world and a world revolution --the final aim of the Kremlin despots and haters of humanity. These Soviet tyrants guide their actions by neither socialistic nor communistic ideas and tenets. Banditism and world destruction, and bloody annihilation of all honest men willing to work and fight for universal peace and common weal--these are the high aims of these bloody executioners of all working people.</p>
   <p>It is not difficult for you, Mr. President, to verify all these facts, known well to Russians and to all non-Russians. In the month of July you sent a special commission into the U. S. S. R. to ascertain the facts about conditions existing in Russia, and how the Russian people live under the Soviet regime.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>It is to be expected that the men sent by you will conscientiously fulfill the task entrusted to them. When the commission returns from its trip to the U. S. S. R., then, Mr. President, listen to its report as a true Christian and lover of humanity, and consider the untold suffering of ninety million Russian people, doomed to death from starvation by the Soviet government,and refuse, once and for all, to recognize the Kremlin bandits, who have destroyed more than sixty million people during the bloody sixteen years of their rule, by imprisonment in Siberia, by executions and by starvation.</p>
   <p>Do not enter into any commercial treaties with these speculators from Russia. Rather give back to your own poor and hungry people all the surpluses and other goods that enter in to the proposed trade agreements with the Soviets. The Soviets have nothing to sell abroad. They have no means with which to buy American products.</p>
   <p>But help the Russian people. Cover the nakedness of Russian peasants and factory-workers. Satisfy their hunger. Send them a gift from the United States <span class="page-break">\5</span>of America this coming Christmas. Give them your surpluses of grain, coal, coffee, soap, shoes, medicines. Help the Russian immigrants in America to rise and extend their protection and help to their brothers in Russia.</p>
   <p>I appeal to you, Mr. President. I want to believe that the principle of democracy this time, also, will serve as a guarantee of your attention to this letter--a petition and an appeal for aid and salvation for millions of human lives in Russia.</p>
   <p>Nina Birskaya</p>
