   <p>The parish was practically destroyed. Services were conducted as in the pioneering days with five to ten present. It was surrounded by hatred and gossip of the enemies of orthodoxy. The church was burdened with a debt of $18, 328.80. But with a determined faith in the help of God, it was necessary to begin work on the soil of Christ.</p>
   <p>Dark sleepless nights, tears in solitude, are the witnesses of the labor the young head of the church was compelled to go through and work for the rebirth of the parish. All the time, from dawn until dusk, he went to the homes seeking Russian people, spoke, consoled and directed. If a drop falling steadily will wear away the stone, then the fire of love for humanity, and decent treatment have conquered the cold hearts and slowly, but definitely increased the parish. In Dec. 1913, St. Michael's Brotherhood was organized and began to serve.</p>
