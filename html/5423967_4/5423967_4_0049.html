   <p>The seventeenth consecutive convention of the Russian National Orthodox Society took place on April 21 and 22, 1928 in Chicago, Illinois. Over fifty delegates from various branches of the Russian National Orthodox Society were present, the majority of which were from the first branch, which is the largest. On Saturday, April 21, at about 8 P. M., Vladimir Sabinsky, president of the Russian National Orthodox Society and a very active person in the colony, opened the convention and greeted the delegates with a brief speech. Recording secretary Ilarion Horoshchenya read the list of delegates from all the ten branches (branches sixth and ninth dissolved during the World War) in Indiana Harbor, Ind.; Benton Harbor, Mich.; Argo, Ill., and other states. After several additional explanations about the rights of various delegates a recommendation was brought in concerning the right of voice for the guests not members of the Russian National Orthodox Society.</p>
   <p>A wise suggestion was accepted to permit members of the Russian National Orthodox Society of the various sections (not the delegates) to appear at the Convention as guests, but of course, with no right to participate in the discussion. The financial secretary, Dimitri Vorobey, brought up the records of income and expense of the Russian National Orthodox Society. From this record it became known that in 1926 the society had $2,905.87 income; in 1927, $14,114-76; in 1928, $17,020.63. In 1927 the expense for widows, widowers, orphans and the sick, $6,702.59. All funds of the society on January 1, 1928 amounted to $22,318.04. Out of this sum it is necessary to pay to orphans (when they become of age) the sum of $3,914.51, and together with small debts, $4,582.51. For January and February of 1928 the society received a net income of $635.79, so that on the first of March, 1928 in the society's treasury there was with the exception of debts, a sum of $17,735.53. The report which was read (month by month and in detail) was accepted by the convention.</p>
   
   <p>After this the president of the Russian National Orthodox Society raised the question of the election of a presidium of the convention. Immediately on the big "blackboard" behind the table of the president appeared five names, B. Konashevsky, F. Ustich, J. Voronko, A. Paciuk, and B. Diedowich. Two of them declined and the fight began for one of the remaining three. F. Ustich received twenty-six votes and A. Paciuk and B. Diedowich received sixteen each (seven votes were found void). Delegate F. Ustich was elected president and A. Paciuk vice-president. B. Sabinsky, on leaving the presidency expressed to the convention his wish that its work might bring good fruit to the Russian National Orthodox Society.</p>
   <p>Following this Jacob Dziyko was elected secretary of the convention by forty votes and Piotr Nagorny as his assistant by fifteen votes.</p>
   <p>The convention hurriedly passed to the most important question - election of officers for 1928-29. The attempts of some insignificant questions were met unfavorably by the audience. First of all the convention requested the president as well as other members of the executive, to continue holding their offices for the coming term. D. Sabinsky, D. Vorobey, D. Slesnik and others expressing their thanks for the consideration, declined the candidacy, explaining their refusal on grounds of weariness, overwork and generally a desire to rest. From the list of people nominated as candidates for the new executive board, only three chose to run: S. Jakimovich, V. Konashevsky and F. Ustich. By voting (by secret ballot) Vasily Konashevsky was elected president of the Russian National Orthodox Society, for the new term by twenty-nine votes and F. Ustich vice-president by sixteen votes. The question of candidates for the financial secretaryship of the Russian National Orthodox Society was more complicated. Many declined on account of the bond required. Out of ten people nominated only three remained. Ilarion Horoshchenya received eighteen votes, Nikolai Kozak, forty-two; and Michael Gorozanko, five. Nikolai Kozak was elected financial secretary and Ilarion Horoshchenya his assistant. For the office of recording secretary a more intensive search was made. The convention has increased the salary of this person from $10 to $25 for the year. Upon request of the convention, Dimitri Sleznik agreed to accept the candidacy and was elected unanimously as recording secretary. Jacob Dziyko, Dimitri Michalchik, Mark Horoshcheyia; the controlling committee: Dimitri Vorobey, Joseph Slesnik, Feodor Kez, Foma Syman, Makari Petrenia. In conclusion on the same day a question was raised about a banquet (on the occasion of the sixteenth anniversary), for the delegates of the convention and guests with the aim of acquaintance and mutual understanding. The convention appropriated for the banquet $100. Sunday, April 22, the convention was continued.</p>
   <p>The question concerning the election of agents for insuring children was much debated, Mark Horoshchenya desiring to remain the insurance agent, in order to avoid two jobs refused to participate in the supervising committee. B. Sabinsky was elected to this office. The other agents retained their old offices.</p>
   <p>A serious matter was the question about paying a premium to relatives of dead members when such relatives were sick a considerable time; the question was answered thus: the widow should receive hundred and fifty dollars for the funeral; the remainder should be paid to the one who is ill, according to his needs.</p>
   
   <p>A new question unforeseen by the order of the day was raised by delegate Joseph Voronko, who reported about the educational activities in the colony in conjunction with the problems of the Russian National Orthodox Society.</p>
   <p>The reporter described in detail the status of the schools in Chicago and vicinity - the Russian colony, where the members of the Russian National Orthodox Society are scattered. These members are also members of the committee of some schools in the colony, whose aims are contradictory to those of the Russian National Orthodox Society. This creates a condition whereby a member of one of the sections of the Russian National Orthodox Society "must" speak and do something else. Besides, the school activities are not making any progress, the educational activities serve the aims of politics, new systems of education and schooling are not taken into consideration. The youngsters and youth are no longer under the influence of family and colony organizations.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there is no school center, no pedagogic system, no school unity. The National Orthodox Society of Chicago, which has members in the school societies can and should have influence on the school system. All schools, where the majority of the members are also members of the Russian National Orthodox Society, should create a unity of the schools. This will give the colony a cultural and educational center, will unite the Russian National Orthodox Society, will give the children and youth a new stimulus of unity, and the society new members and one school curriculum for the schools. It will liquidate the chaos in the school system in Chicago and vicinity. This (new policy - ed.) will change the American's opinion of our schools which in their eyes appear to be the roots of anti-Americanism and therefore lose all aid from American cultural and educational organizations. It will also create a common store of supplies for all schools; books, maps, globes, etc. The Russian National Orthodox Society must quickly take into its hands the creation and unity of the schools. After this report B. Oliesiuk, John Piatnitza, V. Sabinsky, M. Rybak, P. Nagorny, Piotr Sabinsky, F. Ustich, approved it. The convention accepted the report and appointed a committee for creating a united school system within the Russian National Orthodox Society. E. Voronko, V. Sabinsky, John Piatnitza, P. Nagorny, E. Gorshchenia.</p>
   <p>Later Dimitri Sleznik suggested the publication of a calendar-almanac for 1929, with material picturing the activity of the Russian National Orthodox Society, stories, reviews, photographs, etc. The calendar should serve as an encyclopedia for each member of the Russian National Orthodox Society. The reporter recommended the creation of a committee to make this a reality without requiring help from the society. The society should only give the publishers its name and for that it should have a guarantee that nothing will be published unsympathetic to the Russian National Orthodox Society. The governing body will be informed about the character of the material that is to be published in the calendar. The convention has also accepted this report and elected to the editorial committee D. Vorobey, J. Voronko, D. Michalchik, J. Piatnitza, D. Sleznik, V. Goroshenia, and Evlampy Sizich.</p>
   
   <p>The question of the construction of a new building created much interest at the convention. A national building is a necessity of the Russian National Orthodox Society. The old parish for a long time has not been able to house all the organizations on Wood Street. The success of the school is hampered by the crowded condition of the building. To open a high school is an impossibility. For parties and concerts there is no hall. For the office of the Russian National Orthodox Society there is no room, not even a table. The Russian National Orthodox Society is growing. The convention accepted the recommendation to erect a new building as a National Home of the Russian National Orthodox Society.</p>
   <p>Further the convention has earmarked $100 for the parish of St. George the Conqueror, for the use of their building for the convention. The convention has listened to the recommendations to join the protest against the "Vilno" process in connection with the White Russian deputies of the Polish Sejm and others active in the White Russian Peasant-Workers organization (S. Rak-Mikhailowsky, Bronislav Tarashkewich, etc.).</p>
   
   <p>The convention of the Russian National Orthodox Society, the membership of which is composed of emigrants from Grodno, Vilno and Minsk which at present are a part of Poland, accepted the recommendation to protest against the process directed against White-Russians. Unimportant questions were decided quickly and at 6 P. M. the president, F. Ustich, declared the convention closed. In loaned automobiles, the delegates of the convention departed for the celebration of the first anniversary of the first section in the Schoenhofen banquet hall.</p>
   <p>At the banquet the convention continued. A series of orators, reviewing the work of the convention, spoke on topics interesting to the Russian National Orthodox Society and predicted its future welfare.</p>
