   <p>The brutal assassination of V. S. Levkovich, the financial secretary of the Rassviet organization, and active member of Branch 15 of the Rnzov, Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society), occurred last Sunday, at about six o'clock in the evening. Sophie Levkovich, the widow of the deceased, tells the following story of the tragedy.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, at about six o'clock in the evening, V. Levkovich left home for a walk. After fifteen or twenty minutes he was found bleeding profusely on the porch of his house. He could only say that he was struck and wounded by Konstantin Malachovskiy.</p>
   <p>Immediately a physician and the police were called, but the efforts to save him failed because the main artery on the right leg had been severed.</p>
   
   <p>Where, how, and under what circumstances the assassination of Levkovich occurred is unknown. But it is certain that he was attacked by Konstantin Malachovskiy who, with his accomplices, Nestor Kravchenko, Emelian Pasenkov, and S. Payor, attacked him with a knife. All of these men have been arrested.</p>
   <p>The prisoners gave confused testimony. One of them stated that all of them were drunk and Levkovich was in their flat when a fight took place between them and Levkovich. The others stated that Levkovich was not in their quarters. Post-mortem examination, however, proved that there was not a drop of alcohol in the organs of Levkovich.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the authorities have not decided where to set the place of assassination, whether in a home or on the street. Levkovich's overcoat was cut, and that fact provides grounds for the belief that the attack occurred on the street.</p>
   <p>The inhabitants of Pullman know the prisoners as bolshevik gangsters. These gangsters had previously threatened to "get" Levkovich because of his activities against the bolsheviki, but Levkovich had not paid any attention to their threats.</p>
   
   <p>The main prisoner, K. Malachovskiy, was recently freed from prison, where he served a short term for attacking one of the Pullman residents with a knife.</p>
   <p>The bolshevik gangsters willingly explain the assassination of Levkovich in this way: they were dead-drunk, and since Levkovich had attacked them, the murder was committed in self-defense. They naturally make such a statement in order to escape severe punishment. But in reality, the plan to attack Levkovich had evidently been premeditated, considered, and plotted much earlier by their "idealistic" leaders.</p>
   <p>With the death of V. Levkovich, who died at the hands of bolshevik gangsters and villains, the Russian colony has lost one of its most idealistic and energetic workers.</p>
