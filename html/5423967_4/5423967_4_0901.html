   <p>The Pushkin evening given last Saturday attracted comparatively few guests. For some reason or other our Chicagoans accord poor attendance to Saturday evening functions. There is no doubt, however, as to the moral success of the memorial party.</p>
   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Rykov acted excellently their roles in the "Proposal" by A. Chekhov. The appearances of the choir and orchestra of the Y.M.C.A college were warmly appreciated. P. Gribova was rewarded with thunderous applause for her brilliant execution of several Russian folk and classical dances. She was called upon several times to repeat the Spanish dance which she so well performs. The baritone voice of A. Grishaev was in good condition, and the audience enjoyed the violin solo by the youthful S. Dubinka.</p>
   <p>In the recitation of Pushkin's works G. Nedzel was unusually good; he read one of the poet's most amusing pieces, accompanied on the piano by his brother The guests were thrilled by the acrobatic dances of pupils of Mr. Andreev's studio. Miss Helen Kalatskaya was elected queen of the evening. Words of greeting were spoken by Dr. Nedzelnitsky, Mrs. M. Moravskaya, and I. Voronko.</p>
