   <p>Bishop Leontiy has developed an extraordinary literary activity. He started to write on Theological subjects very early in his life, while living in Russia.</p>
   <p>Later he was editor of the Russian American Orthodox Herald (Russko-Amerikanskiy Pravoslavniy Vestnik, organ of the Russian Orthodox Church in America, published in New York) from 1914 to 1930. He was also editor of the newspaper Sviet (Light) from 1914 and still remains a collaborator of this paper.</p>
   <p>He callaborated in 1917 with the Russkaya Zenilya (Russian Land),a magazine published in New York), and from 1918 to 1920 in the New York magazine Golos Tserkvi (The Voice of the Church). In 1921 and 1922 he was editor of the religious monthly magazine Dobry Pastyr (The Good Shepherd, N.Y.)</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>He was collaborator of the newspaper Nedelya (The Week, N.Y.) in 1921; of the papers Pravoye Dyelo (The Righteous Cause, N.Y.) in 1923; Russkaya Mysl (Russian Thought, N.Y.) in 1924, and Pravoslavniy Khristianskiy Vyestnik, (The Orthodox Christian Herald, published in Cleveland) in 1924 and 1925.</p>
   <p>While living in Russia the Bishop published a pamphlet entitled Dookhovnye Russkiye Zhurnaly za 1906 god (Russian Religious Magazines for the year 1906, published in Kremenets) and some other pamphlets.

   <p>Finally Bishop Leontiy is a talented poet and under various pseudonyms has contributed poetry to different Russian-American newspapers and magazines.</p>
   <p>When asked by me whether the Russian Orthodox Church in Chicago carries on any anti-communistic activities, Bishop Leontiy answered in substance as follows: there is no necessity of any militant anti-communist propaganda for the Russian Orthodox Church. Its very existence here in Chicago, in the midst of a population which has been strongly influenced by communist atheistical propaganda is a protest against this propaganda. Besides any campaign against communism, <span class="page-break">\5</span>carried on by the Church, would only induce the communists to undertake a correspondingly more energetic atheistical propaganda. The only effective way of fighting bolshevistic communism is to further the moral and spiritual development of the Russian colony. When this will be done the communist propagandists will not have any success any more. As it is, during the last few years the Russian communists have not been as militant as before in attacking the Church. The communists, said the Bishop, have been unwittingly done a service to the Orthodox Church by their persecution of it. This cruel persecution has eliminated out of the ranks of both the clergy and the laity those insincere and unreliable elements which were only a burden to the Church.</p>
