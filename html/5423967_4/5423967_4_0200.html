   <p>A motion is made concerning the celebration of the centennary of the birth of the great Russian writer Griboyedov. Nobody opposes this motion. The secretary is entrusted with the task of finding a person who could read a report about Griboyedov, and also one or two artists.</p>
   
   <p>Concerning the matter of the by-laws it is resolved to devote one of the next general assemblies to the working up of the by-laws, making them clearer, somewhat limiting the objects of the society and, if possible, abridging the text.</p>
   <p>The ex-treasurer, Mr. K. Kotsyubinsky, burned over to the new treasurer three bank-books:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>1) of the Progressive Bank -- amount</td>
     <td>$1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

   <p>It was resolved to postpone the election of the members of the revising committee till the time when there would be in the society at least 10 members attending its sessions.</p>
   <p>Heated debates arose in connection with Dr. Pertsov's proposal to send to Paris a greeting to Mr. P. N. Milukov, as on January 27 of the current year Mr. Milukov will celebrate the 70th anniversary of his birth. Mr. S. G. Prokopov and Mr. K. L. Kotsyubinsky opposed this motion. Ultimately the assembly settled on a compromise: it was resolved to let the greeting reach Mr. Milukov through the medium of the local press.</p>
   <p>The session is adjourned exactly at 4 P. M.</p>
   <p>It was not decided when the next session would take place. The secretary was instructed to confer later about this question with the chairman and to inform the members about the date of the assembly through the means of the press.</p>
