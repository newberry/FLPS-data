   <p>To Dr. Krasnow:</p>
   <p>Before the Chicago Association of Russian officers there are two matters: one from New York, from the society to aid the construction of the aeroplane E. E. Sikorsky S-36, another from the American Consul in Shanghai describing the very sad situation of Russian orphans located within the boarders of China. The counsel has requested the Y. M. C. A. and all Russian organizations to aid.</p>
   <p>After looking into this information we have found that the first matter is of general concern to all Russians, the second being a purely philanthropic affair. The Executive Committee of the Chicago Association of Russian officers is requesting all Russians in the city of Chicago, regardless of their political views, to be present at the general conference of this committee and the Russian Colony, on Sunday October 31st, at 3 P.M. in the Y.M.C.A. headquarters, 19 S. LaSalle St., in order to discuss the question of arranging charitable affairs to aid the above mentioned.</p>
   <p>Col. Shumkoff has been appointed as representative of the Chicago Association of Russian Officers.</p>
   <p>Signed:</p>
   <p>Gen. Tcheslavsky, Pres.</p>
   <p>Sec. Capt. Shukrostoff.</p>
