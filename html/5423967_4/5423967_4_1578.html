   <p>"Russian Chicago is the most miserable city in the United States."</p>
   <p>This is what an old member of the Russian colony was telling me a short time ago. He had witnessed "the happy period of the life of Russian Chicago," and now he is witnessing the period of dissensions, of the dismemberment of the Russian colony by "foreigners" who, like worms, are gnawing its body. And yet only yesterday these men have been boasting that they are Russians; only yesterday they were feeding on Russian bread, they were studying in Russian schools and were paying for their studies with Russian money.</p>
   <p>The most striking personality among these "worms" (striking, because the devil himself is also a fairly striking character) is a certain White Russian ex-minister and public man who is trying to carry on <span class="page-break">\2</span>anti-Russian political activities in Chicago. (Note: The writer of the article aims at I. Y. Voronko, who even now is a zealous advocate of the separation of White Russia from the rest of Russia. N. K.)</p>
   <p>I do not mean an anti-Soviet or anti-Communist policy, but just an anti-Russian policy.</p>
   <p>He has penetrated into the very midst of the Russian colony by posing as a "lamb," as "a friend of the oppressed White Russian people."</p>
   <p>The colony accepted him because it knew very well what follows: the population of White Russia is actually being oppressed by Polish overlords; and therefore, if we see a friend of the White Russian people, we consider him as one of us, and we are ready to go hand in hand with him.</p>
   <p>We even organized a White Russian People's Society, and the ex-minister joined it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But soon the society found out that the "friend of the White Russian people which are oppressed by the Poles" has come to America with a Polish passport and is making propaganda rather for "an independent White Russia, entirely separated from the rest of Russia," than for the liberation of the oppressed.</p>
   <p>But it is and was well known in the society that the Russians never oppressed the White Russians. These two nations are brothers tied together just as closely as children of the same family.</p>
   <p>The government did oppress, but it oppressed also the Russians and all those who were regarded as "subjects of the tsar, the little father."</p>
   <p>But the "Little Father" is one thing; the people is something different.</p>
   <p>Our Chicago White Russians, who knew this, decided that the "friend of <span class="page-break">\4</span>the oppressed" does the wrong thing, and they ousted him from the society.</p>
   <p>And right here was started some work which I wish I would not have to describe.</p>
   <p>The "friend of the oppressed" who knew pretty well all about the tactics of the Jesuits, started to work according to the Jesuitic maxim: "All means are good." The editors of the Russian newspapers began to receive lots of articles written with <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of arousing the passions and fostering dissensions. In these articles it was maintained that the Russians are enemies of the White Russians, that they oppress the latter, that they are strangers, people who are foreign to the White Russians.</p>
   <p>The White Russians were reading these articles and some of them were astounded, finding that in these articles things were revealed to them of which they had never heard before. Some would spit after reading these revelations; some would be revolted and would ask: "Who is writing that?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>But the "friend of the oppressed," being a crafty man and a coward, like all those who take up some "business that is profitable only for themselves," was never signing his articles by his real name, nor does he do it now.</p>
   <p>He is hiding. But while hiding he does his anti-Russian, devilish work.</p>
   <p>I repeat: This is not anti-Soviet or anti-Communist, but just anti-Russian work.</p>
   <p>This man is carrying on this propaganda everywhere: in schools, at meetings, etc.</p>
   <p>And he is not alone; there are also some "friends" of his who would be willing to drown Russia in a spoonful of water.</p>
   <p>It does not matter to them what Russia it is - Soviet Russia or Russia <span class="page-break">\6</span>under some other regime. They are inimical to Russia as such.</p>
   <p>We shall point them out one by one. We shall do that, of course, not because Russia needs be afraid of them or could be affected by their activities; but because it is necessary that the people should know who are their friends and who are wolves who are concerned not about the people or about "their own independent republic," but about such a place where they could become again ministers, chiefs of police, etc., or in other words, where they could be bosses.</p>
   <p>For the sake of becoming one of the bosses one can, of course, spit on Russia which has fed and educated these persons, has given them a chance to become members of the "master class."</p>
   <p>Yet the peasants who emigrated from Russia a long time ago because they were really oppressed are not planning to secede from Russia and do not spit on Russia's heart.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>They love Russia.</p>
   <p>Nor do the last immigrants who left Russia also because they were oppressed, spit on Russia.</p>
   <p>They love Russia.</p>
   <p>But these representatives of the "master" class, with souls which are far from being noble, are shouting: "We must secede, Russia in our enemy!" Shame on you!</p>
   <p>That is, if you can still be ashamed.</p>
