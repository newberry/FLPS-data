   <p>The problem of our youth in America is no less important than our other significant problems. In my opinion, the problem of our youth is much more important than our farm and our insurance business problems, because our farm and our insurance will soon be needed by no one. Unless our organizations provide for the influx of young people, unless our societies bring up and properly prepare new reserves from among the young generation, our cause is doomed.</p>
   <p>We must say, to our distress, that our public workers....are not examining this problem with enough seriousness; they underestimate it, they do not seem to perceive the importance and the pressing nature of this question.</p>
   <p>They speak and write about our youth only superficially, without touching the root of the matter and without going deeper into the underlying causes. But still sadder is the fact that many of us look upon our youth with distrust and even scorn, as can be seen in the articles published in our press.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>They say: "What can we expect from our Russian-American youth? Illiterate Russian peasants, after coming to America, have married equally illiterate women, have produced offspring, and have never given a care to the upbringing and education of their children. And therefore it is impossible to expect any noticeable improvement among our young generation in America."</p>
   <p>This may be partly true. But people who write such stuff evidently have not received much of an upbringing or an education themselves. They cannot see that the cause of this mental backwardness of our people here lies in the social and economic conditions of our everyday life in America. Give our youth in this country the proper conditions of a normal life, and it will display even higher qualities of development than the American youth or the youth of other national groups. A convincing proof of the superior qualities of our youth is the fact that in many higher institutions of learning Russian students receive the highest grades in all subjects. As an additional proof, we may mention the fact that many Russian youths reveal considerable talent in various arts and sciences. Their names are known to all the Russian colony.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The whole nation cannot be composed of geniuses. The chief merit of the people as a whole is that it produces geniuses and makes it possible for their talents to be discovered and developed. In this connection, I can say from my own bitter personal experience that our Russian-American youth will surpass the old colony, will surpass their fathers, in producing more and finer talents, and that it will provide proof that their mental and spiritual development is higher than that achieved by the old colony.</p>
   <p>Who among the old colony has ever risen to any height in any great field of endeavor? Not one of our "old-colony" brothers has ever become known in the field of literature; not one in the field of art; and not one in science. If someone with the signs of talent and inspiration tried to reveal and develop his dormant abilities, he was brushed aside by our newspaper articles.</p>
   <p>These same newspapers were busy tearing and dividing our colony into political factions, into hostile camps, but they made no effort to teach us and to inspire us to higher achievements in the fields of human endeavor. The same evil and disastrous policy is practiced even today in our Russian colony.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>And it probably will continue to be practiced until the end of our old colony. When the old colony dies out, it will leave behind not even one "miraculous memorial" of the men whose deeds and creations would embellish the pages of some future biographer or historian writing on the history of the Russian colony in America.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, among our Russian-American youth one cannot observe such sharp and clumsy antagonism concerning our young talents, and there is no such sharp division into political groups. The Russian-American youth has virtually one aim and one spirit; however, it is not fully formed, nor is it completely developed.</p>
   <p>To us, America appears as a rich stepmother, our real mother being far away beyond the ocean. Therefore, we old people are divided spiritually. For us the question of our homeland is more important than the question of the betterment of our financial and cultural condition in the place of our present sojourn. We regard ourselves merely as temporary sojourners in America.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>On the last day of our life here, we would still consider ourselves simply as guests in this country, like those who have come here to make some money and then return to their fatherland. We cannot be blamed for this feeling: we are bound spiritually to Russia.</p>
   <p>But as for our youth, America is their mother. In their souls, there is no tragic division of loyalty. And this is why our youth have at once begun the task of improving their financial and cultural condition. They are working collectively and individually.</p>
   <p>There is no political antagonism among the young Russian generation, and there never will be, because American democracy teaches people how to respect the views of their opponents. There is and there will be no room among our youth for religious and national antagonism.</p>
   <p>All this proves that our youth have adopted a sane and honorable program, a program of high ideals in keeping with our times and our epoch. And a man who has been free from childhood on is far removed from all prejudices; he <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>is well on his way to real freedom--not the wild freedom of barbarians, but the human freedom that obliges everyone of us to fulfill his debt to society and to himself.</p>
