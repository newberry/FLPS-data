   <p>The power of any organization is measured not so much by the number of members it may have on its roster as by the potential strength inherent in the quality of its members and in their readiness to respond to the call of their organization.</p>
   <p>Even if we agree with our opponents that our society is not so successful in its work--if, in the words of our opponents, it "has been driven into a blind alley" by the Russian International Mutual Aid Society [Translators note: this is a Communist organization]; then how is it that during our recent Christmas tree celebration there were about two thousand persons present, all members of our organization?</p>
   <p>Everybody knows that a large part of our membership lives outside the city of Chicago, that many members live in other states; despite all this, and despite <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the economic depression and unemployment Union Hall was filled to the walls with the members of the R.I.M.A.S. (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) and their families. All of this means that the inner strength of the Independents not only has not "been driven into a blind alley", but has actually increased during these latter years of our struggle for the expansion of our activities. Our organization has become greater and stronger, and shows no signs of growing smaller and weaker.</p>
   <p>The exceedingly important fact is that, among the large crowd present at the Christmas celebration, the younger generation was magnificently represented by a large number of our Russian boys and girls. The gray-haired patriarchs of our colony were also present in goodly numbers.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that our organization is strong, not only in the quantity but also in the quality of its membership and in the influence it exerts upon the Russian group in Chicago and in other cities.</p>

   <p>Some may say that the Bolsheviks in Chicago draw large crowds to their various doings. Maybe--sometimes. But their affairs are attended not by Russians alone. All groups and individuals, irrespective or nationality who have an "international streak" in them, usually come to all the Bolshevik gatherings; all races, all nationalities, all tongues are there. They are all united in one great idea of remaking the world.....And here in our quarters on Wood street gather the people of one mother, of one race and one tongue, united in one great little idea--not of rebuilding the world but of building and keeping their own little corner of it. The Bolsheviks receive support from all nationalities, and we frequently receive a slap on the face even from our own nationality. In spite of all this, we are able to draw an impressive number of Russian people to our organization. In short, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, with all its branches, is the foundation of all Russian community life in Chicago and vicinity. All the better elements of the Russian colony in Chicago, representing almost exclusively the old Russian peasant immigration to America, is grouped around our organization. And all the elements that still float, without sail or <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>rudder, in the sea of the Russian colony, should find their haven in the ranks of our organization.</p>
   <p>The life itself earnestly demands that every Russian in America should enter this haven, over which there is a sign: "The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. All those who still do not belong to any organization, and all forward-thinking persons, should hurry into the shelter of our society.</p>
