   <p>Language is unquestionably one of the greatest inventions of man. Without this invention, the human race would be without culture and without civilization...The degree of a man's mental development can easily be gauged from his ability to use his own language fully and correctly. The insufficient knowledge of their language which characterizes the majority of people is largely responsible for their economic and social backwardness.</p>
   <p>An interesting illustration of the difficulties and the embarrassment people experience because of their limited knowledge of their own language is provided by what occurs at the Russian lectures. After the lecture is over and the open discussion begins, a man will stand up to question the lecturer. He speaks slowly and with noticeable difficulty. It is impossible for the rest of the audience to understand what he is trying to say. And yet it is evident that he has a thought or an idea which he wants to express, but which he is unable to formulate in articulate language, because his vocabulary is extremely limited <span class="page-break">\2</span>and because he lacks the skill or the technique of putting his words together into coherent thoughts or sentences. He is not necessarily an ignorant person. He may even be keener mentally than many other persons in the audience; but he is helpless because he is unable to give outward expression to his thoughts in so many coherent words or phrases. What this man needs is a systematic study of his own language; he must add to his vocabulary new words and expressions contained in the dictionary of his native tongue.</p>
   <p>Turning again to our lectures for another example, we sometimes see a man, a common worker, rise to his feet and address a query to the lecturer, or deliver a brief talk in such forceful well-selected words that the audience immediately recognizes that this man knows how to express his thoughts.</p>
   <p>The question now arises, How is it possible for one man without any formal education to acquire a knowledge of the language and to discover the power of words, while another man in similar circumstances is not able to express a single sentence coherently? The answer to this question is that one man has been <span class="page-break">\3</span>devoting his leisure time to reading books, while the other has been idling his time away. The reading of books adds greatly to one's knowledge of the language and to one's mastery of words.</p>
   <p>Members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society should know their native language thoroughly, especially those who occupy the more prominent positions in the organization. Often they are called upon to explain some new idea to a group of members or to candidates for membership in the Society, or to make a public address, or to convince the masses. And the first and most important requirement for a successful speaker is a thorough knowledge of his language.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that this little article on the necessity of knowing well one's native language will serve as an inspiration to some of our countrymen to make it a rule to read books and to read a little every day.</p>
