   <p>The author of the article expresses his opinion about the arrangement of Christmas parties for Russian children and adults, and their aim.</p>
   <p>It is true, the author says, that here in America it is not so easy to excite the interest of the Russian children for the Russian customs and rites. It must be taken into consideration that the children are being brought up in a foreign country, do not know the correct English language, have very little sympathy with their parents and all that is Russian. That is why the parents and teachers of the Russian schools for children must endeavor, when planning the children's holidays and amusements, to inculcate upon their children the Russian rites, habits, and customs. Visiting a certain Christmas party the author noticed that the organizers strove to do their best by arranging for the children many amusements, occupying them with gay games and giving them toys and candy. Then the author draws a picture of the condition of Russian children, somewhere on the west shores of the Pacific Ocean, in a half savage country, in a land inhabited by the yellow race of people, where the children are sheltered in dark, cold Chinese phansas (houses). The children are barefoot, without clothes, and hungry, and always in need of a piece of dry bread. "We Russian people," adds the author of the article, "parents, teachers, and trustees of the Russian schools for children in America, striving to give our children the best amusements and pleasures, should not forget the unfortunate children who don't know pleasure and light, and continually live in poverty." The Committee for Aid to Russian Poor Children in Chicago accepts contributions in money, clothes, and shoes.</p>
