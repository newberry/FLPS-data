   <p>The concert given for the benefit of hungry orphans in Russia by the Russian Cooperative Restaurant, on March 18, 1923, at the Schoenhofen Hall, was a signal success both as an exhibition of artistic achievement and as a financially profitable enterprise. It is a long time since the Russian colony has witnessed such a successful undertaking. The program, consisting of a great variety of numbers, was executed in a highly commendable way. The hall was overcrowded. The net proceeds from this concert will probably amount to $700 or $800. This will be a substantial relief for the hungry children in Russia. All honor and glory is due to the members of the Russian Cooperative Restaurant who have managed this successful undertaking!</p>
