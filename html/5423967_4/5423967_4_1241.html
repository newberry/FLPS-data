   <p>The situation of Russian refugees and emigrants in all countries, particularly in Europe, is most difficult, almost in every country they are restricted in their rights. Many of them are being deported and chased from one country to another. They receive employment only when native hands are not available. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Russian papers are replete with stories of tragedies occurring to Russian refugees.</p>
   <p>In many European cities, particularly in Prague and in Paris, there are many Russian educational institutions, publishing houses, courses of instruction of all kinds, trade schools, and even trade organizations, and as far as lectures are concerned, at least twenty are given daily. However, with all this we must admit that there are negative sides to the life of the Russian refugee or [voluntary] emigrant. There are too many political parties among them. As a result, among the Russians abroad there is no singleness of purpose or unity of thought. Because of this, in the long run every one must suffer. With such mutual distrust in the political field no one is the winner, and everybody loses.</p>
