   <p>During the last several years Rassviet has published a number of articles and letters from its readers concerning the faults and virtues of our Russian immigrant group. Throughout these articles and letters one thought has been emphasized--that our group has more faults than virtues, more defects than merits, more weak points than good qualities, and that our group is far behind other national groups in this country in every respect. According to these articles and letters, the chief shortcomings of our group are the following: lack of organization, ignorance, insufficient knowledge of the art of reading and writing, absence of a constructive attitude, a tendency to empty talk and futile arguments, and terrible political and religious intolerance.</p>
   <p>Whether these critics have been right or wrong let readers judge for themselves. Here we want only to stress one of the chief reasons for our lack of organization, as this particular reason is usually overlooked or passed by in silence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Our internal enemies and saboteurs, who are to be found in every Russian community, are the chief cause of our lack of harmony, internal struggles and poor organization. Every Russian organization has its quota of these liars, scandal-mongers, small time adventurers and selfish opportunists. No real fight is being waged against them by any of our organizations, which merely ignore them and try to brush off their waspish intrusions. But at the same time these saboteurs are inflicting more harm and injury upon our organizations than our open enemies. For instance, many think that our greatest enemies are the Bolsheviks, grouped around the Communist paper Novyi <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, who are attempting to bring to ruin all Russian organizations. But this is not so. The Bolsheviks conduct an open war upon the organized Russian groups in America, and, therefore, are not dangerous. Every assault on their part directed against our group is promptly and adequately repulsed by our counter-action. But our internal enemies, who work insidiously, under cover, cannot be dealt with in similar fashion. They are more for<span class="gap">[gap]</span>idable and more of a threat to our unity and to our organized life.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We cite as an example the case of the Russian United Mutual Aid Society. When this Society was continuously but openly attacked by Russian Communists it was in no danger, but when its own saboteurs and internal wreckers set to work the very existence of the organization became endangered. It is hard to say what would have become of this society if, during one of its conventions, their treacherous activities had not been nipped in the bud by their expulsion from the organization. At this time the Society entered upon a new phase of its existence, strengthened its foundations, and did much useful work, such as organizing a Youth Department and acquiring a farm.</p>
   <p>The internal wreckers are very dangerous, because they instigate quarrels, discord and dissension, frequently resorting to the lowest and most degrading methods to achieve their ends. Lies, slanders and provocations are the tools they favor in their efforts to set friend against friend, brother against brother, and member against member, turning them into bitter enemies. If their aim is to destroy not one but two or more organizations united by common ties, then they usually add to their tongue-wagging the use of the pen, writing <span class="page-break">\4</span>articles and reports in which they set one organization against another, and one group of people against another group of people. And one of their important stratagems is that they never appear openly, and never act under their own names, but always hide behind somebody else's back. In order to retain their good standing in the organization and remain unsuspected as long as possible, these saboteurs often pretend to be the most loyal, honest and honorable members of the organization. By doing so they put to sleep all possible suspicion, and at the same time attract to their side naive and credulous members of the organization. When the groundwork for their treacherous plans has been thus completed the rest is easy. The naive, the credulous and the ignorant members of the Society begin to dig under their own organization, not even suspecting that they are but tools in the hands of the treacherous schemers, and not knowing that they are destroying what they themselves have helped to build through many years of hard work.</p>
   <p>Different aims and incentives guide the hands of these saboteurs and wreckers. Some of them work under the direction of some other organization; others, for <span class="page-break">\5</span>immediate or more remote financial gains; still others, the ambitious type, to reach the top, the highest post within the organization, in order to be able to rule with dictatorial power and direct people and programs.</p>
   <p>Because such saboteurs and wreckers are in every Russian organization, are, as a matter of fact, in every organization, it is important that every Russian organization in which there is discord and misunderstanding should seek to discover whether or not there are saboteurs and wreckers within its ranks.</p>
