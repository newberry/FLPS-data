   <p>Recently there has come to our city from Europe a lady who is a physician, Dr. Lydia Yakovlevna Nesterovskaya. Dr. Nesterovskaya has visited almost all European countries. She has been in all the important centers where most of the Russian emigrants reside. She has gathered mush valuable information about the Russian living abroad. Dr. Nesterovskaya intends to devote all her forces to the service of the toiling masses of our city's Russian colony. She expects that the Russian workmen, having gathered together around their non-partisan newspaper Russian Herald, will at last make some progress in the matter of combining, will find a common language and will really achieve unification. The politicians must be swept from the colony with a broom, such is the opinion of the newly arrived interesting member of our colony.</p>
   <p>Dr. Nesterovskaya intends to give in the near future a series of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>free lectures on various subjects for the Russian workmen's colony of Chicago. How she addresses all the tollers to whom she desires to be helpful and begs them to write about their needs and problems. She will answer everybody as far as possible.</p>
   <p>Dr. Westerovskaya is very well acquainted with the state of affairs in our native country. She has received much information from there. In this respect she may prove to be a useful person for the colony. We repeat, we admire this heroic proposal of our recently arrived compatriot to devote herself ontirely to the service of the workmen. Dr. L. Y. Nesterovskaya does not belong to any organization.</p>
   <p>We welcome the new come guest to Chicago. We wish her success in her praiseworthy undertakings.</p>
