   <p>We live in a time and in a country, the author says, where we don't need to worry about passports. This is a great advantage of the United States as compared with the other countries. While in the other countries a person can't make a move without a passport, here in America we, till now, don't need any. That was the will of the fighters for the independence of the United States. That will was observed for a long time. Since the United States became a dominating country the covenants of the ancestors of independence began to vanish and were screened by all kinds of additions to the constitution. Some of the legislators introduced a bill on foreign registration. Fortunately the majority of the legislators were against that bill. But the influence of those antagonistic to foreigners in Congress got stronger and stronger. Because of that there was organized a committee for the protection of aliens, and a branch of it was also established in Chicago. Soon the committee called a conference where more than 100 representatives of different trade unions and cultural organizations were present. At that conference it was decided to begin an energetic campaign against the bill of registration for foreigners. The American Federation of Labor participated in that campaign. Among the persons who took part in that campaign was the famous lawyer Clarence Darrow.</p>
