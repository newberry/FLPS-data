   <p>Political complications in Europe and particularly in the Far East between Russia and Japan begin to excite all [us] Russian people, who despite many years' residence abroad remain true sons of our native land. We all, despite a government of which we do not approve, continue to love our mother country, Russia. We shudder when we hear of the inhuman sufferings of the Russian people. We fight, we protest against the band of highwaymen now controlling the fortunes of Russia. But when a threat of war confronts us, we begin to think seriously and to put the question to ourselves: What shall we do?</p>
   <p>If we side with Russia, we shall have to defend the Bolshevik government, which is hateful to us. To oppose Russia and to desire her defeat in order that by means of it Stalin's regime and his international brethren may be overthrown is also hardly possible. By taking this second stand <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>we may miscalculate and fall under a foreign regime, perhaps even worse oppression. Then it will appear as if we had desired such oppression. Consequently we are confronted with a very complicated problem, which, however, must be solved, for we cannot stand on the sidelines and play the role of impartial spectators. The defeatists say:</p>
   <p>"No matter who rules Russia, the Russian people will be no worse off than they are under the Bolsheviks."</p>
   <p>Perhaps there is a bit of truth in that assertion, but if we look at the problem from another angle, we easily perceive the absurdity of such a statement. It is absurd because the people who say so underestimate the full meaning of a foreign yoke imposed on a country like Russia, and they place too much confidence in the curative properties of the slant-eyed Japanese and of Hitler.</p>
   <p>Of course, to overflow with joy over what is going on in Russia is rather <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>premature, but it is impossible not to notice certain changes in the situation in our native land. Here is an instance of what the Russian people are thinking:</p>
   <p>"Here is what I was told about one lieutenant recently graduated from the Kiev military school. He visited his relatives in his village and talked with them about politics. He told his relatives that the revolution is not over yet; that at present it is going through the most important stage of vital reconstruction; that the forms of authority are not perpetual and depend on historical environment; and that the present authority sitting in the Kremlin is not the last word. He was asked whom he expected after the 'beloved and omniscient comrade Stalin' was gone. The lieutenant mysteriously shrugged his shoulders. To everybody it was clear however, that he had some answer to this question, but that he wanted to keep it to himself. One thing was certain. The lieutenant obviously did not think of Stalin while concealing his answer. He had in view some one else."</p>

   <p>This little instance, at first sight not important, nevertheless is evidence and reveals that among the Russian people something is brewing that sooner or later will come to the surface; that people's patience some day will be exhausted, and that [then] they will pronounce their final weighty word to their oppressors. The coming of such a moment should always be expected, and we must help the Russian people to free themselves of the Bolshevik parasites.</p>
   <p>Whoever rules over Russia, it is easier to settle accounts with an enemy within than with an enemy from without, after the country has been subjugated by a foreign foe. We ourselves can put our house in order and sweep out the dirt when the time comes.</p>
   <p>For that reason the answer to the question which is the title of this article becomes self-evident. It is that in case of war we should take our stand with Russia and say to all enemies and "friends" of Russia:</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"Hands off!"</p>
   <p>Perhaps some people will remind me of our former slogan: "we fight together but march separately." To this 1 reply that at that time we were promoting a political party, whereas now the problem is the defense of our native land, and there is a great distinction between these two.</p>
