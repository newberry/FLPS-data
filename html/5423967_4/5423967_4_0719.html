   <p>The Foundation of the 'Young Russia' organization was laid by the president of the leading center, J. N. Korchak-Novitsky, who, on June 6, 1932, after a report in a private home, established a "nucleus" in Chicago, having appointed the writer as its leader.</p>
   <p>In the nucleus was included R. J. Homko, and later S. U. Busch, who, as a pioneer of the Young Russia movement and its active contributor, had found the time to be opportune to meet the official requirements.</p>
   <p>Thus this insignificant "nucleus" began the complicated problem of the organization and development of the Young Russia movement in Chicago.</p>
   <p>That this problem is complicated and requires an outstanding type of perseverance and energy, of course, every young Russian understands. But the unconquerable armor of the young Russians, the living idea which finds a response in the soul of every Russian person, gives them the courage to overcome these difficulties.</p>
   <p>In Chicago we were hindered not only by difference of opinion and opposition, but also by the fact that the Russian immigrants do not form a compact, segregated community, and that there is only a very insignificant number of Russians qualified for active political work.</p>
   <p>Prior to the existence of Young Russia, Chicago lacked not only a political but also a simple national, patriotic organization. Various attempts were made in this direction in the old colony, but they were not crowned with success.</p>
   <p>In the new colony reigned not only an entirely anti-political feeling but also an inexpressible fear of any organization, even on customary or professional grounds.</p>
   <p>In the face of this we were to build our political organization, our cell. There were two methods of doing it. The first was to make a lot of noise and to recruit as many members as possible, regardless of their quality.</p>
   <p>This method, as the easiest and most effective, is used by the majority of pseudo-political immigrant organizations, which soon burst like bubbles; and should they survive, then they lead a very miserable existence, and that, mostly on various subsidies. The second method was to create a dependable, disciplined, and efficient organization, by way of careful selection of persons with political training, before undertaking any wider activities.</p>
   <p>We selected this method since this corresponded with the aims of the center first, and above all with the creation of that sort of organization.</p>
   <p>We began our work by meeting in private homes. At these meetings we had reports on political subjects. The public heard the reports calmly, but they brought no results, for they were not discussed even by those present. This continued for one and a half years, and in the nucleus there were still only those persons. It was clear that by this method nothing would be accomplished. Then it was decided to arrange the meetings in such a manner that all present would participate actively. Lecturers were invited. Lectures were given on various subjects: philosophy, history, information about Russia, etc. All this had only an indirect bearing upon the teaching of Young Russia, but the lectures were interesting.</p>
   <p>The second part of the meeting was purely young Russian, and here we, having left the defensive, have begun the attack. We have provided a planned education for the members of Young Russia. This was not done formally by way of teaching in but five minutes.</p>
   <p>At the meeting questions were asked about a definite subject. Those who were questioned gave their answers at the meeting.</p>
   <p>It then became clear that our work was not in vain, and that our guests had held the same opinion a long time ago.</p>
   <p>The best answers were worked out by the political section and printed.</p>
   <p>The final publication of these answers was necessary to make them known to all. Thus, gradually a good textbook of Young Russian instructions was created and was at everyone's disposal. A similar text-book was published for Americans in English.</p>
   <p>The work was now on the upgrade; new members flocked into the nucleus. Within a few months it was possible to have an audit. The nucleus grew to such an extent that it was necessary to expand.</p>
   <p>At the head of it were our lecturers; not all, but a great majority. Moreover, the members of the nucleus were well trained. Our public has learned to take an interest in our teaching and it became futile to entertain the public with things which, although useful, yet inclined to detract us from the immediate objective.</p>
   <p>Thus, September 1934 completed the first period of our activity, which period might be called academic. The result of it deviated entirely from our desired objective. The organization was like a fireside circle. To be specific, it was an academic circle of persons interested in philosophy, history, sociology, and economics, in line with young Russian principles.</p>
   <p>The order of the day, however, was an orderly fighting unit, composed of vigilant, disciplined, loyal, persevering, sharp-toothed people able to speak to any audience in any tone, who would be men of action first, and scholars second. However, we have learned a lot during this period. We have created a squadron of political workers and acquired many friends.</p>
   <p>After the second visit of J. N. Korchak-Novitsky, the representative of the leading center, at the end of 1934, began the next step of our activity. This consisted not only in political and orderly training, but in broad propaganda of our ideas within the colony.</p>
   <p>At that time we already had a form. We have had open reports and various kinds of enterprises.</p>
   <p>But a great misfortune befell our beloved nurtured embryo. It came about that the majority of our members had departed for other cities. But the work was already done. A fully trained group of persons were on hand. The nucleus was soon filled and has increased to such an extent that on June 20, 1935 we celebrated the grand opening of the 76th section of Young Russia.</p>
   <p>For the holiday party, July 28, 1935, the cell was so well developed and advanced that three packed cars went to Detroit, and some people on buses. Our cell was saturated with an orderly spirit. The character of our vacations has also changed. The "five minute lectures" have been converted into a text-book, which was used by "back numbers" to take exams. Instead, a class of public speaking has begun to function, where in practice and by way of example our views as well as those of our opponents were studied.</p>
   <p>Desiring to supplement their theoretical education, the members participated in a political school and lectures conducted by the center. Outside activity has also increased, as well as the attendance of our open meetings which were steadily attracting larger audiences.</p>
   <p>The income at our meetings as well as the distribution of our literature have also increased.</p>
   <p>Here it is well to give some figures. The income of our organization has increased by several percent. Not long ago the sale of our Russian publications have expanded month by month. For the month of November, 1935, there were sold and fully paid for 675 issues of Young Russia newspapers and magazines. Our popularity has also grown and we gained the sympathy of various circles in the Russian colony as well as among Americans.</p>
   <p>Why is our popularity growing? Does it mean that all our sympathizers have become young Russians? Indeed, not. It means that the animosity between us and other Russian people in Chicago has broken down, that they believe in our sincerity and our love for Russia and understand that we are concerned with her welfare.</p>
   <p>Americans respect us for our pure Nationalism, and for our defense of it, which is understood by them, and also because we are grateful and loyal to America for having adopted us.</p>
   <p>What then does the 76th section of Young Russia represent?</p>
   
   <p>The number of members bearing the name "Young Russian" is very insignificant. Of these there are only six persons, but each one of these is a responsible worker, a leader who has much more responsibility than president and secretaries of other immigrant organizations. Then follow the candidates of the first and second ranks, and a much greater number of co-workers and members of both sexes.</p>
   <p>Many of these, although they are not under any discipline, voluntarily do more than the most active members of various immigrant committees.</p>
   <p>I cannot be silent about our women. Although in political activity they are not on a par with the men, in their loyalty to the party and the good natured execution of duties entrusted to them and their usefulness in other activity, they are not back numbers.</p>
   <p>Then we have a group of friends who officially are not in the party, but they help us materially and morally. The public which reads our newspapers come to our meetings and enterprises, sympathizes with us or is interested in us, so that even if the size of our organization is not large, the Young Russian movement in Chicago is so great that it penetrates all corners of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>Should some skeptical person, reading these lines, say that we are only a handful, and what we are doing is merely a drop in the bucket, I will reply, " no, it is not true." There is a mass of "Young Russia" nuclei, with the same objective as ours in Chicago. Everywhere there are being molded and trained Young Russia organizations for future work in Russia. Everywhere among the immigrants, nationalism and love to Russia is growing. Everywhere, under the influence of Young Russia, immigrants display a spirit of nationalism, independent and victorious. The process, which is healthy for the immigrants and at the same time healthy for Russia, is under our leadership.</p>
   
   <p>When the expected victories are won, Young Russians will go to Russia in solid columns, for work and construction, for honest cooperation with nationalistic elements, who are inside Russia, in establishing a powerful government.They will be accompanied by thousands upon thousands of Russian immigrants, who under our influence, frequently unnoticed by them, have become true Russian patriots, instead of antagonists and destructionists; they have learned to love Russia, not as they would wish her to be, but as she will be in reality.</p>
