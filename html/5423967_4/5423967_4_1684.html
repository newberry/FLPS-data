   <p>Lately, death claimed one of our leading members of the Moscow Art Theater. Among our group, the name of Ivan Lazarev was little known, but in the theatrical World, his name was greatly revered.</p>
   <p>Four years ago Mr. Lazarev organized a school in Chicago, exclusively to acquaint the American public with real dramatic art. He had achieved much during this time, and for the last two years his pupils staged several Russian plays in English, by Gorky, Andreiev, Tchekov and others.</p>
   <p>Once, during the winter, I had the opportunity to become acquainted with the late Ivan Lazarev. Since that time the name of this talented actor had been impressed upon my memory. Lazarev appeared to be not as an individual personality and a part of the Moscow Art Theater, but the whole theater. Lazarev was the incarnation of sincerity and inspiration, and of all those ideals which the human soul craves.</p>
