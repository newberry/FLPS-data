   <p>At the meeting held by the church council of St. George's parish last Tuesday the question of helping the poor was raised, and the proposal was approved of in principle. The help will be rendered in conformity with Christian teachings. In what form St. George's parish will assist the poor it is difficult to say. So far the details of the projected activity have not been worked out.</p>
