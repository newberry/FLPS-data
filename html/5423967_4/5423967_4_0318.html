   <p>The Chicago branch of the Russian Emigre Children's Aid Society held a social gathering and an entertainment for the benefit of the destitute Russian children who are refuges in foreign countries. The affair, which was called The Day of the Russian Child, was held October 21 at the Russian-American Club. The evening was a complete success, both financially and artistically.</p>
   <p>The Russian artists who answered the call in large numbers and disinterestedly contributed their talent to make the evening a success are chiefly responsible for the splendid outcome of the efforts of the committee in charge of arrangements. They offered a rich and extensive program of Russian music, songs, and dances. The public highly enjoyed the program; the entire audience was enthralled by its own native music, songs, and dances performed by native artists.</p>
