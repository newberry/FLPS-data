   <p>In the latest issue of Movyi Mir, space is devoted to an article signed by some "comrade" by the name of Rudin. Semi-literate and ignorant readers of this newspaper, after going through the article, may come to the conclusion that Rassviet has become a Bolshevik newspaper. For instance, Rudin states that Rassviet became a defeatist newspaper and took Japan under its protection, and declares that the newspaper at present defends the viewpoint which formerly, during the World War, was sustained by Bolsheviks. At that time, the Bolsheviks quite assiduously obeyed the orders of the German general staff, given out with the purpose of destroying Russia and bringing defeat on the country. Now the Bolsheviks, as is well known, have become "the patriots" and the only defenders of the country. For that reason they call "traitors" and "enemies of Russia" all those people who dare to occupy the defeatist positions forsaken by themselves. It is true that among the Russian immigrants there are only a few such defeatist people, but the sentiments expressed by them are still to be noticed, mainly, in monarchist circles.</p>
   <p>However, this newspaper never was a defeatist organ, and it never considered before and does not consider now that, for the sake of bringing about a quick overthrow of the Bolshevik tyranny, it is necessary to parcel out to foreigners Russian land and Russian people, as the Bolsheviks did in order to preserve their dictatorship in Russia, when they gave away parts of Ukraine, White Russia, Bessarabia, etc. Rassviet never justified nor ever called for foreign intervention in Russian affairs for the purpose of annihilating Bolshevism, being always mindful that sooner or later the Russian people themselves would overthrow Bolshevik dictatorship, and re-establish those liberties which were destroyed by Bolshevik dictators. Therefore, Rudin attempts in vain to convince ignorant readers of Novyi Mir that Rassviet, while allegedly following the precepts of Lenin and Trotsky, strives to wreck Russia and approves the expansionist plans of Japan, Germany, Poland, and other countries.</p>
   
   <p>Further in the article this same Rudin writes that Rassviet appears now as Zinovieff's defender and that the newspaper has adopted Zinovieff's and Trotsky's positions of opposition. But in this charge he also reveals his lack of common sense and consistency, together with a total political ignorance. Rassviet always affirmed and still insists that there is no distinction among Stalin, Zinovieff, and Lenin, that all three are nothing more than political adventurers and enemies of the Russian people. As far as the strife among themselves is concerned, it has nothing to do with ideological differences. They carry on a personal fight for domination and leadership in the party--a fight for power. In this respect they very much resemble hungry dogs fighting for a bone. Because of this Rassviet will have no pity for the contestants if they one day find themselves in the concentration camp on the Solovki islands, or somewhere in a political "isolator" where their former opponents are pining.</p>
   <p>Rudin is particularly enraged because the newspaper declared that during the process of the trial the court received no evidence which would implicate Zinovieff with the assassination of Kirov. He tries to persuade the readers that Zinovieff is the only culprit in the crime. But if this be so, the question arises: Why then have Stalin's judges not found Zinovieff guilty of the murder and sentenced him to death as the organizer of the anti-Stalin terrorist movement? Instead, they shot down 117 men who had had not even an indirect connection with Kirov's assasination.</p>
   <p>Why has Stalin treated the main culprit so benevolently? Neither Rudin nor Schliar can give a satisfactory or plausible answer to this question.</p>
