   <p>The school picnic of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society was held on Sunday, August 5. The day of the picnic had been chosen rather unfortunately, because on that day there was held a large meeting of Branch No. 1 of the Independent Society (R.I.M.A.S.), and also a large wedding ceremony took place in the family of one of the members of the Society. Notwithstanding, the picnic was a great success; many people were present. Net profits from the picnic will be turned over to the school fund of our organization.</p>
   <p>Several speeches were made at the picnic. The first speaker, Mr. A. Bernov, chairman of the school council of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, thanked the public for coming to the picnic, and appealed for closer and more effective co-operation in the work of providing Russian elementary education for Russian children.</p>
   <p>Mrs. P. V. Svatikova spoke of the necessity of forming one strong organization which would embrace all Russians living in America, and would unite all <span class="page-break">2</span>Russian societies and organizations into one big family. She criticized our disunion, our quarrels and small envies.</p>
   <p>She mentioned the following two examples: In Pullman, Illinois, where there are no more than a score of Russian families, among which there are fewer than a dozen enlightened, nationally conscious individuals, the members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society arranged a picnic. On the same day and almost on the same spot another small Russian group held a picnic. Today again we see the same thing happening here: Two groups of Russian people, and two picnics, only two hundred yards from each other. One, a picnic of Russian school children of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society; and the other, a Russian youth picnic.</p>
   <p>"Is it not a shame for our grown-up, sensible people to proceed in this way?" asked Mrs. Svatikova? "And we will say it is a shame," she continued. "Instead of going together to one picnic on one Sunday, and to another picnic on another Sunday, thus giving our support to some worthy cause, and having fun together, we split, meet separately, and then spy on each other to find <span class="page-break">3</span>out which picnic has fewer people, and which party is going to go 'broke' first. And we don't seem to notice that we all lose, and that we all may go 'broke'. As a result of such conduct, we should not be surpirsed if our children lose their respect for us and leave our group.</p>
   <p>"We are all children of one country. We speak one language, and observe the same national customs. And yet we do not stick together. If our people desire to free themselves from need and ignorance, and if they wish to make something of their children, they have only one road to follow--unification of all Russian forces and their direction into one channel of mutual trust and closest co-operation in all our undertakings. There should be no federated Russian schools and the schools of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. There should be only one school organization--the Russian school."</p>
   <p>Miss Helen Kalatzkaya, graduate of the Krylov Russian Elementary School, appealed to parents to organize a Russian High School. Mr. V. Sabinsky <span class="page-break">4</span>spoke of the meaning of Russian schools to Russian groups in America, and urged people to strive for better education for themselves and for their children.</p>
   <p>The last speaker was Mr. N. Novin, secretary-manager of Rassviet. In his long and interesting speech he stressed the important contributions of many great Russians to common human civilization and culture.</p>
   <p>The picnic's financial success, in exact figures, is not yet known, but its moral success was unquestionably great, thanks to the vision and whole-hearted efforts of persons connected with the school work of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
