   <p>The leaders and members of the Synod Church on Leavitt Street are in a very sad mood. In all the Russian Colony, enforced work is going on in building schools and libraries, in arranging lectures, plays and useful evenings. The colony little by little is getting organized, is learning, and long ago dismissed every thought about returning to the old regime.

"They read the Shanghai paper with the picture of Nicolay Nicolayevich and are glad of the thought that he might become a Tsar."</p>
