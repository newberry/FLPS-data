   <p>A few days ago the writer of this article had the opportunity of having a talk with the secretary of the People's Independent Society about that society, its aims and purposes.</p>
   <p>"Much nonsense is being told about us," I was told by the secretary.</p>
   <p>"Those who belong to the extreme right or to the extreme left are particularly fond of wagging their tongues when the subject of our society is broached. They make all possible efforts to impress up on everybody the idea that we are a Georgian plague (Note: Georgian because the I. S. is connected with the parish of St. George. D. S.), bolsheviki and rebels. Others again maintain that we smell of incense and do nothing but kiss the floor of the church.</p>
   <p>"Both accusations are obviously preposterous.</p>
   <p>"The Russian People's Independent Society is a non-partisan society, progressive, having for its aim mutual aid, enlightenment and the support of its members who are almost all workmen.</p>
   <p>"It was this society, not any other, that during the first days of the Russian revolution arranged a grand demonstration in honor of the emancipation of the Russian people. The members of the extreme right at that time were still trying to persuade everybody that the revolution in Russia was "just a Jewish bluff"; and many of these who belong to the parties of the left were at that time still assiduously kissing the hands of the priests and listening to their talk about the "Jewish bluff."</p>
   <p>"The Independent Society seceded just for this reason from all those who were clamoring for a dictatorship of some kind or other. We are true democrats and revolutionists and have nothing in common with dictators.</p>
   <p>"This is the reason why we seceded from them and do not have anything in common with them, neither with the monarchists nor with the communists.</p>
   
   <p>"As to our 'smelling of incense,' this is what I have to say to you: Yes, we have built the Independent church, we have built schools and a people's house.</p>
   <p>"But we do not force anybody to go to church. If you believe, please come; if you are not a believer, that is your own business.</p>
   <p>"We have built the Independent church because we wanted that there would be no commercial business, no monarchist propaganda and no commemoration of the tsar, 'our little father,' which was all customary in the old church. This was the true reason of our building a church of our own, not our being so very fond of the "smell of incense.' I reiterate, We are a free people and we are not doing violence to other people's consciences. We do not force them either to go to church or not to go.</p>
   <p>"The main purpose of our society is not to send out propaganda of any religion or of anything else, but enlightenment and mutual aid.</p>
   
   <p>"In this lie the strength and the meaning of our organization.</p>
   <p>"Let anybody answer conscientiously the following question: What Russian organization has been more useful to the Russian colony than the Independent society?</p>
   <p>"I am sure that every honest person will say, 'No other organization has out-done the Independent Society in this respect."</p>
   <p>"We know how many persons are collecting money in their hats from Russians for the benefit of some kind of 'good cause.'</p>
   <p>"The result, however, is that we do not see any good deeds - but the collectors certainly have a good time.</p>
   <p>"Our society does not act that way. If we collect fees and dues from our members, we give them something in return: relief when they are sick or insurance premiums to widows and orphans of deceased members.</p>
   
   <p>"Let people say about us a lot of nonsense. We shall still go on working for the good popular cause of mutual aid."</p>
   <p>This is what the secretary of the Independent Society told me.</p>
   <p>One who knows all about the activities of the Independent society and the results of its work can only say, He is right.</p>
