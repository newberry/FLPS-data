   <p>Mr. Putilov's name was well known to the Russians in Chicago, for he was one of the most active members of that group of Russian workingmen who organized the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society in 1912, when this society was known however under the name of Russian National Orthodox Society. Mr. Putilov has been a hard-working man all his life, but, in spite of that, instead of resting after his work, he would devote all his leisure to the Mutual Aid Society and to the brotherhood of his parish. And he did not only much social work for the good of his fellow men in the organizations to which he belonged, but also spent much of his hard-earned money for the benefit of these organizations. He died poor, he left a poor family, for he has been sacrificing all he could to those poorer than himself. His heart was always full of love and compassion towards all the needy and unfortunate. His life had been a continual service to his fellow men; and <span class="page-break">2</span>even just a few minutes before he died he exclaimed, while talking to the priest I. Zheltonoga who had come to pay him his last visit: "Oh! if I could only serve a little longer the people of my parish!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Putilov died on December 28, 1927. The Russians of Chicago will always reverence the memory of this exceptionally unselfish and noble-minded plain workingman.</p>
