   <p>Some Information about the Russian Ex-Officers' Union of Chicago.</p>
   <p>When asked what he knew about the Russian Officers' Union of Chicago, its origin, activities, and present state, the general gave the following information: this union was organized in Chicago in 1925, on a non-political basis (having nothing to do either with Russian or American political parties), exclusively with the aim of mutual aid and the keeping up of the old Russian military traditions.</p>
   <p>As the majority of the Russian ex-officers had settled in New York, and those who had come from the Far East, in California, only a few Russian officers had come to Chicago. So the union had comparatively <span class="page-break">\2</span>few members - never more than twenty-two. In spite of that some good work has been done by the officers' union while it was in existence. Over $3,000 were sent to Europe to give relief to Russian invalids and about $1,500 for the relief of the children and orphans of Russian emigrants in Europe, chiefly in Poland, Yugoslavia, and France.</p>
   <p>The union had no regular headquarters. General Cheslavsky was its president for eight years. At present the Russian Officers' Union has been captured by the Chicago group of Mladorossy (Young Russians), a monarchistic organization with Fascist tendencies. Since this happened, the Union has been more or less dormant. Its temporary president is Captain Roman Homko. No elections of a regular president have yet taken place.</p>
