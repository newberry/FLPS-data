   <p>The Society of Technical Aid to Soviet Russia in America is one of the most useful and necessary Russian organizations in America.</p>
   <p>The work which is being done by this organization with the purpose of helping Russia is enormous.</p>
   <p>This Society has branches throughout the country. It has tens of thousands of members. It has collected and sent to Russia enormous sums of money, machinery and men. It has organized a great many schools which are doing good work.</p>
   <p>For its useful activities this Society has several times received expressions of gratitude from Russia.</p>
   <p>It is necessary that such a Society enjoy the complete confidence of the Russian Colony.</p>
   <p>In order that this should be so it is necessary that the Society should <span class="page-break">\2</span>regularly inform the Russian Colony about all its (the Society's) activities. The members of the Committees should be elected by the Colony from among persons who enjoy its confidence.</p>
   <p>It is necessary for the Society to give regularly reports to the Colony about all its affairs, the receipts and the expenditure. Complete publicity is necessary.</p>
   <p>The Russian Colony in America has the right to demand that.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Society to do it. It is not an institution belonging to some party. It has not and should not have any secret transactions.</p>
   <p>For a long time the Society has been acting that way. It published regularly reports about its activities, receipts, expenditures, etc.</p>
   <p>But lately these reports have not appeared regularly. What is the reason for that?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>By-the-by, right now there is felt in the Russian Colony a greater need than ever for reports and publicity on these matters.</p>
   <p>Communications have appeared on the pages of some papers intimating that there are some dissensions in the Central Committee of the Society.</p>
   <p>Recently the old Committee of the Society has been deposed and a new one has been put in its place.</p>
   <p>There has been received a telegram from the Council of Labor and Defense confirming the communications and rumors about the disorganization going on in the Society.</p>
   <p>In this telegram which has been published in the Saturday number of our paper it is proposed that the Society should continue its work, but instructions are given about postponing till the month of May, the convention which was planned for the month of March.</p>
   <p>One can see from this telegram that the Central Bureau has sent a telegram to Russia concerning the disorganization which is taking place <span class="page-break">\4</span>in the Society.</p>
   <p>One notices also the fact that the old membership of the Bureau- and Mr. Vilya was among the members,- has been replaced by other persons; and yet the Council of Labor and Defense entrusts Mr. Vilya with the transaction of important business.</p>
   <p>What is the meaning of all that? Why have neither the Central Bureau of the Society, nor the Society in general informed the Russian Colony about these matters?</p>
   <p>Why does not the Society publish in the Russian newspapers clear and definite statements and reports?</p>
   <p>Among other things, why did not the Chicago branch of the Society of Technical Aid to Soviet Russia communicate any of these matters to the public? Why also has this Society not published in our paper any reports for such a long time?</p>
   <p>The Russian American Colony, and the Russian Colony of the city of Chicago in particular, has the right to demand and to expect from this <span class="page-break">\5</span>Society a full account of its activities.</p>
   <p>This organization is being kept up and supported by the Russian Colony; by its labors, cares and means. The Society and its branches must immediately make public all that is happening in them.</p>
   <p>At present the enemies of Soviet Russia - the monarchists, the partisans of Wrangel and other supporters of the old regime- derive benefit from the rumors about the disorganization going on in the Society. They are already carrying on a campaign against the Society, trying to undermine the confidence shown to it by the colony. That is all they want.</p>
   <p>To insure success to the further work of the Society and its branches we demand from them that they make public immediately everything that is going on at present in the Society.</p>
