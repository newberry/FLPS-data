   <p>At this point, the editor of Russkoe Slovo sums up what was done and what still has to be done to bring the case to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

Louis, and Dr. H. R. Krasnow, both of Chicago yet more must be done, $100.00 must be raised" possibly for the complete release of the prisoner, but at any rate for saving him from the gallows.</p>
