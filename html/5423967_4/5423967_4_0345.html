   <p>A concert and ball which proved to be a great success were given on Sunday, April 11th, at the Schoenhofen Hall, by the Russian Society for Aid to Political Prisoners in Russia. In connection with this undertaking there was published in the Rassviet of April 9th an appeal to the Russian colonists. The author of this editorial, entitled "Do Not Forget," explains the necessity of relief to the political prisoners, and quotes the following words of the great Russian poet, A. S. Pushkin, ".... In the deep pits of the Siberian mines, keep proudly patient. Your sorrowful work, thoughts and great aspirations will not be lost in vain. Hope, that true sister in misfortune, will awaken delight and joy even in a dark cave. The moment longed for will come; love and friendliness towards you will arise and will reach you, just as my voice reaches you in your prison holes through the somber bars. The heavy shackles will fall, the prisons will break down, and freedom will joyfully greet you at the gates. And your swords will be returned to you by your brothers."</p>
