   <p>The "Russkiy Vecher-Kontsert" (Russian Evening Concert) , arranged by the Russian Colony of Chicago and held on Sunday, December 4 for the benefit of the United Charities of Chicago, met with great artistic and financial success.</p>
   <p>The broad-minded section of the colony showed its sympathy with the difficult conditions of their suffering, unemployed brothers. It was very pleasant to see the fraternal unity of the Russian people gathered together to aid the unemployed. The Princess Theater, located in the center of the city, was filled long before eight o'clock. All admission tickets were sold and many people could not attend the concert. The audience in return for its participation in this benevolent deed, was offered an excellent program.</p>
   <p>With a deep feeling of sincere gratitude, we can speak of the participation at this charity entertainment of the best representatives of Russian art living in Chicago. Because of their participation, the concert resulted in a celebration of Russian art.</p>
