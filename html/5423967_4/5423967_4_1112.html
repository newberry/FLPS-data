   <p>Even when the people were buying a building for a new independent church of their own, they were still believing not in God alone, but also in good bishops and priests.</p>
   <p>They considered that they had done only what was perfectly right and that they had been very badly treated by the priest, the consul and the bishop. They thought that Rev. Vladimir, Bishop Alexander, and the consul, were good friends; and therefore they decided to appeal directly to the archbishop, Yevdokim, who now belongs to the Living Church and cooperates with the Bolsheviki. The former parishioners of the church of the Holy Trinity wrote a petition and sent it to the archbishop, begging him to give them a good priest for the new church. If I am not mistaken, the archbishop did not answer this petition, nor a second which was sent to him. Meanwhile the people were converting the building which had formerly been used for a German school into a regular Russian Orthodox church.</p>

   <p>In the evenings, after a day of hard work, these lovers of the Orthodox Church would come and work at this new church building without getting any remuneration for this work. Sometimes they would be working there till 10 P. M., or even till midnight. As far as I know, only one or two specialists were doing a regular day's work and were being paid for that. They demolished a ceiling in a two-story house and converted it into a tall one-story building. They scraped and painted the walls; they built a bell-tower, arranged an altar in the approved way, with a partition painted with ikons, and adorned the whole church with holy images. In other words, they ornamented the church as is usual in all Russian Orthodox churches. Only true Orthodox Christian believers can understand with what love and what reverence the "Independents" were building their church.</p>
   <p>When the church building was quite ready they sent again a petition to the archbishop, Yevdokim, begging him to send a priest. This time he gave them the following answer: "Unless you state in the title-deed that I am the owner of the church building, I shall not give you a priest." Apart from this ultimatum, the archbishop gave expression to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>some threats and demanded the acceptance of certain conditions. On the whole, his answer amounted to a proposal that the parishioners should capitulate. The builders of the new church called a meeting, the archbishop's message was read, and after lengthy discussion they came to the conclusion that Yevdokim was in league with the local priest, the consul Volkov and the bishop Alexander.</p>
   <p>"It is not us he wants," said the believers, "he wants our property, the building which we have erected with our hard-earned money and with our own calloused hands.</p>
   <p>"They want to hit our heads again with crosses, to arrest us in our own church, to put us into prison, to make us pay money to the lawyers. We do not need their priests." Thus would speak some persons being revolted by the things the clergy had done: "They are robbers, they want to drink our blood," would shout some others; and some would simply say, "We do not need any church." The more reasonable members of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the Brotherhood succeeded however in persuading the crowd of believers to act wisely, and it was decided to put an advertisement in the Russian newspapers, telling that they wanted to find a priest for a new church in Chicago. For three months, I think, this advertisement appeared on the pages of the Russian newspapers, but nobody answered it. Someone gave to one of the members of the Brotherhood the address of some bishop or priest who was living in Canada, and advised to tell this priest the whole truth about their sufferings, to try to persuade him to accept their offer and to agree to become their priest. A delegate was sent to Canada, but in that case also they were out of luck. The delegate returned without having achieved any result. At that time the position of the "Brothers" was not an enviable one. Much money had been spent for the purchase of the building, for the journey to Canada, for adorning the church; interest had to be paid on loans, and there was no source of income. Some people were so disheartened that they were ready to renounce their undertaking of founding a new church. Some member of the Brotherhood, however, found an archbishop who was independent both of the Roman-Catholic and of the Russian Orthodox missions and who was <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>willing to ordain for a certain amount of money a person elected by the people. This proposal was accepted, and the "Independents" began to look for a good man. And it was not an easy matter to find one. There were not many to choose from. Those who could fulfill the duties of a priest were either afraid of being held responsible by the Russian government or did not trust the people willing to be led by them. At last they found some young fellow from the province of Volyn who was pious, could read well the Slavonic language, but was uneducated and had no experience. At that time he did not even possess a knowledge of the English language and was not acquainted with the American customs. In spite of the many defects of this candidate, the people wanted at all costs to have him ordained so that he would become "the people's priest."</p>
   <p>All these things that I have related came to pass without my participation. At the time when the scandalous things I have been telling about were happening in the old church of the Holy Trinity, I was not acquainted with any of the "Independents." I did not know anything about them also at the time when they were requesting the archbishop to give them a priest <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>and when they were advertising in the newspapers, trying to find a candidate. At that time I was a student in a college situated not far from Chicago and had at the same time to earn my living.</p>
