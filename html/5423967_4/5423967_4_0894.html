   <p>Respected Citizens:</p>
   <p>On February 11, 1937. one hundred years will elapse since the lamented death of our poet-genius, Aleksandr Sergyeevich Pushkin. All Russians, scattered over the entire globe, who love their language and culture, are preparing to celebrate the centenary of the death of our genius, the creator of artistic language, and the unsurpassed poet. In large cities and small towns, all over the world, Russians are uniting in one family to celebrate in a deserving fashion, this significant day.</p>
   <p>It would be quite desirable if all Russians in Chicago as in other centers would <span class="page-break">2</span>forsake their animosity, and in the name of Aleksandr Sergyeevich Pushkin, would unite in one brotherly family, and through united effort of organizations, parishes brotherhoods, all cultural forces such as professors, artists, painters, literary people, representatives of the Russian press, all intellectuals, and all laymen would unite and celebrate this significant and historic day.</p>
   <p>The Pushkin Committee of Chicago, desiring the full cooperation of the entire Russian colony of Chicago and suburbs in this matter, is calling a conference of all Russian organizations of the Chicago district on October 22, 1936, at 8 P. M., at the Russian-American Club, 1902 W. Division Street.</p>
   <p>At this conference the program of the celebration of the centenary of Pushkin's death and other questions in connection with this, will be discussed. The Pushkin Committee of Chicago is requesting you to elect your delegates to this conference.</p>
   <p>With kind greetings,</p>
   <p>J. Erin, president</p>
   <p>N. S. Grib, secretary</p>

   <p>In view of the fact that the Pushkin anniversary is on a week day, the celebration of this anniversary is scheduled for the nearest Sunday, February 14, 1937.</p>
