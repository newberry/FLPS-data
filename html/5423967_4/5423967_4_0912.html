   <p>The United Committee on Arrangements for the celebration of the Day of Russian Culture has received several communications from Chicago, and from cities in other states, to the effect that large groups of Russians in various cities and towns are getting ready to attend the celebration of the Day of Russian culture--a historical and national holiday. The tickets are being sold very rapidly. In Chicago all local organizations participate in the preparations for the festival. All members of the United Committee are working energetically in order to make the celebration an outstanding success.</p>
   <p>The concert part of the program will be made up of the best artistic and literary Russian talent to be found in Chicago. First, we must mention the choir which is under the able leadership of Madame Hgreneva-Slavianskayr; <span class="page-break">\2</span>ballet dances by L. L. Novikov; and Singing by G. Nelidov, an opera artist.</p>
   <p>All this indicates that the day of June 9 in Walsh's Hall will see a tremendous turnout of the Russian people. The Committee, on its part, is taking all necessary steps in order that the day may pass in an orderly fashion; but such measures are not always sufficient. For the preservation of order and necessary decorum, the crowd, itself, should conduct itself in a manner appropriate to the occasion. First of all, it should preserve quiet during the concert part of the program, refrain from smoking in the auditorium, leave the children at home, and remain quiet during the program.</p>
   <p>The celebrants also, should be advised that on this occasion the concert will begin sharply at the time stated in the announcement. All those who come late will regret that they missed an opportunity to hear an excellent concert. The artists participating in the program have their time strictly assigned, and there will be no delays. The Committee, therefore, requests attendants to be in their seats on time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The hope is expressed that the attending public will follow the Committee's instructions closely, to the end that Chicagoans with their guests from other cities may celebrate the national holiday in the proper spirit and in a manner appropriate to the occasion.</p>
   <p>The United Committee.</p>
