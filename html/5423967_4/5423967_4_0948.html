   <p>The question recently advanced about the all-Russian convention [to be held in Chicago] is a very important and timely one. It is important because it will produce, if only partly, that indispensable, common tie of all the wide-scattered and disorganized Russian colonies; it will bring about the cementing of interests which will bring all our human judgments to one common denominator. It is timely because the revaluation of our human ideals, regarded heretofore as sacred, and of our physical and mental achievements, has been effected by itself. Mankind has halted at the crossroads during the crisis ushering in a new epoch, an epoch which demands that we draw up new plans according to our new possibilities. The convention is also timely because, after the enslavement of Russian workers and peasants in Russia by the cruel band of Bolsheviks, we Russian immigrants in America find it necessary to examine our program of activity again, and to investigate closely our relations with the brutal dictators, from the left and from the right.</p>

   <p>The convention is also needed and timely because it will afford an opportunity for the entire Russian colony in America to formulate plans of action, to sum up our future activities and to improve the economic and cultural conditions of our people.</p>
   <p>In spite of all this, there are some who want to delay and, ultimately, bury the convention. In their obscure, empty talks they even go so far as to compare the proposed convention of Russian colonies in America with the conventions of grand princes in Paris. We know that the Bolsheviks are frothing at the mouth about the convention. The convention is their funeral. And here one is inclined to think that all those who oppose the calling of the convention, consciously or subconsciously, are supporting the Communists. But wherever there is much much gab against the convention, it is understood that this talk is not being done subconsciously, but is inspired by the Bolsheviks.</p>
   <p>The convention should be free from party orientations; moreover, the Bolsheviks <span class="page-break">\3</span>should not be admitted, although they will no doubt send their delegates surreptitiously, in order to break up the convention or make its work ineffectual.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to be loud about our nationalism. It is not necessary for cultured people to put their nationalism in the forefront. It will be sufficient if the convention is an all-Russian convention. One may by his convictions be either nationalist or ultrainternationalist, but if he is of Russian origin he can be nothing else but Russian, even if he becomes a subject of Egypt.</p>
   <p>The convention's agenda, in my opinion, should also include the following points:</p>
   <p>(1) Provisions for the financial and cultural betterment of the colony;</p>
   <p>(2) The right approach to the question of bringing up and educating our Russian-American youth;</p>
   <p>(3) The establishment of an official organ for the Russian people;</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>(4) The establishment of a publishing house for publishing works of literary value;</p>
   <p>(5) The organization of a Russian higher institution of learning in America, and the introduction of the Russian language into American public high schools on the same basis as other foreign languages;</p>
   <p>(6) The factors relative to a mutual aid society with consideration for the type of mutual aid society most necessary and convenient for the colony; mutual credit society; and accident or sick benefits, and death benefit insurance;</p>
   <p>(7) The construction of a Russian hospital in the district most densely populated by Russians;</p>
   <p>(8) The old people's home for old members of our colony (a farm or a home);</p>
   <p>(9) Clarifying our relations with the Soviet government in Russia by sending a resolution to all civilized nations in the name of the all-Russian convention; and</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>(10) Our relations with the enslaved and starving people in Russia.</p>
   <p>All the more prominent Russians and Russian public workers should be invited. In the event the all-Russian convention cannot be called because of the widespread unemployment and general poverty, the convention should be limited to Russian progressive organizations which are grouped around Rassviet. For this limited convention the order of business should be changed. The convention of these organizations should consider the following questions: the unification of persons and organizations sharing the same convictions; the establishment of a federation; the formulation of a program for united action; the improvement of the printed organ; the publication of works of literature as monthly supplements to the daily newspaper, or the issuance of Sunday editions; the creation of special funds; and the enlargement of the number of our co-workers.</p>
   <p>Good luck! God speed you with the hope that the Russian colony has not yet died!</p>
