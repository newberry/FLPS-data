   <p>In one of the Bolshevik newspapers of New York there appeared the advertisement of a certain commercial establishment offering for sale red flags and many other Soviet emblems. There had been no such advertisement in the American Bolshevik press before, as there had been no demand for Soviet emblems. Whenever the Bolsheviks or the Socialists were in need of a red flag, they usually went to some dry-goods store, bought several yards of red silk or other red fabric, and had a red flag, since the Red Russian Flag has no eagles, lions, stars or other emblems on its red fabric.</p>
   <p>But now, since the recognition of the Soviets by the United States government, there evidently has appeared a great demand for red flags and other Soviet emblems, and some enterprising commercial house has decided to make a little money selling red flags. But whether American Big Business will make any money by its commercial relations with the Soviets is another story.</p>

   <p>The Red Russian Flag is no longer regarded in this country as a flag of revolution, as heretofore, but as the official flag of a foreign country. From now on we shall see red flags flying on Soviet buildings in this country, on the automobiles of Soviet diplomats, and other places where there is Soviet activity.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that the Red Russian Flag is now officially recognized in America, the Bolsheviks are trying hard, if not to convert to Bolshevism all Russian organizations in America, then, at least, to make them friendly toward the Soviet government and sympathetic with it. They are beginning now to attend the meetings of Russian organizations and to suggest to their members that they send greetings to Moscow, congratulating the Soviet government upon having achieved recognition by the American Government. They also ask that red flags be prominently displayed on the premises of all Russian organizations in America. When asked why the Soviet government should be congratulated, they answer: "Because of its recognition by the United States." They do not understand that, if Russians are so much imbued with the greeting spirit, they should direct their salutations and affabilities not to the Soviets, but to the American Government.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Why? Because the Moscow government has not recognized the United States; the United States has recognized the Moscow regime.</p>
   <p>The suggestion of the Reds that Russian organizations should decorate their quarters with Red flags is causing much disagreement and discord among their members. Some of our people are of the opinion that the Red Flag of Soviet Russia should be acknowledged as our flag, because it is the flag of our fatherland. Others maintain that it should be accepted because it is the symbol of freedom, equality and brotherhood.</p>
   <p>But both groups are wrong. The Red Russian Flag is not the flag of our father-land, because, for us, the doors to this fatherland are closed forever. The Soviet government regards all Russians living abroad as foreigners, and allows them--if they are not open enemies of the Soviets--to visit their former father-land only as tourists. This is why the Red Flag cannot be our national flag.</p>
   <p>One also cannot regard the Red Flag, the flag of the Bolshevik party, as the symbol and emblem of equality and brotherhood. Until the Bolshevik revolution <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the Red Flag really was the flag of all workers, the symbol of freedom and social justice. But after the Bolshevik revolution it became the emblem of blood, terror executions, lawlessness, and hard labor.</p>
   <p>Therefore, there should be no room in Russian organizations for the Red Russian Flag and the Soviet emblems until the Soviet government establishes freedom in Russia, until it permits the Russian people to live their lives according to their own needs and desires, and until the Red Flag ceases to be the symbol of blood and slavery.</p>
