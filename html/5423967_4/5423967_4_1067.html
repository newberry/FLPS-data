   <p>The enormous meat industry on the South Side of Chicago, has encouraged and strengthened the stream of population in this part of the city. Thirty years ago many Russian immigrants from Austria - Hungary settled here and built a Uniate Church on 50th Street and Seeley Avenue. The immigrants from Russia attended The Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Parish, located on the north side of the city.</p>
   <p>It is self understood, that the immigrants from Russia desired to have a church within walking distance. At that time the immigrants from Austria-Hungary, knowing about the case of A. Towr who was converted and who always aimed to return to the "faith of his forefathers," negotiated about building an orthodox parish on the South Side.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of 1909, when the Archbishop platon was serving in the Holy Trinity Church of Chicago, the immigrants from Galicia (from the vicinity of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Przemysl) sent a delegation to His Holiness which consisted of three people, Anthony Rybak, L. Stanko and N. Kutcherepa, to ask the blessing for the opening of a new Orthodox parish on the south side of the city. The Archbishop platon gave them his blessing and encouraged the delegation to begin work immediately.</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1909 a conference was called to which were invited Alexander Nemolowsky (subsequently - Archbishop of North-America), Rev. A. Yanowsky and Rev. P. Kochanik. The conference was a success and a resolution was passed about the opening of a new Orthodox parish and the appointment of a Russian Orthodox priest. The ecclesiarch appointed to the new parish a priest by the name of Michael Pazdry.</p>
   <p>Following the arrival of Pazdry in Chicago the first meeting was held. In view of the importance of the first meeting of the Russian Orthodox people of the South Side of Chicago, we present the minutes of the meeting in detail. On June 6th, 1909, Michael Pazdry arrived in Chicago and conducted the first service in the home of Ivan Gensersky. After the service there <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>was a meeting in Davis Park. At the meeting over 80 people were present. The meeting was opened with a prayer - Ruler of Heaven. After this Mr. Anthony Rybale introduced to the people the situation of Russians in Chicago and the necessity of an organization for the founding of an Orthodox parish.</p>
   <p>The next orator was Michael Pazdry, who made an appeal to forsake the disgraceful Uniates and establish the parish on a truly Orthodox basis.</p>
   <p>It was unanimously decided to begin the founding of the Orthodox parish immediately. The following persons were elected as members of the church committee: Anthony Rybak, president; Anthony Stanko, Secretary; Teodor Kazak, cashier; Leon Stanko, Nicholai Kutcherepa, Wasily Onisik, curators; Ivan Stanko and Maksim Fedinsky, collectors. The meeting ended with a prayer.</p>
   <p>The proceeds were to be dedicated in honor of St. Michael. At this meeting voluntary contributions were asked for the organization of the parish. The following persons gave contributions of $50.00: Anthony Rybak (who has also <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>loaned $100.00) and Leon Stanko.</p>
   <p>Those who gave $25.00 were: Michael Stanko, Dimitri Stanko, Wasily Onisik, Stefan Kutcherepa, Peter Rybak, Nikolai Klintchnik.</p>
   <p>Those who donated $20.00 each were: Nikolai Kutcherepa, Luka Rydziak.</p>
   <p>Ivan Tomashevsky gave $15.00.</p>
   <p>Contributions of $10.00 were given by Anthony D. Stanko, Anthony M. Stanko, Ivan Gensersky, Luba Panaciuk, Andrei Gensersky, Ivan Andrusiak, Ivan Kozak.</p>
   <p>The following have donated $5.00 each: Ivan Stanko, Matthew Miliak, Fuma Murza, Ivan Woytzechowsky, Simeon Uminsky, Michael Pitula, Wasily Pelech.</p>
   <p>The entire collection amounted to $410.00.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Thus the immigrants from Imperial Russia, Galicia and Karpats, have gathered for the first time to recognize their national unity and have laid the Orthodox foundation upon which their lives were molded for a period of 25 years.</p>
   <p>How many earthquakes and storms the new parish had to endure, but the Almighty God has helped and has shielded the faithful!</p>
   <p>Their hearts overflowing with prayer, with tears of gratitude in their eyes, they all, and particularly the youth, read this first mandate; and the names of the founders and contributors are remembered with a prayer of thankfulness.</p>
