   <p>That the overwhelming majority of the Russian people in America are against the recognition of the Soviet government is a commonly known fact. If we discount a handful of the Russian Bolsheviks in this country, constituting less than one-tenth of one per cent of the entire number of Russian-American immigrants, then the whole Russian population in Amerca has received the news of the possibility of the recognition of the Soviets by Washington with a feeling of deep sorrow and indignation.</p>
   <p>It cannot be said, however, that the Russian immigrants have been caught unawares by these tidings. This unpleasant happening they have long foreseen, and now each different stratum of our Russian-American life reacts in its own particular way to the fact soon to be accomplished.</p>
   <p>During the seventh annual convention of the Russian Orthodox youth, which was held in Detroit, Michigan, on September 4 of this year, a resolution was passed protesting against the recognition of the Soviet government. Besides its principal demand, the resolution contained some other interesting points, applicable if and when the recognition should take place, in spite of all the resolutions.</p>
   <p>For instance, the Russian Orthodox youth demands that the Soviet government shall not be allowed to support, either directly or indirectly, Communist propaganda in the United States. In reality, however, this demand is without meaning, because officially the Soviet government always denies support of Communist propaganda in foreign countries. The Soviet officials state that they have no ties with the American Communists. But these are just words, for, in practice, the Soviet regime, secretly, through the government-controlled Comintern is closely associated with the American Communists, and is guiding and subsidizing their activities in this country.</p>
   <p>A second point, dealing with the safeguarding and protection of the wealth of the Russian Orthodox church in America, was included in the resolution with the view of preventing the seizure by the Soviets of Russian church property in America--property not amassed by the Soviets. There have been attempts made by the bolsheviks in this direction in the past, and there is no doubt that they will be made again as soon as greedy Soviet diplomats have made their appearance in this country.</p>
   <p>The third point of the resolution contains the requirement for an unimpeded admission into the U. S. S. R. of all American citizens, especially those of Russian origin who wish to pay a visit to their homeland, upon the condition that such visitors shall refrain from any kind of political activity while there. It is hardly to be expected that the Russian-American communists will object to such pilgrimages, especially since these pilgrims will cause a considerable inflow of American dollars into the Bolshevik treasury.</p>
   <p>The fifth point, dealing with missionary work in the Soviet Union by the Russian-American clergy, certainly will meet with decided opposition on the part of the anti-God Bolsheviks. They might allow the religious propaganda, but only if the clergy acknowledged Lenin and Stalin in place of Christ.</p>
   <p>The most decided and energetic opposition to the recognition of the Soviets is coming from the Ukrainians in this country, since they are better united and better organized than the Russians. In addition to the many meetings of protest held by the Ukrainians against the stifling of the Ukrainian population in Russia through hunger and oppression, the Ukrainian united societies have sent a special delegation to Washington to present a memorandum to President Roosevelt, containing a complete description of conditions in the Soviet Ukraine. This memorandum accuses the Bolshevik government of purposeful and premeditated action in artificially creating hunger conditions in the Ukraine, in order to destroy this peasant population for disobeying the Bolshevik lords. The Ukrainians ask the President to send a special commission to the U. S. S. R., and especially to the Ukraine, to investigate conditions on the spot, and only then to make a decision as to the advisability of formal recognition of the Soviet Union.</p>
