   <p>We risk our life daily, which is dear to us and our relatives, by working in factories. After an unfortunate accident in a factory, frequently the family of the victim, having lost its breadwinner, is placed in a critical <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>condition. With little children on her hands, the poor widow does not know where to lay her head and how to get the means for feeding her children.</p>
   <p>In the majority of cases the victim himself is at fault. He has not protected himself and his family against accident.</p>
   <p>In order not to get into a situation of this kind, hurry to register before it is too late.</p>
   <p>D. Michalchik, President</p>
