   <p>Citizens! The Foreign Section of the third Liberty Loan of the United States government had informed a Russian branch for the sale of this loan. This loan should especially interest us Russians, since from the fight for human freedom which has arisen all that Russia can hope for is the help from the side of the allies. Therefore all we Russians who found refuge in America are obliged to do all we can in contributing to the success of the Third Liberty Loan. For that purpose on Saturday April 6, 1918 at 8 P.M. sharp at Hull House, Polk and Halsted Streets, there will be an organization meeting of the Russian branch, for the working out of the plans of the future work of the loan.</p>
   <p>All must be present.</p>
   <p>Invite your friends and acquaintances. Please not to be late.</p>

   <p>The Russian branch of the Foreign Committee of the Third Liberty Loan of the United States, seventh Finance District.</p>
