   <p>As the secretary of the society 'Russian Center' is getting many inquiries about the aims of this organization, we give below some extracts from the constitution of this society, which was accepted at the organizing meeting of the Russian Center in Chicago, held on April 3, 1925, at the House of Enlightenment, 1080 W. 14th Street.</p>
   <p>Clause 1. The Russian Center of the city of Chicago has for its aim the unification of all Russians of the city of Chicago without distinction of their political sympathies.</p>
   <p>The following things belong to the circle of activities of the center:</p>
   
   <p>(a) Active cultural and educational work among the wide masses of the Russian colony of the city of Chicago.</p>

   <p>(c) An intimate contact in its activities with those Russian-American organizations which pursue aims identical with those of this society.</p>
   <p>Clause 2. The Russian Center, being a non-political organization, decidedly excludes any politics, and does not pursue in this respect any aims having to do either with Russia, or with the United States, or with any other country.</p>
   
   <p>Clause 4. Any person who wants to become a member of the Center presents an application to the committee with a recommendation of one of the members of the society (such application can also be made verbally).</p>
