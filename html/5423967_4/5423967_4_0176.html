   <p>Chicago quack doctors, living on the fear and misery of the simple, are finally forced to accept a fight not for life but for death.</p>
   <p>In response to persistent protests from many readers, exasperated by the dishonest tricks of medical quacks, readers marveling at the complete passivity of the law against the swindlers, The Tribune once more undertook to investigate the matter of quack doctors.</p>
   <p>This investigation went on for six weeks. Three important conclusions may be drawn from the facts gathered: (1) The old gang of charlatans, who had been in temporary hiding four years ago as a result of the Tribune's campaign against them, has reappeared and is again operating as of old. (2) They can no longer poke fun at the impotence of the old laws, because on June 1, 1917, a new law was passed for the <span class="page-break">2</span>practice of medicine. This law can easily deprive the medical charlatans of the right to practice, whereas the old city and criminal ordinances were unable to cope with these gentlemen. (3) The State Health Department, having the full support of the Chief State's Attorney, is prepared to enforce the new law against the medical charlatans.</p>
   <p>The investigations by the Tribune show that many of these quacks are flourishing in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Some of them, known to have been under previous indictments, are now again busily at work at their old tricks.</p>
   <p>Among those interviewed by reporters of the newspaper, we find the following names: Dr. L. G. Burges, 422 South State St.; Dr. Edward N. Flint, 322 South State St.; Dr. F. G. Field, 737 W. Madison St., and others.</p>

   <p>The reporter, who is in perfect health, underwent a preliminary examination by Professors Pennington and Evans, both doctors enjoying a reputation as men of science. In addition, a blood-test was made on the reporter in the National Pathological Laboratory. The reporter was found to be perfectly well.</p>
   <p>As soon as he entered the richly decked out consultation rooms of the quacks, he learned to his surprise that many dangerous maladies were plaguing his wretched body. The facts, gathered by the Tribune will be forwarded to the proper authorities, who will use them for prosecuting the medical charlatans.</p>
   <p>The Department of Registration and Education may, according to the new law, annul one's practice license on nine points. Here are some of them: (2) When the person attempted to secure practice in his profession by fraudulent and untruthful representation. (4) When, by deceptive and untruthful presentation of his profession, the person attempts to obtain money or other objects of value. (5) When the person goes under an assumed name. (6) When the person behaves unprofessionally or unethically.</p>

   <p>F. Shepardson, Director of the Department of Registration and Education, said the following in a letter to the Tribune:</p>
   <p>"I shall be very glad to help as much as possible in any campaign which aims to exterminate in our state the undesirable medical speculators, who prosper on the fear and misery of the simple."</p>
   <p>Tribune.</p>
   <p>The office of Svobodnaya Rossiya asks those of its readers who have had their own experience with the widely self-advertising quacks to supply the editor with all the facts and evidence thereof. It will be forwarded to the proper channels. In this wise, by concerted efforts, we shall be able to rid ourselves of the human leeches, who so insolently bleed the nation.</p>
   <p>In addition, the office of Svobodnaya Rossiya again reminds its readers that all decent physicians are members of the Medical Society of their <span class="page-break">5</span>respective city or town. These societies are closed to quacks.</p>
   <p>Readers who are in need of medical attention may request the editor's office, who will be glad to make official inquiries about the doctor in question and will inform the reader of the results.</p>
   <p>Medical societies have regular committees whose business is to investigate unprofessional and dishonest acts of their members. When a member of a medical society is found guilty he is expelled from the society. Even though these instances are very rare, yet the editor's office mentions them so that the readers may know that there is supervision over those doctors who may wish to hide behind the mask of membership in a medical society, but at the same time following in the footsteps of their worthy brethren, the quack doctors.</p>
   <p>In such instances the editor's office will keep vigil over the interests <span class="page-break">6</span>of its readers, and will help to remove the mask from doctors of that stamp.</p>
   <p>One thing, however, we ask of our readers, and this is that accusations should not be without foundation, by hearsay, but rather supported by facts, by letters, and similar prooof.</p>
