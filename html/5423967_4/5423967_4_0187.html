   <p>The question of our youth has been frequently and amply discussed on the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society's page of Rassviet, because the future of our organization soon will be in the hands of our younger generation. But, while thinking of the future of our organization, we must not forget about its present needs. It would be quite appropriate now to give a thought to our oldsters, the founders and to this day the mainspring of all activities of this large and useful organization.</p>
   <p>The oldsters of our society are still actually far from a decrepit old age, but at the same time they are considerably worn out by their approximately twenty years of hard work in factories and shops. In ten years from now they will need a rest and a more quiet and care-free life. For this reason it is advisable to provide a place, a refuge, where they can live in peace and quiet for the rest of their lives.</p>
   <p>This home should be a Russian home; should be run by Russians and occupied <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by Russians, so that our old people would find themselves in their own familiar atmosphere, and would live in the way they have been accustomed to live all their lives. God save a Russian man, unable to speak well the English language, and being a complete stranger to the American way of life, from spending his last years of life in an American poorhouse. He would be lost there entirely. And yet many members of our Society in the near future will be obliged to look for shelter and refuge to an American poorhouse, if it neglects now to build its own home for the aged.</p>
   <p>The best solution for this problem would be for the Society to acquire a large farm somewhere near Chicago. A Russian man likes farming, and knows how to run a farm. When he is getting older his desire to settle on a farm grows stronger. If such a farm were acquired, it would serve a double purpose. Old Independent (R.I.M.A.S.) members could live on the farm, growing vegetables, tending the orchard and tilling the soil. Younger people, living and working in Chicago, could come over week ends to the farm to buy the farm's products. During summer months the farm would be an ideal vacation spot for many of our <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>members and their children. The children could be left there for a week or two in the care of their grandfathers and grandmothers, while their parents returned to their duties in the city. Thus the children would gain in health, and the old folks would have a chance to talk with them in Russian, acquainting them with their native tongue. Every Independent member living on the farm would experience a sweet and comforting feeling, reminding him of his own village in faraway Russia.</p>
   <p>At the time of the last convention it was decided to select an appropriate farm, and, if possible, to obtain it in exchange for city property. The board of directors has already appointed a special committee for that purpose.</p>
   <p>Slowly, quietly, and with deliberation, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society will without fail accomplish this benevolent undertaking for the well-being of all members of our organization. It is only necessary that every member of our Society should think of it constantly and keep his ears and eyes open for a farm suitable to our purpose which may be conveniently <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>acquired and which will take us back closer to Mother Nature, closer to flowers and the sun.</p>
   <p>Let the befuddled and deluded members of the Russian National Mutual Aid Society (overrun by the Communists) continue to deposit their hard-earned money into the bottomless chest of Novyi Mir, and thus aid men like Deviatkin to grow rich and build beautiful summer villas. Our Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is an organization of brotherly love, mutual aid and self-aid. Members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society may serenely look forward to a secure future, awaiting complacently the day when inevitable old age would otherwise make them helpless.</p>
