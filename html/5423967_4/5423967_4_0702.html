   <p>"For us Russians the most important event of the past two weeks has been the publication of the Russian-American Treaty." The writer then gives in a few words the history of attempts to negotiate such a treaty from 1873 to 1886. "Using the panic of the bourgeoisie which followed the events in Chicago in 1886, Russian officials renewed their underground machinations. Until taken up by the Russians the business remained in embryo. The treaty failed in the Senate. Its further history is already known to our readers. At the present time there is in progress active preparation for a new campaign against the treaty. In New York there has been formed an American "Society for Suppression of the Treaty", in Chicago likewise agitation has arisen. . . . The Russian-American League here opens its activity with a public Russian meeting on Saturday in the hall of the Progressive Club, Santer's Hall, corner Johnson and 14th Sts." (The text of the treaty is appended).</p>
