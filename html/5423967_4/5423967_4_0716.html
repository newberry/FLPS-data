   <p>On Tuesday, January 25, under the chairmanship of I. Piatnitsa, with all the board members present, a regular meeting of the board of directors of R. I. M. A. S. was held. The meeting made decisions on several important matters which were presented to it.</p>
   <p>The financial statement for the entire year of 1934-1935 was presented to the members and read into the record. The figures in the statement tell more eloquently than anything else of the rapid growth of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society and the financial stability which it has acquired in the last few years. From the financial statement it may be seen that for the year under consideration the cash resources of the Society have increased fifteen per-cent. A list of new members who have joined the Society within the year was read into the record and approved without any objections.</p>

   <p>W. Sabinsky, who has made a trip to Westmont, Illinois, declared that in that community it is possible to organize a new branch of R. I. M. A. S. The question of arranging a series of lectures and other problems connected with cultural and educational work the board decided to turn over to the special educational committee, to which are entrusted the decisions on such matters.</p>
   <p>I. [F.] Erin, who was delegated to attend the ceremony of opening the new branch in Kenosha, Wisconsin, reported to the board that there are already twenty-four members in that Branch, and that all these members conduct their activities in close collaboration with the local social workers and city officials. Mr. Erin told the board what impression he had received of the new Branch and its membership.</p>
   <p>P. Yushko called the board's attention to the possibility of organizing in connection with the new Branch a youth club, which could enroll about seventy <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>members. The sisterhood in Kenosha counts in its ranks over two hundred members, and this organization with an intelligent approach to the problem could carry on active cultural and educational work.</p>
   <p>The secretary of Branch Number Two of R. I. M. A. S., Mr. D. Bregin, reported to the board that his organization is arranging an evening of entertainment for May 10. The board decided to help in every way toward the success of this undertaking and requested all other branches not to schedule their own entertainments for this date.</p>
   <p>In mutual help, in brotherly unity, in friendly co-operation are our strength, our future security, and the security of our children in America.</p>
