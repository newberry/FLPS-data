   <p>When observing the life of the Russian Colony one can notice that, after all, our colony is progressing. Let us take for example the Russian Colony of the City of Chicago. (In Chicago and suburbs there are residing about thirty thousand real Russians). We find that only during the last ten years or so our Russian colony has undergone a complete change as regards both its public and private life. Ten years ago our Chicago Russians were all scattered and were living a secluded, isolated life, hardly knowing anything about each other. There were at that time very few Russian organizations. True, there was a socialist branch consisting of seven or eight members, which did not manifest any activity; there was also a Russian orthodox church in which some twenty Russian believers gathered and prayed on Sundays. True, there existed at that time also one noteworthy place where the majority of the Russian colony would gather on Sundays: it was on Jefferson Street. This street with the adjoining by-streets for the distance of several blocks was a regular Jewish-Russian rag-fair, of the type of those second-hand markets which can be seen in the towns of the northwestern part of <span class="page-break">2</span>Russia. Here you can find anything the poor emigrant wants: small retail stores, various kinds of cheap eating places, old clothes' peddlers, taverns, Gipsy fortunetellers, offices of banking and steamship companies, etc; in short everything and everybody, including organ-grinders. In such places the people are all very hospitable. They get hold of your arm and try to drag you to their place. Our Russians used to come to this rag-fair from all parts of the tremendous city, coming often in crowds. Here they felt "at home", because they could get anything by asking for it in their native tongue. Here these credulous simpletons spent their hard earned money, often in a most unintelligent way. Here they were robbed by everybody who was smart enough to do it. By the by, this remarkable "Russian Nook" is still functioning for the benefit of the most backward of our countrymen; only now it is called by another name - that of Maxwell Street. Some eight years ago light began to be shed in the dark corners of our Russian colony. The Russians began to get organized. Educational and cultural organizations appeared on the horizon of the Russian colony. The first to be organized was the Club Znanie (Knowledge), Zarya (Dawn), Prosvyeshchenie (Enlightenment), Russkii Nationalnia Klub (Russian National Club). Soyuz Russkay Molodezhi (Union of Russian Youth) etc. These were all non-partisan organizations intended <span class="page-break">3</span>chiefly for the more intelligent elements of the Russian colony. It must be mentioned that all these organizations, especially the Club Znanie, have done much useful work in the realm of the public life of the Russian colony. At the same time the work being done by the radical circles of the Russian colony became also more lively. Approximately at the same time was organized the Society for Aid to Political Prisoners, and the number of branches of the Socialist party began to increase; a branch of the Union of the Industrial Workers of the World, and some other societies were also organized. In short, the Russian colony had created its progressive front and had begun to move slowly along the path of progress. Even in the ranks of the believers of the Orthodox Church a split has occurred. The conservative elements created their own bloc; and later there was formed a group of dissatisfied elements who seceded from the Leavitt Street Church, organized an Independent Society and built their own church on Wood Street. After a while this society became powerful and has almost entirely defeated the Leavitt Street Church which had been upholding the policy of the Holy Synod.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>These organizations began to arrange lectures on various subjects, entertainments and theatrical performances. The Russians who would attend those lectures and visit the entertainments began to show more interest in the public life of the colony; their mental horizon was broadened and they began to be interested in such questions as: how do people live in other cities or in foreign countries? They showed more interest in the reading of books, newspapers and magazines. Soon Russian newspapers began to be published. The first to appear in Chicago was Russkaya Pochta (sic) which was published by A. I. Pokatilov. In its time this newspaper provided the Russian colony of Chicago with much material for reading; however, because of lack of funds it was liquidated. Its place was taken by the newspaper Svobsdnaya Rossiya. The publisher of this paper was one of the most influential Russian Chicago organizations, the Russian Independent Society (Mutual Aid). This paper appeared until lately, and has done a great deal to help the Russian colony in its progress in the cultural and educational field.</p>
   <p>This newspaper has had to suffer much because of financial difficulties, but owing to the strong support it received from the above mentioned organization <span class="page-break">5</span>it lived through the financial crisis and it exists at the present time.</p>
   <p>Lately this newspaper has been reorganized and is being published now under the title of Russkii Viestnik (Russian Herald).</p>
   <p>The personnel of the administrative body and of the editorial staff of the newspaper has been augmented by new, energetic workers and every day the paper is getting more and more interesting.</p>
   <p>Other Russian publications have also made their appearance in Chicago, namely: the newspaper Russkaya Zhizn and the magazine Domashnii Vrach (The Home Physician); also some publications issued by private individuals which, however, have existed only for a short time. There is also the newspaper Golos Truzhenika (The Voice of the Toiler), [but it is the organ of the Russian branch of the I. W. W. - D. S.), and therefore it is devoted exclusively to the interests of this organization which is financing it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>A great impulse to the public life of the Russian colony was given by the first revolution in Russia in February, whenthe tsarist regime was abolished. After this revolution there came about a great change in the life of the Russian colony of Chicago. Russians began to be intensely interested in all the things which were happening in the world; they opened wide their eyes to observe the changes which life was bringing about. Russian elementary schools, lectures, educational excursions were being organized; the work was going on at full speed.</p>
   <p>The October revolution stirred up all our Russian colony, down to the most secluded nooks and spots. Now it was our radicals who got very busy. They were arranging mass meetings twice or three times every week. These meetings attracted large crowds. The non-partisan organizations now had to give place to the branches of the Socialist party; these non-partisan societies were reorganized; they were amalgamated and joined the radical front. During this period enthusiasm was especially noticeable among the plainest workingmen...Now they get out of their pockets their hard earned dollars and donate them for schools and for the fight against capitalist...</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The gigantic struggle for freedom and justice encouraged us also here on the other shore of the ocean; the uneducated peasants, these rustics, began to feel more free, as if somebody had helped them to shake off the chains which were holding them in thraldom. These peasants began to be interested in schools, they began to buy text books, they went to school in order to learn grammar and many went on with the studies which they had begun when they were still living in tsarist Russia....At this turbulent moment was organized here in Chicago the Russian People's University.</p>
   <p>This University was comparatively well equipped with all that is necessary for such an institution. It possesses a fund of about $10,000. It was financed by Kerensky's ambassador, Bakhmetev, who once had assigned for this University $5,000, and by Russian capitalists, one of whom,Mr. Batolin, had donated to the University $5,000....</p>
   <p>(Note: I questioned Mr. Erin, the author of this article, as to the troubles which had arisen later in the University, and according to his explanations this is what happened: Owing to some politically tactless utterances and actions of <span class="page-break">8</span>the president of the University, Professor Novakovsky, whose views about certain matters differed radically from those of the majority of the other members of the Board of Directors and were not shared also by the students, there arose a dissension which proved to be detrimental for the further existence of the University. D. S. )</p>
   <p>There was a thoroughly competent staff of professors. It should be mentioned that among the teaching personnel were persons holding various political views; some of them were radicals. The number of students was about 150. It is only fair to state that this University, during the period of its existence has done much for improving the educational standard of the Russian colony....</p>
   <p>(When the dissension mentioned in the note had arisen)...the students called a meeting and passed a resolution to quit their studies at the University, and in a few days they no longer attended the lectures. The lecture rooms were empty. After that the heads of the University attempted to persuade the students to return, but these attempts were unsuccessful. Nobody returned, and the administrators had to go home. But the students did not give up their studies; they <span class="page-break">9</span>all joined the Soviet School which had just been organized. They started to work very energetically for this school and to study hard. They brought to the Soviet School some of the more radically minded lecturers of the University. But the work being done by the Soviet School did not last very long: federal service agents began to visit this school and soon the raids, organized all over America in compliance with the orders of Mr. Palmer, the Minister of Justice, started. In the beginning of the year 1920, on some unlucky day, the Soviet School was raided by the police, and seventy persons were arrested. All the students, together with their text books and their teachers were taken to the police station and all had to hear some entirely undeserved punishment. Of course later it was proved that the school was not guilty of any transgression of the law. It was perfectly legal and it was allowed to go on with the studies.</p>
   <p>Having received its "baptism of fire" the Soviet School started to work again with renewed energy. The number of students began to increase so that soon there was not enough room for them. The administration had to look for a larger <span class="page-break">10</span>apartment. Later, the Soviet School occupied the headquarters of the former Russian People's University. Here, in these new headquarters, the work was in full swing. All were busy as ants in an ant hill. Some were fixing electric wires; some were placing tables in the room where mechanical drawing was to be taught; some were putting in place the furniture, arranging the library etc. After some time the Soviet School had at its disposal its own classroom for mechanical drawing, a small laboratory, an automobile workshop with three automobiles; and from the International Harvester Company the School had received as necessary appliances for practical study, mowing machines, self-binders, two tractors etc. The number of students was increasing rapidly, both in classes having to do with general education and in the classes of applied science. There were five classes for arithmetic and for the Russian language; classes of chemistry, physics, agriculture, mechanical drawing, electrical engineering and of the English language. The automobile mechanics' class with <span class="page-break">11</span>about seventy students, was functioning especially well. Some of the students of this class were so enthusiastic that they quit their jobs and were working in the automobile workshop of the school both in the day time and in the evening, and were paying out of their own money an extra fee to the teacher. This class proved in time to be very useful to the students. When the Russian frontier was opened for electrical engineers the work in the Soviet School became quite feverish. All the students and teachers were working without respite. And very soon the good results of this work began to be seen. Professional groups were formed, consisting of mechanics, tailors, agricultural workmen etc. These groups numbered some thirty, forty or fifty men. They were leaving for Russia, taking with them machines, tools and other useful things which were of course badly wanted in Russia. According to the reports which appeared on the pages of the Russian newspapers these groups proved to be very helpful in Russia.</p>
   <p>The Soviet School, while it existed, has also done much for the relief of Russians suffering from famine in the Volga provinces. The school succeeded in unifying all the Russian organizations of Chicago around this undertaking.</p>
   <span class="page-break">12</span>
   <p>A campaign reaching wide circles of the Russian colony, was started, and the result was that over $10,000 in cash was collected, and several carloads of clothes and foodstuffs were donated. Besides the special educational work which the Soviet School has been doing, it also produced a great change in the whole life of the Russian colony of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It has drawn into the common progressive current a great many commonplace, poorly educated Russians who previously had become entirely disappointed in the public life of the Russian colony, but who have now become members of school committees and at the same time students. After the pattern of the Soviet School, has been organized also the so-called "South Side" Russian School, and later the schools on Kedzie Avenue near Douglas Park and on Fullerton Avenue. At present there are six Russian schools in Chicago...</p>
   <p>Hail the Russian schools and the progress of our Russian colony!...</p>
