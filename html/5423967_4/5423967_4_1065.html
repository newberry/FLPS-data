   <p>The under-water stones have been trodden on! Nothing disturbs the tranquil creative church life. All Russian Orthodox people are united: practically all have joined the various Brotherhoods and Sisterhoods. Love and Peace are reigning within the circle of parishioners.</p>
   <p>The most moving and significant fact of all church goers is, that in the midst of all members there was an American-born woman teacher, Miss Shuntlev. Three years ago she accepted Orthodoxy under the name of Zinaida and since has not missed a single Sunday, staying through long services, which were conducted in a language alien to her - carrying out all instructions of the church, lighting candles and making contributions to the church.</p>
   <p>The debts provoke us no more, - already in December of 1923, when the priest of that church was transferred to the Holy Trinity Church, the entire debt amounted to $4,000.000, not a mortgage but in notes and owed to its own members.</p>

   <p>Thus every year saw the church spiritually elevated; this was reported by St. Michael's Church to its 25th jubilee. Two months before the celebration, a general remodeling of the church took place, the church was decorated with ikons!</p>
   <p>And the faithful in gratitude for God's love are contributing for all needs of the church.</p>
   <p>"O, God! Strengthen our church and the orthodox faith, from now and unto eternity."</p>
