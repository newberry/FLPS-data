For this purpose a special committee was elected which is to work out a program for these excursions, invite experienced persons to manage them, and should also communicate beforehand with all the institutions which are to be visited.</p>
   <p>The excursions will be arranged on holidays, so that all interested persons can participate in them. The committee will try to organize these excursions so that they would be useful in two respects.</p>
