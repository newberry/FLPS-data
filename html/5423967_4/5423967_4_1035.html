   <p>The evening of entertainment given by St. George's parish, 917 North Wood Street, last Sunday was an outstanding event and a great financial success. The guests enjoyed the evening as never before. The sponsors of the occasion must have devoted a great deal of attention to preparing the concert part of the program, and they may well take pride in the arrangements for the evening in general.</p>
   <p>The guests very warmly responded to the singing of the Russian folk songs and the religious chorals by the church choir under the direction of Professor P. Zaychenko, the new leader of the choir. In its singing the choir has reached a high degree of perfection, and there is no doubt that under the able leadership of Professor Zaychenko it will soon become one of the first-class singing organizations in the city if not the best. The staging of the gypsy camp was excellently done under the direction of Mr. A. Grishaev and with the participation of pupils from the Bunin children's school.</p>
   
   <p>The high point of the program, however, was reached in the ballet dancing by the students of Mr. A. Andreeff's dance studio. Each appearance of his very able and well-trained dancers evoked enthusiastic applause from the large audience. There were thirty-five students in the ensemble, which displayed the choregraphic art at its best under the talented leadership of Mr. Andreeff himself. The students showed what even little tots can do when they have the chance to study under the direction of a master such as Mr. Andreeff undoubtedly is. In this connection one should mention the fact that the majority of Mr. Andreeff's students are children and young people of Lithuanian extraction, and it should seem that members of other nationalities value the versatile talents of our compatriot much more than we Russians do.</p>
   <p>In the role of master of ceremonies Mr. G. Chepelevich demonstrated great ability.</p>
