   <p>Three years ago in Chicago, two Russians dramatic actors, E. Less, and L. Luganov-Kopelevich, husband and wife, appeared on the American stage. Both were longing to retarn to Russia, thinking that only there they could live as human beings and be of service to the people and to Russian art. Finally, both of them became homesick and several months ago, leaving the "American Paradise," they went to U. S. S. R. They were overjoyed when thinking how much better they would feel there.</p>
   <p>Recently from an item in the Russian newspaper Russky Golos (Russian Voice), we learned that E. Less and L. I. Kopelevich-Luganov returned to America. We welcome them heartily.</p>
