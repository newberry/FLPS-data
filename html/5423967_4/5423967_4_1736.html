   <p>Greetings to you, 'City of Gigantic shoulders, Nations' loader, flesher of the world'. To you, Blue Lake Michigan, to you - resplendent parks of the city of Chicago, of museums, libraries, spacious streets, and of grey, massive capacious structures.</p>
   <p>Greetings to you, - dear monuments of Goethe, and of Lincoln; to softly, speeding tram-cars; air-lines, and tranquil, unperturbed multitudes of the street; and to you, halting, Russian colony, - and to you, dear, dear friends....</p>
   <p>My greetings to you I send from turbulent, ever-agitated New York. I turned disloyal to you for a while, and have forgotten you temporarily.</p>
   <p>I became infatuated with the feverish, nervous bustle of this city's street crowd; what a light and luring step hers is. I am lured by myriads of bright-sparkling evening fires; by tops of giant sky-scrapers; by monstrous bridges of legendary enormity; by inviting buildings, monuments; and by the singular music of this city, which is stirring, soothing, joyous, and wistful. I am carried away here by contrasts that are heart-rending, and soul-prostrating; mad, luxury living, side-by-side with destitution in this amazing city; congestion with spaciousness; matchless lustre with dusk from indigence; joyous smiles, with a depressing sleekness; elegance, with vulgarity.</p>
   <p>And I am carried away by certain spots so reminiscent of Europe...</p>
   <p>At no time in your capaciousness, Chicago, have the shadows of Europe appeared so artistic and so bright.</p>
   <p>Here, in this life-seething, nerve-quivering, giant city, I ramble for hours in the streets to look at buildings, show windows, monuments; the ease of the speeding crowds, all so reminiscent of Paris, London and Stockholm.</p>
   <p>At moments I feel drawn to your vastness, to your parks, your flower-beds, and your exquisite beaches of Lake and Sea Michigan, your streets abounding with trees. I simply long for you, as the city which became my own.</p>
   <p>Here, it is at times stifling, crowded. The streets are narrow, the houses are of many stories. It is sad to see pale-faced tots playing on the side-walks of narrow business streets... It is depressing to meet everywhere, faces exhausted from work and worry.</p>
   <p>But then, there is more music here, and the masses are more sensitive, closer, more books, theatres, museums, paintings. And more of a throbbing, seething life. Then, swing is broader, broader and deeper are the people's demands on life in this city. There is more searching here for the ways of life, a greater avidity for life; there is more reflecting and a tragic-joyous, insight here. A more bold and audacious city, and a brighter struggle for the luminous and the beautiful.</p>
   <p>Ah, what an amazing, alluring, and agonizing city this is. A city in which people are grains of sand. A city of infernally hot and madly speeding subways. A city, whose workingmen, fight tragically for a better life for all, and whose bankers are in control almost of the entire world. A city of artists and of store-keepers. Of palatial homes and sardine-packed, barrack-like tenements. A city of the world's dreamers, and a center of most shameless corruption and exploitation. A city avidly hearing Chaliapin, and roaring with beastly hilarity and baseness at boxing-tussels. A city of pale-looking children and red-cheeked, plump, trades-women. A city with the statue of Liberty and 'an Island of Tears' in it. A city, which is a most hospitable asylum for all, who are persecuted, yet also of intrigues and of cruelty.</p>
   <p>On the day when my infatuation with this city will end, and I shall tire of her beauty and her ugliness, of her allurements and her repulsiveness, take me then, take me back to you, Chicago, city mine.</p>
   <p>Signed-</p>
   <p>Alexander Zemetchinsky.</p>
