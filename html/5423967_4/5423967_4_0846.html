   <p>Every year "Narodniki-Nezavisimtsi" (The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society), arranges a Christmas tree for the children of their school. The Christmas tree of this Society is a traditional one. If they failed to organize such an event, the holiday of the Nativity of our Lord would appear somehow imperfect, because in this celebration, the children's gayety would be absent.</p>
   <p>We, the adults, for any pretext are apt to arrange an entertainment at any time. But what do we do for the sake of our children? To the children the Christmas tree is their holiday, it is their pleasure and joy. Also the adults recall their own childhood, their native land, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas tree at home, and the long ago joy, and thus relive the event with their children. Do you think that some of us will go back to our native land? Do you hope to celebrate this particularly solemn holiday of the Nativity of our Lord over there again?</p>

   <p>Maybe it would be possible to visit our homes in Russia; perhaps it would be possible to arrange a Christmas tree over there. But could we be children again? No, never! That is impossible.</p>
   <p>This being the case, let us hurry and accept the invitation of the Society to attend their Christmas tree celebration. And there, seeing the joy of the children we can recollect our own past childhood, and thus enjoy this party just as well.</p>
   <p>There will be a very good program of entertainment. Those who will participate will be the clown C. Arrigoni, acrobats from downtown, the violin soloist, N. Arrigoni, the choir of the Independent Church under the direction of V. Shumkoff, a gipsy group, recitations by the pupils of the Independent School, the balalaika orchestra of the Douglas Park School under the direction of A. D. Dobrohotoff, gipsy romances, sung by L. A. Slavina, and a speech of welcome by the very Rev. I. Zeltonoga, the Prior of St. <span class="page-break">3</span>George's Church.</p>
   <p>There will be appetizing refreshments for all. Dance until late at night with a first-class orchestra which will play Russian, Polish and American dances.</p>
   <p>The Christmas tree celebration will be held at the Polish Hall, 984-86 Milwaukee Avenue at Augusta Boulevard, beginning at 4 o'clock. The entire proceeds [of the affair] will go for the improvement of the school.</p>
