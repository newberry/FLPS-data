   <p>Our dear brothers:--</p>
   <p>Soon 15 years will elapse since the members of the parish of the Leavitt Street Church have been robbed of the church property. At the time when this happened we at present members of the parish of St. George, were also members of the parish of the Holy Trinity, and, seeing that the clergy was oppressing and cheating the parishioners, we arose to defend the interests of the parish. But what could we do?--we who were poor, without means and support.</p>
   <p>We were beaten, many of us were arrested; so we left the parish and founded a new one, and now We live and pray freely and feel happy. We were accused of various misdeeds, our enemies threw mud at us were threatened with severe puishments. But we suffered it all and went on praying in our poor <span class="page-break">\2</span>little Church of St. George, waiting for the people of the Leavitt Street parish to understand whom they were following and to join us. And the people were coming.</p>
   <p>They called us atheists, Jews, etc. But the people did not believe that-- They visited our church services, and when going out of our church would say: "Well, our priests have told us that here, at Wood Street, they were building up a new Jewish confession; but we see that these people have the same divine service, according to the Orthodox rite, as we do; and, what is more, from their preacher one can learn more truth than from ours. So we see that our archbishops have been lying to us." And members of your parish would come to us and stay with us. In the beginning only one or two hundred of us seceded from the Holy Trinity parish; but now we have in our organization over 3000 regular members. Whereas in the Leavitt Street parish, now as before, the number of members does not increase; on the contrary, it steadily decreases.</p>
   <p>"The bishops have deceived the people and have contrived to get documents <span class="page-break">\3</span>making them the clergy the owners of the church and property. They have promised to give the parishioners heaps of benefits, but instead of that they just wiped their noses. The people at Leavitt Street are ill-treated, insulted, cheated, robbed of their last cents, and all they get for that are such names as "scoundrels" and "heretics."</p>
   <p>"Good people, our brothers as to religious beliefs and blood, fellow-countrymen, some of whom even come from the same villages as ourselves, you have been remaining long enough under the despotic rule of evil-doers who have only being reviling you....Have they not robbed you of enough of your money, pretending that this money was needed for repairing the church, while in reality they have either been sending the collected money to New York, to the bishops, or leaving it in their own pockets.....Do not regard us any longer as your enemies. We are not enemies at all. We are, just like you, hard working people. Join us. Our small church, our school, our lot, everything we possess is at your disposal.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"We are not taxed as heavily as you are. You pay ten or more dollars a year, and once you paid even more than $35.00. Our members pay only $3.00 a year."</p>
   <p>(It is explained further in the letter that the Wood Street Society has enough money to give relief to those in need of it and that it has no debts; that the parishioners know exactly how the money is spent, and that the priests has nothing to do with the financial affairs of the Society. The members of the Wood Street parish, further say, that they are ready to show the ledgers and other books of the Society to the parishioners of the Leavitt Street church so that these could persuade themselves that there is no risk in joining their Society.)</p>
   <p>"If you, our brothers from Leavitt Street, will follow our advice and join us, we could achieve great things in Chicago. We could immediately build an orphanage and an asylum for the old people, a People's House and at least a Russian public school, so that our children would get as good education as those of other nationalities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"Do not hesitate, do not wait till your priest starts to knock you on the head with his cross in the church and to put some of you into jail for defending your own property, as has been done to us. Do not hope that the bishops will be lenient towards you and will return to you all your property, they will, rather, mortgage it, and you will lose it entirely. Look how the bishops have shaken both morally and materially our mission. It is perishing.....Visit our church and listen to the service and to the preaching of our priest. You shall see, that the service is the same as in your church. We have remained true Christian believers, keeping the faith of our fathers in our hearts. We are falsely accused of having introduced all kinds of innovations, but this is done in order that the people would not visit our church. But remembers that the pharisies accused and killed even the Christ. And He, of course, had not done anything wrong. Our priest does not try to prejudice us against the members of the Leavitt Street parish, while your priests advise you to drive us away with a broom if we try to approach you. But what is the use of writing to you about all these things? We think that by this time you know yourselves whereto your false shepherds are leading you.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"We, members of the parish of St. George, appeal to you, enjoining you to unite with us in brotherly communion and in that love of God which is the testament left to us by the Christ.</p>
   <p>With fraternal greetings</p>
   <p>"The Independents."</p>
