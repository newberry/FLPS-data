   <p>Rev. Sneghirev gave me the following additional information:</p>
   <p>1) As to the number of parishioners of the Holy Trinity Cathedral: in the beginning, i. e. in the years 1892-1893, there were 50 families belonging to the parish (the number of persons could not be ascertained). Among the parishioners were a few Serbs and other non-Russian Slavs.</p>
   <p>2) The income of the church during the years 1892-1894 did not exceed $500 a year. The clergy was remunerated not out of this income, but out of the funds of the Mission.</p>
