   <p>Leaders of a great many Russian organizations in America have, for many years, been carrying on an intense propaganda campaign in favor of uniting the Russian colony. All of them quite justifiably declare that the Russian colony does not constitute a social force because it is not organized and united into one fraternal family. This, of course, is true. Without unity and organization nothing can be accomplished. Any large and important undertaking can be carried through by united effort. If the people, however, continue to abide by the rule of each person for himself alone, each person to take care of only his own interests, nothing of a social nature can be created.</p>
   <p>Why doesn't the Russian colony respond to the appeals of the most active members of its organizations and its leaders? Why do we often note that it trails after other nationalities and does not grow into an influential social force?</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Considerable blame can be attached to the leaders of the Russian organizations themselves because they set a bad example to the colony. They call upon the Russian colony to unite, but they themselves never unite.</p>
   <p>In large cities there are usually several Russian organizations. In the largest cities, there are always many organizations, and each one leads an entirely independent life. Leaders of each organization always call upon the people to join only their own organization, they praise only their own organization; they never try to unite the organizations that already exist, and thereby perform a service to those members of the Russian colony who do not belong to any organization.</p>
   <p>As a result, the unorganized element within the Russian colony mistrusts all the appeals of the active members of organizations and considers such appeals insincere or hypocritical. Let us take, for example, one particular case. For several years, conversations have been in progress concerning the necessity of uniting all the larger Russian societies of mutual aid, but these talks have thus <span class="page-break">3</span>far been unproductive. Why hasn't ROOV [Russian Consolidated Mutal Aid Society] amalgamated with RNOV [Russian Peoples' Mutual Aid Society]? The reason is obvious. The first-mentioned society is interested in cultural work and mutual aid to the members, whereas the second organization is more interested in politics than in anything else. And if these two organizations have no common aim, they cannot have a common language.</p>
   <p>But why couldn't ROOV and RNzOV [Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society] unite and merge their interests, since both organizations pursue the same aims? This is not so easy to understand. When delegates of RNzOV, at their convention, adopted a resolution against amalgamation with ROOV, many Russians read the decision with certain misgivings. Why, they thought, the leaders of these societies always talk of uniting the whole Russian colony, and then they cannot even come together themselves.</p>
   <p>For this reason, the leaders of Russian organizations should do everything in their power to unite at least the many weak organizations already in existence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>If some of the organizations pursue different aims from others, it is necessary to establish between such organizations some form of co-operation so that they can at least work hand in hand in the cultural field, without interfering with one another, such as is the case now when several organizations hold their entertainments on the same date.</p>
   <p>If the existing organizations set an example of unity and organized activity, then their appeals will be answered by the unorganized members of the colony. This cannot be seen at present. Sometimes just the contrary occurs. For instance, those members of RNOV who disagree with the policies of its present Bolshevik leaders want to form an entirely new society, instead of joining one of the existing mutual aid organizations. If such tendencies continue among members of the Russian colony in Chicago and other cities, the colony as a whole will, in all probability, never be united and will never act as an organized unit.</p>
