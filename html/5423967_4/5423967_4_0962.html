   <p>In today's edition of Rassviet (The Dawn), there are two articles which touch upon a very important question, the question of the all-Russian national convention. The authors of these articles, I. Zheltonoga, and G. Souhkodol, live in different cities, but they both have brought up the same subject at the same time, as though they had a mutual understanding. This indicates that the question of the all-Russian convention is attracting the attention, not only of the authors of these articles, but of many prominent men, workers, and above all, Russian organizations, as well. They have been talking, for a long time, of the need of uniting all the Russian groups into one large fraternal family. Up until now, however, no one had thought of discussing this question in the press.</p>
   <p>The authors approach the subject from different points of view. Each of them, in his own way, explains the necessity of calling an all-Russian convention. The first writer approaches the question from the political point of view, the second, from the economic. Mr. Zheltonoga thinks that the all-Russian <span class="page-break">2</span>convention should be called to unite all the Russian groups, in order to coordinate all the activities which have for their goal, the liberation of Russia. Mr. Souhkodol proposes that the convention should be called for the purpose of discussing ways and means to improve our economic, legal and cultural situation in America.</p>
   <p>At first glance, it may appear that these two points of view deal with two different problems. In reality, however, both authors touch upon one and the same question--the question of defending Russian interests in Russia, as well as in the United States.</p>
   <p>We also think that the all-Russian convention appears to be a most important and timely problem, the consideration and solution of which should be undertaken at once by all the Russian organizations, as well as prominent civic workers.</p>
   <p>The Russian colony is now facing a whole complex of very important questions, which can be solved only by an all-Russian convention. The more important <span class="page-break">3</span>questions have been specifically noted in the articles of both writers.</p>
   <p>The fate of Russia is very dear to every Russian immigrant, and, therefore, it is to be expected that only the all-Russian convention will be able to find a successful way of co-operating in the task of liberating Russia from the bloody, Bolshevik dictatorship. It is also true that only at this convention, will the way be found to improve the economic and legal conditions among the Russians in America. This all-Russian convention can also decide the question of uniting all the Russians in America into one great brotherly union. Unless we have such a convention, it will be impossible to resolve any of the questions raised by the authors of these articles.</p>
   <p>To many persons it may appear that an attempt to consider and solve all of these vital questions, at the convention, will only cause quarrels and dissension. As a result, sharper conflicts would develop among the ranks of the colonists, instead of closer unity. I do not think, however, that this will happen, because we are all conscious of our common interest in our common welfare, in spite of our different political convictions and religious <span class="page-break">4</span>beliefs. This is proved by the successful existence of such large Russian organizations as the Russian Mutual Aid Society and the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, where, united by their feeling for the common good, the believers and nonbelievers, the socialists, the communists, the anarchists, the democrats, and those belonging to no party at all, work together in complete accord. If this is so, then we can unite for common action on a broad scale, in the interest of all the Russian immigrants in America.</p>
   <p>The struggle against the bloody Bolshevik dictatorship in Russia and the struggle for the improvement of our economic situation in America do not contradict, but rather, complement each other.</p>
   <p>All the Russian organizations (excluding the Bolshevik ones), and all prominent civic workers, not only those from the United States, but those from Canada as well, should participate in this convention.</p>
   <p>When we speak of the Russian organizations, we have in mind not only the <span class="page-break">5</span>large political and mutual aid organizations, but the small cultural and educational societies, and various clubs, as well. Indispensable also is the attendance of the Dukhobor organizations, religious societies and youth organizations. Only then will the convention be an all-Russian convention. And it will know how to solve the problems that confront us.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, the convention should be called in the fall. The best location for the convention appears to be Chicago, because geographically, it is situated in the center of the United States. What is more, the Century of Progress Exposition is being held in Chicago at the present time, and a good many Russians will certainly want to visit it. Therefore, the convention can be called in Chicago in the fall, without any difficulty.</p>
   <p>When the Russian organizations and prominent individuals have agreed that such a convention should be called, then, soon afterward, the organizing committee can be chosen by various Russian organizations in Chicago. Its responsibility will be to inaugurate the work, preparatory to calling the <span class="page-break">6</span>convention.</p>
   <p>We hope that the Russian colony will understand the importance of this question, and will answer this call without delay.</p>
