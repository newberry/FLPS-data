   <p>Dr. Nedzel was born in the large village Lubomirka, in the province of Kherson (Ukraine), in 1888. He received his education partly in St. Petersburg, where he studied at the Voznesenskaya High School. But he was not graduated from this school, as in 1905, being involved in political troubles which stirred up all the Russian young people, he was discharged from the school together with several of his fellow students. Being eager to complete his education, he went abroad, to Germany, and in Dresden joined the Polytechnikum, where he studied two years. He then returned to Russia, to Odessa, passed his high school examinations and joined the Novorossiysky University in Odessa, where he studied medicine. He graduated in 1913 and, as one of the most proficient students, was allowed to remain connected with the university in order to go on with his studies, preparing himself for professorship.</p>
