   <p>The first head and organizer of the parish was Michael Pazdry who took his position June 6. It is to be regretted that Pazdry later betrayed Orthodoxy and went over the uniates. This vacancy was filled by Sergei Vasilievich, but as was stated above, the betrayal of Pazdry created a commotion in the parish and C. Vasilievich had no opportunity to be a pastor. The church was closed. In 1912 with the appointment of John Grazione, services were renewed. John Grazione remained in the parish for seven months. After he left the church again was closed for lack of funds.</p>
   <p>On March 7, 1913, the writer of this book was appointed as head of the church. Twenty years have passed and the modesty of a writer does not permit me to enumerate all labors and sacrifices which the service to God and the Orthodox faith demanded.</p>
