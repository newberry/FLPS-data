   <p>We receive many letters from our people asking us to explain what the results will be of the recognition of the Soviet government by the United States--how the recognition will affect the economic life in this country. Will the situation of the Russians living in America change with the establishment of Soviet consulates in the principal cities of the United States? Does any danger threaten those Russians in America who are of anti-Bolshevik convictions? Will the Soviet money be acceptable in the United States? Will it be possible now for the Russians living in America to visit their homeland?We can answer all these questions in a few words. All will remain as before. The recognition of the Soviet government by the United States will not bring any changes either in the life of the Russian people in Russia or in the life of the Russian group in America. Over there, and here, everything will remain exactly the same as before the recognition.</p>

   <p>The new Soviet envoy, Mr. Troyanovsky, is already in Washington, but his appearance in the American capital has produced neither joy nor sorrow among the people of this country. This is explained by the fact that the former supporters of recognition now understand that by the establishment of diplomatic relations with the U. S. S. R. the United States will not derive any material gains whatever. Those who opposed the recognition are now satisfied that, according to the declarations of both Litvinov and Troyanovsky, it is plain now that the Bolsheviks have buried their mad dreams of the "world communist revolution," and have become better friends of the capitalists.</p>
   <p>When the Soviet consulates open in various American cities, their officials, like those in the Soviet embassy in Washington, will write piles of official papers and reports, will confer with bankers and businessmen about loans and trade relations, but all these will not change the existing conditions either here or in Russia. The Russian masses will not gain anything by the recognition, as it will not give them badly-needed bread or political freedom.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The present situation in America also will not be much influenced by the recognition of the Soviets. Even if we assume that the present export of American goods to Russia will increase somewhat, this increase will be of but very slight importance to American industry as a whole.</p>
   <p>The recognition is not going to bring any changes in the life of the Russian colony in America, contrary to many expectations and fears. It is true that some ignorant Bolsheviks here think that, with the official recognition of the U. S. S. R., their importance here in America will increase, and consequently all the anti-Bolshevik activities in America will be promptly liquidated. They evidently do not know or understand the fact that in America there exists freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly. A violation of any of these privileges would be a violation of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
   <p>It is true that the newspapers had widely discussed the possibility of wholesale deportations to the U. S. S. R. of all those Russians who entered here illegally, <span class="page-break">4</span>including the anti-Bolsheviks, but later it was explained by Washington that those persons who might be faced with persecution after they got back to Russia would not be deported.</p>
   <p>The recognition will prove to be to the disadvantage of the American Communists. The deportation of the Reds to the U. S. S. R. has already begun. Naturally, the Bolsheviks do not like it and are calling meetings to protest against the deportations. But it is unlikely that the United States Government will pay any attention to these protests, as it is well aware of the fact that the deported Bolsheviks are not in any danger of being persecuted by the Soviet government.</p>
   <p>The recognition of the U. S. S. R. by the United States will also have a decided influence upon the Communist press in this country. It can already be noticed that some of the American Communist newspapers have lost much of their revolutionary spirit and have become inoffensive, semicapitalist, yellow sheets. It is to be expected that, as time goes by, these sheets will become still more <span class="page-break">5</span>yellow, avoiding Communist propaganda in order to prevent any possible friction and misunderstanding between the Red Kremlin and the White House.</p>
   <p>Nothing else can be expected of this recognition.</p>
