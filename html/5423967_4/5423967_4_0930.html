   <p>The ninth annual convention of the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society opens tomorrow. The convention must solve some mighty weighty problems, and must find answers to some important questions which directly influence the life and well-being of the organization.</p>
   <p>The life and affairs of any large Russian organization in America are being watched with great interest by hundreds of thousands of Russian people in this country. The quarrels and enmities so frequent between Russian organizations not only confuse the members of the organizations, but also demoralize the entire Russian public, especially the unorganized part of it; the unorganized part, by the way, is far greater than the organized part of the Russian group. The unorganized Russians are little acquainted with the Russian organizations and with their internal affairs, therefore are easily swayed by any unfriendly, malicious propaganda, and they are confused by the internal squabbles ceaselessly going on within almost every Russian organization in this country.</p>

   <p>The opening convention of the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society should devote much time and thought to the devising of means and methods to enhance public confidence in Russian organizations on the one hand, and to bring more dignity and order within Russian organizations on the other. If the organization as a whole, with every one of its many branches, first adopts and puts into practice the harmony, friendliness and the brotherhood which should flourish in the life of the entire Russian group in this country, then its future will be assured and its growth will be fast and steady. It is necessary, however, for the leaders of the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society, as well as for the leaders of all its branches, always to keep in mind the interests and benefits of their organization first and foremost, and to the absolute exclusion of all personal gain or other considerations.</p>
   <p>The Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society, as well as other Russian organizations in this country, still has great opportunities for much useful work among those Russian immigrants who are not yet members of Russian organizations. There are many cities, and even states, having Russian population where there is not a single <span class="page-break">\3</span>Russian organization or society, or even a branch of any Russian organization. The convention should also give thorough consideration to the problem of our youth. The proper organization of our young people within the framework of Russian-American life and activities is of paramount importance to the future of our organizations. If our sons and daughters are not interested in the work of their fathers, the convention should make an effort to find ways to remedy the situation. The acquiring of a farm property for the use of the organization in another important problem the convention must solve. If the convention decides to buy a farm, this decision should receive spontaneous support and financial backing from every member of the organization.</p>
   <p>The delegates to the convention should not hurry their deliberations, or hastily arrive at decisions. During the sessions, the delegates should always keep in mind the welfare and continued growth of their society.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we express our sincere wishes of success to the ninth annual convention of the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society in solving its many problems and in laying a new foundation for the greater growth and development of the organization.</p>
