   <p>This article confirms the facts as stated in the article of February 2, 1916. The writer tells of a second meeting held January 30, a continuation of the meeting held on January 23, at which it was revealed that the treasurer was elected irregularly, and the opposition succeeded in forcing a re-election. The possibilities of losing their treasurer so disheartened the other officers that they resigned. As a result an entirely new staff of officers was elected at this meeting. The new officers immediately made the society a progressive organization. "Accordingly, the Program Committee was instructed to arrange lectures, literary evenings, etc. Another committee was installed to collect funds for war victims refugees ... all of which has always been the intention of this society, so that when A. Awikovich made this motion everybody responded warmly."</p>
   
   <p>In conclusion, the members of the R. A. S. are warned to be alert, active, vigilant, lest the reactionaries catch them napping, and again pull off their sinister tricks. Through their frame-ups the most active workers of the organizations were expelled, every progressive was persecuted.</p>
