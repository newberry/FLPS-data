   <p>I cannot pass over in silence the article written by P. Zaychenko and published in the Rassviet of January 30.</p>
   <p>This well-written article in defense of priesthood cannot be substantiated by facts, however, for in our times in America it is difficult to find a priest of the type portrayed by the author in his article.</p>
   <p>It is true that there are priests in America noble in character and honorable in conduct, but there are many who resemble mileposts: they show the way to others, but they do not follow it themselves. They preach to the people the Gospel in which meekness, humility, and love toward one's neighbor are set forth as cardinal virtues, but they love only themselves and nobody else. To the devout they promise the Kingdom of Heaven in the World beyond, but they themselves <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>care only for earthly things and leave estates of fifty thousand dollars. [Translator's note: Reference is made to the death of Archbishop Platon in New York, who, it was rumored, left an estate of which the value was estimated at $50,000.]</p>
   <p>Such priests cause misery not only to their fellow priests who have noble hearts but to the other Christians as well. They do what religious precepts forbid doing. The Gospel teaches: "Love your enemies and pray for them; judge not, that ye be not judged."</p>
   <p>Mr. Zaychenko attempts to convince all Christians that they should turn their backs on atheists and not pay attention to them or act toward them as Father Kapanaze acted in New York. These recommendations suggest to me that the author is not the kind of religious man that a true Christian should be.</p>
