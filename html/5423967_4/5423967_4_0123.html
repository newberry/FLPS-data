   <p>On the pages of the daily Russian Herald there appear often, articles about this or that Russian organization and it is pointed out that a certain organization has done by its activities, a great deal of good to the Russian colony of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>I do not intend to criticize our Russian organizations, because I understand that every good undertaking should be welcomed by our workmen's colony.</p>
   <p>But, unfortunately, our really useful organizations do not get much encouragement; more often they are regarded with distrust.</p>
   <p>Yet every conscious Russian worker should get thorough first hand information about the various societies and decide which of them has contributed most to the welfare of our Chicago colony.</p>
   <p>In looking over all our Chicago organizations, one after another, from small circles, numbering only a few members, to the oldest and largest organization, the "Russian People's Independent Society", (Note: the author means the organization known at present under the name of "Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society", D.S.), I have come to the conclusion that this large organization, the Russian People's Independent Society (in Russian R.N.N. O-vo, meaning "Russkoye Narodnoye Nezavisimoye Obshchestvo." has done a great deal of good to our poor Chicago colony, consisting chiefly of workmen. Thanks to the Russian People's Independent Society, many widows and orphans have been saved from hunger and extreme poverty, and relief has been given to persons who were not even members of this Society. And there is a large number of such luckless workmen among the Russians living in Chicago and suburbs. Every year the Russian People's Independent Society spends over $5,000 for the rescue of such people, which does not include the money which is given out in benefits to sick members and non-members by the branches or brotherhoods of this Society.</p>
   <p>The Russian People's Independent Society takes care not only of those workmen who have been afflicted by some misfortune or calamity, but is useful to the whole Russian colony of Chicago and suburbs.</p>
   
   <p>I am sure that, if it were not for the Russian People's Independent Society, even now the Russian colony would not have a daily Russian newspaper. No other Russian organization has been as interested in creating a Russian newspaper in Chicago as the Russian People's Independent Society. In spite of the fact that most of the members of this Society were poorly educated, thanks to these half-educated people the Russian colony obtained the daily Russian progressive newspaper Free Russia, (Svobodnaya Rossiya) and the present newspaper Russian Herald, (Russkii Viestnik) which defends the interests of the toiling masses.</p>
   <p>Our Russian colony has received much information through this newspaper and has gained much valuable knowledge.</p>
   <p>But the Russian People's Independent Society has not achieved its purpose yet; many efforts and much money will have to be spent in order to reach that goal and to put the Russian colony on the same level which has been reached by other nationalities.</p>
   <p>There is, as yet, no Russian House of the People in Chicago, no Russian orphanage, and it is necessary for our colony to,possess such institutions.</p>
   <p>And the Society is preparing itself for these difficult undertakings, in order to achieve that which is needed and to enable the Russian colony to obtain the same standing which has been attained by the other nationalities. We, Russian workmen, must help the Society in this useful work. Every Russian workman should join the Russian People's Independent Society in order to be able to insure himself, his wife and his children against accidents and calamities which often befall Russian workmen who are earning their living in factories and workshops where they are doing dangerous work. Conditions there are such, that a man is always in danger of being hurt or even killed.</p>
   <p>Remember, that it is necessary for us to join such an organization as the Russian People's Independent Society which is diligently taking care of its members, just like a mother takes care of her children.</p>
