   <p>Almost every year bills are introduced in Congress directed against foreigners. In most cases the purpose of such proposals is to limit the rights of foreigners, and they contain provisions for such things as compulsory registration, deportation of undesirable foreigners, the removal of aliens from certain kinds of employment, depriving them of the right to seek and receive public aid, etc.</p>
   <p>The anti-foreign sentiment has grown particularly during the depression. Some Congressmen now assign to foreigners all the blame for the misfortunes which grip this country: for unemployment, for the increase in crime, for the spread of strikes, and for other undesirable aspects of American life. Several Congressmen even go so far as to demand the deportation of all foreigners from the country, considering them undesirable and harmful simply because they do not want to become American citizens.</p>
   
   <p>In connection with this new campaign directed against foreigners the annual report made public by the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, Mr. D. McCormack, is of absorbing interest. In his account the Commissioner notes the sharp increase in the number of applications for first and second citizenship papers.</p>
   <p>"It is possible," he states, "that the reasons for this are purely economic. At present it is difficult for a foreigner to get a job, and in many States proposals have been submitted with the purpose of depriving foreigners of the right to receive public assistance. The movement for old-age security and for the adoption of other measures of social security is, it seems, of vital interest to foreigners, for they realize that the new program of social reforms will extend only to American citizens."</p>
   <p>In his report the Commissioner cites interesting data concerning the progress made in the naturalization of foreigners. In the year 1935 more than 136,000 applications for first papers were filed, almost twice as many as in the year 1933. Petitions for second papers numbered 131,000, and 118,945 petitioners became citizens within the year. In 2,735 cases the applicants did not qualify for citizenship and were rejected. Besides, 864 certificates of citizenship were found to be void. This occurred as the result of the investigation of cases of fraud in New York, in which thirty-four persons involved were brought before the court, including a number of federal employees from the Immigration Bureau. It was established that a group of petty officials was changing dates of arrival, recording fictitious names, and committing other fraudulent acts, as a result of which several hundred foreigners who had illegally entered this country had received citizenship papers. A whole gang of persons was discovered who collected from $300 to $1,200 for such services from persons not entitled to citizenship. The investigations included 424 persons, and 83 of those have already been deported.</p>
   <p>In his report the Commissioner also states that all talk of millions of persons illegally residing in this country is unfounded. At present, in his opinion, there are not more than 4,920,000 foreigners in the United States, and among them are 1,500,000 persons who have taken out first papers.</p>
   <p>Of no less interest is Mr. McCormack's statement to the effect that during the last five years, on account of the prevailing unemployment, more foreigners have left our shores than have entered the country. For that reason the "predominance of foreigners" exists only in the imagination of some Congress-men and other public men. They are ready to blame foreigners for all the misery which afflicts the United States.</p>
   <p>At present there are bills in both houses of Congress directed against foreigners. We have no doubt, however, that the most drastic of them will be rejected. One should always keep in mind the fact that the entire population of the United States is essentially an immigrant conglomerate. The only difference [among the inhabitants] is that some became citizens sooner than others. Some are automatically made citizens by the mere accident of birth, and some persist in remaining foreigners for one reason or another. This is the reason, probably, that the more drastic bills against foreigners invariably have been rejected by Congress. The same fate, we believe, will befall most of the bills lately thrown into the legislative hopper.</p>
