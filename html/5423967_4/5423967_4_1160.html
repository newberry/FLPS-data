   <p>The first Greek-Catholic church service in Chicago was held last Saturday evening, Nov. 5th. at 13 Center Avenue, by a Russian congregation, which as yet is very small in number. The service was conducted by Bishop Nicholas, who is the primate of the Greek-Catholic Church of the United States, with headquarters in San Francisco, California. Some of the priests from other parts of the country attended this initial service. In the morning of the following day, Sunday, High Mass was celebrated in the same place. The premises at 13 Center avenue have been leased by the congregation for one year.</p>
