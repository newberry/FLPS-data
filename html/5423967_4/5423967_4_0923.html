   <p>This year, the traditional Christmas tree festivity, arranged by St. George's Parish, was unusually successful. In spite of the economic crisis, and the consequent unemployment and need existing among the Russians in Chicago, two thousand people attended this gala celebration. The hall was packed. The musical part of the program, arranged carefully, with an eye to the selection of the best talent, went off with unprecedented success, and the guests were delighted with it. The committee on arrangements wishes to express its gratitude to the pupils of the Kriilov and Bunin schools, as well as to their parents, for their participation in the concert. Particular thanks are due Mr. Schumkov, the director of the schools, who expended a great deal of effort in order to make the stage appearance of these pupils, an outstanding event.</p>
