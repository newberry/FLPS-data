   <p>For the last several years the question of the building of the Russian National Home has been frequently discussed and then put off to a more propitious time. Because of the economic crisis, unemployment, and the closing of banks, this undertaking seemed to have been definitely stopped.</p>
   <p>Now, however, the conditions are more favorable, and the construction of the building can be started, on a very economical basis with promise of success and convenience for those individuals and organizations who now take the initiative and without further delay, begin construction of the building.</p>
   <p>Waste of time is like death, Peter the Great used to say.</p>
   <p>This sentence remarkably well applies to present conditions in our Russian colony. We must go forward and join hands to build a National Home.</p>
   <p>To stand still now is impossible, for the wave of Americanization is now <span class="page-break">\2</span>capturing the remnants of the Russian colony, and with the advance of the new generation, there will soon be an empty place where the Russian colony now is.</p>
   <p>The Independent Society on Wood Street intends to build a new church and a new hall if it can do it economically, without depleting its fund and without weakening its present satisfactory condition. All this can be done conveniently and inexpensively, without entering upon overambitious and overexpensive plans of action. It is also necessary to remember that better times seem to be coming, and without doubt this cultural undertaking will find support among Russians and among Americans.</p>
