   <p>".... On our arrival in Chicago we found quite a large colony of Russian emigrants. Some of them hailed from the provinces of Russia--Letts, Lithuanians, Esthonians and Finns, some from Poland and western provinces of the Russian Empire--Poles, Jews and Ruthenians, some from southern Russia and Ukrainia. Very few, if any, came from the purely Russian (Great Russian) districts. The Russians proper in this multitude of Russian subjects were almost exclusively from the guberniya (states) of Minsk, Grodno, Vilna and Volyn. It should be noted that these four districts of old Russia did not possess municipal self-government (zemstvo) which by that time had already established a network of public schools in the agrarian districts of the thirty-four zemstvo guberniyas. And since the four guberniya mentioned above were non-industrial in character, the native sons they sent to this country were culturally backward, a great number of them illiterate. Economically most of the Russians in Chicago were unskilled laborers with a low standard of living, sometimes ten or fifteen men living in one"community-hourse". Their social life outside of the Church was almost nonexistent. The only active educational and cultural factors of the Russian community of that period were the Russian branches of the Socialist Party and the <span class="page-break">\2</span>non-political organizations influenced by them. Their lectures, meetings, free libraries and schools contributed both to the cultural betterment of the Russian colony as Russians and workers, and to the Americanization process of the immigrants."</p>
