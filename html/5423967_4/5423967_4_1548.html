   <p>The arrival of the Russian fliers to America united almost all the Russian Monarchists, Bolshevists, Anarchists, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Social-Democrats, etc., all forgot, for the time being, their "isms" and transformed themselves into proud Russians only, rejoicing in the achievement of their fearless compatriots, the fliers who had come from Russia.</p>
   <p>It makes no difference to us, said the colonists, who is ruling our native land. Government is only a matter of time; to-day Ivan is ruling; to-morrow it may be Stepan. Yesterday Trotsky was in power and glory, and at present he is in exile, accusing Stalin and incriminating him with every deadly sin. Government is a changeable thing, not permanent. But Russia is everlasting and everlasting are the Russian people, who gave to the world these four fearless sons, the Russian fliers.</p>
