   <p>General Usefovich came to Chicago in 1923. In the beginning he had to do some odd jobs which were not at all appropriate for a man of his education and abilities. But in 1924 he was invited to work with the world renowned Rand McNally Company (printers specializing in maps), 538 S. Clark street. Soon he was able to occupy a responsible position in the department of cartography of this firm.</p>
   <p>In 1931 General Usefovich obtained a United States Civil Service government position having passed brilliantly his examination, ranking second among the candidates. About two years he has been serving in the Geodetic Division of the Department of Commerce. At present the general holds a responsible position in the United States Ship-Building Department. He has not only become an American citizen, but also a true American patriot. He is a member of five American military patriotic organizations. The organization of the Foreign War Veterans extended to him its invitation to visit its last convention in Annapolis, Md., in the quality of an honorary guest. At this convention he made a speech on behalf of the Russian war veterans.</p>
   
   <p>General Usefovich was the first among foreign generals to be allowed not only to become a full-fledged member of the above mentioned military patriotic organization, but also to wear the American military uniform. He is the author of several monographs on <span class="gap">[gap]</span> subjects both in the Russian and in the English languages.</p>
   <p>While residing in Chicago the general has been lecturing very frequently both for the Russian and for the Americans. He has also been an active member of several Russian social and philanthropic organizations in Chicago. He also acted as counsel to the Russian Center of the City of Chicago.</p>
