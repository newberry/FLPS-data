   <p>If one were to hear our Russian people talk in parks, in homes, at picnics, at meetings, and at lectures, he would be inclined to think that the Russian group here is composed of intelligent, well-educated, well-informed, nationalistic and class-conscious active people, the best human element of all foreign language groups in this country. They talk of everything and anything one can think of: liberty, justice, culture, education, mutual aid, the class struggle and the rebuilding of the world.</p>
   <p>All these talks, however, remain just empty chatter. Their flowery words have nothing in common with realities. The group solidarity and the love of education find no proof in their actions. For instance, not long ago we read an editorial in Novosti, the organ of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in which, among other things, it was stated that during a big picnic of this society there was a collection of voluntary contributions for the benefit of one of the schools conducted by this society. The collection brought only $3.59. Some readers may say that this was an exception, and that generally Russian people here co-operate generously in all group affairs. However, it was not an exception but rather the rule. The overwhelming majority of our people--the same people who make all kinds of pretty talks--do not stint them-selves when it comes to spending their time and their money for unnecessary and even harmful objects, but they usually are very frugal and economical in relation to all objects and propositions having a wider meaning for our entire group. Where they can apply their high-sounding ideals in actual life and where they can be of real help to their own group, they relegate their great theories to the background; they shrink and become indifferent deadwood. It is not a secret nor a product of the imagination, but a fact known to everybody, that there are a great many people among our group who, with ease and unconcern, would spend five or ten dollars on drinks in some dive, but would not spare even a penny to buy a Russian newspaper or a good book. They spend their <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>money freely for various knickknacks, gifts and objects of comfort and pleasure, but contribute nothing toward the support of any useful undertaking. In the first instance they are great spenders, in the second instance they become poor and almost indigent. These phenomena of the common psychology of the Russian mind in America can be observed not only among the more ignorant people, but also among those who consider themselves better equipped mentally and economically. They talk loudly about group solidarity, mutual aid, support of our schools and our press, but actually they act in the opposite way. They support various business establishments outside of our group, and private enterprises of various individual proprietors, not giving a whoop for their national group or the class consciousness they talk so much about when in the company of others.</p>
   <p>From the point of view of our group interest, every Russian should, above all, support his own Russian enterprises. A Russian with his class consciousness highly developed should support those who hold similar opinions, irrespective of their nationality. But what do we see in reality? We see that our Russian people, the great majority of them, support the wrong commercial enterprises, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and fail to support those which they should regard it their duty to patronize. Not only private individuals but whole Russian organizations are guilty of such practices. Many of our organizations, for instance, order all their printing from outsiders, passing by all those printing establishments that have a right to expect their patronage. From our own experience we can quote the following incident: A Russian organization had sent us a leaflet and asked that we print its contents in our paper every day for a week. The leaflets were printed by some commercial job printer, while our printers had no work to do.</p>
   <p>All these are reasons why it is so difficult to keep our Russian schools going, to build our national homes, to acquire collective farms, to organize co-operative stores and restaurants, and in general, to do useful things for the benefit of our entire group.</p>
