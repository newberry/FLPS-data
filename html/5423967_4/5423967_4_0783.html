   <p>The Russian-American Club of the 25th Ward held its regular meeting on July 6 at 1345 South Washtenaw Avenue on the West Side. About fifty persons, both men and women, were present at the meeting. The Russian-American Democratic League was represented by Mr. V. A. Kishun.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chopko, the chairman, presented a short report on the life and activities of the club. He said that the club had more than two hundred members, and that it had organized its youth circle, consisting of some sixty young men and women. The adult members of the club hold their meetings once a month, while the young members meet weekly.</p>
   <p>After reading the reports and concluding other routine matters, Mr. Chopko introduced Mr. V. A. Kishun, chairman of the executive committee of the Russian-American Democratic League. Mr. Kishun made a lengthy speech in which he explained in detail the aims of the Russian-American Democratic League, its meaning and its usefulness to the Russian group in general and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to Russian-American youth in particular.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. N. Novin and Mr. I. F. Erin, both also representing the League, gave further explanations of that organization's future aims, and of its great moral importance to the sons and daughters of the Russian-American people and its influence on their future. They also congratulated the Russian-American Club of the 25th Ward on its good work and on the fine results it has already achieved. Several members of the club also spoke. They praised the good work of the Russian-American Democratic League and urged their co-members to increase still further their efforts toward co-operating with the League and to continue the expansion of their club.</p>
   <p>One fact must be noted with particular satisfaction, and that is the number of women members of the Club who participated in the meeting. We are informed that the women members of the club are especially active in many of the club's activities.</p>
   <p>The young people's department is well developed and is gaining strength every <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>day. Besides giving healthful recreation to our sons and daughters, it also gives them a good training for their future duties as useful citizens of this great country of our adoption, our second fatherland. The youth department of the club is especially useful in preventing many of our Russian boys and girls from being absorbed by the "street" with all its baneful influences upon their character and their future life.</p>
   <p>Before adjourning the meeting, the members took up the question of organizing a picnic. They decided unanimously to hold a large picnic before the end of July, and elected a special committee of ten persons to arrange all the details and to set the date of the outing.</p>
   <p>It may be noted here that the Russian-American Club of the 25th Ward consists of former peasants and workers exclusively. Not a single member of the so-called intelligentsia is to be found in this organization. These simple men, however, are able to conduct the affairs of the club very smoothly and efficiently, and to advance the aims of the club rapidly.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>All praise and honor to you, members of the Russian-American Club of the 25th Ward, for your excellent work! You serve as a good example for all Russian organizations in Chicago.</p>
