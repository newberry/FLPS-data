   <p>On April 3, 1928, there will be the third anniversary of the Russian Center. During that period of time fifty lectures have been arranged. The Russian Center has urged the Russian colony to enlightenment and self-education. Unfortunately, the Russian center is a young organization and the colony has few people who have the time and will to do some work for the center. The center gradually ceased its activity in the spring of 1928. At that time there was organized the 50th Branch of the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society of America under the name of Society Znaniye (Knowledge). The society "Knowledge" won the sympathy of the colony. It attracted many members. Many members of the Russian Center joined the society "Knowledge." Then the idea was born to unify the Russian Center with the new formed society "Knowledge," which had all the chances to exist and flourish.</p>
