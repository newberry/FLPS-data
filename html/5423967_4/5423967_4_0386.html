   <p>Comrades! Russian immigrants!</p>
   <p>There are millions of Russian orphans -- 600,000 in Povoloszhye, 400,000 in the Ukraine. They are in urgent need of immediate assistance.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of thousands of emaciated little hands are stretched out to us from across the ocean, from the distant, yet dear homeland of ours.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of thousands of little eyes turn to us with childish prayers for help.</p>
   <p>"Khly-e-bush-ka (breadie)," beg these unfortunate children.</p>
   <p>Can we, the well-fed, well-dressed and in good shoes, remain indifferent <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to this heart-rendin cry from the children of our unforgettable comrades who fell in an unselfish strife for the future happiness of mankind?</p>
   <p>Shall we refuse bread to the orphaned Russian children, our children? The maintenance per child in the homes which we are now building in Russia will amount to two dollars per month. The initial equipment, with clothing, underwear, books and sundries, amount to $5 per child. Thus for the adoption of one child it is necessary to make the initial payments of $7, with subsequent payments of $2 monthly.</p>
   <p>In this wise, each one of you, comrades, by paying two dollars per month will save the life of one orphan, providing regularly food and shelter for the child.</p>
   <p>Do not take upon your conscience, comrades, the perishing of these unfortunate to Russian orphans. Fill out the enclosed blank, and together <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with your contribution send it to the following address:</p>
