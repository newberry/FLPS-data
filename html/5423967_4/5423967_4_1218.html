   <p>In the spring of this year the student S. A. Popov (a member of the Northeastern Branch of the Russian National Christian Students' Union in the United States, which is the only large unifying students' organization in the United States) made an attempt to unify the Russian students' colony in Chicago. He was doing this with the closest cooperation of his senior colleagues, members of academic organizations, and of persons who were in sympathy with the noble aim of unifying the young scientific forces.</p>
   <p>Because of some accidental misunderstanding there were present at the organizing meetings certain students and some persons calling themselves students, who had come with the obvious desire of creating, not a students' union, but a political organization under the guise of a students' union. They made speeches, tried to be witty, spoke eloquently about all the good they could do, and promised to do even better, if the student S. Popov would surrender to them his office of organizer.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Much was said, and all the work which had been done by the student Popov with the help and cooperation of Mr. Bowers, the secretary of the YMCA, was undone. That which was in the process of birth was destroyed, and nothing new was put in its place. The "students" (we regret to say that a part of them consisted of members of the New York branch of the Russian National Christian Students' Union), after having abused those who had participated in the first two meetings when the organization of the Chicago branch of the union had been discussed, gradually faded away, became like dust, and there was a lull in their work.</p>
   <p>The student Popov who had always insisted on the necessity of organizing an independent local students' union, which later was supposed to become the fourth branch of the R. N. C. S. U., not wishing to interfere with the work of the students (there were only two or three of them) continues to work with the help of the three already existing branches of the R. N. C. S. U., and of the YMCA.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the group of students numbers about 40 persons, plus the <span class="page-break">3</span>members of the academic organizations, and life imperatively demands that the existing students groups be unified into a well formed, healthy students organization which could stand the hardships of the way towards the completion of higher education.</p>
   <p>Having gathered an initial group of students, S. Popov proposed to it to approve a project of by-laws in accordance with which is being realized the idea of the creation of a Russian National Christian Students' Union in Chicago. The idea of this union can be expressed concisely as follows:</p>
   <p>On what plane can persons who respect and trust each other come together? What can a community of foreigners give to the members of a union in which the number of political parties represented may happen to be the same as the number of its members?</p>
   <p>Without mutual trust and respect there is no life in any organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It is the cement. In creating an organization, its initiators want to have cement of the best quality. Such is, according to the idea shared by all the branches of the R. N. C. S. U., the idea of moving towards good, the desire not of purely selfish profit, comfort and privileges, but the common thought that we have certain obligations towards other people, and that on the fulfillment of these obligations depends the welfare of all, including ourselves. How can these results be achieved? The religious consciousness of the Slavs, and of us Russians in particular, has a pre-eminently contemplative character. It consists chiefly of inner experiences and aspirations. While being proud of that religious nature of our mind and while considering it to be of great spiritual value, we must not forget that every principle possesses real value only in so far as it is being realized in our lives. The behests of Christ, such is the platform on which all can be united, and we must know how to consciously realize these behests in our daily life. During the period of such events as are happening now in Russia, one of the most dreadful consequences is the decadence of a lofty <span class="page-break">5</span>spirituality and morality in their vital manifestations. This we see, not only in Russia itself, but also among the Russian emigrants. Until a spiritual regeneration has set in we have no reason to believe in the possibility of the realization of material welfare.</p>
   <p>Thus in making the moral integrity of the candidates to membership the basic condition of their being accepted the Union has solved a very important question which often becomes a stumbling block, namely, the question as to the non-political character of an organization. The solution is this: though the Union, as a matter of fact, does not mix in politics, it regards those acts of violence which are happening now in Russia as immoral actions, and it considers those who are in sympathy with these acts of violence as persons who have not reached that level of moral development which is required of a candidate to membership in the Union. All the other students, though they may differ in their views about other questions, have in this negative attitude towards violence that common basis which is so necessary for those who want to do some work together.</p>

   <p>The skeptic will probably declare that in our age it is difficult to apply to life the principles of Christianity and of the progress towards good. True! It is difficult as long as it has not become the result of a conscious effort, but many can do it, though it costs them a lot of trouble.</p>
   <p>The basic motive must be to do good to others; to be useful to the greatest number of other people. On these ideas we base the aims of the Union.</p>
   <p>What has been told above constitute rather the plan and scheme of our endeavors than already achieved results.</p>
   <p>But we must achieve. So help yourselves, and may God help us.</p>
