   <p>In today's issue of Rassviet there appears an important decision of the board of directors of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society concerning the merger of this Society with the Russian United Mutual Aid Society. The talk about the consolidation of these two Russian organizations of mutual aid began a long time ago, and both sides agreed as to the necessity of the union, but neither side undertook any concrete measures to that end. The question was originally settled in the positive sense during the latest conventions of the two Societies. However, a year passed after the two conventions and no union took place. Even this newspaper stopped discussing this important question on its pages.</p>
   <p>The Russian people, impatiently waiting for the moment of the merger of the forces of the two organizations, finally began to think the whole question had been relegated to unimportance in the minds of the heads of both organizations, and that the talk of merger would remain but empty phrases. It is not so, <span class="page-break">\2</span>however, The merger had not been brought to a successful conclusion only because the Independent Society was not ready to make the concessions demanded by the other Society.</p>
   <p>At the last convention of the Russian United Mutual Aid Society it was decided that if the new consolidated organization would retain the name of that Society, i.e., the Russian United Mutual Aid Society, the headquarters should be located in Chicago, while, if the Independent Society, i.e., the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society should insist on giving its own name to the new organization, the headquarters would have to be located in New York. The Independents wanted to give their name to the new organization and at the same time to retain their headquarters in Chicago. The members of the other Society, whose headquarters are in New York, did not feel inclined to grant these two important concessions to the Independents, and even began to suspect them of insincerity and of lack of real interest in the proposed merger.</p>
   <p>Now, however, according to the declaration of the board of directors of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, published in today's issue of Rassviet, this organization offers a concession to the R. U. M. A. S. and agrees that the consolidated society be called the Russian United Mutual Aid Society, but demands that the headquarters be in Chicago, as Chicago is nearer the geographical center of the United States.</p>
   <p>We can suppose that there will be no more obstacles in the way of the merger of the two organizations. The next thing now for both organizations is to work out all details of the merger and conclude the fusion as soon as possible. If this question is not settled in the near future, the rank and file members of both organizations will demand some explanations as to who is blocking and holding up the proper solution to this burning question.</p>
   <p>The union of these two Russian organizations is unusually important, not only for the members of these organizations but for the entire Russian group in America. It will serve as an impulse for consolidation of our ranks and of our aims as a racial group in this country. The sooner it happens the sooner <span class="page-break">\4</span>we will be able to get rid of many strangers and adventurers, like the Bolsheviks, who lead us to disaster; and the sooner we will be able to rehabilitate our name and repair and raise high our fallen prestige as a national group.</p>
   <p>The international unity of which we hear and read frequently is a good thing, and in many cases a necessary thing. But before uniting with other nationalities the Russian group should unite internally; should consolidate its own ranks. Only then will it be able to defend successfully its own rights and interests, and to create its own cultural and economic values. Only then will our group be able to command the respect of other national groups and international combinations.</p>
