   <p>The author comments on the sermons of Rev. Everett Wagner, clergyman of a fashionable New York church on 44th Ave., and Rev. F. V. Staycy, methodist minister. The first pointed out in his sermon the terrible growth of crime in the U. S. The second maintained that the modern prison system in many cases does not reform the criminals. Rev. Staycy held that a proper education of children - meaning evidently a religious education - would be a far more efficient means of fighting crime than any severe system of punishment based on the old Mosaic law: "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth". The author of the editorial does not agree with this view. He points out that, in spite of the activity of Sunday Schools of various denominations, crime is on the increase. In his opinion it is the abnormal social structure of modern society, fostering the spirit of materialism and greed, that causes the growth of crime. He holds that only a radical change of social conditions could therefore abolish crime.</p>
