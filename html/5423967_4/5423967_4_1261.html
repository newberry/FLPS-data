   <p>Figures published the other day on the number of visas issued by American consulates tell more eloquently than enything else the difficulties connected with obtaining permission to enter the United States.</p>
   <p>According to the existing law in this last year 153,774 quota immigrants might have entered the country. As far as the non-quota immigrants are concerned, the law provides no limit to their number.</p>
   <p>Actually, however, within the last fiscal year only 17,291 visas, about eleven per cent of the quota, were granted. Out of this number 6,062 permits to enter were received by parents of American citizens or by wives and children of the holders of first papers, who are entitled to first and second priority. Besides these 20,855 immigrants of the non-quota class were admitted to the country. Most of these were wives and minor children of American citizens.</p>
   <p>In distributing these figures among countries, we find that from Germany 4,653 immigrants were admitted, or only 18 per cent of the annual quota, from Italy 2,207, or 38 per cent, and from Poland 1,724 or 27 per cent of the quota.</p>
   <p>With respect to the Soviet Union we find the following data. Although the Russian quota allowed 2,712 immigrants, only 381 permits were issued, including 85 permits to parents of American citizens and 32 to members of families of declarants. Thus only 14 per cent of the quota allowance was utilized. In addition 166 non-quota immigrants were admitted from the Soviet Republics. Among them were 120 close relatives of American citizens, 23 immigrants with re-entry permits returning from short visits to their native country, 11 professors, and 11 students.</p>
   
   <p>The State Department considers that the application of more rigid requirements to the immigrants in the last four and a half years has reduced immigration by a million. During the year 1930 monthly arrivals in the United States reached a total of 22,000. But as soon as the United States consulates received instructions that they were to demand proof that the applicant would not become a public burden and require charity, immigration was immediately reduced by one third, later on by one half, and finally by three quarters.</p>
   <p>In many countries the strict immigration rules have led people to believe that it is impossible to gain admittance to the United States, and they do not even apply for permits to enter. By the end of June, 1935, only 238,798 applications for visas had been filed, and 45 per cent of these came from persons residing either in Germany or in Poland.</p>
