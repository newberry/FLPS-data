   <p>It would be a very good thing to increase the number of members of our organization of workers and laboring men. The larger the membership of our organization, the smaller the financial burdens each member of the organization must carry on his shoulders.</p>
   <p>Through long years the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has been carrying on its pioneering work among Russian immigrants, in Chicago and vicinity but it has not succeeded as yet in organizing all Russians in this territory into one family, into one fraternal order. There are still a great many Russians all around us who remain outside of our organization. The new board of directors of the R. I. M. A. S., elected at the 23rd convention, considers this an inadmissible condition, especially now when our people are so deeply affected by the unemployment situation and the economic depression. Our new directors think that now is the time for our organization to grow and expand, in members, in power and in financial resources.</p>
   <p>Life itself has taught us how to value our organization, and how to guard it against the enemies who desire to bring about dissatisfaction and dissension among our members, in order to fulfill their own insidious plans. Now as never before it is necessary for all Russian immigrants to unite under the leadership of one strong organization, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. The dream of returning to Russia has ceased to trouble most of us. The Russian Revolution, which promised so much, has not fulfilled its promises. In Russia, as before, under an unrelenting oppression of rude despotism the masses of working people are suffering. The prisons are filled with innocent people who are being held there for years without any legal procedure or court action. Since such cruel conditions of life now reign in Russia, our people here no more think or talk of returning to their mother country. And this is the main reason why the Russian group in this country should, in all sincerity, admit the necessity of organizing into one strong organization, like the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
