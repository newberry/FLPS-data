   <p>From a notice about the activities of the Russian Baptist Church, at 2646 Ogden Avenue, near Douglas Park, we gather that, besides regular services on Sundays at 11:00 A.M. and on Thursdays at 7:30 P.M., the Church has Bible classes for children and young people (in English) and for adults (in Russian); also meetings for women and for young people.</p>
