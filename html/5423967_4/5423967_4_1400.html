   <p>The Moscow correspondent of the Chicago Daily News, W. Stoneman, reports that a new wave of mass arrests is rolling over Russia. According to Mr. Stoneman, in the larger cities no fewer than one thousand arrests take place daily. During the last four weeks there were arrested, and exiled to Siberia and other places, no fewer than twenty-five thousand men and women.</p>
   <p>The arrests are conducted under the pretense of eliminating "undesirable elements" from Moscow, Leningrad and other large cities. But, as can be inferred from the information supplied by Mr. Stoneman, the Bolsheviks regard as "undesirable elements" mainly the remaining old intellectuals, and not the criminal elements, as might be supposed.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviks, as is well known, have been engaged in the extermination of the intellectuals for the last seventeen years. During the first years of their dictatorship the exterminated part of the intellectual class, part of it was starved to death in prisons and places of exile, and the rest of the intellectuals were deprived of all rights. These men were the rejected ones in every sense of the word; they had no rights whatsoever, and yet they honestly and faithfully took part in the economic upbuilding of the country. But when in some sphere of this reconstruction breakdowns or upsets occurred, the blame was always laid at the door of these outlawed specialists, and they were subjected to all forms of persecutions and reprisals, including punishment by death.</p>
   <p>At present, it would seem that the Bolsheviks have once more detected some important breakdowns in their "socialist reconstruction". For that reason they have decided to exterminate by means of hunger and other privations that in-considerable part of the intellectual class which has managed to live through and survive the period of military communism, and has not perished from cold and hunger up to the present time.</p>
   <p>The mass arrests, according to Stoneman, have reached such proportions that many scientific institutions at present have found themselves without scientists, universities without professors, hospitals without physicians.</p>
   <p>Scholars, professors, engineers, physicians and other specialists are being exiled to Siberia and other places to perform hard labor; others are forbidden to reside in the fifteen main cities. The Bolsheviks impose on these people such conditions as were suffered under the Czarist regime only by Jews, whose residence was also restricted to the limits of the so-called "pale."</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviks, it would seem, now are of the opinion that they can continue the work of "socialist reconstruction" with the assistance of their own "Red specialists" alone--specialists raised and educated during the soviet regime--and, therefore, the remnants of the old intellectual class may be starved to death or done away with by means of the imposition of hard back-breaking work.</p>
   <p>They are mistaken, however. If the Bolsheviks decide to find support only in their own specialists, their Tower of Babel will crumble very soon.</p>
