   <p>In addition to the decree inflicting capital punishment on criminally inclined children on June 1, the Bolshevik government made public another decree. This latter one is also directed toward putting an end to the juvenile criminal activity, and to the elimnation of homeless children as such, but the methods to be employed to fight these evils as promulgated by the government in the second decree are different from those prescribed in the "decree on shootings".</p>
   <p>The decree "On Liquidation of Juvenile Criminalism and Uncared-for Children," as the decree is officially known, was signed by Stalin and Molotov. It introduces a new system in distribution of homeless children, and those children who have no parental care [children of Soviet citizens who have been exiled, imprisoned or executed], among Soviet Juvenile institutions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Children without criminal records will be sent to children's homes, and those with criminal records will be confined to special institutions of correction and to the labor communes maintained by the Commissariat of the Interior. General supervising authority, both over the children's homes and the communes, is vested in the newly established Department of Schools of the Central Executive Committee. For this purpose, the ruling party will assign to the department two hundred active Communists and five hundred active Young Communists. For technical supervision over the trade-teaching shops of the juvenile institutions, the Central Council of Trade Unions will select three hundred qualified workers, and for educational and caretaking work the Commissariat of Education will assign five hundred graduates of the pedagogical institutes who received their diplomas during the current year, and one hundred twenty-five graduates from the Soviet universities.</p>
   <p>For prevention of child homelessness in the future, the chairmen of city and rural districts are instructed to appoint guardians to take care of the orphans and children whose parents find themselves in poverty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>For reappearance of vagabond children on the streets or in other public places, the responsibility will be carried by presidents of city or county committees, and in places where organized guardianship exists the responsibility is carried by the guardians.</p>
   <p>The militia is entrusted with the task of prevention of criminal activity among Street children. The militia is given the authority to fine, up to two hundred rubles, parents whose children commit acts of depredation or rowdyism.</p>
   <p>The decree also imposes responsibility on guardians and parents for material losses from juvenile acts of a criminal nature, children's pranks and other mischievous acts. In cases where children prove to be incorrigible, they may be sent to juvenile homes of correction, and their parents will bear the expense of upkeep of their offspring in such institutions.</p>
   <p>The Section of Press and Propaganda of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist party is ordered not to admit into children's circles literature and <span class="page-break">4</span>films of a character having harmful influence on the child's mind.</p>
   <p>Besides this, throughout the entire Union a reorganization of schools and all organizations of Young Communists had been carried through for, in the words of Bolsheviks themselves, "many former schools and Young Communists' units had become crime breeding places". In the schools was re-established, almost in its entirety, the regime of pre-revolutionary Russia. On the Commissar of Education, Mr. Bubnov, former member of the dreaded secret police, is imposed the duty of supervision and guidance over all other commissariats of the component republics. Simultaneously Bubnov is appointed chairman of the commission of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League, which will take charge and direct the general political and civic bringing-up of the youth. As a result Mr. Bubnov concentrates in his hands the entire problem of education over the whole extent of the U.S.S.R. both in the Soviet and party institutions.</p>
   <p>The Bolshevik newspapers lately have been carrying on an extensive propaganda <span class="page-break">5</span>campaign against heretofore flourishing "free love," preached and practiced originally by Miss Kollontav [Translator's note: present Soviet ambassadress to Norway]. Her preachings of such love bred incredible sexual dissipation and other vices among Young Communists. The campaign is against abortions, against the breaking up of families, and other realities of Soviet life which heretofore were considered attainments.</p>
   <p>All this serves as evidence of the fact that loose sex association, criminalism, and complete demoralization among the Soviet youth have reached such a point that panic begins to get hold of the Bolsheviks themselves, the very same people who planted and cultivated all the hideous sides of Soviet life.</p>
   <p>Now they attempt to destroy all these Lenin-Marxist achievements by means of shootings, imprisonments, and other reprisals. But it is very difficult to fight against these vices, for they are being nursed into growth by the oppressive Bolshevik regime itself.</p>
