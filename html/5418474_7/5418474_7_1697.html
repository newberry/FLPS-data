   <p>The first day of the Cannstatter festival, being held at Ogden Grove yesterday, was indeed a splendid one. The weather was beautiful, every seat in that large garden was occupied and seemingly everyone was in good humor....</p>
   <p>The Pantomimic Scenic Performances from "Faust", "Wallenstein" and others with 150 children cooperating brilliantly in the play, provided pleasant and profitable enjoyment. Exceedingly enthusiastic applause was received at the final tableau; "Schiller and Goethe in Lincoln Park."</p>
   <p>Dramatic recitals of well-known patriotic and love songs contributed much to the amusements of the day. By approaching darkness the large garden was illuminated. A great many pictures were presented and fireworks enriched the evening. The festival will continue to-day. The program contains many extraordinary plays and performances.</p>

   <p>It is assumed that the pecuniary success is above all expectation. A considerable amount will be turned over to the fund for Goethe's Monument.</p>
