He spoke well of the work and success of the past year, and pointed towards the coming German Day celebration. He mentioned also the singing festival in Peoria. He then introduced to the audience the president of the German Day festival, Mr. Bruno Hnechz, and Professor Scherger. Mr. Knacht, after a few words of thanks, which concluded with praise for the endeavors of the Singing Society, gave a short description of the events planned for the German Day celebration.</p>
   <p>Professor Scherger mentioned one of the outstanding characteristics of the German people, namely their love of singing and of music, as one of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>profoundest expressions of the German mind. Rich applause rewarded the two guests of honor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kruetgen spoke then in a grateful and appreciative manner of the conductor of the Chicago Singing Society, Mr. W. Boeppler, who never denied his German nationality, and who always served the Singing Society with the best of his ability and with all his strength. Mr. Boeppler thanked him and referred to the two gentlemen who had spoken before him. He found for the festive mood which prevailed throughout the evening, the right expression, and designated the occasion as a worthy introduction of the coming German Day celebration.
