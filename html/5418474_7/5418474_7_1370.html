   <p>Amidst ideal weather, the 54th "festival of the old settlers" or as it is generally called, the "Old Settlers Picnic," was celebrated at Noon in the large Picnin Grove of Riverview Park. At 1 o'clock, several hundred people gathered on the spacious Picnic grounds, to write their names in the register. The officials of the Turner society were making the last preparations for the reception of several thousand guests, who participate every year in the old settlers' festival. Somewhat shaky, but full of pride, the old settlers wrote their names in the book, and received their insignia, which showed the year of their arrival in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the band played music for dancing, vendors called out their wares, and children were gleeful; the 54th festival of the old settlers has begun. There is no doubt that it will prove very successful if the weather remains pleasant.</p>
