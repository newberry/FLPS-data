   <p>Although not favored by the best weather, yet the 23rd yearly picnic in honor of the old settlers of Chicago was held yesterday in the traditional harmonious and pleasant way at the local historical Ogden Grove.</p>
   <p>The preparations for the festival were again in the hands of the ChicagoTurngemeinde who accepted this honorable duty years ago and who will keep it up in the future. Mr. Emil Hoechster distributed the medals after the customary fiery address and among the prize crowned winners are: Oldest German Settlers, -Lorenz Baer(57 years in Chicago), Mrs. Anna Ernst (65 years in Chicago): Oldest Settlers of non- German origin, *H. A. Ward(63 years in Chicago) and Mrs. Martha Hammer(64 years in Chicago.)</p>
   <p>The young German-American generation was asked, in an earnest appeal to their hearts to keep up the manners of their ancestors and preserve German character and customs.</p>
