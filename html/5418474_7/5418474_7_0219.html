   <p>The German Theater season at McVickers was brought to a successful close last evening with the pretty Comic Opera "The Bat" (Die Fledermaus) by Johann Strauss. Messrs. Collmer and Isenstein, the managers of the German Theater may well look back with pride upon their achievements during the season. They deserve great credit for what they have done. The Germans here never before were treated to such uniformly good performances as they were this season, and if as good performances are given the next one, the managers may rest assured that their efforts will be even better rewarded. What enabled the directors of the German Theater to give such uniformly good performances was due to the fact they also managed the German Theater in Milwaukee. Thus they could bring plays that proved a success at one place to the other with same strong cast.</p>

   <p>For one evening's performance in the week they could not have engaged so strong and able a company as they could for three nights at Milwaukee and one night in Chicago. While the managers did not reap a rich harvest for their enterprise, yet they did remarkably well, and came out with a balance in their favor. Had it not been for the mistake of occasionally bringing out inferior plays with inferior casts, the managers would have done still better. It is to be hoped, that they will take a lesson from this year's experience, and give none but the best plays with the best actors that can be obtained.</p>
   <p>The German theater-goers of Chicago are a highly critical and peculiar people. They will support a German Theater if the performances are first class; if not, they stay at home or go to the English theaters. The house last evening was the largest for many weeks, and the performance, with a few exceptions, a brilliant one.</p>
