   <p>The first vice-president, Ernest J. Kruetgen, presents an annual report of the activities of the Chicago "Singverein" and is enthusiastic of its outstanding and successful performances, which received highest praise from the combined newspapers of Chicago.</p>
   <p>That the "Singverein" possesses in William Boeppler an unexcelled conductor and leader, who combines all the qualities which are necessary for the realization of the high aims of the "Singverein", is a fact, which has gradually become common property.</p>
   <p>The highest praise and deep appreciation have been expressed to the conductor, and may his valuable and incomparable service, be preserved for so long.</p>
   <p>The "Singverein", in its endeavor for the cultivation of German music and German language, became a factor of culture in the musical and social life of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Chicago of which the Germans of Chicago have reason to be proud. And, therefore, it is their paramount duty to support the "Singverein".</p>
