   <p>The merry play, "Goldner Boden" (Golden Soil), opened the theatre season at the Apollo Temple last evening. The members of the cast, who are already known to the public for their experience of many years, were greeted heartily by the audience. The ladies, Clara Lucas, Sidonic Hepner and Linda Schmidt, were rewarded by the presentation of splendid flowers. It was a smooth and perfect performance, and the visitors had an amusing evening.</p>
