   <p>The preparations for this year's German Day celebration are completed. This afternoon, promptly at 1 P.M., activities will get under way which will prove that, in spite of any little differences which may have crept into their ranks lately, the Americans of German descent are firmly united. These activities have taken place regularly for many years, in commemoration of the first German immigrants and as a pledge to the German national heritage.</p>
   <p>German Day--a more appropriate name would be The Day of German-America--is of special significance this year, inasmuch as it is celebrated in connection with the World's Fair (A Century of Progress Exposition).....</p>
   <p>The ceremonies, which will commence immediately after the parade at 1 P.M., will take place in Soldier Field, which has a capacity of one hundred thousand seats. The program committee, which had great difficulty in obtaining Soldier Field to <span class="page-break">2</span>accommodate the huge throng they anticipate, appeals once more to the Chicago German element to be present at the celebration.</p>
   <p>All nationalities have been invited to celebrate their particular "day" under the auspices of the World's Fair, and there is no doubt that special efforts have been made and are still being made [by each nationality] to make its day a glorious one. The committee in charge of the German Day celebration, consisting of representatives of the most prominent German-American associations, has been working hard for the last seven months completing the preparations for today's celebration. They can look back on a job well done. The problem was to present a varied program which would not tire the spectators. The program printed elsewhere in this issue shows that the committee has discharged its task satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>The German Lied has been granted an especially prominent place on the program. Not less than three mass choruses--two male choruses and one female chorus--will be heard. The turner societies and sport clubs will glory in special <span class="page-break">3</span>performances and will engage in competitive games. From the wealth of attractions offered, let us merely mention the Sternentanz [dance of the stars] of the Styrian group who will appear in national costume.</p>
   <p>It was decided to omit the long-winded speeches this time. Except for a brief welcoming address by Mr. Bernard De Vry, who is in charge of the celebration, there is only one speech on the program. George Seibel, first speaker of the American Turner Bund, will deliver the German Day address in German.</p>
   <p>Seibel was born in Pittsburgh in 1872. He went to a German school and early learned to appreciate the beauty of German literature. When only ten years old, he had already read Simrock's "Nibelungenlied" and Schiller's "Wilhelm Tell". His love for the German language and literature has never died, and after working for twelve years as an editorial writer for the leading American newspapers of Pittsburgh, where he also was a book critic, he turned to the German-language press. During the entire war he did this difficult work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>His speech at Johnstown, which was delivered at the German Day celebration of 1916, and was entitled "The Hyphen in American History" has been distributed throughout the country in many thousands of copies.</p>
   <p>Seibel's poems and novels have been published in the best monthly magazines of the country. His dramas, among them "The Leper," have been staged in many cities.</p>
   <p>This year's parade, under the command of Captain G. H. Weideling will probably turn out to be especially imposing and colorful. All participants are to meet at the north entrance of the World's Fair at noon. Only those who come in costume or in uniform--white trousers, white shirt, and cap will also be considered as such--will be given free admission to the Fair as participants in the parade.</p>
   <p>The floats will assemble at Franklin and Randolph Streets at 11 A.M., and after passing through the Loop will join the rest of the parade at the north entrance <span class="page-break">5</span>to the Fair. In the first division, there will be the usual detachments of the United States Army units. As they march to the plaza where the flag-raising ceremony will be held, the artillery will fire the customary salute.</p>
   <p>In this division, whose marshal, John Beierwaltes, is the president of the Central Association of the Military Societies of Chicago and Vicinity, will march all the military groups that have decided to take part in the parade.</p>
   <p>At 7 P.M., there will be a reception for the guests of honor along with the program of entertainment and music at the German-American House of the Fair, which is located on the north island near the Planetarium. A double quartet from the Chicago Singverein has promised its co-operation. There will be no extra admission for this little after-program. Everybody is welcome.</p>
