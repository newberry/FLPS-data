   <p>The forty-first concert of the Chicago Baecker-Gesangverein, which took place yesterday in Wicker Park Hall, was a complete success. Under the leadership of its director, H. A. Rehberg, the society sang many songs, which received general applause. The cello solos of Miss Lillian Rehberg were very pleasing, and the performances of the Chicago Baeckermeister Gesangverein (Master Bakers' Song Society) and of the singing section of the Frauenverein Fortschritt (Progress Women's Society) enjoyed universal approbation. A pleasant dance with lively music brought to a close an evening which everyone who attended found delightful.</p>
   <p>The following entertainments were very successful: the Lumpenball (Ragamuffin Dance) of the Berliner Verein von Chicago and the spring ball of the Germania club in the Lincoln Turner Hall; the spring festival of the United Brotherhood of Musicians of Chicago in Mozart Hall, and of the Palm Social Club in Belmont Hall; and also the first founding festival of the Deutsch-Galizien Frauenverein (Galician-German Women's Society) of Chicago in Fleiner's Hall.</p>
