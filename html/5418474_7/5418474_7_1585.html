   <p>A not to be forgotten feast was the grand commers, to all guests who met last night in the Northside Gymnastic all, to celebrate the 80 years birthday of Prince Bismarck. The success of the festival exceeded the highest expectations. The roomy hall was filled to capacity by Germans of every trade who shook hands in jubilant enthusiasm to honor the man, who had won their hearts. The stage was decorated with flowers of all colors and in the center was a colossal picture of the chancellor, draped with the black-white-red flag. The picture was the work of the painter, Hermann Michalowski. Behind the Picture the musicians of the Kalbitz, military band sat in their smart infantry guard uniforms. The gallery was decorated with garlands of fir branches. Mr.August Fiedler, presented by Emil Hoechster as president of the festival, opened the affair with a short speech, and emphasized that the festival did not originate from the associations, but has a general universal national character. He asked all present to raise a thundering cheer in honor of the Jubilee and it took some time till the second speaker assistant librarian Mr.F.L. Ganss could take the floor. The prologue which followed, had been composed by the speaker himself, and was of such stirring enthusiasm and lighting effect, that he was interrupted at various occasions by stormy applause. The first speaker at the festival was the German Consul, Dr.Karl Berentz about the subject: "Bismarck as a unifier of the German empire".</p>
