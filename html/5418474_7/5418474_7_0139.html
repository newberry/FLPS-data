   <p>The plan which this Company has adopted for the management of its three theaters is excellent, as it benefits the management, the artists and the general public. It works as follows: The company is divided and studies three plays, one for each unit, and these in turn will be produced at the three theaters. The Company is benefitted in so far as each play is produced three times, and as it can afford to spend three times as much as for a single performance. The actors have an opportunity to study their parts thoroughly and the public gains by the better productions which the system makes possible.</p>
   <p>To-day's programs: "Apollo Theater," the great musical-farce, "The Wild Cat."</p>
   <p>Aurora Turnhalle, the pleasing Operetta "Mariette and Jeanetton," Two Daughters of the Regiments, or the "Marriage Before the Drum." Miss Martha Weick and Miss Mizi Sereni have the leading roles.</p>

   <p>Mueller's Hall: Miss Bertha Ahlfeld in the bravura part, "Jane Eyre," "The Orphan of Lowood." -L. Schinder as Rochester.</p>
   <p>Hepner Theater.</p>
   <p>At Labor-Hall, W. 12th St., corner Waller and Blue Island Ave., that hilarious, well known family portrayal with song and dancing "Bummelfritze" by Wilken, will be given. The leading role is entrusted to Mr. Zebernick. As the play is exceedingly interesting and offers a profusion of comical scenes, an enjoyable evening may be anticipated.</p>
   <p>Freiberg's Opera-House.</p>
   <p>In this popular theater of the South-side, a first-night performance is announced; "The Coal-Mayors"; a delightful farce with music. That the artists for the various parts have been carefully chosen, and that the stage management was most exacting needs hardly to be stressed when one considers the proven leadership of the director, L. Grobecker.</p>

   <p>At the above hall the Character-farce by Dr. H. Mueller, music by R. Bial will be produced. Its title, "From Step to Step" may well be called a picture of life set to music. The exceptionally realistic and comical figures of this play follow an idea advocated by the Spanish author. Calderon, who treated life as if it were a mere dream. Two capable artists for these parts have been found in the Misses Von Bergere and C.L. Lucas, as both are endowed with melodious voices.</p>
   <p>Theater-Walsh Hall.</p>
   <p>The above hall, which has a seating capacity of 2000 and is splendidly arranged for theatrical performances, will be used by the Jean Wormser Company tonight. The tragedy "St. Genoueva" and also the epilog "Schmerzenreich" are on the program. The most suitable artists have been selected for all the parts. Next Saturday evening the troupe will feature the same play at the Almira Turnhall.</p>
