   <p>Music Director G. Katzenberger has succeeded in conjunction with some prominent Germans to establish German classes for free singing lessons.</p>
   <p>These lessons are meant particularly for women and children. Since the teaching of German and singing instructions have fallen off considerably in the Public Schools, the said free classes will contribute a lot towards the preservation of the German song and language. It is up to the Germans of Chicago to cooperate in this direction with Mr. Katzenberger, who must be particularly praised for his unselfish, patriotic efforts. The free singing lessons will be given at the following places:</p>
   <p>Yung's Hall, Ashland and Lincoln Avenue,</p>
   <p>Ziesler's Hall, 632 N. Clark Street,</p>
   <p>Hoerber's Hall, Blue Island Avenue and 21st Street</p>
   <p>Southside Turnerhall, State St &amp; 32nd Street</p>
   <p>John Michel's Hall, Western Avenue and Indiana,</p>
   <p>where any desired information will be gladly given.</p>
