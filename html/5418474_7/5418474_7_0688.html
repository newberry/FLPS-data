   <p>The first concert of North American Choral society is history. Long before the fixed hour, thousands of visitors crowded into the festively decorated hall of the Coliseum. The singers on the large stand, early took their places and offered a beautiful picture because of their large numbers. Punctually at the fixed hour Mr. Frederic Stock, the conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, took his position and the crowd of about 15,000 people rose, and from the throats of all those thousands arose the beautiful American national hymn: "America".</p>
   <p>With the "Meistersinger" prelude, this wonderful composition of the German maestro, Richard Wagner, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra opened the concert proper. Could there be found a more appropriate musical creation as an overture to the great German singing festival? The orchestra, under the direction of its excellent leader, in spite of the unfavorable acoustic conditions, as always, performed very brilliantly, which deserves praise.</p>
   <p>The German Song.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Just like the first spring storm, which sweeps away the snow from the fields, impressive as the cathedral bells ringing the "Ave", but also powerful as the sublime chords of an organ, sounded the tunes of the beautiful old song, "Harmony", sung by the Chicago Singing Festival Men's Chorus, with out orchestra accompaniment, under the leadership of Karl Reckzeh. Reckzeh has a reputation as a clever leader, and it can be said, that his and the performance of his singers, exceeded all expectations. The "German Song" by Attenhofer, worthily joined, and carried by inner conviction, resounded. "Whether in his own country, or in a strange place, the true son of Germany lives, o German song, you can gladden the heart, that is surrounded by silent happiness". Was it applause, this roaring, which mixed with the final sounds of the song, or was it the appreciation of the thousands , who touched by the beautiful performance, gave expression of their feelings, with loud applause.</p>
   <p>Marie Gundelius.</p>
   <p>Mary Gundelius, the prima donna of the New York Metropolitan Opera Company, sang the aria from Tannhauser, "You Dear Hall" in a masterful way. In spite of the large size of the room, the artist's voice penetrated strongly and fully. She is a Wagner singer of sterling worth, commands an excellent <span class="page-break">3</span>pronunciation, a main proviso for all Wagner singers, and her voice is, in spite of largeness and strength, prepossessing and rounded. She received stormy applause, for which she thanked them with the addition of "Du bist die Ruh" by Schubert. To her performance must be credited a large part of yesterday evening's success.</p>
   <p>The Mixed Chorus.</p>
   <p>The "Hallelujah" from Handel's "Messiah" sung by the mixed choir of the Chicago Sangerfest, under the direction of William Boppler, may be considered as one of the best offered in yesterday's concert. The conductor understands how to hold the large chorus in his hands, to control the tempo and especially masterly are the pianissimo effects, which are of such clearness and beauty, that they appear to be unbelievable considering the large number of singers participating. It is therefore easily explained, why King George the First of England, at the introduction in 1741, was so impressed with "Hallelujah", that he rose from his chair, all those present following his example and standing listened to the powerful song, and in this way honored the great German genius, who created this wonderful work.</p>
