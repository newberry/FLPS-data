   <p>The Concordia League, the well-known association of sixty-five Lutheran congregations of Chicago and vicinity, will give its annual concert and entertainment next Wednesday evening at 8 P. M. in Wicker Park Hall, 2040 West North Avenue. [Translator's notes: The author of this article is in error when he states that the Concordia League is an association of sixty-five congregations of Chicago and vicinity. The fact is that the membership of the League is derived from sixty-five Lutheran congregations of Chicago and vicinity, i. e., some members of the individual congregations hold membership in the League, and within their own circle they constitute a branch of the League. Concordia League was founded about thirty years ago, principally for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a Lutheran high school. The school is known as the Luther Institute. It is located at 120 North Wood Street and enjoys an excellent reputation among the businessmen of Chicago. Later the League organized its own benefit society, which grew very rapidly and soon became the chief objective of the League, the management of Luther Institute having been assumed by a committee representing the Lutheran churches of Chicago and vicinity affiliated with the Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America. The Concordia League accordingly changed its name to the Concordia Mutual Benefit Association. It maintains offices at 20 Wacker Drive.]</p>
