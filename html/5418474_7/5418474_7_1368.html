   <p>A statement issued by the new executive committee of the German Group of the World's Fair is as follows: "Politics has no place in our ranks, we are a non-political organization, and we want to remain such. Whether Democrats, Republicans, Catholic, Lutherans, or Jews, everyone who is willing to promote the German group's representation at the World's Fair in 1933, is welcome. Should the German-Americans of Chicago, obtain political influence once more, they owe it to Mayor Thompson, who counted them among his followers. As a German group of the World's Fair, we have nothing to do with politics, but will support everything that will tend to increase recognition for Chicago's German-Americans." Guided by these principles, Ernest J. Kruetgen, president of the executive committee of the German group, refused to affiliate the German-American group with any political organization, yesterday at a meeting at the Bismark Hotel.</p>
