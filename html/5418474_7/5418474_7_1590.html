   <p>Several prominent Germans of the Northside are much interested in the plan, to buy the German House of the World's fair, and to remove it to Lincoln Park. The affair was not yet discussed with the Park Commissioners, and it is hardly possible that they will consider the plan. One of them gave as his personal opinion, that no more buildings should be placed in Lincoln Park and that all available space should be used for planting and for resting places. There are in the immediate vicinity of Lincoln Park many pieces of land that are just as suitable for the project as the park itself.</p>
