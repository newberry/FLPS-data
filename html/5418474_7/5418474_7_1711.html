Nothing was lacking as the Arrangement Committee had done all that was possible. Unlimited joyfulness reigned the whole evening till the early morning hours; and with certainly it can be said that the vistors of the festival counted the time spent at the masquerade as one of the joyful and agreeable of the season.
