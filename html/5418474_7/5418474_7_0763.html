   <p>To give aid to the cultivation of German folk songs the Chicago Turngermeinde instituted a singing school for children in which teacher Schmidthofer will give instruction. The lessons will be given every Saturday from 9 to 10 for the smaller children and from 10 to 11 for the larger children, and the instruction is absolutely free.</p>
