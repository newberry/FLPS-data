   <p>The singing club Frohsinn-Mozart held its annual fall concert Sunday. It was directed by Helmut Steinmetz, and was aided by numerous affiliated organizations. It was held in the South Side Viking Temple, 6855 Emerald Avenue. It was effected in such a manner that words of appreciation are quite in order. At the center of the concert was the personality of the director, Helmut Steinmetz, conducting not only the home organization, but also the Wiener Waeldler Singing Club, which gave a couple of songs, and the Germania Orchestra, whose concert was enjoyed by everyone, as well as the dance music which followed.</p>
   <p>Following the opening number, the overture to the opera "Martha" by the Germania Orchestra, the singers of Frohsinn-Mozart assembled on the stage to sing the melodious Wagnerian song "Seemannstrenc". Here, as at the <span class="page-break">\2</span>beginning of the second part, in which they played "Heimatrosen", by Opladen, and "Die Auserwaehlte", the choral singing was well blended and the songs effective, because these songs were familiar and because they were supercharged with affection and a bit of humor. Earned applause came from the audience. The Wiener Waeldler Singing Club chose two popular songs, "Here ist Trumpf" and "Seifenblasen", which were very well received. Led by their director, L. Lohmiller, the Arion male chorus of the South Side offered the light-winged song "Waldlust" by Fuellerkruss in a lovely manner.</p>
   <p>Besides these two organizations the G. V. Calumet, under J. Memmelsheimer gave a couple of songs, "Heute scheid' ich" and "Rheinreise". The concert was closed by a song with orchestral accompaniment, by Frohsinn-Mozart. It was intended to crown the whole concert and won the appreciation of the audience. Pleasant additions were the songs of the tenor soloist, Rudi Martini, who sang Lowe's "Tom der Reiner", and a melody from the tune film "Laughing heirs". As an encore he sang the Gipsy song from "Countess <span class="page-break">\3</span>Maritza" displaying, as he sang, good talent and training. After the concert was a sedate ball, which kept the guests together still longer. That the affair was a success is to the credit of the fest committee, which was composed of the following gentlemen: O. W. Roesler, chairman; Joseph Moeller, treasurer; C. Roesler, secretary; and committee members Hermann J. Friesenhahn, Justus Emme, C. Schultz, Stanley Plitzka, Wilhelm Frost, Andrew Friedrich, Hermann W. Friesenhahn, Ernst Tiegs, Wilhelm Stahlheber, and Rudolf Zimmermann.</p>
