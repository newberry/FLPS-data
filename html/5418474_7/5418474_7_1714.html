   <p>The Labor Aid Society gave an entertainment with a ball last Saturday evening at Yondorff Hall.</p>
   <p>The program was a selection of pleasing songs.</p>
   <p>The monologue " Das Schneeweisse Haar" (The Snow White Hair), recited by Mr. Ch. Keiter, was a remarkable performance and should be mentioned particularly. All festivity-arrangments were in the hands of Messrs. C. A. Thielmann, Wm. Farmendt, H. F. Siebach and Wm. Klein.</p>
   <p>A dance kept the folks together till late in the night.</p>
