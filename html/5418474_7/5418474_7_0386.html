   <p>On the occasion of its last business meeting, which was attended by thirty-four active singers, the recently founded Aurora Maennergesangverein (Men's Singing Club) unanimously voted to join the Saengerbund des Nordwestens.</p>
   <p>The president of the Saengerbund, Mr. Wehrwein of Chicago, explained the purposes of the Bund. Because of existing conditions, he regards the merger of German organizations as an urgent necessity. Mr. Wehrwein advised the organization to join one of the large associations now in existence (Saengerbund des Nordwestens, Nordamerikanicher Saengerbund, etc.), and so to come in contact with other German organizations.</p>
