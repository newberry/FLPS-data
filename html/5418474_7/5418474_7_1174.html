   <p>The first large picnic given by the Illinois Federation of Germans and Austrians in Frank Simon's Grove, 117th Street and Homan Avenue, was successful, and many guests were present. We were not surprised at the large crowd, due to the fact that the membership of the organization is chiefly derived from political circles of the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth and Nineteenth Wards.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Federation of Germans and Austrians was founded about two years ago and already it has a membership of twelve thousand. It is planning to expand its activities to other districts of the city. The aims of the Federation are political in so far as the support of candidates of German and Austrian origin is concerned; its party affiliations are of secondary importance. The Federation believes that in this way it can effectively help citizens of German blood to gain political recognition, so that German-Americans need no longer forego the position which they deserve in political <span class="page-break">\2</span>affairs.</p>
   <p>The entertainment committee presented a program which included various types of amusements--games for young and old. Beautiful presents were awarded to the winners of the contests. Later in the afternoon there was a parade in which all the children took part; favors were given to every youngster who participated, as a reminder of this and next year's picnic.</p>
   <p>Devotees of the dance were able to enjoy this form of entertainment; the thirst and hunger of every guest was fully satisfied; and the guests finally departed, happy to have spent a few pleasant hours among Germans and Austrians of the Illinois Federation.</p>
   <p>The members of the Federation's central committee, John Hotwagner, president, and John Deutsch, secretary, made up the arrangement committee, and we are indebted to them for the entertaining features of the picnic.</p>
