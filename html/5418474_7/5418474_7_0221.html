   <p>The enormous success which Mr. Mitterwurzer scored recently in the role of Risler in the French comedy "Framont Jr. and Risler Sr.," was the cause for the repetition of that play during his present engagement. It will be remembered that we described at his previous engagement, not so long ago, the play and the great art of Mr. Mitterwurzer's acting, sufficiently enough as to refrain from a repetition. But we have to mention that this genial artist was superb in his part. In that great scene in Act 4, when there is the unmasking of his unfaithful wife, the audience burst into wild applause.</p>
