   <p>"Reason has prevailed; every discord has vanished in the face of an iron necessity to make the first step towards unification of a triparted branch of a people whose fate has been the same for centuries....What holds us together, knowingly or unknowingly, for centuries found its visible expression of friendship faster, and never ask, 'Who art thou, or who is that one?' We must faithfully stand by our flag, and bow in reverence before the flags of our fellow men. Want, which has visited us like a tempest, must not make us despair and, if want has caused ruin, we can be well convinced that soon new life will sprout from these ruins. Austrians, German-Hungarians and Volga Germans, united we want to step into the lines of our other German brothers and remain there until victory is ours...."</p>
   
   <p>Under this sign stood the fest which was celebrated yesterday at the Court of Honor in the Hall of Science of the World's Fair. Without emphasizing the harmony underlying this festival, one might have noticed that persons joined together there who once belonged to one and the same realm, the monarchy on the Danube. But it was much more. Not only did the fest committee do its best to prepare a good program, but also the co-operators did their best to render the individual numbers of the program in such a manner that it clearly manifested their joy in what they did, and thus showed the results of their striving to provide real joy, and visual pleasure to all participants of the festival.</p>
   <p>Everything proceeded without friction. The fest management had everything under control. The individual numbers of the program followed one another with no interruption and, because of that, the program, rich though it was, required but little time. Fatigue of the audience was nonexistent.</p>
   
   <p>The god of the weather had good intentions toward the festival. Even though the sun was burning hotly during the noon hours, it soon was changed. The sky clouded slightly, as though with a veil, and the north wind began to blow strongly from the lake. Thus the audience could take in all that was offered with real enjoyment, sitting in the pleasant cool air. No one will deny the management and its co-operators his gratitude and acknowledgement for the beautiful day.</p>
   <p>In the Court of Honor, every seat was taken, and a large number of "fence guests" gathered about the great space. And one remained "put," although the Fair beckoned with its many attractions.</p>
   <p>Densely crowded throngs of people fringed the Avenue of Flags where the festive procession went by from the Court of Honor in front of the Administration Building toward the festive place before the Hall of Science.</p>
   
   <p>The advance guard was formed by a battery of field artillery from Fort Sheridan, a company of infantry and a detachment of cavalry of the federal army. They all had their flags, and were headed by a captain in gala uniform. Behind them came the parade marshal, Daniel Jaeger, on horseback, and Georg Lovitz' orchestra.</p>
   <p>Headed by the parade marshal, Konrad Gerstenbrand, the first to march were the German-Austrian organizations. They marched with the flag of the United Austro-Hungarian organizations and the individual member organizations. They were followed by an allegorical group, symbolizing fraternization, composed of the ladies: Anne Martin as Miss Columbia, Julia Steigerweldt as Miss Volga German, Lillian Heine as Miss Liberty, Crete Taborsky as Miss Austria, and Beatrice Schutz as Miss German-Hungaria.</p>
   <p>In the parade, which almost completely filled the Avenue of Flags, the costume groups were particularly pleasant to look at, because their garb was something unknown to many. Among them the Schubert group of the Vienna-American Ladies' Aid Society, the Swabian Kirmess, and the group of bird trainers of the Illinois Canary and Bird Trainers' Organization received particular attention and were, on passing by, photographed by many. The pageant pleased generally because it proceeded without friction.</p>
   <p>Marching in the German-Austrian group were the United Austro-Hungarian organizations. Marshal Andreas Jakobi, a mass chorus, Alpenlander men's chorus, Burgenlander Liedertafel, singing section of the Hungarian National K.U.V., South Side Saengerbund, South Hungarian Singing Club, Styrian Saengerbund, and the Vienna Woods Saengerbund.</p>

   <p>The rear of the parade was made up of the Volga Germans, headed by their own group marshal, Christ Ruppel. The group was composed of the main organization and all branches of the Volga German organization. First marched the orchestra of the Volga Germans, accompanying the parade with music. Following it were the costumed groups, which were joined by the bund of the Volga Germans and all its sections.</p>
   <p>Before the paraders arrived in the Court of Honor, a large part of the guests of honor were already present. Representing the mayor was County Clerk Robert M. Sweitzer; he made a brief speech. Representing Rufus C. Dawes was Charles S. Peterson. Among others were the Austrian consul general, Michael G. Girten, chairman of the city council Emmet Whealan, City Treasurer James A. Kearns, Jury Commissioner Neumann, Major Schultz representing the National Guard, Captain G. Martling, Ernst J. Kruetgen, and a number of presidents of German organizations.</p>
   <p>When the participants of the parade occupied their seats, it took only a short time for the official fest program to get under way.</p>
   <p>The program was divided in three parts: The first part was taken over by the Austrians, then came the German-Hungarians, and then the Volga Germans.</p>
   <p>The fest was opened by the chairman of the entertainment committee, Frank Taborsky. The orchestra of the German-American Musicians Aid Society played under the direction of G. Lowitz. Reinforced by the orchestra of the Volga Germans, they played the American national anthem as the American flag was raised.</p>
   
   <p>Then followed the old Austrian national hymn, and proudly "Red-White-Red" was displayed in the wind.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Heinrich Heine recited a prologue composed by Hermann Branden.</p>
   <p>Then Jack W. Kobalte, chairman of the festival committee, stepped before the microphone, and in a few words that went to the hearts of all, he welcomed the guests of honor and the festive assembly.</p>
   <p>The Austrian-American World's Fair March, composed and directed by E. Dorazil, was played excellently by the orchestra.</p>
   <p>Next came the singers, conducted by Franz Beidel's baton. A mass chorus was assembled, consisting of the following singing clubs: Alpenlander Men's Chorus, Burgenland Liedertafel, Burgenland Men's Chorus, Singing Section of Hungarian National S.B.S., South Side Saengerbund, South-Hungarian Singing Club, Styrian Saengerbund, and the Vienna Woods Singing Club. The singers were all stationed within the large tent on the stage. The acoustics were excellent, so that the two songs "Alpensohn" and "Heimkehr" sounded truly beautiful and melodious. Rich applause rewarded the singers.</p>
   <p>Consul General Michael Girten took the floor. He sincerely regretted that His Excellency, Edgar Prochick, was prevented from participating at the festival in person. He [Girten] was ordered to substitute for the ambassador. His heart rejoiced that he could speak before such a large number of guests. He thanked the fest committee for the work done in such abundance, and hoped that this festival would be instrumental in showing other nationalities that Austria has no reason to keep in hiding even though, because of hard times, it was not represented by a house of its own on the fair grounds. It would have liked to have one.</p>
   <p>Frau Hildegard Kramer appeared as soloist with the Schubert song "Anfenthalt". There is no need to say more about it. The public stormed, demanding more, but the fest management interfered, in keeping with its promise to keep the program as brief as possible. Frau Kramer then sang, together with Max Bratt, the song everyone always likes to hear again, "Wer uns getraut," from the "Gipsy Baron". Herr Bratt gave an interpretation all his own.</p>
   <p>A stir went through the audience as the Styrians gathered for their dance. Great applause greeted the popular costume dancers as they marched toward the stage. Cries of joy were heard when the Styrians began the movements of their beautiful popular dances. Siegfried Weiss headed the Gamsgebirg people, D'Wildschuetz'n, the Rosegger Styrian Club, and the Styrian group of dancers. Especial mention should be made of the little ones who did their work well, or were at least not behind the adults in zeal.</p>
   <p>At a recess between two dances, a table was quickly carried in, and the two well-known yodlers Joseph Lene and Karl Wieser took their turns. Wieser played the accompaniment on the zither. The two would have had to continue for some time longer with their presentations had time permitted. With the Schuhplattlers, Austria's part of the program came to a close.</p>
   
   <p>Herr John Hess took over the microphone from Herr Taborsky to function as announcer. To the sounds of a sprightly march, the members of the Austro-Hungarian Military Sick Benefit Society marched to the stage, followed by the ladies of the German-Hungarian Ladies' Benefit Society, dressed in their beautiful white uniforms. With the military society forming the stage background and the singers decoratively occupying the elevated seats, the ladies performed a short but pretty drill which brought forth sustained applause.</p>
   <p>The stage was then flanked by the ladies and from within the tent resounded a Strauss waltz, "An der schoenen blauen Donau", played by the orchestra.</p>
   <p>Standing in the midst of his countrymen, the veteran Joseph Maschek made an address from which the words of the introduction to this article came. The participants listened in devotion to the words of the tireless champion fighter for the preservation of the German language and the customs of the the fathers. A noticeable stir went through the audience as he urged them to unity, and as he expressed his pride in being an American citizen, his greater pride in having descended from Germans, and his desire to remain a German to the end of his days.</p>
   <p>Now the juniors of the German-Hungarian group took the floor. They performed the festival dances for a Kirmess as it is customarily done in every old German-Hungarian community. These youngsters did their work excellently, and many an oldster itched to leap upon the stage and join with the others. The polka wasn't much of a success; it is just not possible in this country to kill the all-powerful "jazz step".</p>
   <p>The final number consisted of a Transylvanian wedding celebration by the First Transylvanian Saxons Sick Benefit Society.</p>
   <p>Lack of space makes it impossible to mention all participants by name. They will have to take comfort in the knowledge of having offered something to the participants of the fest that was never before seen in a similar fashion, and to have been instrumental in adding materially to the joy of the festival.</p>
   <p>Then came a brief recess. E. Dorazil gathered the orchestra of his conservatory around him to be held in readiness to provide the musical background for the part of the program reserved for the Volga Germans.</p>
   <p>The Volga Germans had selected something special for themselves. Dancing master Petri, formerly master of the ballet at the Chicago Civic Opera, undertook to perform a few dances from Borodin's opera "Prince Igor," in which he was assisted by members of his school. He personally rehearsed all the dances and took care of the costumes for the men and women dancers.</p>
   <p>Before he could begin, however, the parade marshal of the group, Christ Ruppel, spoke a few words to the participants of the fest and presented a few of Volga German leaders.</p>
   
   <p>Then the dance began. Large-eyed, the audience followed the supple motions of the girls, the wild leaps of the men until, after a stormy dance, there came again some calm into the movements of the performers which slowly grew into an apotheosis of the joy to live. Herr Dorazil adjusted himself perfectly to the dancers; Herr Petri may be quite proud of his own and his pupils' exploits.</p>
   <p>The fest committee, which went to all sorts of pains to arrange the performance down to the smallest detail, consisted of the following gentlemen and ladies:</p>
   <p>Consul General Michael F. Girten, honorary president; Dr. Jack W. Kobalter, president; John J. Hess, first vice-president; Frau Josephine Braun, third vice-president; Frank K. Waldherr, second vice-president; Frau Rose Austin, fourth vice-president; Frank P. Anderwald, corresponding secretary; Mathias Jeme, financial secretary; Ludwig Gebert, recording secretary and treasurer; Frank Ellmer, Frau Katharina, Wingert and Nick Zimmermann, finance committee; Frank Taborsky, chairman of entertainment; Daniel Jaeger, great marshal; Konrad Gerstenbrand, marshal of the Austrians; George Schopper, marshal of the Geman-Hungarians; Christ Ruppel, marshal of the Volga Germans.</p>
   <p>Members of the management; Alex Braun, Edward Dorazil, Gabriel Jung, Georg Kaft, Peter Lessiak, Michael Schaut.</p>
   <p>Women's Section: Frau Kathatina Wingert, chairman; Frau Eleanor Rovill, Frau Anna Pechloff, Frau Barbara Edinger, Frau Anna Kaft, Frau Anna Freifogel, Frau Anna Strama, Frau Minna Boyer.</p>
   <p>Junior League: Miss Anna Martin, chairman; Miss Grete Taborsky, Miss Beatrice Schutz, Miss Helene Maschek, Miss Evelyne Wischmann, Miss Rose Artner, Miss Anna Kaft, Miss Anna Laub.</p>
   
   <p>As a prelude to the celebration, and in order to give the out-of-town visitors an opportunity to get acquainted with their Chicago countrymen, there was a reception last Saturday evening in the large hall of the Lincoln Turnhalle. It was an unconventional, easy-going affair with a short and succeeding dance.</p>
   <p>The program was opened at 9 P.M. with a recital by Edward Dorazil's orchestra. Later in the evening, they gave many more musical numbers and also played for the dance. Her Ludwig Gebert was master of ceremonies. The guests were entertained with songs by Herr Joseph Lenz and Miss Anne-Marie Gertz, and with humorous recitations by Herr Jose Danner.</p>
   <p>Later in the evening the president, Dr. Kobalter, welcomed all those present, and especially the presidents of all individual organizations of the Austrians, German-Hungarians and Volga Germans which participated at the fest. Then he presented a number of guests of honor, among them the Austrian consul general, Michael F. Girten, the editor of the Abendpost, Paul F. Mueller, and many others, among them the representatives of the larger German organizations in the city, such as singers, turners, German benefits bund, the Swabian organization, etc. Also many ladies and gentlemen from the committee of German Day, which was recently observed, were present.</p>
   <p>Speeches were made by the chairman, Consul General Girten, Herr John Hess, as representative of the German-Hungarians, and by Herr Dorazil, representing the Volga Germans.</p>
   <p>At the close of the official program, a large number of the visitors to the honor day of the Austrians, German-Hungarians and Volga Germans crowded into the German-American house on the second floor, where a Munich-Dachan farmers' orchestra, alternating with the Chicago Mandolin orchestra, kept playing. The bar-restaurant proved a most popular place.</p>
