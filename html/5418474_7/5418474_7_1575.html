   <p>At the North Side Turner Hall which was tastefully decorated for this occasion, a great number of German patriots and their ladies assembled for the banquet celebrating the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Peace of Frankfort. Weege's Military Band opened the program with Weber's Jubilation Overture, while the participating Veteran Organizations marched into the hall with their banners and flags. Judge Brentano, introduced as festival president by Mr. George Buettner, delivered a short address, in which he reminded the audience of the magnificent peace celebration of twenty-five years ago by the German population of Chicago. He expressed his satisfaction that the united Germany not only in arms but also in the peaceful domains of arts and sciences, does take a leading position. E. F. L. Gauss recited a self-composed prologue. Dr. Karl Buenz, the German Consul was the first speaker. Mr. Henry Hachmeister proposed a toast for Kaiser Wilhelm the First. President William Meyer of the Plattdeutsche Central Association of North America pictured the ruggedness of the German people before the victorious war against France. After singing of "Heil Dir, Germania" and playing of the Parisian Entrance March, Mr. Emil Hoechster gave a toast to the 'true uniter of Germany' the "Old Chancellor Bismarck", to whom then a telegram was sent. The outstanding oratorical achievement of the evening was delivered by the Justice of the Peace, Max Eberhardt, with the topic "The Germans in America before and after the War of 1870 to 1871". He pictured the pioneer work of the Germans in America, their brave intervention for the endangered Union; their quiet civilizing work for the social and harmonious life and the beautiful arts. Gratefully the orator acknowledged that the unification of the German people prevents the Germans abroad from parting too quickly with their nationality. With an appeal for the new fatherland Mr. Eberhardt closed his speech: "With the enthusiasm with which the greatness of our old fatherland does overpower me, I would like to issue to you, at this moment, the warning that - just as the old fatherland has become strong and mighty by your assistance - your new fatherland does need this aid in order not to be detained on the road to progress, in order that it does raise its voice for justice and freedom in the council of the nations, in order that the teachings of a Washington and Jefferson do not only find willing ears, but also strong arms for their defense!"</p>
   <p>Several musical numbers and two addresses, one by Mr. George Buettner about "Germany as a Bulwark of Peace" and one by Dr. J. A. Schmidt who paid due tribute to Womanhood, brought a satisfying conclusion to this patriotic festivity.</p>
