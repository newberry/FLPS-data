   <p>At the monthly meeting of the Vereinigte Saenger (United Singers), which took place yesterday at Forest Park, in conjunction with the anniversary festival of the Harlem Maennerchor, (Male Chorus) a resolution was made, following the usual business discussions, to conduct combined quarterly rehearsals for all singers of the joint organizations. This will enable them to present a few songs without special preparation, whenever such an occasion arises.</p>
   <p>The first of these joint rehearsals was set for Sunday, January 8, at 9:30 A. M. The joint organizations are requested to prepare thoroughly the following songs which are to be sung at the rehearsal: "Abendglocken rufen," "Waldmorgen," and "Heimatsrosen".</p>
