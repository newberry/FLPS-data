   <p>The preparations for the great Concert to be given on March 15th in the auditorium, are already made and the rehearsals, under the direction of Mr. Babatkos, have already begun in Uhlich's Hall last Sunday. The most difficult songs were gone through, and it was shown that each individual society has extensively practiced and that under such conditions, a brilliant success of the concert may be expected. There are altogether seven Men's Choruses on the Program, of which three execute artistic singing with orchestra accompaniment and four folks songs.</p>
   <p>An excellent orchestra of 50 pieces, also prominent soloists, are engaged for the concert. Total rehearsals from now on will be held each Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock, in Uhlich's northern Hall.</p>
