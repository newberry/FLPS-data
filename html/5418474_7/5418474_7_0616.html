   <p>Seldom have such storms of applause been heard as yesterday in the North Side Turner Hall, where members of the Steuben club of Chicago were guests at an afternoon concert given by the Philharmonic orchestra, playing under the eminent leadership of Richard Czerwonky.</p>
   <p>The concert was in belated celebration of Washington's birthday and because of the presence of members of the Steuben Club, was also dedicated to Baron von Steuben. During the intermission, Walter W. L. Meyer, vice-president of the Steuben Club, spoke about George Washington and Von Steuben.</p>
   <p>He told about the life of the Baron, and read von Steuben's last address to Congress. He also read the last letter George Washington had written to his friend, the Baron.</p>
