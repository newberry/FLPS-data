   <p>Last night, the Lieder Tafel (Song circle) Forward held its annual masquerade with customary, brilliant success. Animated by the genuine carnival spirit countless masks, part of them gorgeously costumed and Masked groups amused themselves, leaving life's daily vicissitudes behind them. Among the groups, those composed of the ladies and gentlemen of the Rheinischen Vereins (River Rhine Club) and the Zwiebel-Orchester (Onion Orchestra), the latter by members of the song circle Forward, proved most prominent. The grand march, led by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kellermann, in the role of prince and princess was accompanied by showers of confetti and made a most colorful picture. The entire arrangement produced one of those festivities, which this Club knows so well to prepare, that the participants experienced a most joyful evening which they are not likely to forget.</p>
