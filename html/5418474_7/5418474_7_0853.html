   <p>If the Auditorium has been created for the sole purpose of reviving Italian Opera, by providing scintillating surroundings, then its owners must have realized, after yesterday's concert, that German music cannot readily be eliminated. It required no exceptional advertising, no $5000 per evening singers or songstress, no fabulous decorations nor costumes to help "German Song" to a vertiable glorious triumph. Although this concert was not proclaimed and heralded as a "fashionable event" the spacious Audition Theater was filled to the point of overflowing. The enthusiasm of that tremendous audience plainly showed, after this rather modest impretending performance, that the German music is endowed with an unconquerable, indestructable virility, which mocks all competition. The gentlemen, Fd. Peck and his cohorts will be forced to admit, that their Italian-galvanizing-experiments are useless. It is not necessary to resort to exaggerations to give justice to last night's accomplishments.</p>

   <p>Orchestra and solo parts were excellent. The unassuming German folk song, in which German sentiment finds its greatest expression, recorded its greatest victory. The renditions of Frederic Barbarossa and "In The Cool Ground" given in genuine German fashion, left no one unmoved. Mr. Knorr, Miss Johnston never were better.</p>
