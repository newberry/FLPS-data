   <p>The New German Theater, at the Social Turnhall, under the direction of Mr. Mittlacher, is progressing very nicely. The performance of last Sunday was well attended and met with much acclaim. Stage Manager, Mr. Grundlach, deserves great commendation for his tasteful, proficient managing of the play: "The Proposal at Heligoland."</p>
   <p>Jack Trolle gave an excellent portrayal of the boatman; likewise Miss Lucas, Claere and Mr. Roth William, whose song numbers met with generous approval. Hannes Pump had the laughing element on his side. The smaller parts were well represented and deserve praise.</p>
   <p>Just keep it up!</p>
