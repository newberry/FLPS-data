   <p>The "German Warriors Club of Chicago, has made the following appeal: In all towns and villages of Germany especially in Berlin and Leipzig, the Sedan festival will be celebrated September 2nd in a magnificent manner. The German Press and also the American ones have already informed us, two years ago, that we are expected to join these celebrations over there and that we will be received very warmly.</p>
   <p>Though a long time has past since those memorable days, they will remain unforgettable to those, who have risked their lives for the glory of their fatherland. All those fighters of 1864, 1866, 1870 and 1871 have helped to form a united Germany, which protects its citizens in all parts of the world. We also, in the great free land of America, of which we have become citizens, have felt the advantage to be descendants of a United Germany, great and mighty and not torn up as before. The majority of our fighters have become old and grey, and many have been laid to an eternal rest. Only the minority will be able to celebrate the festival with their still living conrades in the <span class="page-break">2</span>midst of the German people. We as the last surviving ones will also soon be called to the great army. Because of this the Chicago Veterans have already planned for years to send an excursion to Germany to enjoy some happy hours with the still living companions in arms. Many applications, to take part, have come in from all parts of the country, which shows the tremendous interest in this affair.</p>
   <p>Comrades! You are invited in the first place! Naturally everybody can take part in the excursion, but it is essential, that all former soldiers of the German Army, who wish to take part in the entran ce march in Berlin shall announce this especially in their application. Prices have been so reduced, that everybody can take part.</p>
