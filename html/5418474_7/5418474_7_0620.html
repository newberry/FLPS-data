   <p>A simple "song evening" was announced, and turned out to be a festival of heavenly singing - because singing is a gift of God. On such occasions, this can always be observed anew. The violins, flutes and horns also make music but the most beautiful and noble is still the human voice.</p>
   <p>Of the chorus recitals the best was, unwilling as we are to admit it, the two pieces in English, Negro spiritual songs. Which of the two was more beautiful and touching, or more beautifully sung, it is hard to decide. It could not have been any better: this distribution of light and shadow, from the most delicate pianissimo, to the strongest fortissimo in "Listen to the Lambs," the shading in mezzoforte of "Deep River."</p>

   <p>The soprano-solo of Mrs. Anna Langrich fitted beautifully in the first piece. Next came a Swabian folk song, which was sung admirably. With the 43rd Psalm by Mendelssohn and the "Waters of Babylon" by Gounod, the accompaniment of the orchestra would have been welcome, although both were written for A Capella chorus.</p>
   <p>Luella Melius possesses one of the most beautiful voices I was ever privileged to hear. She proved yesterday, that she is at home in all types of singing. The coloratura aria is just as easy for her, as the simple lyric song. After the highly dramatic performance of the "Gypsy Girl" by Hugo Wolf, with the shrill laughter and the scream, she appears to be predestined to become a Wagner singer.</p>
