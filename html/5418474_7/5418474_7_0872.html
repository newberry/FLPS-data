   <p>The executive board of the North American Singers' Alliance held its final session yesterday evening at Quincy Number Nine. Franz Amberg presided, and Oskar Schmidt was recording secretary.</p>
   <p>The first item on the agenda was a report by Mr. Bucher, treasurer of the committee on arrangements, giving an account of the proceeds from the New Ulm concert; according to the figures the net receipts amounted to $411.39. [Translator's note: New Ulm, a town in Minnesota, settled principally by Germans, was destroyed by a cyclone. The community, some years before,had contributed a carload of flour to Chicago after the fire, and therefore the Germans took up collections to help the people of the stricken city.] The assembly thanked the committee for its efforts, and Mr. Bucher was requested to give this sum to Mr. Madlner [probably Madlener or Madler], treasurer of the Chicago Relief Committee.</p>

   <p>A bill for diplomas, amounting to $65, was ordered paid. Other bills.....</p>
   <p>Vice-president Bucher then delivered a short address, thanking [President Franz] Amberg for his efforts in behalf of the song festival, and he gave to the president an honorary diploma, in conformity with a resolution passed at a previous meeting. In accepting the proffered document Mr. Amberg suggested organizing a Chicago singers' alliance and emphasized the fact that it would be beneficial in furthering the friendly relations of the various Chicago singing societies and would promote a competitive spirit which would promote the interests of music if a suitable director could be found.</p>
   <p>As a result of Mr. Amberg's proposal the Chicago Singers' Alliance was organized forthwith. Mr. Amberg was nominated secretary pro tem and requested to communicate with all the singing societies of Chicago, inviting them to send two delegates each to a meeting scheduled for October 17 at Quincy Number Nine. The following associations immediately became affiliated:</p>

   <p>The idea of such an alliance met with an enthusiastic reception and was promptly celebrated by a Commers. [Translator's note: Commers: lunch--mostly beer.]</p>
