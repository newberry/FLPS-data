   <p>The Chicago Liederkranz gave its third concert of the season yesterday, at the North Side Turner Hall.</p>
   <p>Attendance was not as good as usual....but a select public appeared, and some of the excellent performances were given generous applause.</p>
   <p>For the opening number of the concert Carl Maria von Weber's "Jubilee Overture" was selected. This is one of the most important compositions by Weber. The work is immense in conception and some parts are awe-inspiring. [Hans] Balatka's orchestra did justice to the splendid work and revealed its beauties in full measure; it followed the composer's ideas closely, and the performance proved fascinating and elicited hearty applause for the masterly creation as well as for the excellent musicians.</p>
   <p>Ed. Schultze sang in place of Mr. Leivermann, who was indisposed. He selected <span class="page-break">2</span>the song "Der Wanderer" by Fesca....one of the outstanding works of that composer. The melody is very appealing and Mr. Schultze, a distinguished and well-trained singer, could not fail to make an impression.</p>
   <p>Mrs. H. Clair sang a cavatina from Donizetti's "Gemma di Vergy," but, though she made great efforts, was unable to arouse enthusiasm. The lady has a powerful but not very pleasant voice, and forcing in the upper register made it even less pleasant. A lack of proper schooling thus became particularly apparent. Her rendition could not possibly have been pleasing, but her efforts were rewarded with weak applause.</p>
   <p>The chorus sang Fischer's "Meeresstille und Glueckliche Fahrt" (Quiet Sea and Safe Journey); it was very good. The Liederkranz showed again that it has very capable members who are able to perform in an outstanding manner. The selection was applauded.</p>
   <p>Miss Balatka replaced Mrs. Dong, as the latter could not be present. Miss <span class="page-break">3</span>Balatka sang the "Prayer of Elizabeth," from the opera "Tannhaeuser". The melody is not very appealing, but the lady compensated for that by giving a very pleasant rendition. It became evident that her voice also is of better quality in the lower register, since in the upper register it lacks pitch. She was rewarded with hearty applause. Miss Balatka was recalled and sang Abt's "Bluemchen Am Herz" expressively and with proper sentiment.</p>
   <p>The trio from "Wilhelm Tell," sung by Messrs. Schultze, Wirtschureck, and Berechy was excellent. Exactness and precision in time were the outstanding features; it was loudly applauded and had to be repeated.</p>
   <p>For the closing number of the concert the third scene from Wagner's "Lohengrin" was given by the chorus. The latter, as well as the solos, were excellent, and formed a fitting finale.</p>
   <p>The ball at the conclusion of the concert lasted until a late hour.</p>
