   <p>A beautiful festival pamphlet with a poetic welcome-salutation was presented to every visitor at the entrance to Ogden's Grove yesterday, while above the gate a black and red banner greeted with its historical inscription: "Hie Gut Wuerttemberg Allewege." At excellent program was performed during the day, including two stage plays, "Der Schwaebische Dorf Barbier" and "Der Kleine Postillon", and that the 1893 Riesling" found warm friends needs no special mentioning.</p>
   <p>Acrobatic performances, a comic show, shadow pictures of the old country, dance and concert music, brilliant fireworks and the wonderful illumination of the park provided the entertainment of the guests of whom certainly none went home dissatisfied.</p>
