   <p>In Kimball Hall, lovers of art yesterday afternoon enjoyed the Muhlmann Opera Club's 20th opera program, under the direction of Adolph Muhlmann. The program was opened with two piano pieces, "Consolation," by Liszt, and "Caprice Espagnole" by Moszkowski, played by Miss Annette Goodman, a pupil of Maurice Rosenfeld.</p>
   <p>A waltz from "Romeo and Juliet" by Gounod, sung by Miss Agnes Ziegenhagen, followed. The young artist possesses a beautiful soprano voice, which enables her to sing in the highest range with great precision. A contrast was offered by the alto voice of Miss Helen Ornstein who sang "Ah, Mon Fils" from the "Prophet" by Meyerbeer.</p>
   <p>Several thrilling scenes from the opera "Cavalleria Rusticana" by Mascagin were sung by Leo Brande, member of the Zoo Opera in Cincinnati, Miss Clara Stensaas, an amateur and school teacher by profession, Frank Horstmeier, Cordelia Jones and Helen Ornstein. After the program a social gathering took place. Alexander Kipuis, the famous basso of the Chicago Civic Opera and his wife were present as guests of honor.</p>
