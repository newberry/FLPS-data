   <p>The management of Collmer and Isenstein has announced a comedy by Kneisel for tomorrow evening's performance for the express purpose of providing an opportunity to introduce three excellent new members of their cast, Miss Hagen, Ferdinand Welb, and Ottomar Dietz. It is highly regrettable that the company in its constant effort to provide new plays overlooks the fact that under the present circumstances, in the week of mourning [for President Garfield's death], the selection of such stage productions meets with considerable objection. However, a comedy is not a farce, and if Kniesel is the author, then such an offering becomes a pleasant up-lifting diversion which may be suitable even for a period of mourning. The play depicts the brighter aspect of life, with humorous situations, and the contrast provided by pathetic scenes inperspersed with comic tends to increase effectiveness [of the humor], and no one need fear <span class="page-break">\2</span>that attending the performance will in any way interfere with the prevailing sentiment for the beloved departed leader of our nation. To avoid the comedy would be just as exaggerated a display of mourning as to refuse to read some diverting romance, and obviously it would be ridiculous to refrain from attending and enjoying an artistically presented comedy because of consideration for the present period of sorrow. We therefore believe it fully proper to recommend attendance at tomorrow's performance at Vicker's Theater. The comedy "Die Kuckucks" (The Cuckoos) is on the program, and three new members of the cast will make their first appearance in the play. However, we print a letter received by the editor to show to the theater management what the public thinks of the selection.</p>

   <p>"'That is nice; mourning hung outside the house, and the announcement of a comedy in the window! It won't do!'</p>

   <p>"This was the declaration of a saloonkeeper of the North Side yesterday evening as he took the notice and laid it aside for future use. The man is right. Was it actually impossible to find and present some suitable drama, to write a prologue bearing on the tragedy which affects us all--something which might be read in an intermission? The theater has been proclaimed as an institution of learning time and time again, and so it might have been expected that these disseminators of intelligence would act with propriety. No fair-minded person would think of demanding that the theater should remain closed, and that all persons involved should be deprived of their earnings, but it is not too much to expect that existing conditons be considered.</p>

   <p>The sender should remember, however, that the theaters which are frequented by pious American church members offered farces and rank nonsense throughout <span class="page-break">\4</span>the entire period of mourning, and that one of the fashionable theaters of the city, in which a sermon will be preached tomorrow afternoon, offers rank attractions in the evening. Our German theater is mainly dedicated to comedies, and giving a tragedy might prove tragic, we fear.</p>
