   <p>The Concordia Men's-Chorus celebrated its 73rd anniversary at the National Hall with a concert and dance. The program was opened with several songs of the Concordia Men's-Chorus under the excellent direction of its conductor C. A. Bohler, These were followed by song recitals, performed by several singing societies who were present as guests. The management of the festival was in the hands of Messrs. Wm. F. Behrends as chairman, August Ehlers as treasurer, and Wm. Thuring as president, of the Concordia Men's-Chorus.</p>
   <p>The Concordia Men's-Chorus was established in 1857, and is one of the oldest singing-societies in Chicago. The members not only cultivated the German song, but devoted a part of the time of their meetings to mutual advice, spiritual education and interchange of ideas about the most important political questions of the day.</p>
   
   <p>The Concordia Men's Chorus has been, since 1881, one of the most active singing societies of the "North-American Singer-Bund" and was one of the founders of the United Men's-Choruses of Chicago.</p>
