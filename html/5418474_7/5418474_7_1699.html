   <p>The executive committee of the German-American Central Society met in its hall, No. 106 Randolph St., last evening to discuss the arrangements for German day, the anniversary of the landing of the first Germans in America. This day is to be celebrated Oct. 6, 1892, at which time a grand celebration is expected. The anniversary will also be celebrated on the same day of this year, though on a much smaller scale, and Anton Kneck, Mat. Goldburg, Gustav Manufsky, Frank Kock, and Richard E. Stupe were appointed a committee to make arrangements for that event.</p>
   <p>For the grander celebration an address will be sent out notifying each German society in the city to send a delegate to a general mass meeting, and at that meeting, a committee will be appointed to prepare a plan of entertainment. The date of that meeting was not decided upon, but it will be in the near future.</p>
