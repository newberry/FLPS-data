   <p>At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the 1933 World's Fair group, held yesterday, the official reception committee of the Chicago Germans was constituted under the presidency of Ernest J. Kruetgen. The proposition to form such a committee, composed of the heads of the German societies and unions had already previously been submitted to the German groups. Because two hundred delegates of international aeronautics are to be in Chicago next Thursday and Friday, Ernest J. Kruetgen was again requested by the city to receive the German delegates: Privy Counselor Fisch, Dr. E. D. Bar, director of the German Lufthansa, Otto Merkel, Director Rohobach, and Director Hamel, and to entertain them during their stay in the city. As president of the German group, Ernest J. Kruetgen proposed the appointment for the next five years of an executive committee of the German groups that will act as an <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>official reception committee for the German-American population of our city. This proposition was unaminously accepted, and a committee was created, which will represent the German people in a worthy manner, whenever prominent Germans honor our city with their presence. According to a proposition of the secretary, A. F. W. Siebel the president of the Illinois Turn District was appointed as a permanent member of the Executive Committee. The soliciting activities of the societies were duly appreciated, and what Messrs. Jauss and Oeschler of the Swabian society, and Otto C. Reich of the German Club have achieved in this respect was especially pointed out. The Women's auxiliary is doing fine and is already able to show good results.</p>
