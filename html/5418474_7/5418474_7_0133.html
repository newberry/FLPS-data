   <p>The above production is tantamount to a jovial, if not hilarious evening. Wherever this work has been performed, it has created laughter and as such was a huge success. More cannot be demanded of a farce.</p>
   <p>According to some reliable criticisms which are available to us and judging from the play itself, it must be conceded that the work is an exceptional creation destined to produce smiles galore. It is said by one or another physician--but then this is not a strictly authentic declaration, that nothing is more effective in strengthening our cardiac muscles and the proper functioning of our sluggish kidneys, than a real diaphragmatic convulsion or, if we wish to simplify it, we could say: "hearty laughter," and nothing is more suitable than "The Doubting Thomas!"</p>

   <p>I have seldom seen such an unrestrained guffawing in a German theatre as yesterday evening. This farce is indeed a rare inspiration and the author's expertness in compiling his hypnotic problems (verbatim, we would say, compelling problems, Transl.) serve fully to achieve his intended purpose.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bira will be the regisseur. (Regisseur: French stage manager; but in the German theaters this dignitary is usually, if not always an actor of long experience who also functions in the play as a regular member of the cast. We might say actor-director, but as director he has nothing to do with the financial end.</p>

   <p>He is more than what we understand by the term: "stage manager," being an artist besides. Transl.)</p>
