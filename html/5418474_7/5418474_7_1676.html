   <p>Accompanied by Fr. Berg and Secretary George Franke the German World's Fair Commissioner Privy Government Counsellor Wermuth arrived in Chicago and took residence in the Transportation Palace,as the German Representative house has not been finished yet. The cabin inspector Halle as it was mentioned before has been here for some time. The Ex-Consul Gustav Spiess and architect Hoffacker have left Germany on the 20th of this month.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wermuth praised the progress already made of the fair buildings since his last inspection. He expects with confidence a splendid success of the undertaking, and assured us that Germany will do its part. The fear of a Cholera epidemic expected to break out in the Spring, he does not think justified; he however, thinks that a law stopping immigration into the U. S. A. would greatly limit the visitors from Germany, especially, if the Hamburg and Bremen navigation Company would limit transportation or make it more difficult.</p>
