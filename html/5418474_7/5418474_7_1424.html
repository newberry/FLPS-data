   <p>Today's session of the Illinois Turnbezirk (Turner District) will have to decide whether or not the National Turner Festival of 1921 is to take place in Chicago. The business headquarters of the Turnbund (National Turner Alliance), the first speaker of which is John G. Blessing, have seen to it that the report to the Turnbezirk clarifies all questions and gives complete details of all steps taken by the organization up to the present time.</p>
   <p>The part of the report which follows is quoted verbatim: The preparations for the Turner Festival have not produced any definite results.</p>
   <p>At the special session called together to ascertain whether the Illinois <span class="page-break">\2</span>Turnbezirk had assumed a task beyond its capacity, the District committee was requested to raise a fund of fifty thousand dollars by the time the regular session was to be held. This decision was prompted by the fear that financial failure of the festival would precipitate the downfall of the Vereine [associations comprising the National Alliance]; this fear is justified by unsuccessful festivals of the past.</p>
   <p>It goes without saying that making arrangements for a festival of national scope and magnitude, like the National Turner Festival, without assuring ourselves of a fair chance of success, would be jeopardizing the existence of the Vereine. The committee is fully aware that not only its own associations and the Illinois Turnbezirk, but the Turnbund, as well, have to be protected from the consequences of a failure of the festival. Therefore the committee has not yet taken any steps which would commit the Vereine or the Turnbezirk to any definite plans that could justify our apprehensions. The committee fully realizes its responsibility. For this reason it was deemed necessary to give not only to the members of the Illinois Turnbezirk, <span class="page-break">\3</span>but also to the rest of the Vereine a detailed account of the events, circumstances, and conditions under which our delegation to the National Session assumed responsibility for the National Turner Festival.</p>
   <p>The committee believes that the purpose and size of the undertaking must be clearly understood before we commit ourselves definitely.</p>
   <p>To tell the truth the delegation of the Illinois Turnbezirk to the national convention overstepped the intentions of the last regular convention by evincing too much enthusiasm. The reasons for this are mentioned here just for the sake of information and orientation:</p>
   <p>When Turners who find that things are moving to slowly get together, they like to help the progress of their organization along a little. They are afraid that the Turnbund may some day fall asleep because of old age, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and at these meetings they usually make all kinds of suggestions, reasonable and absurd, because they believe that things should be "different". In their former self-imposed isolation the Turners were not confronted with the problem of dealing with the consequences of the war, National Prohibition, or differences in attitude which were formerly latent but which have now turned into open hostility to German-Americans and everything German. The worth-while ideas which our organization has espoused were adopted to a large extent, but our organization itself, and to a certain degree our splendid achievements in building up this country, have remained comparatively unknown. Our organization has known considerable local success; in some cases the success of individuals has been remarkable, but it has been of local significance and has remained unknown outside of the "village boundary". Our next-door neighbor, the "American," the only man who makes history in this country, has remained unaffected, cool, and reserved. It did not take a war to awaken that restless element among us. A long time ago it was indicated that a livelier tempo was needed to help our development along. But in some instances it takes a <span class="page-break">\5</span>thunderbolt to awaken the slumbering giant.</p>
   <p>Chicago has always been known as a disturber of the peace. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if a tendency to leave the old rut and travel a new course prevails here more than any place else.</p>
   <p>The realization grew that something had to be done to make the public recognize us. The feeling of an isolated position--an artificial one into which we were forced--makes some people obsequious and others rebellious; human temperament varies. The question arose: What can we do? And the answer was: Let us hold a Turner festival and thereby abandon our isolation in grand style. The argument that Chicago was too large for a Turner festival was countered by the reply: Then we shall have to arrange a Turner festival that is either greater than Chicago or is at least in proportion to the size of the city. And although the delegation to the last regular convention of the Turnbund <span class="page-break">\6</span>received only tentative permission to hold the National Turner Festival, they came home with a National Turner Festival "in the bag". It must be said, however, that the national convention did not take the matter seriously enough. They offered practically no resistance to the arguments of the Chicago delegates.</p>
   <p>After the resolution of the committee for national affairs, "to turn over to the Illinois Turnbezirk the promotion of a National Turner Festival, to be held in June, 1921, "was adopted, the delegate of the Illinois Turnbezirk made the following remarks:</p>
   <p>"I cannot refrain from calling the attention of the convention to the consequences to this resolutions. If Chicago is supposed to hold a Turner festival in which, as in former festivals, participation will be limited to the members of the American Turnbund, it can only result in failure. Chicago can and must have a festival of larger scope which will attract <span class="page-break">\7</span>all organizations interested in physical education--athletic clubs, municipal and park playground organizations, public schools, Turner organizations of other nationalities, college and university athletic teams, etc. Only in this way would we be able to raise the necessary funds for a festival large enough to be noticed in a city of Chicago's size.</p>
   <p>"But if the Turner festival is designed to be a piece of German propaganda and of the same limited scope as former festivals, then--as much as I wish it were otherwise--we might as well give up the idea. The drawing power of the purely German character of the festival would not be great enough to cover half a day's expense. This is a sad confession, but in this case the Bund and the Vereine would have to pay dearly for their illusions. And this we want to avoid. If your resolution is feasible at all, we shall need your consent to go far beyond the limits to which previous Turner festivals have been confined, and our rules of competition must be revised according to a plan which we consider fitting."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>These important words which perhaps have announced the beginning of a new era for the Turnbund, did not elicit a reply. This silence could be interpreted as the session's approval and the logical consequence of this could only be:</p>
   <p>"The Turnbezirk committee has to take steps immediately to find out whether it is possible to enlist the necessary financial support of the business world to promote an undertaking of the character and scope outlined above."</p>
   <p>The summer months made any efforts in this direction impossible, but as soon as the parties in authority had returned from their summer vacations the committee went to work.</p>
   <p>The request that the district committee raise a guarantee fund of from twenty-five of fifty thousand dollars by the date of the next session, <span class="page-break">\9</span>i.e., today, November 9, could not be carried out to the letter.</p>
   <p>We interpreted the resolution to mean that the committee would have no right to impose obligations on the Vereine which they could not or would not fulfill. The committee has justified this assumption.</p>
   <p>The committee would have been only too glad to have presented the ordinary session with a "cash guarantee" of any amount, but it was impossible to solicit subscriptions for an event that isn't to take place until June, 1921. If that resolution was to be interpreted to mean that the district session would sanction the preparation for a festival only on that condition [that a cash guarantee fund be raised], then all our efforts and hopes for a brighter future, for enlarged activities, for closer co-operation with all branches of physical education, and our attempt to place our experience, knowledge, and efforts at the service of humanity will have been in vain. But would such a request be justified? Should the fact that we cannot yet provide funds for the festival in the form of "cold <span class="page-break">\10</span>cash" make us say: We do not feel equal to the task?</p>
   <p>We are convinced that such an attitude would not be justified at this early date, which does not mean that we are convinced beyond all doubt that we can solve our problem. What we ask is only this:</p>
   <p>That the executive session credit our committee with enough common sense to abandon the project of its own volition as soon as it is definitely established that the necessary financial support is not forthcoming. And if promises mean anything the committee is very optimistic in this respect, although the individual members are usually inclined in the opposite direction.</p>
   <p>The committee began its campaign with a letter addressed to the most prominent clubs and commercial and industrial organizations of the city. This <span class="page-break">\11</span>letter informed these organizations of our plan; we intimated that we would take care of all the necessary preparations, but we informed them that as soon as the preparations assumed concrete form we would have to ask them to sponsor the project. We pointed out that it was not intended to be a profit-making enterprise, but that the nation would benefit by it, that it was not the affair of a single organization, but should be the concern of the city, and that we even considered it a matter of national scope.</p>
   <p>We sent a committee to Mayor William Halo Thompson and to the Association of Commerce, two agencies whose co-operation we thought indispensable. We also inquired of the South Park Board whether the stadium to be built on the lake front would be completed by June, 1921. The press was informed and their co-operation has been secured. Individual clubs, like the Chicago Athletic Club, the Illinois Athletic Club, and others were directly solicited to take over the program for a certain day as our special show feature.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>Mayor Thompson was even more enthusiastic about the size and purpose of the enterprise than we were ourselves. Right now he is anxious to have us suggest to him what the can do; he is ready to appoint a committee of citizens to assist us in raising the necessary funds. It is a happy coincidence that all during his life the Mayer has participated in all manner of athletic activity, especially water sports, and that he is also an enthusiastic supporter of physical education. The subcommittee which returned from the Mayor's office has convinced us that we can depend on the Mayor's co-operation to an extent not anticipated.</p>
   <p>The good will of the Association of Commerce is one of the most imperative prerequisites to raising funds for enterprises which do not pursue selfish ends. The recommendation of the project by this Main representative of commerce and industry was promised to the subcommittee; not only that, but the officials volunteered to advise the program committee, and they were enthusiastic about the value of the festival for publicizing the necessity of physical education for youth. To doubt the sincerity of these two <span class="page-break">\13</span>agencies or to consider their promises just empty phrases would be an insult to their integrity.</p>
   <p>The South Park Board has granted us permission to use the lake front, but whether the stadium will be completed by 1921 could not be ascertained. A committee which had a preliminary interview with the general superintendent received the following information: "On November 20, the plans submitted by architects (open competiton) will be opened and submitted to a jury which will select one of the plans. Then drawings and specifications will be made, bids will be solicited and contracts will be let--and then the speed of the work and the length of time required for its completion depend on factors which nobody can control. A strike, for instance, could easily upset any plans, no matter how well conceived."</p>
   <p>If the stadium should not be completed in time, however, an official of the Association of Commerce intimated to the committee that a temporary <span class="page-break">\14</span>one could be erected to serve the purpose.</p>
   <p>On these promises the committee bases its conviction that, when the time comes, if a cash amount--not a guarantee fund--has to be raised it can be secured within a short time. Whether the committee can be charged with reckless optimism now that the circumstances and the facts have been revealed is a matter everyone must decide for himself.</p>
   <p>About the plans regarding the participation of other organizations as mentioned by the delegate to the executive session in the beginning of this report, nothing definite can be said as yet. These plans are being considered, and when a decision has been reached they will be submitted to the national headquarters, i.e., to the technical committee of an executive meeting scheduled for November 28 in Indianapolis. At the same time the executive committee will be asked to grant all necessary powers to the committee of the Illinois Turnbezirk to facilitate freedom of <span class="page-break">\15</span>action in making the necessary arrangements. We will endeavor to secure the most extensive co-operation of all organs of the Turnbund and its districts. For this purpose we have already appointed and advisory committee, consisting of members of various Vereine, which will review the work done by the district committee. Two meeting have been held already. The newly formed committee is to function in an advisory capacity, at least for the time being.</p>
   <p>The publicity campaign and all preliminary steps are to be left to the committee in order to avoid complications. But after the most important things are settled the usual committees will be appointed from the ranks of the large advisory body.</p>
   <p>Let the executive session decide now what is to be done. Are we to give up without having made an attempt to fight for success, or shall we go ahead with courage and confidence? If we are to persevere then it is <span class="page-break">\16</span>necessary for us to declare unanimously: The festival must be successful, true to Chicago's motto, "I Will".</p>
   <p>Now a word in favor of those who gained permission for the Illinois Turnbezirk to hold the festival:</p>
   <p>"If there is such a thing in life as a psychological moment which causes great decisions to be made, that moment is now.</p>
   <p>If the war has taught this growing nation anything it is the realization that healthy manhood is essential to its development. If, as the medical examinations of drafted men have proved, thirty-five percent of the men were unfit for military service, whereas those who had undergone systematic physical education were found capable of doing service, then it is proved conclusively that physical education is of profound importance in the upbuilding of this nation. And the extent of its importance is being <span class="page-break">\17</span>realized more and more. The question is no longer whether or not physical education is necessary, but where it should start and how it should be carried out.</p>
   <p>Great hopes were pinned on the military training of high school students; we know now that these hopes were disappointed. The experiment was made in Germany, but later abandoned. On the other hand the Turner system of gymnastics was developed there without any government sponsorship and merely by private initiative. Later it was introduced into public schools, and from then on it was supported by the state.</p>
   <p>If we can manage to take advantage of the prevailing trend now, it should be possible to make the Turner clubs an integral part in the development of the nation. That this has long been our objective is a well-known fact, and that we have to do it in order to survive is equally obvious. But we have not been able to agree on the tactics to be employed. The <span class="page-break">\18</span>sudden jump from a German-American organization to one which is Anglo American was rejected as too daring and risky, but nevertheless this gap has been narrowed without our realizing it.</p>
   <p>We have asked everyone to promise to become a citizen. On the Turner grounds the German language has prevailed for a long time. Aware of the anti-German terrorism during the war, many Vereine displayed--figuratively speaking--the sign, "English Spoken Here". German and English are used side by side in the communications with the Turnerbund. What we should do now seems obvious, but the first step is always the hardest. Things have come to such a point that if we want to survive, and I mean by that not just to vegetate but rather to develop a progressive program, we will have to take the chance and make a jump in the dark. For this reason we are in favor of a Turner festival such as has been planned. We are not afraid of sacrificing our individuality by so doing, on the contrary we believe that it will give us the opportunity to <span class="page-break">\19</span>demonstrate that we are the best of all foreign nationalities within this nation. We will be strong if we stand together. All we need is the courage and the determination to overcome the obstacles which stand in our way. If we force the issue, the pressure under which we are now laboring will be relieved.</p>
   <p>It shall be our task to co-ordinate our powers systematically. The Turner festival, as it was orginally conceived, shall be our running start by which we shall show the country--without being arrogant--that we are the peers of the best in the land.</p>
   <p>We believe that all members of the American Turnbund, upon whose co-operation we depend, will agree with the above remarks and we hope that our intentions will gain the good will of all native Americans who think objectively.</p>
   <p>The Committee of the Illinois Turnbezirk,</p>
   <p>(signed) John G. Blessing, First Speaker.</p>
