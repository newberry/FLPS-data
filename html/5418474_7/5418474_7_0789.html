   <p>p. 8.. The song festival, arranged by the United Male Choir in Sunnyside Park yesterday, added another glorious chapter to the history of German sociability in our beautiful garden city. The storm preceding the festival was disregarded by the music loving public. Several thousand people were present when the orchestra opened the program, playing the "Coronation March" by Meyerbeer.</p>
   <p>This was followed by the composition "Freedom of Song" by Marschner, executed excellently by an "a capella" mass chorus. After the playing of Rossini's overture to "Wilhelm Tell," the mass choir delivered the extremely difficult composition "Siegesgesang der Deutschen nach der Dermanns Schlacht" by Abt. The execution of this powerful composition showed careful study by our singers. They performed their task beautifully, aided at intervals by thunder and lightning, which helped to make the production much more effective and imposing. Bren's composition "Spring in the Rhine" was executed by an "a capella" united male choir.</p>
   <p>The renowned conductor, Mr. F. A. Kern, was in charge of the concert program in which the following singing societies participated: Frohsinn Singing Society, with 38 active members; Ambrosius Male Chorus, 30; Almira Singing Society, 23; Teutonia Male Chorus, 36; North Chicago-Liederkranz, 24; Junger Male Chorus, 30; Calumet Male Chorus, 60; Harmonia Male Chorus, 24; Harugari Male Chorus, 38; Polyhymnia Singing Society, 25; Freier Saengerbund, 38; Liedertafel Vorwaerts, 70; Schleswig-Holstein Singing Society; Senefelder Liederkranz, 76; Concordia Male Chorus, 32; Orpheus Male Chorus, 28; Schiller Liedertafel, 28; Swiss Male Chorus, 30; and the Arion Male Chorus.</p>
