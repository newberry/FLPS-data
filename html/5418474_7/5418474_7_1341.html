   <p>During a community's development, it is not unusual that its original character continues to prevail in certain districts.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, however, which started with a population of two thousand and grew to nearly four million in less than a century, amidst unparalleled conditions in the annals of the world, it is rare indeed for a neighborhood to remain practically intact in spite of the tremendous changes in the vicinity.</p>
   <p>We refer to the district bisected by North Avenue, from Clybourn Avenue to Halsted Street and towards the Lake.</p>
   <p>North Avenue, seventy-five years ago, was the northern limit of the city. Beyond this limit the primeval wilderness stretched as the domain of roving Indians and the habitat of furtive, wild animals. The area between the Chicago <span class="page-break">2</span>River and North Avenue, which is a labyrinth of streets today, was but sparsely settled then.</p>
   <p>At the intersection now designated as North Avenue and Halsted Street, a few straggling log houses could be found where trade and barter flourished with the aborigines. This trading-post developed so consistently that a better connection with the city was considered; the first of Chicago's intricate transportation problems.</p>
   <p>Eventually, in 1862, the boundry of the city was extended northward to the present Fullerton Street, the village of Lake View laid beyond, and at this time street-paving of a sort on North Avenue was begun. The trading center grew, but not until 1872 did the street improvements meet with the general approval of the inhabitants. We enter now into the era of wood-paved streets, followed by a period of rapid development.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The log houses disappeared, only to be replaced by modern frame and stone buildings, but the trading character of the street remained. Nearly every house contained a store, and many firms who today are known throughout the city, founded their business at that time.</p>
   <p>Drift in Population</p>
   <p>Originally, this area was settled mostly by Germans. Even today it is a Teutonic center, although containing an Irish, Polish, and Italian admixture. The streets have many German names, some providing unsurmountable linguistic obstacles for American palates.</p>
   <p>A large number of the thriving firms were of German origin. Indeed, the employees of these concerns must take cognizance of their numerous patrons and be able to speak German fluently besides English.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Reputation of the Business District</p>
   <p>The middle class in particular knows that the businessmen's slogan, "It pays to trade on North Avenue," is justified.</p>
   <p>Most of the stores cannot compare in size with their huge counterparts in the Loop, but in matters of quality they can withstand any challenge. Besides, the merchants pay lower rents than their Downtown colleagues, and this becomes apparent in sales prices. And in regard to transportation facilities, this locality is just about unexcelled, if one cares to exclude the Loop, a circumstance which helped considerably in developing the district. It may not be amiss to mention a few firms. Everyone of German origin undoubtedly has been on North Avenue to buy an article which could not be obtained anywhere else.</p>
   <p>And so North Avenue is rich even today in long established mercantile houses <span class="page-break">5</span>whose owners were well known in far-flung German circles. Many firms of more recent origin have also sought that neighborhood, doing their share in the furtherance of business development.</p>
   <p>One of the best known stores on North Avenue is undoubtedly the firm of Knoop. It was founded by Ernst H, Knoop in 1888, as a small dry goods store. Today it is a corporation under the management of the pioneer's son, Walter Knoop.</p>
   <p>A long established house in that community for instance, is the Botschen Furniture Company, founded in 1900 by Arthur Botschen, Sr., father of the present owner.</p>
   <p>Among the oldest firms, founded in 1858, let us mention the well-known L. Fish Furniture Company, of 654 North Avenue.</p>
   <p>In 1872, the Yondorf Clothing Company on Halsted Street and North Avenue, a <span class="page-break">6</span>store for men, a reliable concern of excellent reputation, was established. In the year 1871, Zeitz Brothers' jewelry store, founded by the father and grandfather of the present owners, came into being.</p>
   <p>Neither is there any lack of banking institutions on North Avenue; first of all we must enumerate the North Avenue State Bank, the Prudential State Savings Bank, founded by Kaspar G. Schmidt, and the Immigrant State Bank, 343 West North Avenue.</p>
   <p>The younger business element, one might say, is represented by Horwitz, 650 North Avenue, one of the largest ladies' dresses and coat shops, founded in 1911; then A. Schlesinger's music store, 623 West North Avenue, founded in 1908 and built almost entirely on German patronage; also the banking business of Alexander Weiss, 1925. All these firms serve the German element mostly, which they attract by honest merchandising methods. This brings them constant support, and an ever increasing clientele.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Well-Known Firms</p>
   <p>North Avenue boasts of a large number of business houses of diverse nature, which are generally known and enjoy an excellent reputation. To this category belong the Stern Clothing Company (John C. Friewer, president), North and Ogden Avenues. At 646 North Avenue, the Union Woolen Mills Company, a corporation of twenty-six years' standing, under the management of Max Cohn; the furniture store of E. J. Klaiber, in business for nine years, at 536 North Avenue; the Singer Furniture Company, 512 North Avenue. The latter has been in existence for more than nineteen years, its destiny guided by N. Singer.</p>
   <p>North Avenue also has a large number of real German food stores supplying specialties, and therefore these establishments obtained a deserved reputation. They are mostly declicatessen stores. Here we have J. E. Kuhn's store, 315 North Avenue; the butcher shops of Frank Becker, 704 North Avenue, and C. E. Freeman, 420 North Avenue, as well as many others.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>The Jubilee Celebration</p>
   <p>The businessmen of North Avenue decided to celebrate the diamond jubilee of their district. The North Avenue Business and Improvement Association, with which all interested merchants have been affiliated, have made all necessary arrangements for a festival commensurate with the importance of North Avenue as a subject of historic interest.</p>
   <p>Today marks the beginning of the celebration. Flags and emblems are in evidence everywhere, fittingly ornamenting the street, and an extensive program has been provided for the festive week ending October 26. Above all, the merchants will exhibit tempting displays in their windows to attract new customers and announce jubilee sales, featuring outstanding quality at low prices.</p>
   <p>Much Business in Sight</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>The climax of this commerical propaganda will be the distribution of prizes, amounting to five hundred dollars in all. A valuable diamond ring has been selected for the first prize.</p>
   <p>Every buyer in any of the stores participating in the festival, will be given a coupon entitling the holder to share in the distribution. Coupons are given even with fifty-cent purchases.</p>
   <p>The Carnival</p>
   <p>Amusement will be provided on the street in true carnival spirit. The merchants promoting the festival are intent that young and old shall share in this festival as well as in the justified pride of the long established businessmen, who value their achievements and good name.</p>
   <p>The Festival Committee</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>The festival committee in charge of arrangements consists of the following gentlemen: John W. Lorenz, F. Otto Zeitz, Abel Stein, Charles B. Bach [All together ten names. Translator]</p>
