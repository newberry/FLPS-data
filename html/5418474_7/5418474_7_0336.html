   <p>Hans Ravené, the German actor, who will appear next Sunday in Col. Wood's Museum, is thus described by the German correspondent in Baltimore: "His acting although full of energy is at the same time very natural. Each of his movements and expressions corresponds perfectly to the feelings expressed in the play. Mr. Ravené knows how to hold an audience spellbound and to focus all the attention upon himself. He is an actor, who makes the public laugh and cry with him."</p>
   <p>Mr. Ravené will play here the role of Don Caesar de Bazano.</p>
