   <p>Yesterday's yearly concert of the Catholic Casino in the Kimball Hall exceeded all expectations considering it is an amateur chorus. The majority of the performances, were well above the average, for which principally the master over the choristers, Joseph Moos, was responsible, who at the same time appeared with a great composition for men's chorus, solos and orchestra before the public.</p>
   <p>The program contained a selection of the best: Johann Sebastian Bach, with his weighty cantate: "Sleeper Awake" and "Palestrina", with a double chorus "Popule Meus". Other numbers were the previously mentioned Moos' composition, an Offertorium; "Recordare, Virgo Mater Dei", Mendolsohn's "Boating", "Where To" by Edwin Schultz and Beschnitts "Hope". The offertorium is in the style of the old masters, full of meaning and harmonies. The soloists were Miss Mary Fartell and the tenor, Laskowsky. The performance of Schult's composition, was not equal to the others offered. McDowell's "Gnome Dances", one of the few chorus offerings of the most prominent representative of romanticism, succeeded brilliantly and great applause greeted the closing number: "The Bug and the Flower". The singers had to repeat same.</p>

   <p>It must be mentioned, that Harry Harmon, tenor and Herman Schlitt Bass, took over the solos in two choruses, giving great satisfaction with their singing. The alto soloist Miss Rose Lutiger Gannon, appeared on the program with songs by Brahms, Wolf and Chadwick. The singer possesses a strong, pleasing voice with excellent schooling and her performance was expressive. Miss Irma Rounds accompanied her on the piano, with great understanding.</p>
