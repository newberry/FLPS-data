   <p>After several weeks of preparation, there was produced last evening by Alexander Wurster's German dramatic company, at the new Chicago Theatre, the celebrated German drama, a"Wildfeuer" (Wild fire) by F. Halm, the author of "Fechter. von Ravenna" (Gladiator of Ravenna). This drama is written in blank verse, and is considered one of the best German literary productions extant. The piece when it was first brought out about ten years ago created the greatest enthusiasm, and in Berlin and Vienna it was produced hundreds of nights in succession to crowded houses.</p>
