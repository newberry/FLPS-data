   <p>The first Bad Boys' radio ball, arranged by the German announcer of station W C F L, Karl Berg, and W G E S announcer Walter Lampel, which recently took place at the Germania Club, was a success in every way. The great dance orchestra opened the ball at 8:30 P. M. There were a number of artistic presentations during the evening; these had the full approval of the guests. These special features were begun by Madame Etta Hintermeister, singing (with a good voice) a waltz song from the "Walzertraum". She was followed by two members of the Chicago Civic Opera, Giuseppe Cavadore and Madame Hazel Sandborn, who won enthusiastic applause with their songs. Humorous sketches by the Saxon comic artist, Georg Klinking and dancing performances by the Schuhplattler Organization "Gamsgebirg," added to the variety of the program.</p>
   <p>The guest of honor of the evening, Consul General Dr. Rolf Jalger, addressed a few congratulating words to the two directors of the German broadcasts.</p>
   
   <p>The guests enjoyed dancing until a late hour.</p>
