   <p>Although rain was threatening, The Schwaben-Festival has been held, and it was pleasant to observe, that the heavy overcast skies, did not disturb in the least, the happy crowd, which has gathered for the festival. We have to hand it to the Schwaben. As usual, the Cannstatter festival commenced with a procession, moving from Haymarket and W. Randolph Street to Ogden's Grove. A lovely arrangement of the procession, brought much acclaim, especially is this true of the people of the North side, who in many instances decorated the buildings for this occasion.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. Rapp held a festive speech in German, and Mayor Harrison, who was supposed to deliver a festive speech in English, wired to the Society from Plymouth, Indiana, where he held a political speech the evening before, to have missed his train, and could not be present at the appointed hour. At 8 o'clock however, he did make his appearance, and at the general request made a short speech, for which he was acclaimed. The entertainment for the rest of the evening, consisted of the usual program on such occasions.</p>
