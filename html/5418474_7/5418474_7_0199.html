   <p>The above company will give as its initial performance at Central Turn-Hall, on Milwaukee Avenue, "The King's Daughter," "A Beggar," or "The School of Life." Mr. Hahn promises that all theater-goers, who appreciate good stage-management and cast, with historically accurate costumes and the best of available scenery, are invited. The new company has engaged excellent artists and is convinced that its trial performance will inaugurate a new era of German art in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The possibility of daily performances is not precluded, if we consider Chicago's large and constantly increasing German population. If Mr. Hahn fulfills his promises, then, undoubtedly the public will give him ample support, since our city has a large art-loving German population, sufficient to make daily performances possible.</p>
