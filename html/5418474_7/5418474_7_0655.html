   <p>The fall festival, in the Lincoln Turner Hall, of the well known union of German speaking Free Masons, the "Circle", combined with an artists concert and ball succeeded beyond all expectation. Under leadership of the well known conductor, Mr. Martin Ballmann, who also assembled the excellent program, very good numbers were offered. The participating artists were zealously up to their task and success rewarded their efforts.</p>
   <p>The program was opened with some offerings of the Ballmann orchestra, of which particularly an extract from "Orpheus in Hades" met with favor. A cornet solo by Mr. Iver Lindstrom, accompanied on the piano by his wife, was followed by Mr. Herman Krueger who with a few songs made furore; Mr. Frank Lamon on the guitar and banjo, Mrs. Laura Van der Locht with a few songs, Mr. Julius Van der Locht, Mr. Rudolf Baumheier with a well received Cello performance, then Mr. Paul Gawatzki on the violin, and finally a trio consisting of Messrs. Sawitzki, Baumheiter and Martin. Mr. Paul Thone did his share through his excellent piano accompaniment.</p>
   <p>The concert was followed by a ball. It was, in every respect, a successful <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>evening for the circle. What especially pleased the youthful audience was the lively music, which was furnished by the orchestra later for dancing.</p>
