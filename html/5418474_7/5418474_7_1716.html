   <p>The twenty lodges of the Order of the Knights of Honor, existing in Cook County, celebrated yesterday afternoon and evening their first popular annual picnic, under the auspices of the Union Council, in the North Chicago Rifleguard Park.</p>
   <p>This picnic, like all previous festivals of the Knights of Honor, was remarkable. John Meinken's famous orchestra furnished in a generous way the music for dancing and various kinds of games. Later in the evening, brilliant fireworks kept the many hundreds of celebrating visitors in good spirits.</p>
   <p>Naturally also, refreshments were served lavishly. The carefully managed arrangements of the whole festival were in the hands of the following gentlemen: E. C. Breyer, B. Corn, R. Ragdeick and so forth.</p>
