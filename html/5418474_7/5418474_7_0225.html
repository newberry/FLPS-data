   <p>"Cinderella" the dramatic piece by Robert Benedix, was performed last evening before an overcrowded house. Miss Elize Rouier distinguished herself in her role as "Elfriede", frequent applause was her reward. Mrs. Horn also played her role with great virtuosity. Mrs. Hauser after a long absence, was an excellent "boarding school Mistress" and portrayed the "Ursula Veltenius" in a natural way. The little juvenile "Ida" was well played by Miss T. Neuman. Mr. Uhlich was a splendid "Count Albrecht", and Mr. Bounet characterized the head of the school "Dr Veltinius" very well. Mr. Bender as "Count Rothberg" the man who enjoys life was satisfactory. Next Sunday for the benefit of the popular actress Mrs. Johanna Horn, the historic dramatic play "Philippine Welser" will be given. We hope that a large audience will welcome this lady, Mrs. Horn has rendered great services to the German Theatre in Muller's Hall.</p>
