   <p>None but those who attended last night's performance know what a pleasure it was to spend an evening in the spirited atmosphere of the German Theatre, where the grand comedy "Mr. Senator," written by the renowned playwrights Franz von Schoenthan and Gustav Kadelberg, was given.</p>
   <p>This farce is especially appreciated in a country of unrestricted manners and is decidedly intended for the vigorous exercise of the facial muscles of the audience. The story of the play unfolds in the home of Senator Anderson, a Hamburg patrician, who tolerates nothing but ultra-formal manners. However, the young people of the family revolt against this traditional exclusiveness of the Senator. They marry to secure happiness rather than to maintain false prestige.</p>

   <p>Ernst Robert was admirable in the title role. What a comical figure he presented as the head of the family who tries to do justice toward his loved ones without deviating a hair's breadth from his senatorial dignity!</p>
   <p>Johanna Eisemann portrayed the Senator's wife, who, as the result of twenty-seven years of married bliss, chilled to a sub-zero temperature in her contact with others. Nevertheless, when her son's happiness was at stake, she too was able to radiate warmth and prove herself a loving and sympathetic mother.</p>
   <p>Detty Schumann, as the married daughter, at first over-emphasized the stiffness of her role. She came into her own, however, when the chain of restrictions had been cast off and the mask had been discarded, thus permitting her to yield to her innermost nature. It then became quite obvious why her husband's love had not waned after two years of disgraceful submissiveness.</p>

   <p>Helene Holstein and Edna Werner were well cast in their respective roles.</p>
   <p>Spontaneous applause interrupted many scenes.</p>
