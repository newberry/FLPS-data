   <p>The 13th Annual Picnic and "summer-night" celebration at Hoerdts Grove, held by the beer-brewers worker's Union was a splendid success. The makers of the fine "Barley-Drink" always understand how to make these picnics a good time for all.</p>
   <p>For the children and young folks all kinds of plays were arranged and prizes given to the best players. The adults amused themselves dancing and bowling.</p>
