   <p>In the gymnastic hall "Vorwarts" last night, under the management of the popular actress, Louise Hagemann, the play, "The Devil of St. Germain" or "The Blind Of Paris," a character sketch of A. Prix, has been enacted. It was very much regrettable that the attendance was so sparse. The sensational French play and the exceptionally good representation of the ensemble deserved, indeed, a full house. The performances of Mrs. Hagemann and Miss Thielemann were excellent. The costumes were elegant and well chosen.</p>
   <p>The Germans of the Southwest side have every cause to support the undertaking of this very capable institution.</p>
   <p>A very entertaining dance followed the performance.</p>
