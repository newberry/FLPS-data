   <p>The following new contributions in the interests of the German theater fund have been obtained through the tireless efforts of the gentlemen who are in charge of this drive: McAvoy Brewing Company, $2, 500.00: Orpheus Male Chorus $1,000.00,etc. Three $1,000.00 contributions are listed, the remainder are of $500.00, $300.00, $200.00 and $100.00 denominations. The total gives $10,200.00.</p>
   <p>All sums thus far received amount to $312,000.00.</p>
   <p>The promoters of the project intend to send notices to the stockholders within the next few days, calling them to a very important business meeting at the Orpheus Hall, Dec. 29, in the afternoon; the directorate is to be elected. The great work progresses and its goal is visibly nearer.</p>
   <p>A correction: Bunte Bros. &amp; Spoehr have paid $1,000.00 at the very beginning. By mistake they have been credited only with $500.00 in the previous list. For this reason, their name appears again with an additional $500.00.</p>
