   <p>The Chicago Zither Club considers it an honor that its Easter concert gave a few hours of entertainment to its members and their friends.</p>
   <p>With the co-operation of the Styrian Singing Society under the leadership of Ludwig Schwartz, and the Chicago Mandolin Orchestra, under Fritz Brockmuller, a performance was presented which consisted of overtures, marches, etc.</p>
   <p>Conductor F. Stabla cleverly solved the task. President Kurt Reichel's welcome address was followed by the Chicago Zither Club's orchestra, which played two selections.</p>
   <p>The evening's success may be credited not only to the quintet, quartet, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and trio, but also to the soloists, all of whom did their best to make a success of the performance. Miss Frances Kaufmann (Zither), Miss Sophie Wellitz (Mandolin), and Mrs. Johanna Eicherl (Zither) played the "Gnome Dance" and an original "Lander" in a remarkably clever way. They received great applause from the audience, which they rewarded by playing an encore. The "Isar Phantasy" found a splendid interpreter in Max Schiels. Miss Therese Eschbach sang two soprano solos, "Quiet as the Night" and "Zillerthal, you are my joy," She was accompanied on the piano by Miss Ida Eschbach.</p>
   <p>The management of the performance was in charge of a committee consisting of Mr. Kurt Reichel, president; Max Schiele, secretary; Richard Nehls, treasurer, and Max Blatz, cashier of ticket sales.</p>
