   <p>Costumes worn by German-speaking immigrants for the last 100 years, and their old-fashioned luggage, will be displayed in a historical parade at the next German day, if the committee follows the suggestion of Michael Schant, made at the meeting of the German Day committee, Friday evening in Musicians Hall, 175 W. Washington St. The parade and the performance of the festival play, which was produced at the 75th year celebration of the Chicago Turner Society, were two suggestions submitted to the head committee for consideration.</p>
   <p>On account of the absence of President Gill and the sickness of Vice-President Leopold Saltiel, the 2nd Vice-President, Dr. W. Teichmann presided. The minutes of the committee's last meeting, which took place December 9th, were approved by the delegates.</p>
   <p>In order to draw all the German societies to the German Day celebration, the organization committee issued a circular, in which they requested the societies to join them. So far 200 societies have joined the German Day committee. Shortly an appeal will be published in the Abendpost.</p>
