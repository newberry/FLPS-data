   <p>German Exhibitors are complaining more or less about insufficient space-reservations, granted by the World's Fair administration, which obviously is favoring American and British applicants for room. Mr. Arnold, representing Siemens and Halske in Berlin, has explained this fact to us and announced at the same time, that his concern has opened up a Chicago Branch office, which is managed by O. Maysenburg and A. W. Wright. In cooperation with this Branch-office, every effort will be strained, to make the German division in electric achievement one of the most attractive, brilliant spots of the World's Fair.</p>
