   <p>The date for next year's festival was set for the first Sunday of June, 1928. The festival location will be the stadium in Grant Park.</p>
   <p>The report of the treasurer showed that the entire receipts amounted to $7,888.85 against expenditures of $6,032.98, and after $1,400 had been assigned to benevolent institutions, the balance of $1,008.25 remained.</p>
   <p>President Adolph Gill prefaced his yearly report with the remark that the German day festival of the year 1927 had been a glorious success, of which the Chicago German element can be justly proud. Highest appreciation is due the different committees for their tireless efforts through which this success was possible.</p>
   <p>Complete harmony was established through the offices of Dr. Kobalter, Joe Maschek, Gabriel Jung and Michael Schaid, in the Austrian, Hungarian and <span class="page-break">\3</span>Sudeten-German circles, and all prevailing misunderstandings were successfully ironed out. The yearly report praised the excellent co-operation of the Turners, of the sporting clubs, of the military societies, and last, but not least, of the singers.</p>
   <p>The highest compliments are paid to the two official speakers of the German day celebration: Senator Charles S. Deneen, of Illinois, and the Editor, Paul H. Ortmann.</p>
   <p>In regard to a possible intervention in local politics, the report states: "We should be very careful not to become affiliated with any of the local political controversies. The German citizenry of Chicago might be split through party controversies and political hatreds, and the great work which, to the present, has been successfully carried out through our efforts, would be considerably impaired."</p>

   <p>The report closed with another expression of gratitude to all those who helped to make a success of this German day festival.</p>
