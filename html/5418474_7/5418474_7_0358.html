   <p>North Avenue, on which the only German theater of the North Side burned down, has once more--thanks to Mrs. Louise Thielemann--a German theater at 334 North Avenue, near Sedgwick Street. The first German performance was so favorably received in the neighborhood that at 7:30 P.M. the entire street was filled with people. Sunday the theater was still only half finished. The performance of the play "Wirrvarr" was fair but the first evening was more important as a "get-together" after such a long separation. In the meantime, building operations continue on the theater on Clybourne Avenue and Division Street. The opening of this theater is expected to take place Oct. 1.</p>
