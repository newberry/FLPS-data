   <p>I wish to announce to the Germans of Chicago that I intend to operate a German theater which will meet the demands of the public. Alexander Wurster's enterprise has closed down as a result of bad times.</p>
   <p>My chief desire, of course, is to safeguard the theater's future. I have decided to open the theater regardless of the fact that the season is almost over and in spite of the financial sacrifices involved, so that the Germans will not lose interest in German plays.</p>
   <p>Newspapers have already reported the fact that I have succeeded in securing the services of the most experienced members of the former Wurster theater, as well as other well-known actors, and that I am at present corresponding with famous German-American players, in an effort to get them to appear at special performances.</p>

   <p>In regard to the repertory of my theater, it will be dedicated for the most part to the now popular modern comedies. I shall also endeavor to produce in Chicago the latest successes in the dramatic field.</p>
   <p>In the hope that my venture--which became possible only after great difficulties were surmounted--will meet with popular favor, I remain,</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>Emil Hoechster</p>
