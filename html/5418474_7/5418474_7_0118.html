   <p>Henrik Ibsen's play "A Doll's House" was presented in German last Sunday evening at Powers Theatre. The play drew a full house. The German actors who give plays at Powers Theatre on Sunday evenings are, on the whole, able people, and the presentation of "A Doll's House" was praiseworthy.</p>
   <p>Nora's role was presented by Pauline Wirth who appeared to have taken her task very seriously and executed it with great ability. Advocate Helmer was presented by Ludwig Lindikoff.</p>
   <p>The German translation by Wilhelm Lange was used.</p>
