   <p>The well-known Music Teacher &amp; Conductor, Mr. Oscar Schmoll, has the intention of arranging a Singer's Excursion and Concert Tour through Germany. The time of the starting will be about the middle of July. Everybody who knows something about singing, whether he is a member of a society or not, may participate; also every singer of any other nationality, in so far as he knows sufficient German, to understand the text of the songs and be able to pronounce them correctly when the Concerts are given. The name of the entire Organization will be:"German-American Singing Society." Also Non-Singers can join the organization as passive members.</p>
   <p>The projected excursion will include the cities of Hamburg, Bremen, Hannover, Berlin, Leipsie, Dresden, Munich, Stuttgart and Cologne, with trips to a few spas like Wiesbaden etc. and also to the "Niederwald."</p>
