   <p>Under the auspices of the German Society of the Northwestern University, the memory of Schiller's birthday was celebrated last evening in the Congregational Church at Evanston. The celebration was dignified and extremely expressive. A large American flag and the German solors decorated the church-organ. Busts of Schiller, Goethe and Lessing, placed along the edge of the chorus-gallery, looked down on the fairly packed audience, which had come to honor the memory of the greatest German poet.</p>
   <p>The well arranged program was opened with the introduction and reception of the rector and professors of the North Western University as guests of honor. Then various fine songs of Mrs. Brentano and of the Germania Chorus followed. Recitals of Schiller poems and various talks on Schiller's life wound up the entertainment of the evening.</p>
