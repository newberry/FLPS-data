   <p>The new stadium, large enough to accommodate sixty thousand people, will be dedicated Wednesday evening, September 10, amid festive songs and gorgeous light effects. The festivities are to be held in grand style. School children, thousands in number, carrying Chinese lanterns, will gather at the immense center of the Stadium, flanked on both sides by participants and the public. The latter two are to be united in a great song festival under Harry Barnhart's leadership.</p>
   <p>The South Park Commission invited the mixed mass chorus of William Boeppler, and the mass children's chorus of Hans Biedermann for the festival.... It will be epochal in the history of Chicago.....</p>
