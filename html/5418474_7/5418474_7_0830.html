   <p>German Music will receive new honors Saturday, June 6th. This time it is the children and ladies chorus, founded by Mr. G. Katzenberger which will present itself for the first time to the German public. The children's chorus contains 1000 voices and the ladies chorus 500 voices. Both choirs have been trained to such an extent, that a great success can be anticipated. The program setup for the German song festival is very well chosen and varied and contains the most favored German popular songs and choruses with accompaniment of organ, harp, horn and string orchestra. Also several well-known artists and soloists will perform. There will be no doubt, that the Germans of Chicago will support this real German National undertaking with an immense attendance and demonstrate to the self sacrificing management of the choirs, that they recognize their qualities in the proper manner.</p>
