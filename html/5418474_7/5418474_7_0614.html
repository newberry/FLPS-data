   <p>A new proof of the popularity of German men's choruses, was given by the United Men's Choruses of Chicago at their spring concert yesterday afternoon before 3,000 listeners at the Medinah Temple. The concert, judging by the repeated applause, was a great success.</p>
   <p>The chorus of 600 singers was under the direction of Karl Reckzeh. To him much credit is due for the success of yesterday's concert. Without doubt, the chorus will reap more laurels at the coming singers' festival at Cleveland.</p>
   <p>Among the visitors at the concert were the German Consul-General, Dr. Hugo F. Simon and his wife. To a representative of the Abendpost, Dr. Simon expressed his great appreciation of the singers' excellent performance.</p>
