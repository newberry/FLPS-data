   <p>"I can indeed not dance a Jig", said Mr. Friedrich Haase, Friday, when he visited the Editor of the ArbeiterZeitung, "but I hope nonethe-less to have made many friends in Chicago."</p>
   <p>Without any doubt, this great actor is very popular among German Society in Chicago. Yesterday, the tickets for today's performance were quickly sold out, due undoubtedly to Mr. Haase's world reputation.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday is positively Mr. Haase's last appearance in the Comedies "Die Beiden Klingsberg" and" im vorzimmer Seiner Excellenz." Both comedies are famous, and are performed by Mr. Haase.</p>
