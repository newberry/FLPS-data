   <p>At the behest of the committee, Director Franz Beidel of the South Side Men's Chorus makes the following announcement to the Abendpost:</p>
   <p>"It almost appeared, last Saturday night, that we had found ourselves in the primordial forest on the Kankakee river instead of at the entertainment of the South Side Men's Chorus at the South Side German House. Only an assortment of brown bears and opossums was lacking.</p>
   <p>"In keeping with the various efforts of the committee, especially with respect to the decorations, the atendance was large (sic). No one thought of going home before the hour designated by the police. They all hoped that the organization, popular as it is, would frequently arrange such easygoing, genuinely German entertainments."</p>
