   <p>Last night's opening performance of the German theatre season at the Chicago Opera House was a great success. Director Selig may be well remembered by our Chicago audiences of former years for his work and interest in the German Theatre.</p>
   <p>Last night's performance was the comedy, entitled "Falling stars" by Moser and Girndt. The play is of no literary depth but is rich on comic situations and entanglements, and if the actors unite in a light and carefree flow of conversation, one could be carried away with it, never realizing that there is no action to the play at all....</p>
