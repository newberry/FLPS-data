   <p>We, the undersigned, who have attended with pleasure the representations in your theater, are sorry to learn that due to unfortunate circumstances the attendance in your theater has diminished to such an extent, that you have sustained severe financial losses. We hope that these detrimental influences will soon disappear and that on Sundays your theater will be filled once more as usual.</p>
   <p>With satisfaction we look back upon your artistic performances, which even the English press said were superior to similar presentations in English theaters, and which were, at the same time, "rendezvous" for the better class of Germans. In order to compensate you for the losses sustained during these last weeks, we offer you a complimentary presentation on Jan. 14, and we hope that we shall get the support of all the art-loving Germans of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Chicago, January 8, 1877</p>
   <p>(Signed by 14 prominent Germans).</p>
