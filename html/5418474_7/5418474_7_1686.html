   <p>The great dance-hall of the Germania club-house last night presented a scenery, dazzling lights, beautiful costumes, and happy faces could make it. It was the twenty-seventh annual carnival of the Germania Mannercher, and many hundred of the best known German society people of the city were assembled to take part in the best masquerade dance, or witness the unique Chinese performance, and the frolic of the dancers. The scene was designed to represent the reception of the Chinese Emperor on a festival occasion. Louis Nettlehorst impersonated the Emperor, and Frau Hand, true to her country, represented Germania. By means of clever scenic paintings the dance-hall lost for a time its usual appearance, and opened up vistas of Chinese scenery, picturesque and beautiful, and so natural that they smelt of tea. The entire wall was covered with painted canvas. The ceiling was draped with blue and yellow bunting so as to represent a blue sky with on eastern haze. Here and there Chinese gods, armor bric-a-brac, and the like were placed with admirable effect, and at one end of the hall was a typical Chinese stage. It was on this that the special performance in honor of the Emperor was presented. A touch of reality was lent to the scene by the presence of half a dozen bonafide Chinamen. A brilliant ballet dance opened the theatrical part of the entertainment, <span class="page-break">2</span>and then the various Ministers of State appeared to accompaniment of wild, musicless Chinese noise. Messrs Goldzeer, Konta, Lederer, Welker, Schulty, Hand, Reimann, Hild, Schierbrand and Claussenius impersonated the characters of the various Ministers. The show ended with a striking tableau. The carnival surpassed in brilliancy and numbers all former efforts of the Mannerchor.</p>
