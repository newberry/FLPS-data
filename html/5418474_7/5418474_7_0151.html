   <p>"Ibsen's Ghosts" went over the stage last night at the German Theater, which had a considerable crowd but was not sold out. The new dramatic conception of our modern writers is not fully understood by most people. This was proved by sporadic jeers of some spectators, while at the same time others applauded. We are sympathetic to both sides.</p>
   <p>One side holds on to the old ideals of our fathers and forefathers, while the other side, the new direction- is trying to tear our dreaming mind away from these ideals, to face a world of bare reality with all its monstrous injustices and hopeless misery.</p>
   <p>It was a highly interesting play, and all actors did their best, to make the performance a success. Particular praise must be given to Messrs Kauer, Werbke and Welb, also to Miss Milasson.</p>
