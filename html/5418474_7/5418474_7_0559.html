   <p>With all the outward signs of success, the South Side Singing Society arranged its spring concert under the direction of Conductor Ewald Barginde. With the overture "Berlin, how it cries and laughs," by O. Couradi, the orchestra of Professor A. Bardeleben opened the first half of the program. Immediately after this, the South Side Singing Chorus sang "Silent Valley," by K. Schmidt. Later in the evening the chorus sang "There are Still Days of the Roses," by Baumgartuer. The songs were sung in a perfect manner and the audience applauded heartily. Daniel Jager, president of the society, welcomed the members and friends of the society, thanking them for their large attendance. The Singing Society considers it its duty to promote social activities among the Germans. In this and other friendly societies, German-speaking men and women have united to cultivate and promote German songs.</p>

   <p>Max Bratt sang "My Whole Heart Is Yours," by Lehar. Bratt possesses a voice of great volume which he used in a very impressive manner. Unending applause compelled him to give encores of "You Will Also Deceive Me Sometimes" and "Come, Zigan," from the "Countess Maritza" operetta.</p>
   <p>Also worthy of mention was the singing trio composed of Carl Wieser and his two sons. This musical family sang "The Brave Cannoners," and "Three Healthy Styrians," with Zither accompaniment. "The Shepherds Morning Song," Cornet solo by M. Kreppel, was also well received and applauded.</p>
   <p>A play, "The First Love of Little Charley," concluded the program. The cast of the play was made up by Theresia Eckhardt, Theresia Predl, Sam Geigner, Joe Walter, John Predl, and Karl Eckhardt. All players under-stood that their job was to make the audience laugh.</p>
