   <p>The Lakeview Men's Choir imitated an idea which is truly worthy of imitation. This plan has reference to the establishment of the choir of children, who are being taught German songs and receiving instruction in German. At the rehearsals, which are held every Saturday, German is used only in singing and speaking. The children of active and passive members between the ages of 7 and 15 years are rnrolled free of charge. Also children of non-members are entered, but they must submit to an examination before they are accepted by the committee.</p>
   <p>Already fifty three children have been enrolled, and this is evidence of the fact that this plan has met with the approval of the Germans in Lake View.</p>
