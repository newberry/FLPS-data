   <p>Die Wassersimpel (The Water Morons), a character comedy out of German-American life by Julius Kurzer, was given for the first time, last night, in Aurora Turn Hall. The interest every premiere arouses (especially when it treats, with an outspoken slant, a vividly discussed current question) had enticed a large crowd to fill the hall.</p>
   <p>The play appealed to the spectators. Some scenes, we mention only the temperance meeting, aroused stormy applause.</p>
   <p>Some changes we recommend. The performance lasts by far too long....... Some lines of the dialogue need to be softened. Also the text should not be too wild a mixture of German and English phrases......</p>
