   <p>In Schumacher's Hall at Ashland Avenue this week a grand fair took place; promoted by the German-Protestant Peace Society. The fair was attended by many friends of the members. The chief aim was, to find amusement and this they did, so for several hours they enjoyed themselves, and were a very jolly crowd. Those who have not visited the fair, should do so. There is not only an interesting and entertaining program but also a raffle of very useful gifts takes place, these gifts are much appreciated.</p>
   
   <p>present.... Thomas' Symphony orchestra will appear.... The World's Fair Chorus, under Katzenberger's leadership ... will undoubtedly give us a glorious concert, one of especial interest to Germans...</p>
