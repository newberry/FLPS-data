   <p>The concert offered Saturday night in the Logan Square Masonic Temple by the Schleswig-Holstein Saengerbund gave renewed proof of the sincere striving and the diligent work done by the members of the chorus. It also gave proof of something more, namely of performances to be achieved with a talented director and well-trained and willing singers working in harmony.</p>
   <p>The invitations specified a Johann Strauss evening, and the light and teasing music of the Viennese valse king dominated almost exclusively the program. Having played the overture to "Fledermaus," which was done perfectly by the orchestra, there was given the first chorus number "Geschichten aus dem Wiener Wald," with orchestral accompaniment. The quality of the singing and the blending of the voices were such that the singers and their choir master, Reinhold Walter, may be proud indeed. With what zeal and what devotion the rehearsals were made for this concert was shown by two more Strauss compositions which were rendered with orchestral accompaniment. They were an extract from the "Zigenmerbaron" and, as a final valse, "an der schoenen blauen Donan". As the only a capella choirs sang "Am schoensten bist du," by Sonnet and--for the seventieth birthday of the composer--"Der Jaeger ans Kurpfalz," by Orthegraven. They, too, were very gratifying because of the liveliness with which they were rendered. The second song had to be repeated.</p>
   <p>That the Johann Strauss evening was such a huge success is to be ascribed, aside from the performances of the chorus proper, to the fact that the singers were aided by a good orchestra and able soloists.</p>
   <p>Frau Gertrud Clauss-Koehler, the soprano singer, has in recent years been active at German concerts and on Saturday night she was quite heartily welcomed on her first reappearance. She sang the czardas from "Fledermaus," which she rendered with artistic feeling and a well-trained voice, reaping rich, well-earned applause. Particularly gratifying, however, was she as soloist with chorus and orchestra in the selection from the "Zigennerbaron". Here, as well as in the duet "Wer uns getraut" with Ernst Cornielsen, her voice showed full development. Mr. Cornielsen likewise acquitted himself quite well.</p>
   <p>With the program finished, a festball held the guests together for several more hours. It must not be left unmentioned that the program began at 8:30 P.M. and was lively throughout. Representing the consul general, Dr. [Rolph] Jaeger, was secretary Keppler from the German consulate general.</p>
