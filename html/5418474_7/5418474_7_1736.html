   <p>There was pleasure and enjoyment yesterday evening at Folz's Hall such as can seldom be witnessed. The "Sozialistische Mannersgor," which held its Mask-ball , must be given credit for the success. Everything went smoothly.</p>
   <p>Amusing were the Mask-jokes: "The Mixup in the Mill," "The Barber of Seville," and the "Animal Quartet", when our reporter left the locality at a late hour the pleasure temperature of Prince Carnival rose above 100 degrees.</p>
   <p>That he, under the circumstances, would have preferred to linger somewhat longer at Folz's Hall, instead of returning to 5th Avenue on such a cold night, needs no further explanation.</p>
