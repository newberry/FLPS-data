   <p>The recital of the "Kaiser Marsch" by Wagner in the Sunday concert of the Great Western Light Guard was a musical event, and the Turn Hall was unusually well filled. At any rate, Chicago is, aside from New York, the only city in the United States where the newest composition by Wagner so far has been played in public. The opinions about the musical value of the piece are strongly divergent -consonant with the opinions each listener had formed previously about Wagner's music.</p>
   <p>...As the Wagner compositions advance by more frequent hearing, a repetition of the Kaiser March next Sunday is to be highly desired from the point of view of art education.</p>
