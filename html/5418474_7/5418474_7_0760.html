   <p>The concerts at Turner Halle will be continued at a nominal admission price during the coming winter season.</p>
   <p>This was definitely settled at last night's general meeting of the Turn Community. The ultimate decision after three hours of deliberation was to continue the Sunday afternoon concerts at the admission price of 25 cents..... The management expects the response of the public to these concerts to be gratifying at a very small compensation, but if this expectation should not be fulfilled, and losses should warrant the step, the Turn Community reserves the right to terminate the concerts at any time before the close of the actual concert season.</p>
   <p>The direction of the artistic management has again been entrusted to the very able conductor, Mr. Martin Ballmann, despite the fact that another orchestra leader offered his services at one third less the fee offered by Mr. Ballmann. The preference given to Mr. Ballmann was due to his excellent accomplishments, and the truly splendid orchestra. Furthermore, a change of conductors for economical reasons would be rather risky at the present time.</p>
