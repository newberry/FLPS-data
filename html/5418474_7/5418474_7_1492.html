   <p>The "German Day", is approaching and we appeal again to the Germans of Chicago to take part in this huge celebration and to give expression to the Spirit of German humor and enjoyments before the people of Chicago. We will prove to our persistent adversaries that we also honor the day of rest, yet not as they, the bigots, would like to have us do, but according to real German manners and customs. To elevating and instructive entertainments and mental as well as physical recreations the German Day will be devoted. German songs, German music, German Athletics and German speeches will be the order of the day. Many important and powerful pioneers of Germanism in America will be present. The President of the German-American National League will be the official speaker. No man or woman of German descent who are proud of their ancestry, should neglect the opportunity to listen to the brilliant oratory of our leader and to heed to his exhortations.</p>
   <p>Therefore, yea, German men, women and children, come and partake in this great <span class="page-break">\2</span>celebration. Prove that you are worthy of your ancestry! We will have reasons to be proud of the "German Day" if a happy and decent crowd is assembled at the Coliseum on Sunday, September 25.</p>
