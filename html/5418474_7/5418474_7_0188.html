   <p>Last Sunday the opening play at the Labor Hall was "Worther and Lotts" and proved to be all the way through a complete success; Messrs Alvin and Rossecke were particularly good actors. Also the loving couple, Mr. Siegal (Werther) and Miss Liebig (Lotts) accomplished their best. Then followed the Gamethief (Wilddieb), which also pleased the visitors. The audience did not spare the applause, particularly for Messrs Alvin, Rossecke, Siegel, and Miss Liebig.</p>
