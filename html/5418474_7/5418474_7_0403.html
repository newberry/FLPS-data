   <p>On the occasion of its sixty-seventh anniversary, the Teutonia Men's Chorus entertained, yesterday evening, at the Germania Club, 108 Germania Place, with its regular annual concert, which was a worthy sequel to its famous predecessors. The great hall of the clubhouse was filled when the Chorus opened the program with "Gruss an Deutschland aus der Ferne", by Alfred Dregert, under the direction of the talented conductor, Joseph N. Moos. With this number, the singers proved that their efficiency had attained a height of perfection which must be gratifying, both to themselves and to their conductor. Later numbers bore excellent witness to the art with which the Teutonia Men's Chorus can sing. The audience showed its appreciation by enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>Without listing the program in detail, especial mention should be made of "Sommernacht", by J. J. Brambach, sung by the quintet. Its technical difficulties were surmounted by the singers with remarkable skill. In rendering the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>familiar Swabian folk song, "Maedele ruck, ruck, ruck," and "Zwa Sternlan," by Kremser, the singers displayed a modulating ability which contrasted favorably with the "forceful exertions" demanded by certain other selections.</p>
   <p>In its opening number, the quartet, composed of Adolph Gill, Lorenz Schlegel, Willie Hess, and Albert P. Regalla, showed its power with flattering success. Beschnitt's "Hoffnung" was presented in a most impressive manner, with Fred H. Miller singing the baritone solo passages.</p>
   <p>As soloists, the soprano Marie Heinrich, together with the baritone Fred H. Miller, contributed their honest share to enjoyment of the concert.</p>
   <p>Fran Heinrich first offered "Traenme," from Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde," followed by "Strampelchen," Eugen Hildnich's cradle song. Her further offerings consisted of "Fruehlingszeit," by R. Becker, and R. Franz's "Er ist gekommen". Despite the strains which the various compositions must have placed upon the singers, they acquitted themselves in a splendid manner, and well deserved <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the enthusiastic ovations given them for their fine performances.</p>
   <p>With "Horch auf du Traeumen der Tannenforst," and with the "Bedouin Love Song," by Pinsuti, Herr Miller gave the audience an enjoyable treat, which they rewarded with sustained applause.</p>
   <p>Professor Ascan W. Kittner accompanied Frau Heinrich on the piano; Miss Vera C. Gill accompanied Herr Miller.</p>
   <p>The concert was followed by the usual ball.</p>
   <p>The committee responsible for the success of the concert was composed of: C. Dorendorp, chairman of the entertainment committee; E. Schreiber, secretary; W. F. J. Schultz, L. Schlegel, A. Mueller, F. Rex, M. E. Lehman, E. Romeiser, and Charles Alschwede.</p>
   <p>The officers pro tem of the Teutonia Men's Chorus are: Adolph Gill,president; <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Curt Dorendorp, vice-president; Erich Schreiber, recording secretary; Albert P. Rogalla, financial secretary; William Schultz, treasurer; A. Mueller, keeper of the archives; Lorenz Schlegel, treasurer of the Bummel.</p>
   <p>Chairman Dorendorp made the guests welcome with a brief address, in which he expressed the appreciation of the organization for the large attendance, which he regarded as most eloquent proof that the Germans of Chicago still have an active and vital interest in fostering the German song.</p>
