   <p>German Day is over. It produced, in all who were present at the festivity, a feeling of boundless pride. At the same time, it imposes upon the Germans of Chicago new tasks which are as difficult as they are honorable and gratifying. It is not an exaggeration to say that never, in the United States of America, has there been a German Day celebration to be compared with that at the Stadium. This celebration gave complete and artistic expression to the character and importance of German Day.</p>
   <p>Such celebrations bring honor to the German population of our city. They fill German-Americans with pride in their nationality; they evoke sympathy and respect for the German nationality in our fellow citizens of different origin. One may be proud to invite any American, no matter of what stock he is, to a festival such as this. Now the question arises: German man, German woman, what next?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>With this year's festival Gustav A. Brand, chairman of the German Day Alliance, has created a new standard for German Day celebrations. "A great example awakens emulation, and makes the verdict rest on stricter laws." These words of the poet can also be applied to this German festival. From now on, all German Day celebrations must be of the same artistic perfection as this one was. Otherwise the public will shun them, and they will leave a bitter taste in one's mouth, for it is inevitable that they will be compared with the German Day celebration held in the Stadium on September 16, 1934.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the German Day Alliance has brought about a festival which was fraught with meaning and perfect artistically. Naturally, a considerable share of the work was done by the delegates to the German Day Alliance, and others, also, co-operated; this, too, should receive grateful acknowledgment. But it is indisputable that the chairman of the Alliance deserves chief credit for the splendid success of the work, although he stayed modestly in the background during the whole celebration. The affair cost a good deal of money, much more than any affairs of this sort in the past. The money was raised, and <span class="page-break">\3</span>for this, too, Gustav Brand deserves chief credit. By the part he played in this celebration he has earned an honorable place in the annals of German-American history.</p>
   <p>How will the next German Day celebration turn out? Who will be in charge of it? Can the Germans of Chicago find a man who is able and willing to take Mr. Brand's place; a man who is ready to devote all his attention to this good cause for a whole year, and make considerable financial sacrifices? This is the question which the delegates to the German Day Alliance will have to face, and with them, all Germans of Chicago. The problem would be much nearer a solution if Mr. Brand could be persuaded to take charge of the celebration once more. Much would be gained if he continued to act as artistic adviser in the service of the good cause.</p>
   <p>The proposal has been made that the next German Day celebration take the form of a picnic. This would be a step backwards and a sad admission of poverty; it would be a step unworthy of the traditions of the Chicago Germans. After the glorious success of the last German Day, the Germans must, with increased energy and creative fervor, in a spirit of harmony and unselfishness, set to work and <span class="page-break">\4</span>prepare a German Day celebration worthy of the last one.</p>
