   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung reported yesterday the arrival of C. B. Schmidt from Berlin. He declared the results of the negotiations in regard to the an "German Village" as entirely satisfactory. Negotiations had been started several months ago by correspondence. The German village, the German medieval city, the concert-garden joining both, and other pleasure-grounds are destined to become the general rendezvous for German and German-Americans. These plans will be carried out at an enormous expense. At the Midway Plaisance then will be created a part of Germany, where one can feel at home. Genuine German life and activities will prevail here. The area measures 250 by 700 feet; half of this is reserved for a concert-garden, in which restaurants will be located which will be able to serve eight thousand people at one time. It is planned to engage several military bands, and the arrangements will soon be completed.</p>
   <p>The tickets to the concerts will be twenty-five cents, but the entrance to the city and village is free. The entrance fee to the German museum, located near by, will be also twenty-five cents. The city, consisting of thirty-three houses, will represent the architecture of the medieval age, the whole arrangement gives to the city the impressions of former ages. The village on the other hand, will demonstrate the different industrial branches of our country-men in Bavaria, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Saxonia, and elsewhere.</p>
   <p>This enterprise is undertaken by the German Bank and the National Bank in Berlin. These large financial institutions consider it their patriotic duty, and an honor to have their interests represented at the World's Fair in Chicago. Mr. Schmidt was a personal friend of the late editor, H. Raster. Besides, he is well-known to many readers as an efficient immigration commissioner and has achieved splendid success in his connection with the Santa Fe Railroad.</p>
