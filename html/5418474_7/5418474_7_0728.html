   <p>The Orpheus Maennerchor (Male Chorus) will celebrate its golden jubilee with a great jubilee concert in the Bush Temple Theater next Monday. Today we will give some details of the long and honorable history of the club.</p>
   <p>On August 11, 1869, Franz Amberg, Wilhelm Burkhardt, John Hoffman, Wm. Reinhardt, and Geo. Walz called a meeting for August 19 at Bernauer's Hall, Lake and Clinton Streets. At this meeting, where many citizens of the West Side gathered, the Gesangverein (Singing Society) Orpheus was founded. Mr. Otto Lob was engaged as director, and he held this office until 1873. He was succeeded by Messrs. Hans Balatka, B. Ziehn, W. Bergstein, and John Molter, and since 1877 by the well-known and popular director Gustav Ehrhorn, who was succeeded by Karl Reckzeh. The first president of the association was Mr. Henry Greenebaum, who was succeeded in office by Messrs. John C. Meyer, Clemens Hirsch, Louis Sievers, Franz Amberg, Theodor Arnold, Henry Jansen, and Hermann Pomy. The present president is Mr. Josef Stein. After the Great Fire in October, 1871, <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Orpheus contributed to the erection of a large hall, at the corner of Peoria and Lake Streets, which was named Orpheus Hall, and which was occupied by the association in the spring of 1872. There the Verein (association) made splendid progress. Its membership reached three hundred and eighty. The number of singers was about ninety. A ladies' chorus was added and gave splendid performances. The panic of 1873 forced the Verein to return to its former quarters. The female chorus was dissolved and the Verein continued as the Orpheus Maennerchor. The number of singers had greatly diminished, but under the guidance of Gustav Ehrhorn a fresh start was made. The society remained at that location until 1883. On account of building alterations the association, which had originated as a West Side club, moved to the South Side and found quarters at 49 South La Salle Street, where it remained continuously for ten years.</p>
   <p>The former ups and downs of the Orpheus were due to the changing times but the present period of gay prosperity was brought about by hard work and close co-operation. Besides a great many other selections, the German folk song <span class="page-break">\3</span>was zealously cultivated, and of the more important pieces let us mention Mendelsohn's "Antigone," "Die Allmacht" by Lachner, "Bergpsalm," "Columbus," "Landsknecht," "Hunnenschlacht," "Sturmesmythe," and the chorus selections "Weihegesang," "Hymne an die Musik," "Das Gewitter," and "Sklavenjagd," all of which were written by Hermann Mohr, an honorary member of the Orpheus. After the Schiller Building was completed the Orpheus Maennerchor found a new and beautiful home.</p>
   <p>The Orpheus has taken a great and active interest in supporting the German singers of America in their efforts to promote the German Lied by arranging great Singers' Association song festivals. The Orpheus was represented in full strength at all song festivals of the North American Saengerbund (Singers' Association), and was proud that its members did their share to heighten the success of the occasion.</p>
   <p>At the 1881 song festival in Chicago, the Orpheus was at the head of all <span class="page-break">\4</span>Chicago Singers' Associations. Its president, Mr. Franz Amberg, was elected president of the North American Saengerbund.</p>
   <p>He was instrumental in consolidating the various Chicago singing societies under the name of "Vereinigte Maennerchoere" (United Male Choruses). In this association the Orpheus took over the lead and retained it for eleven years. Its director was Gustav Ehrhorn during that time.</p>
   <p>At the song festivals of Buffalo, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and New Orleans, the Vereinigte Saenger von Chicago (United Chicago Singers) furnished the bulk of the mass choruses and their efficiency as clubs was praised by all music lovers.</p>
   <p>In April, 1898, the society was forced to abandon its location in the Schiller Building and returned to its old home at 49 South La Salle Street, Wilkens Hall. The Orpheus has always been active and eager to promote the German folk- <span class="page-break">\5</span>way, and especially to glorify the German Lied. We find the singers present to the last man at the jubilee concert given in the Bush Temple on April 18, 1902, in honor of director Gustav Ehrhorn. Three clubs participated: Teutonia Maennerchor, Liedertafel Vorwaerts, and Orpheus Maennerchor. The concert was a great success.</p>
   <p>In the years that followed, attendance at rehearsals declined as well as the membership. This had to be remedied. One attempt at such a remedy was to let the rehearsals take place at the Bismark Garden in June, 1908. In the same year the song festival of the Saengerbund of North America, which was given in Indianapolis, Indiana, was heavily attended by the Orpheus members. In order to obtain more public attention, a concert was given on September 23, 1908, at the old Handel Hall. The success of this affair was quite satisfactory. But the singers did not feel at home at the Bismark Garden and subsequently various other localities, such as the Kaiser Garden, the Lincoln <span class="page-break">\6</span>Turnhalle, and again the Kaiser Garden, became the club's headquarters. Hard times were in store for the Orpheus. It was homeless, so to speak, but the worst part of it was that it had lost quite a number of excellent singers.</p>
   <p>The society seemed to run into a streak of adversity. The year 1910 was a very sad one. First the president of long standing, Hermann Pomy, died. Then followed another heavy blow. This was the loss of one of the founders and old-time president, Mr. Franz Amberg, the soul of the society, so to speak. His death not only caused the singers to grieve at the loss of a strong supporter and a meritorious member, but it caused the whole German element to grieve with them. He was seventy three years old when he died. His burial was on June 15, 1910, from the North Side Turnerhall.</p>
   <p>The number of singers dwindled until only a few remained. What was to be done? Some solution had to be found. Maybe more singers could be made to return if headquarters were moved back to that hall on La Salle Street. This decision <span class="page-break">\7</span>was carried out. Rehearsal attendance became somewhat better in 1911, preceding the song festival in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Participation there was comparatively good.</p>
   <p>The society suffered another heavy loss in 1912. On August 6, one of the last cofounders died, singer Adolph Arnold.</p>
   <p>In 1914 the singers rehearsed diligently for the song festival in Louisville, Kentucky. The heat was terrific, but in spite of that it turned out to be one of the most successful festivals the singers had ever presented.</p>
   <p>Just when a happier outlook for the future was about to materialize shadows again cast their gloom. After a brief illness, the faithful and untiring president of the club, Mr. Jacob Spohn, died on September 22, 1914. The Orpheus and the Vereinigte Maennerchoere of Chicago lost a gifted and valuable member.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Since the old hall on La Salle Street did not attract the singers as was anticipated, it was decided to look for a location on the North Side. The selection was Keller's Hall, 4012 Lincoln Avenue. Moving day was August 12, 1915. But as soon as the singers had become used to the place, they sustained the severest blow imaginable. Their popular and experienced director, Mr. Gustav Ehrhorn, died in December of the same year.</p>
   <p>Karl Reckzeh was chosen as his successor. He was conductor of several choirs as well as the Vereinigte Maennerchoere. The Orpheus Maennerchor was [and still is] very well satisfied with its energetic and intelligent director. A new spirit seemed to prevail in the singers' new home. The rehearsals were better attended and many new members joined the society. Enthusiasm among the singers gained such height that in 1917 they even planned to give a concert in Central Music Hall in the business section of the city, on Sunday evening, November 4. The society was honored on this occasion by the presence of the president, secretary, and other officials of the North American <span class="page-break">\9</span>Saengerbund. The concert was a success in every respect, and it served as an incentive for more undertakings. The singer, Joseph Keller, the host of the society played a big part in its promotion while the society remained on his premises. He also solicited many new members. Unfortunately, Brother Keller was forced to give up his business in October, 1918. But luckily a suitable place was found in the Social Turner Hall on Belmont Avenue. The singers are very satisfied with their new home. But bad luck has followed them here, too. The singer August Dosch, an old and active member, died after a short illness. The rehearsals are well attended now, and the number of singers is steadily increasing.</p>
   <p>The oldest active living member with the longest membership record is Brother Franz Siegel. He as never yet missed a rehearsal. For many years he has held the important office of treasurer.</p>
   <p>The next longest membership belongs to Georg Hellmann, who has been financial <span class="page-break">\10</span>secretary for eight years. Up to the present time he has taken part in all rehearsals. We can also mention President Joseph Stein, who has held this important office for a number of years, to the full satisfaction of all the members.</p>
