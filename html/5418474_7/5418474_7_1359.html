   <p>For the second time the German-Americans of Chicago are planning to erect a German house, in connection with Germany at the World's Fair. The plan to erect a German house at the World's Fair in 1933 was suggested by a member of the committee, Mr. Haake. The chairman, Mr. Krutgen took up the matter warmly and offered a plan which will make it possible to erect such a building to serve as a center for the entire German-American population of the United States.</p>
   <p>Considering former experiences, Mr. Krutgen warned the members not to depend depend altogether upon the generosity of wealthy people, who would donate in a generous way to this cause, but suggested that the German government be approached through the German Consul of Chicago in order to preserve the building at the close of the World's Fair, for the benefit of the German-Americans of America.</p>
   <p>Mr. Krutgen explained, that, if this should become reality, he and all German Americans would do their utmost this time to prevent the destruction of the building which was built through the kindness and generosity of the German people, as it happened with the "German House" of the Columbian exposition.</p>
   <p>To take up the necessary negotiations in this matter, the German Consul of Chicago is invited to attend the next meeting.</p>
