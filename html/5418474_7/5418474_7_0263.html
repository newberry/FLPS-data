   <p>The Society of Mr. Pelissier's will play for the first time this afternoon and evening in Chicago in Moser's attractive comedy, "Kandel's Curtain Lecturers." The play will be enjoyed the more as it is written in the easy-going language and, being full of very comic situations, will satisfy the taste of the public. Furthermore, the Kotzebue farce, "The Distracted," and the songplay of Jacobson's, "My Aunt, Your Aunt," will be enacted. Mr. Pellissier proves by the selection of his plays that he has a full understanding of the wishes of his public, and those who enjoy a hearty laugh will also today reward him by visiting his performances.</p>
