   <p>The German Theater must be regarded by the Germans of Chicago as a valuable factor in the cultivation of German culture. A way must be found to secure the continuation of the German Theater during the present season, so that it should not be forced to close its doors before the end of the theatrical season. The Germans of Chicago cannot be permitted to be humiliated by the Poles, Italians, Czecks, and Chinese, who all have well paying theaters in their national language in Chicago, and whose lasting permanency is secured by steady and diligent attendance. Something must be done to prevent the collapse of the enterprise which the small but courageous ensemble of the German Theater under the leadership of Angelo Lippich has dared to approach.</p>
   <p>That was the motto, which had brought the representatives of German societies of Chicago together. After a short deliberation, a decision was quickly made. A society was established which will bear the name German Peoples Theater of Chicago. All who were present were immediately initiated as members. The recruiting of new members will begin at once. On Sunday the members of this young society will help to fill the house of the German Theater, not only the seats will be filled but also the cashiers cage.</p>

   <p>Represented at the meeting were the gymnastical societies of Illinois by Attorney Leopold Saltiel, the combined Women Choirs by Mrs. Minnie Willem, the American Admirers of German Art by Mrs. Emmy Heitke, the Schwaben-Verein by Mr. Charles Rink, the German Theater by Angelo Lippich, and many other prominent people of German descent. Angelo Lippich pointed out the difficult financial condition of the German Theater. Because of the necessity of immidiate help all German societies are requested to donate at once a certain amount to the German Theater.</p>
