   <p>Since the celebration of "German Day" has been planned, all of the German Clubs, Lodges, Unions, Societies, etc. should assist in making plans as elaborate as possible. All Germans will have to work together harmoniously, if the "German Day" is to emphasize the importance of Germanism. Such a co-operation is possible, since nearly every German belongs to a club or lodge or society, or union, etc. If each of these organizations will send a delegate to a general conference, it could be legitimately stated, that all Germans of Chicago are represented. The "Abendpost" (Evening Post) as well as all other German publications will do everything they can to make it a success. We trust the organizations will do their duties also.</p>
