   <p>A gala presentation will be given next Wednesday in the North Side Turner Hall, for the benefit of the free German American Dispensary.</p>
   <p>For a long time, it has been the hope of German physicians that it would be possible some time. to build a German Hospital. It was a frequent experience of theirs, that poor Germans, unacquainted with the English language, either could not enter hospitals or were unable to describe to the doctors the nature of their ailments.</p>
   <p>Without money nothing can be accomplished. For that reason a gala presentation of the play "The Painter" will be given next Wednesday. Such eminent actors as Miss Wolff, Mrs. Claussen, Mr. Donald, Mr. Mayer, and Mr. Wolkenstein, will take part in the play.</p>
