   <p>The building Committee of the "World's Fair," has published a report on the grouping of the buildings at the coming "World's Fair." The site will be divided into five parts. The cultivated part of the park on the Northside, buildings will be erected for the different States and probably the art buildings will also be built there too. The buildings which cannot be erected on this particular space will be built in the "Midway plaisance" as well as, the buildings erected by private parties. The three divisions which are crossed by the lagoon, will be appropriated for all those buildings of which will be the main and Southern front and will be in the direction of the main part if the fair grounds. Division four will have the principal erected thereon. On division five including the most Southern par of the Park, will be erected the less unimportant buildings made from cheaper materials and not so elaborate. The buildings of the various States will be very imposing and will be surrounded with paved roads. Germany has informed the Committee by cable that most likely it will be officially represented. A Committee which has investigated the opinion of German industry has reported very favorably and has advised the Minister of Commerce, Mr. Van Bertfisch to nominate the Imperial Exhibition Commissioner and give him the necessary authority.</p>
