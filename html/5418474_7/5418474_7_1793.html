   <p>The three fairs of the Alexian Brothers were very lovely and above all expectations. The financial result promises to be very satisfactory. In Baum's Pavillon today a contest will be held as to the most popular man of the Southside and the visitor will find a rare selection of all kinds of curiosities, as they might not easily be found here in Chicago on one and the same place. In the Vorwaerts Gymnastic hall last night a great gymnastic performance was given by the gymnastic club and the Catholic Casino presented a number of songs, receiving much applause. Also here an active popularity contest between the different candidates will be conducted. Tonight there will be music and dancing. The great attendance at the 3 fairs proves that high esteen the Alexian Bros. are with the public. Part of the lots have already been sold and it is recommended to visit the fairs and to support one of the most beneficial institutions in Chicago.</p>
