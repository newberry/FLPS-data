   <p>German Theatre at McVickers.</p>
   <p>One half column, describing the initial appearance of Mrs. Marie Kronau and her co-actors in the regular German Theatre. (Comment) She fills a long-felt want, is capable and experienced, and in her initial performance proves that she is equally enabled to display parts of passion in "Ladies of the Drawing Room." Her versatility thus constitutes a most desirable acquisition to the regular personnel, and credit is to be fiven to the management for its perspicacity in obtaining a lady whose qualifications make her suitable for such parts as plays, her engagement was indeed a necessity.</p>
