   <p>The attention of the German people must be called again to the fact that it is not sufficient to have a house; it must also be taken care of. We have a German theater now. It has a splendid troupe and renders highly satisfactory, well-rounded performances. It has made only a few mistakes in the choice of plays. It now presents to us brilliant guest-artists, whose talents and reputation entitle them to a full house, but in spite of all that, there is a gaping vacancy in the theater.</p>
   <p>Of course, we can not force any one to attend a theater. There is no obligation, as, for instance, paying debts, nevertheless, it is true that if we neglect to maintain a house, it will deteriorate. It is obvious to all that if the performances on week days are not attended, the same must be stopped, and if they have to be given up, it will be <span class="page-break">\2</span>impossible to maintain such a large and splendid troupe, and to furnish such a variety of performances.</p>
   <p>In order to maintain the German theater, it would be well for the German citizens to attend the week-day performances, even though they have to change their habits to do so.</p>
