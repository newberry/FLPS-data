   <p>It has been frequently pointed out during the last few months, that the management of the German theater will do its utmost to furnish us with the best possible performances for the coming season. Likewise it has been discussed, again and again, in this paper as to what difficulties the management has to face to make the theater season from a financial stand-point a successful undertaking, while at the same time it tries to comply with the wishes of an audience which loves and understands art. Finally, we appealed urgently and repeatedly to the Germans to protect our own theater, that is, prosaically speaking, to patronize the same as much as possible, and, perhaps to purchase a season ticket. Our German theater can only then become well established and grow continually, if an audience is formed which attends the institution regularly and remains loyal, although a competitive institution tries to shake its foundation from without..........</p>
   
   <p>The German theater must become a part of Germanism itself, and must become intimately related to it. Every attack upon our theater should be treated as an attack upon all Germans, irrespective of whether the attack is made by English-Americans, or by competitors with a German nationality.</p>
   <p>Although it is generally asserted that free competition is beneficial, in this case the statement is not true because this is an enterprise which must be first strongly developed by sympathetic care and understanding. Competition can only smother the plant instead of strengthening it. The experiences of recent years are sufficient evidence that competitors in the realm of German art were not mutually benefited, but suffered losses. Where the German stage is compelled to maintain laboriously its cultural efforts; as a foreign group it faces the many native English-American theaters and where it can depend on a small percentage only of the total population for support, then competition can only be detrimental and destructive.</p>
   
   <p>Considering the future of the German stage in Chicago, we must recognize the fact of existing dangers, namely, that new German troupes of actors may arrive here, which will attempt to win the favor of German audiences. This will divide the interests and weaken the strength of German audiences thereby frustrating the hope of establishing a German theater permanently.</p>
   <p>In order to prevent this, and not let the dream of an excellent, well established and financially sound, German stage in Chicago go up in vapor, all art-loving Germans and others, who honestly desire the development of Germanism, should make every effort to assure the success of our theater, and then other similar German enterprises can be supported.</p>
   <p>We therefore urgently appeal to our readers to render practical assistance by purchasing season tickets, so that the management of our German institution can devote all its efforts toward the performances of the best plays and not be disturbed by the grinding and competitive battle for existence, which at best would dull its interest in the main problems.</p>
