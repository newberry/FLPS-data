   <p>German Day! With true pleasure every genuine German-American watched yesterday afternoon the fitting up of the enormous hall at the Auditorium, with ladies and gentlemen who, in spite of the beautiful weather, wanted to participate in the celebration of the German Day that was dedicated to the memory of the achievements of their ancestors on American soil. This was shown during the festivities in actual illustrations, and was further dedicated to the memory and the encouragement of the tasks and duties which confront the present German-American generation to preserve its influence and the German acquisitions in every domain of noble human effort.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately the celebration did not pass on in every way as impressive as was desired. And the fault was, that the Programs Committee made the regrettable error of laying too much weight on the oratory that devoured fully two hours time. The song presentations of the United Male Choruses between the three speeches were always welcomed by the audience as a true relief, and when in the middle of the third speech people showed aloud their dislike, it was not directed against the orator, but as a protest against the arrogance of the Committee.</p>
   <p>....Speeches were given by Mr. Max Eberhardt, Mr. Richard Barthold of St. Louis, Dr. Gustav Karsten, Professor of the State University in Urbana, Illinois and Professor Dr. E. Voss of the State University in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>With explanations by Mr. Karl Haerting significant pictures of the history of the Germans in America were hereupon shown. The first picture showed the arrival of the "Krefelders" in Germantown on October 5, 1683 under the leadership of Franz Daniel Pastorius, holding a Thanksgiving service in the open. Here the United Singers intoned the hymn: "Nun Danket Alle Gott" (Now Let Us Give Thanks To God). Then was pictured the first settlement and the erection of the first building. In the third picture was shown how Konrad Weiser and his wife kept up friendly terms with the Indians, of whom they had bought land, while the English and Dutch settlers took their land by force. The fourth picture brought several exhibitions of the spiritual and technical production of the German pioneers. It showed for instances, how Christoph Saver printed a German Bible, the first one, that was ever made on American soil. Touching was the impression of the fifth picture. It showed the historical moment when Pastor Muehlenberg threw down his robe on the altar of his church and instigated his pious listeners to take up arms and fight for independence. There wereshown the well-known figures of Von Steuben and Dekalb in the war council with Washington. It showed the brave Nicolaus Herchheimer directing the German settlers of the Mohawk Valley in the battle of Orizkany; also how he was mortally wounded. Moehring's Battle Prayer sung by the United Singers, impression of the performance.</p>
   <p>"The Migration Towards the West", the next picture, reminded one of the settlement of the Middle States along the Ohio Valley in Indiana and Illinois by German pioneers. In the seventh picture was shown the immigration of the fighters of 1830 and 1848, the "Grey" and the "Green". A storm of enthusiasm was unchained by the eighth picture. "The Germans in the Civil War", where over 180,000 followed Lincoln's call to the arms, proportionally more than those belonging to other nationalities. In the foreground could be seen the numerous German leaders: Sigel, Schurz, Hecker, Osterhaus etc. Beside this picture showed the storming of the Lockout Mountain by German Regiments and the marching out of the Chicago Turner Regiment under Hecker's leadership. A scene from the wonderful peace festival in Chicago in the Spring of 1871 was shown in the next picture and then the United Singers sang, "Das Deutsche Lied".</p>
   
   <p>It was shown then, how the center of German spiritual and social activities in old Chicago, the German House, was destroyed in the great fire. The victory of personal liberty 1873 showed Hesing at the speakers' restrum surrounded by his most outstanding fellow fighters, whose facial expressions were excellently reproduced.</p>
   <p>The other pictures were: "The German Day of the Chicago Worlds' Fair" with the German Village in the foreground; "German Art, Science and Music in America". With the apotheosis "Columbia and Germania" and the community singing of the "Star Spangled Banner" with orchestra accompaniment, the beautiful celebration came to a close.</p>
