   <p>The "Tribune" of St. Louis, pays this tribute to our Turn-Society Vorwarts: The "Turn Society Vorwarts of Chicago," not only through their excellent appearance, but owing to the fact, that the turners won the three first and a number of other prizes, demonstrated, that this Society classifies, among the first of it's rank. The members of that Society, who through their joviality made many friends, arranged yesterday afternoon, as a finale to the festivities, a sight-seeing trip through the city.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann of Chicago and Mr. Leo Scheben of this city, conducted the trip. The first to visit, was the Liederkranz Halle and garden, which was greatly admired; from there the procession went to Anthony and Kuhn's garden, and then to the Anthony and Kuhn's garden, and then to the Anheuser-Busch Brewery, where a great reception awaited them.</p>
