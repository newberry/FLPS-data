   <p>In the competition for prizes in the field of art and industry the Germans achieved a success, at the Columbia World's Fair, that will live in history indefinitely. While representatives of both continents crown Germania with the laurel-wreath of praise and fame, the German-Americans, feel, naturally, a deep desire to extend to their Old Fatherland their best wishes, and a token of their devotion and loyalty. Although thousands of miles separate us from it, yet we can never forget our parental home, our mother-tongue, nor the customs and habits, responding readily to the genuine German heart and mind. Every German is a brother to us, and no German-American is <span class="page-break">2</span>a brother to us, and no German-American is indifferent towards Germany, whether good or bad luck be his fate. At the Columbian World's Fair, Germany has captured the admiration of the whole world. Chicago has become the field of victory and honor for Germany. Not only they, the Germans, but also we, their brothers in the United States, are made happily aware of this fact.</p>
   <p>It was the purpose of yesterday's festivities to give expression to these feelings of joy. June 15th will live in our memory as one of the most beautiful days of our lives, because the sons of Germany and the German-Americans celebrated together at the German House, in the German Village, and everywhere the stars and stripes, and the black, white, and red waved. The impressions made yesterday upon our hearts and minds are a valuable treasure which we will preserve forever, because the stimulating and uplifting character of yesterday's festivities has kindled the flame of memories <span class="page-break">3</span>of the Old Fatherland, and our devotion to, and fraternization with, the sons of Germany and the German-Americans, has been confirmed and strengthened anew. The mother-tongue and the German song, which appealed so profoundly to our hearts yesterday, have again aroused in our breast the sentiment of unity and loyalty of all Germans wherever the German tongue is heard.</p>
   <p>The Parade - Guests of Honor - Floats.</p>
   <p>The reason for the colossal parade, which was held by German organizations of all descriptions was, undoubtedly, to call the attention of the people to the fact that the German element is one of the largest in this great and free country. Most of us are familiar with the extensive preparations for this historic German-American parade, but since this glorious affair has succeeded so brilliantly, all those who helped towards making it a success deserve to be congratulated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>(The following eight columns describe in minute detail the parade. It is reported that between 20,000 and 25,000 people took part in it. In the lead were the guests of honor, and prominent personages in up-to-date carriages, there followed in numerous divisions, the almost countless German-American organizations with their orchestras, bands, and the many floats, depicting famous episodes in the history of the United States as well as of Germany, such as the ship "Santa Maria," "Columbia," symbolizing the 13 original states, "War of Independence," "War of 1812," "Civil War," "Germantown," etc. The parade took place in the forenoon. At 3 o'clock the real festivities began in front of the German House. Appropriate decorative flags, platforms for the speakers, guests of honors, choirs, and orchestras were out up for the occasion.)</p>

   <p>Twenty minutes after 3 o'clock the chairman of the festivity, Mr. Hall, gave the signal to start. The singers tuned in the German national song: "Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles." (Germany, Germany above all.) Under the direction of Katzenberger, the tune was carried through with overwhelming enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hall, accompanied by Mr. Rubens, stepped upon the speakers platform and very heartily welcomed the assembled audience in the name of the Executive Committee. He expressed his satisfaction and great joy that German Day was turning out to be such a success. "The many thousands of people present are in hearty agreement with our endeavor to give evidence that justifies the pride with which the German-Americans look upon the great success of their old fatherland. German industry, art, and science have achieved a great victory, and all the German-Americans are unitedly celebrating it...."</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"There are two great landmarks in Germany's history of the last quarter of a century. Each of them has moved the hearts of the German-Americans very deeply. The first was an accomplishment of the sword. The second is the result of peace and labor, but is no less great and outstanding than the former and is being demonstrated in our new homeland, in our Chicago. Again, we, the German-Americans have assembled with great rejoicing to send to our Old Fatherland across the ocean our gratitude and good wishes; and because their great achievement is one of peace and labor, our joy is deep and genuine. We German-Americans are, without exception, devoted to work. Astonished at, and admiring German ambitions and achievements, as revealed at the most brilliant of all World's Fairs, we press upon the head of the genius, German labor, the well-deserved laurel-wreath. We feel justified in claiming a share of this triumph, because they, who have completed this marvelous work, are our brothers and fathers, our flesh and blood.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>"To the emotions of pride, joy, and exultation, is added deep gratitude. Every grand achievement of the Old Fatherland casts its reflection of splendor into the home and hut of every German upon the whole earth. With this reflection of the most glorious of recent German achievements, we are more directly concerned.</p>
   <p>"Your excellencies, the German Ambassador, and the German Reich Commsssioner: On this day of honor, German Day, at the Columbia World's Fair, all the German-Americans extend herewith their congratulations and best wishes to Germany, and in their name I give you my right-hand. We cordially request you to promote extensive publicity in the Old Fatherland, giving expression to our feelings of joy and pride over the amazing revelation of the greatness, energy, and glory of German labor, German art, and German science."</p>
   <p>"German-American fellow citizens, arise and join with me in a rousing threefold hail to Germany! Long live Germany!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>The next speaker was the German Ambassador, the Baron von Hollenben.</p>
   <p>"In responding to the greetings extended to us in such beautiful and stirring words, I, the representative of the German Kaiser and the German people, take pleasure in expressing my gratitude for America's hospitality. The Germans in America have always been good American citizens, without forgetting their Old Fatherland, and without denying the good old German customs. They have always been loyal to the American people; and with the strength of their muscles, with the depth of their disposition, and the knowledge of German brains they have promoted American aims and aspirations, we, the national-Germans have observed with joy the astonishing development of America. In this environment was gladly speak of this, our joy. We are glad to observe the energy and power which the German-Americans manifest here; and since the Germans in Germany exert a wholesome influence upon America, we are, therefore, in this sense members of the same tribe as' the American-Germans. All Germans and all German-Americans may express their <span class="page-break">9</span>wishes for the progress and prosperity of the United States, and for the well-being of its President with loud voices. Hail to the United States! Long may it live!"</p>
   <p>The next speaker was the eminent German-American, Carl Schurz.</p>
   <p>"The Executive Committee has succeeded in persuading a man to be our speaker today, who is not only known in Chicago and the United States, but also in the whole civilized world. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you our famous countryman, the first German-American, Mr. Carl Schurz."</p>
   <p>Carl Schurz's Speech.</p>
   <p>"This is German Day, the day of honor in the battle of peaceful competition among nations upon the hospitable soil of this American Republic. We <span class="page-break">10</span>have come from far and near to pay tribute to the genius: the German nation. When the honor was bestowed upon me to express this tribute in the name of my countrymen, many difficulties presented themselves. However, the German blood in my veins did not permit me to rest until I could join you in honoring our Old Fatherland. Those of our countrymen across the sea, who believe that the hearts of the German-born Americans have become cold in the selfish chase of the dollar, and have lost all sympathy for the Old Fatherland, fail to know and understand us. Today they will hear these hearts speak. (Applause).</p>
   <p>"It is, indeed, true that we are loyal citizens of the great American Republic - as loyal as the most loyal. We are proud of our citizenship, proud of our free commonwealth, whose self-government is our government, whose progress is our progress and whose fate and destiny is our fate and destiny. We are proud of the powerful and noble people with whom we are one.</p>
   <span class="page-break">11</span>
   <p>We are proud of the glorious "Star Spangled Banner" - as proud as we can be. It is the symbol of hard-fought-for unity, the ensign of a great past and a still greater future. We are also aware of our duties, and gladly do we fulfill them. Whenever our new fatherland called its sons to defend it against inner or outer enemies, the German-born citizen was one of the first to sacrifice life and blood upon the battlefield for the common cause. Among the heroes and martyrs of the republic we find many a name with that German sound. In all laboratories of science, and in all fields of labor, the German brain and the German hand have been busily engaged in creating the fruits of labor. We may state unhesitatingly that on America's soil German blood has been abundantly shed. When called upon to exercise our political rights granted to us most magnanimously by our new fatherland, in order to serve the cause of liberty, justice, and an honest government, we may well boast of the fact that the majority of German-American citizens, although not immune to temporary errors, have always found their way to those in whose hands national honor and the welfare of the country was safest. There are aberrations to which the alluring voice of the party-spirit could <span class="page-break">12</span>never persuade the German-American citizens! (Applause). Ask the crooked politicians and they will confess that the German vote always causes them anxiety and fear. But inquire of the true patriot, our attitude, and he will tell you that he depends upon the sound, honest, patriotic sense of the German-Americans with full confidence. (Applause).</p>
   <p>"Yet, this is not all. No matter how interested the German-American has been in the struggles and achievements of his Old Fatherland, nor how his wishes may have accompanied his countrymen in all walks of life, his devotion to his adopted fatherland has never been confused with the idea of leading this republic into entangling intrigues with the Old World. Never did the German-American attempt to inject European politics into American politics. However, he has always cherished one desire. It is a patriotic wish, characteristically German, but that of a loyal American as well, namely, that the friendly relations and good-will that have existed between the United States and Germany for these many years may never be clouded by dissension <span class="page-break">13</span>or misunderstanding. May there always be a genuine friendship between the Old and New Fatherland, and may it ever be an inspiration to the other nations of the world! (Applause).</p>
   <p>"We look back upon those dark days of the Revolutionary War, when the Union seemed to totter on the verge of ruin, (Speaker undoubtedly refers to the American Civil War - Translator), when our army suffered defeat after defeat. Not only our enemy, but also our fickle and wavering friends in the Old World predicted with certainty the downfall of the Great Republic. The credit of our nation reached its lowest point. Even the most courageous began to lose hope. In this dark hour, only Germany, and Germany only of all people or nations of the earth kept its faith in the final victory of our good cause, and the future of the United States. Not only that, it poured millions upon millions of its savings unhesitatingly into the Union and this gave the sorely tried republic new strength for the desperate war. Germany was a friend, who assisted the Union - the friend in need - faithfully <span class="page-break">14</span>and gladly, and this we remember with great satisfaction. This friendship was amply rewarded. That this friendship between the Old and New Fatherland may ever remain strong and unclouded is the wish which is carried in the hearts of the German-Americans, and to which they will find a response in the hearts of every noble, patriotic native American.</p>
   <p>"He who does not respect his old mother, nor honor her memory, cannot faithfully love his young bride. He who does not honor the Old. Fatherland is not worthy of the new one. (Con't. applause). Therefore, out of the fullness of our hearts, we send greetings across the ocean. Proud as we are to belong by our own free choice to the great American Republic, we do not deny that we are also proud of being descendants of a great nation, which has planted upon countless battlesfields of arms, science, and labor, trophies of its triumphs for a thousand years. Long before Columbus discovered America, the German nation was a powerful and cultured people. Let us say it aloud today how much we love the land upon which our cradle stood!</p>
   <span class="page-break">15</span>
   <p>(Speaker continues to eulogize Germany and to praise its exhibit at the World's Fair - (over two columns). The following is the conculsion of Schurz's speech - Translator).</p>
   <p>"But to us, Americans of German descent, it must remain an exhortation and an inspiration. May we never forget that our joy over Germany's fame can be real only to the degree that we are worthy of it. He is not worthy of the Old Fatherland, who does not prove himself a loyal and patriotic citizen of the New Fatherland. It means much more today to be a German than it did in former years. The German-American should never forget his duty by respecting and honoring Germany in himself. The German-American can contribute greatly to the development of this new nation, if in what he is and does he combines the best of the American. Let us promise on this day, a day of honor for Germany, that we will live up to this high expectation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">16</span>
   <p>"This is the greeting that we send over there: With love for what you, with gratitude for what you have done, with best wishes for your welfare, and a vow to prove ourselves worthy of you, from the fullness of our hearts, we greet you today - good and great mother of ours, beautiful and lovely fatherland of the Germans!" (Continued thunderous applause).</p>
   <p>(The next speaker addressing the masses was the commissioner of Germany, Mr. Wermuth. He explained the reason for Germany's extensive participation in the World's Fair. What follows are his concluding remarks - Translator).</p>
   <p>"The effects of the World's Fair upon the life of the nations will certainly be lasting and unforgetable. Hundreds of thousands will take with them impressions, which will develop into useful and fruitful ideas for the future. An opportunity is given to many capable and experienced men of all nations, <span class="page-break">17</span>supplemented his speech, and next came Mr. W. Vocke, who delivered the festive speech in classical English, eulogizing Germany's achievements through the past centuries. Enthusiastic ovation - singing by the choirs: "Star Spangled Banner," and finally, the playing of the festive march by Wagner, under the direction of H. Schoenefeld, brought the festivities to a close in the Hall of Music.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously with the celebration in the Hall of Music, a tournament took place in the Arena where all German-American athletic clubs, young and old, male and female, participated. For the late evening a pyrotechnic program was arranged and executed with splendid success. The last column contains a description of the magnificent decorations and special arrangements to make the festivities of Germans Day an outstanding success and a never-to-be-forgotten episode in the life of the visitors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">18</span>
   <p>It is stated officially that 193,575 persons visited the World's Fair on German Day, more than 100,000 above the average attendance - a synopsis of the last eight columns - Translator.</p>
