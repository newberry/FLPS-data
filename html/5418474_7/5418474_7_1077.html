   <p>A German festival, the like of which is rarely seen, even in our city, was held yesterday afternoon and evening in the Swiss Clubhouse; it was in honor of the sixtieth anniversary of the German Veterans Organization of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It was a genuinely German family fest, and it undoubtedly will long remain a pleasant memory for all who participated in it. The fest program was arranged in fine taste, holding the guests fascinated from beginning to end. The fest committee, which carefully made all the arrangements, and which deserves thanks for the success of the festival, consisted of the following comrades: Fritz Lindemann, honorary president of the fest; John Schmidt, fest president; Carl Vogel, president of the organization; Hermann Sengebush, vice-president; Fritz Anton, secretary of the fest; Max Bartsch, treasurer of the fest; August Wolf, treasurer of tickets; Fritz Brumund, August Simon, Eugen Oeschler, Georg Meyer, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Georg Stangle, Hans Stueven, Philip Wagner, Adolf Kopp, and Paul Hallmann. It must not to be forgotten that the ladies of the organization likewise did their level best to make the festival a success.</p>
   <p>The official program of the festival opened at 5:30 P. M. The hall and the stage were decorated with German actors and in a beautiful green. Alongside new German flags, the Star-Spangled Banner greeted the eye.</p>
   <p>When the strains of the "Kaiser Friedrich March" and of the overture to Keler Bela's comic opera were sounded, comrade Fritz Brumund came upon the stage and spoke the festival prologue--Germany's greetings to her warriors on foreign soil: The words are by Wilhelm Sturm. As the "two most faithful of the faithful," Herr Brumund then presented the honorary president of the festival, Fritz Barbarossa Lindemann and the president of the festival, John Schmidt. Both of them welcomed the guests with heartfelt words, giving expression to the hope that they would spend a few pleasant hours in the circle of comrades.</p>

   <p>The Swabian Saengerbund had the kindness to volunteer to enrich the fest by singing a few songs. The singers with their president, John Maurer, at their head, were present in a body, and for their songs, under their choirmaster, H. A. Rehberg, they were accorded well-earned applause. Under the direction of Charles Meinken, Hartwig's orchestra acquitted itself with great credit.</p>
   <p>"Faithfulness is the marrow of honor," This "saw" of the universally honored late president of the Reich, von Hindenburg, was woven like a red thread through the fest speech of the president of the organization, Carl Vogel. He mentioned that, in the German Veterans Organization of Chicago, there are four generations of German soldiers united; he further emphasized that comradeship means readiness to make sacrifices; he also pointed out how the organization's history is closely connected with the history and the development of Chicago. He demonstrated to the attentively listening audience now the organization had done its duty, at all times, by the old and new fatherland, and concluded his interesting remarks with the words: "Our faith in Germany is unshakable--the German and the American flags, united in friendship, will lead the world to a new and happy future". His speech <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>was given a great ovation.</p>
   <p>President Vogel then proceeded to bestow honors upon the members present who had served the organization for twenty-five years and more, and had remained faithful to it. He presented the fest president, John Schmidt, with a diploma of honorary membership which had been awarded him by a recent resolution of the organization, and to Comrade Balthasar Woelfelschneider he gave the customary gold medal for twenty-five-year membership.</p>
   <p>Consul Dr. Tannenberg, accompanied by his wife, was present in place of the German marine attache from Washington, who regretted very much his inability to come. Also present was the former German Consul General and honorary member of the organization, Dr. Simon, and the well-known German journalist and traveller, Dr. Colin Ross. Both came with their wives. They were presented by Herr Vogel, and made short speeches, which were hailed with applause.</p>
   <p>Also present were the presidents of other military organizations of Chicago; they <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>were seated at the speakers' table. The president of the German Veterans' Bund, Comrade Hermann Bick, brought greetings from the chairman of the German-American Veterans' Bund, who also sent a wire.</p>
   <p>Sixty years of faithful work in the interest of the German element in general (and its members in particular) are now behind the German Veterans' Organization. Even during the grave years of the war, filled as they were with assaults upon the Germans settled here, and through the years that followed the war, full as they were of venom, the Organization has held itself steadfast and unshaken.</p>
   <p>Large sums of money were sent by the organization to Germany during and after the war. The organization forms a link between the veterans of the glorious war of 1870-1871, members of the army before the war, and the German soldiers of the World War, who fought for Germany's honor and national existence.</p>
   <p>The German Veterans' Organization sees, in the fostering of comradeship and in the maintenance of the German mother tongue, the most essential link between the mother <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>country and the new homeland.</p>
   <p>Comrades who take an interest in the Organization. its aims and scope, are cordially invited to attend the meetings, held the first Sunday of each month. The home of the organization is the Swiss Clubhouse, 635 Webster Avenue.</p>
   <p>The officers of the German Veterans' Organization of Chicago are: President, Carl Vogel; vice-president, Hermann Sengbusch; secretary, Fritz Anton, 3111 North Racine Avenue; secretary-treasurer, Adolf Kopp; treasurer, Max Bartsch; keeper of archives, Franz Maronde; board of administrators: Fritz Hagemann, August Wolf, and Paul Hallmann.</p>
