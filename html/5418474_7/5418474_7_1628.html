   <p>It is odd, that, either by intention or by accident historical and also battle pictures are barely represented - - - - - -</p>

   <p>Adolph Hirschl's "Prometheus" impresses us with the extraordinary fineness of the tune. This son of the gods is pictured forged to the rocks, and a mighty eagle eating his liver, is covering a large part of his body.

Very interesting are the nymphs where the artist overcame all the technical difficulties caused by the water, between the figures, with a admirable skill.</p>
   <p>A small simple looking painting hangs in the German department. The limits of Genre and landscape is blended in this, but what calls attention to its wonderful perspective, is the vigor and vivacity in which it is executed. It is Kallmorgen's "Fruehling Anfang" (Springtime). The barefooted girl, the tender <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>lawn, the zigzagging river, the village the tree tops gold-dipped by the spring sun - all this is combined in harmony. But in spite of their artistic Value, pictures like these receive little attention, which does not look very flattering for the visiting public. In general the public is struck by the spaciousness, the vivacious coloring or the represented extraordinary event of a picture but it is also a fact that thousands of the visitors see real art works for the first time in their lives and no not even know how to look at them.</p>
