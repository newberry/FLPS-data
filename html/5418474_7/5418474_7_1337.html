   <p>Chairman Ernest Kruetgen declared, in the course of a debate at the Bismarck Hotel during yesterday's meeting of the German Group of the World's Fair that the German Group does not possess enough influence with the management of the World's Fair to have its wishes respected; the opinion he expressed of that management could hardly be regarded as complimentary. It is true that upon all political occasions Germans are repeatedly told how important they are to America and to Chicago, and what a great share they have in the development of the nation, but when it comes to rewarding them with an office or a vote, the issue is dodged.</p>
   <p>During his talk on the Fair the speaker said that he had convinced himself, by means of an inspection of the Fair grounds, that the coming World's Fair will compare favorably in beauty with the Exposition of 1893. If one stands <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>on the terrace of the Adler Planetarium, and pictures buildings and pleasure grounds extending for miles along the shoreline, one can realize that because of its natural location the Fair will be of great beauty.</p>
   <p>A resolution, which recommends to the management of the World's Fair the election of Mr. E. J. Kruetgen as a member of its executive committee, and the outcome of which is anxiously awaited by the German Group, was adopted by the meeting.</p>
   <p>Otto E. Reich was elected chairman of the committee to raise funds.</p>
