Mr.Email Hoechster, the chairman of the general committee, being elected a week ago, opened the meeting. Mr.Louis W.H.Neebe was elected secretary. According to the report read by Mr.Paul Haedicke the executive committee was formed as follows: Chairman, Jos. Schlenker, Sec. Paul Haedicke. Press Committee Haedicke, Neebe and Van Massov. Programme and speakers Committee: V.Manstein, Lindemann and Neebe. Decorative Committee Masse, V.Massov and Jaeschke. Music Com.Jaetschke, Neebe and Haedicke. The recommendation of the general Committee to hold the festival on the 1st of April in the Northside Gymnastic hall without women was accepted. Every guest had to pay $1.00 but was entitled to free beer and lunch. Cigars and other drinks had to be paid for. The press committee had worked out the following appeal to the Germans of Chicago which met with great approval: "As far as the speaking of the German language extends on the first of April of this year, the birthday of the founder of the present Germany is celebrated, who now finishes the 80th year of a hero's life. As unique as Prince Bismarck is in the history of Germany, so unique <span class="page-break">\2</span>will be the celebration, which the German world is arranging for the 1st of April, 1895.</p>
   <p>Ten years ago at his 70th birthday, a National Bismarck celebration was held in Germany, which was so splendid, the likes of which have never before been arranged for an uncrowned person. At that time the Iron Chancellor was still in office, and guided the policy of the German Empine with an incomparable master hand. Today he has retired into private life, and notwithstanding this fact the Bismarck celebration will be greater and more splendid than the previous one. It will not only be a celebration of the German Nation, but of the German world. History has no second example of such an enormous, elementary, voluntary allegiance to a private person. All over the world where the Germans live in all countries, towns and villages this day will be celebrated with gratitude for the deeds of this great man. Also in Chicago one of the greatest meeting places of Germans in the U.S. of A., the general desire for such a celebration has been expressed. The following gentlemen will make festival speeches: Consul Dr. Buentz, Wilhelm Borke, Dr.Theodor Bluthaidt, and Paul Haidicke. The Kalbitz musical choir of 30 musicians has been engaged for the festival. The next meeting will take place March 30 at the same hall.</p>
