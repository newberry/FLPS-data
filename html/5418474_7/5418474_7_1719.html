   <p>To give this festive entertainment during the cold season, appears unusual but nevertheless it is to be given Saturday, March 29th at Mueller's spacious hall, corner North Avenue and Sedgwick Street by the Mizekato Club. According to Lange, Menge and Stern, who constitute the arrangement committee, it is to exceed anything, and everything of its kind. The Hall is to be transformed into an artificial picnic ground, created by the use of artificial grass, flowers, and shrubbery. The production of "living" pictures will be taken care of by Mr. Schweitzer and Lenders. "The Seven Schwaben Hunting Rabbits". "The True incident at the Stuttgart Marketwell". "Catching Whales at Nesen Creed", and other exaggerated sagas, which remind one of the lovely Schwabenland (Southern) German district; also thefamous pillar of fruit, a dime museum, Inidana and the well-known wheel of fortune. A double orchestra under the leadership of H. Schmoll furnishes concert and dance music.</p>
