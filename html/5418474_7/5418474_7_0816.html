   <p>The Concert of the Children Choirs last night at the Central Music Hall was a real hit and a marvellous achievement. The Choir-leader, Mr. Professor Katzenberger, has proved again to be worthy of the task, to organize,train and prepare this immense musical enterprise for the opening of the Chicago World's Exposition.</p>
   <p>Words fail to describe the accuracy, discipline, and outstanding tonal quality of these young choir singers. The Solo-voices are well selected and thrilling. Mr. Katzenberger himself is in every way a master-leader. With words, eyes and motions he seems to electrify, hold and control this multitude of young voices.</p>
