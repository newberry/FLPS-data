   <p>The Song Festival was a success the like of which was never before recorded, and it probably will not be equalled for a long time. On Wednesday evening the mixed chorus sang "Odysseus," an excellent, unforgettable performance, and yesterday afternoon we heard the recitals of the several clubs and the soloists; in the evening the grand chorus, eighteen hundred men, gave a performance which dispelled all doubts about our German singers' ability. No male chorus throughout the land ever enjoyed so tremendous a success. The audience listened spellbound; the performance was overwhelming. And if any doubt existed regarding the festival committee's selection of the soloists, that question was answered by the astounding accomplishments of Mr. Candidus, Mrs. Peschka-Leuther, and Miss Cary in the first part of yesterday evening's concert.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>This concert will be indelibly impressed on the history of Chicago. The audience comprised nearly 12,000 people; the chorus had almost 2,000 members; and there was an orchestra of 150 musicians. The two thousand felt inspired by the occasion; the twelve thousand waxed enthusiastic and expressed their feeling in tumultuous applause; then add to this the immense hall and the intense labor of preparation which was necessary in order to realize this unprecedented performance, and one must exclaim:</p>
   <p>"When can this be repeated!"</p>
   <p>Chicago may pride itself on having organized this affair, and it may take more pride in having made such a success of it. The glory of the achievement must be ascribed to the committee members as well as to the participants. The former worked zealously for the realization of an idea, and the latter, both our local singers and the soloists from other parts of the country, spared no effort to help the affair [succeed]. The male chorus particularly <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>showed that its members adhered to the principle that accomplishment in art requires the renunciation of pleasure. Indeed, their rendition gave conclusive proof that they believed in the old adage.</p>
   <p>The financial success of yesterday evening's performance has helped to allay the fears of the committee. In the afternoon the huge hall showed many vacant seats, enough to cause apprehension. After the artistic offerings of the two previous days, the house should have been packed. In the evening matters assumed a different aspect. The management did not admit more than a thousand people to stand, to avoid crowding in the aisles, and even the receipts must have been about $15,000.</p>
   <p>First Matinee</p>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon's concert did not attract so large a crowd as might have been expected, in view of the highly interesting program and also the circumstance <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>that one of the clubs, a member of the Alliance, offered a composition by its director, the first public performance. Through a printer's error in the official program the song "O Lieb' So Lang' Du Lieben Kannst" (Oh Love as Long as Love Thou Canst) was accredited to Weber instead of W. Malmene, director of the Cleveland Singing Society. Fortunately the mistake was not mentioned or noticed.</p>
   <p>About 3,000 people were present.</p>
   <p>The opening number of the concert was the overture of "Oberon", by Weber, played by the gigantic orchestra. Then followed the Cleveland Singing Society; their male chorus presented the song previously mentioned, "O Lieb' So Lang' Du Lieben Kannst", a poem by Rueckert set to music by the Society's conductor, Mr. Malmene. The rendition was delightful. Mr. Malmene's composition leans strongly to the individualistic style of Abt; the movement is ingratiating, and its development shows exceptional skill. However, in the intermediate <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>movement the theme appears somewhat too elaborate, and a shortening of this part would improve the work considerably. A solo quartet, or rather four soloists, to emphasize its melodious character, proved to be a masterly conception and gave considerable coloring to the whole. The Cleveland Singing Society produced the work of its leader in a truly artistic manner, and it served as a fitting introduction to the subsequent numbers of the great festival. The following soloists deserve particular praise: John B. Long, baritone, Charles Jaster, first tenor, H. J. Votteler, second tenor, and Charles Mudler, second bass.</p>
   <p>Our enjoyment of this exemplary offering was somewhat diminished by the noise of the railroad, which managed to be loudest whenever we were listening to the most interesting parts of the composition; the strains of a brass band, playing outside, were also plainly audible. The next number was a solo by Mrs. Peschka-Leutner. She had selected the "Bravoura with Variations," by Adams, with flute obbligato (Mr. Oesterle). It is impossible to give a <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>description commensurate with her extraordinary achievement. Her voice, true and clear as a bell, filled the immense hall, and although its tonal qualities did not appeal to us, she really sang like a nightingale and trilled like a canary as she sang in alternation with the flute and daringly vied with its strains. The public insisted on an encore, and the artiste complied by repeating the last part of the selection.</p>
   <p>Candidus, in his recitation of the "Walkuere" love song, by Wagner, achieved a similar success, but it must be attributed to his pleasing voice rather than to the composition.</p>
   <p>The main orchestral number of the concert, "Tasso," by Liszt, proved a less fortunate selection. Although the work boasts of some appealing parts, it is one of Liszt's lesser achievements and is modelled too much on the conventional form of the usual overture and therefore lacks sufficient novelty to be effective.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Mr. Balatka [A Chicago German] led the musicians, 150 in all, in a most capable manner, and the orchestra played magnificiently, but the theme became too repetitious, and failed, therefore, to arouse interest; even the final triumphal song was unimpressive because the public had been wearied by the preceding parts of the composition.</p>
   <p>Hannah McCarthy, our Chicago soprano, achieved a triumph in the aria from "Semiramis", by Rossini. She sang magnificiently, and the audience, still under the magic influence of Peschka-Leutner, showed by tumultuous applause that the appealing voice of our Chicagoan was appreciated. In continuing with the soloists, let us mention Mrs. Donaldi, and her presentation of the "Gnadenarie," a presentation which did not come up to our expectations, either in regard to the quality of her powerful voice or in her artistic perceptions--she sang,for the most part, out of tune. E. Schultze, a Chicato tenor, sang the prayer from "Rienzi," taking the place of Mr. Lindau of Cincinnati on the program, a very creditable offering. J. Benzing of Cincinnati was hoarse, and obviously it would have been better if he had not sung Handel's aria from the "Messiah," <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>"Warum Rufen die Voelker".</p>
   <p>The mixed chorus of the Cincinnati Orpheus Society, led by Conductor Barns, sang Haydn's "Te Deum". While nothing exceptional, the presentation would have been regarded as most meritorious under ordinary circumstances, that is, it would have been considered as a great accomplishment anywhere except at a festival of this kind.</p>
   <p>The orchestra played (besides the "Oberon" overture and Liszt's "Tasso," previously mentioned) the Scherzo from the "Midsummer Night's Dream," which was not adapted to the acoustics of the hall, and besides, the tempo was too fast, so that much of the effectiveness was lost. Another offering was the "William Tell" overture, which was excellently performed.</p>
   <p>The Second Evening Concert</p>
   <p>Probably no concert in America ever boasted of a larger audience, and it is <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>doubtful indeed whether a more impressive performance was ever heard anywhere. If the festival had consisted only of last evening's offerings, it would have been epochal in the history of music in America.</p>
   <p>The first part was a choral number, with 1800 members of the Singers' Alliance participating, and no better selection could have been made than Wagner's "Kaisermarsch," a composition inspired by intense patriotism, which, owing to its heavy instrumentation, required no vocal addition in the final climax to be effective. The brief pause before the outburst of applause, which shook the house to its very foundation, gave convincing proof of the audience's unqualified approval. The multitude of more than ten thousand was spellbound. The next selection, Moehring's "Schlachtgebet" (Battle Prayer), for male chorus, was, if anything, still more impressive. The audience, inspired with almost religious awe, insisted on a repetition. Bruch's "Salamis," the last choral piece, was the closing number of the first part of the program and was also acclaimed with the enthusiasm which the rendition merited. "Salamis" is <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>a composition of definitely individualistic character, a masterly example of modern instrumentation in combination with vocal melodies; but to appreciate it fully it behooves one to hear it often, since an effective finale, designed to arouse the audience, is lacking. The unaccompanied choral part was sung by the Young Men's Choral Society of Philadelphia. The number was faultlessly executed in every respect, but the singers gave the impression of being too much at ease, of taking their task too lightly, particularly the tenors, and this became somewhat apparent in their singing.</p>
   <p>The three soloists who sang at intervals, were the tenor Candidus, Mrs. Peschka-Leutner, and Anna Louise Cary. Their offerings were delightful, without exception. Mr. Candidus is endowed with a phenomenal voice, and he is an exceptional artist. He sang Mozart's "Maurerlied" (Mason's Song) in a most passionate and appealing manner. Mrs. Peschka-Leutner, selecting the aria of the "Queen of the Night" from the opera "The Magic Flute," aroused the audience to boundless enthusiasm and admiration by her perfect intonation and her masterly artistry in singing these cadenzas, which have difficult intervals <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>and staccato passages with echo effect. She was rewarded with huge bouquets and upon popular insistence gave an encore, but it became apparent that she now felt tired after her previous efforts. Anna Louise Cary, a pronounced public favorite, received an ovation upon her appearance and sang the oft-repeated aria from Gluck's "Orpheus" in a most enchanting manner, with a spirit of piety befitting the text. Her voice appears to gain in volume as well as in sonority and her magnetic personality seems more puissant than ever. Stormy approval and shouts of bravo prompted her to return to the stage once more; however, it was only to bow.</p>
   <p>For the second part of the concert the first movement of Mendelssohn's "Elijah" was selected. Carl Wolfsohn was the leader; the chorus was the United Beethoven Singing Societies of Chicago in conjunction with the Milwaukee Musical Society, all together 400 singers, and their achievement was by no means dimmed by the great soloists, Peschka-Leutner, Cary, Candidus, and Whitney. Better choral singing was never heard before, though its effectiveness <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>was greatly reduced because this comparatively small chorus had been preceded by the immense combination of singing societies, an oversight of the festival director which cannot be too strongly emphasized. The great accomplishments of these choral societies, which exceeded by far the offerings of the festival chorus, lost thereby in effectiveness. Among the soloists Miss Ettie Butler deserves mention; she sang her small part excellently.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wolfsohn must likewise be mentioned and is entitled to praise for his conscientious supervision during rehearsals, his leadership at the performance, and the high state of perfection attained by the Beethoven Societies, and these words of praise also apply most aptly to Mr. Luening, conductor of the Milwaukee Music Club (Musikverein).</p>
   <p>A Great Honor and Surprise.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Candidus had sung the great cantata at yesterday evening's concert, <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>Louis Wahl, the master of ceremonies, gave a laurel wreath to the artist which had been sent from Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The wreath was twenty inches in diameter and a beautiful white gold-fringed ribbon bore this legend in golden letters:</p>
   <p>"O Kehr' Zurueck, du Kuehner Saenger! (O Gallant Singer, Home Return!) Presented to Wilhelm Candidus by his friends in Frankfurt: Ambrogio, Heymann, Meyerfeld, C. and B. Baerbrauer, Schumann, Colsmann, Klahre, Richter."</p>
   <p>The wreath was sent in a small wooden box, addressed to Mr. Claussenius, and left Bremen on June 12, on the steamship Oder; it arrived [in Chicago] yesterday and was forwarded by the consul [Claussenius] to the Exposition Building. The master of ceremonies presented the gift and said:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Candidus, I am giving you something which will surprise you--a present from friends in Germany, a gift that you will like, and which incidentally pleases us, since it proves that Europe accords to you as much recognition <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>as we do--a laurel wreath! And when you take it home, think not only of those friends who sent it to you, but also of us who presented it here!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Candidus was taken completely by surprise, for the consul obviously had not mentioned the matter, and the singer, deeply moved could only say a few words expressing his thanks.</p>
   <p>The Crowd</p>
   <p>The environs of the Exposition Building presented a highly interesting spectacle. What a crowd! Thousands of people milled about looking at the decorations; scores of vendors of programs, lemonade, waffles, and peanuts offered their wares; singers and committee members helped to increase the vast surging throng; add to these the people trying to obtain a few more tickets at the box office, and one perceives that Michigan Avenue and Adams Street presented the replica of a national convention.</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>Today</p>
   <p>Today's concerts are highly promising. In the afternoon Mrs. Peschka-Leutner., Miss Cary, Messrs. Whitney, Candidus, and Schultze, and Breytschuck the harper will appear; the choral parts will be sung by the Columbus Male Chorus and the Young Men's Chorus of Philadelphia. The first number on the program will be an orchestral selection, Schumann's "Second Symphony".</p>

   <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>
   <p>The "Ninth Symphony," by Beethoven, which is scheduled for the end of the festival, will be given as the final number on Saturday evening, and we append the following terse description by Dr. Fessel, who apparently wrote while still under the overpowering influence of the work. His comments will undoubtedly be of interest to our readers:</p>
   <p>"Throughout my long life I have had repeated opportunities to listen to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, as well as to participate in its performance, but I could never fully understand and co-ordinate the separate parts, regardless of their intrinsic appeal. Only lately, when I heard the rehearsals which Mr. Balatka [a Chicagoan] conducted in such an intelligent, convincing manner and thus had heard the main motives often enough repeated, did I finally apprehend the composer's design. The profound thought underlying this gigantic work overwhelmed me, and the oftener I listened to these rehearsals, the more was I impressed. The work conveys to us nothing less than the fortunes and the development of mankind from their very inception to their <a name="p22" class="page-break">22</a>final culmination; a prophetic tonal picture bridges the milleniums and condenses them within the framework of a colossal descriptive symphony..... It speaks to us of man's ambitions and his efforts and of the uncontrolled forces of nature!".....</p>
   <p>Activities of Visitors</p>
   <p>The Arion [Singing Society] of Fort Wayne went to Lincoln Park in the afternoon,....and also the Druiden Male Chorus of Cincinnati....</p>
   <p>The members of the Philadelphia Singers' Alliance know how to enjoy themselves. After several outings they decided to visit Schoenhofen's Brewry yesterday afternoon, and they spent a pleasant hour there.</p>
   <p>William Mechelke, a brother of our accountant Mechelke in Chicago, is the president of the Philadelphia Singers' Alliance. Tomorrow he will extend an <a name="p23" class="page-break">23</a>invitation to all the singing societies now appearing in our city to participate in the song festival which is to be given next year in Philadelphia in celebration of the two hundreth anniversary of the city and of the State of Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>The two St. Louis clubs, Sozialer Saengerbund (Social Singers' Alliance) and Nord St. Louis Bundeschor (North St. Louis Allied Chorus), enjoyed an excursion on Lake Michigan. When both clubs and their brass band were preparing to board the steamer 'Grace Grammond," they found that the captain had already admitted other passengers although an arrangement had been made, and therefore not all the members could go on the trip. About half the membership of each club walked up the gang plank; the remainder, including the musicians, marched to Uhlich's Hall, where they decided to go to Fischer's Garden. A despicable trick of the captain's to treat visitors to Chicago in such a manner!</p>
   <a name="p24" class="page-break">24</a>
   <p>The Turner Maennerchor (Turners' Male Chorus) of Cincinnati made a tour of the south parks and boulevards, and then called at Seipp's brewery, where their product was subjected to a thorough trial.</p>
   <p>The Columbus Liederkranz (Song Circle) made a round trip by boat to Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>The Columbus Maennerchor (Male Chorus) went to South Park in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>The Bloomington Maennerchor saw the city; they rode in coaches.</p>
   <p>The Sozialer Maennerchor of Louisville viewed Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>The Saengerbund of Buffalo (Singers' Alliance) visited the headquarters of the Liedertafel (Song Club) of Buffalo, at 85 Dearborn Street, but no one was there to receive them. The Saengerbund intends to go on a sightseeing trip through the city today.</p>
   <a name="p25" class="page-break">25</a>
   <p>The Milwaukee Musikverein (Music Club) made a similar trip yesterday.</p>
   <p>The Cleveland Gesangverein (Song Club) will ride through the city and its environs.</p>
   <p>The Philadelphis Junger Maennerchor (Young Men's Chorus) received its guests, many song clubs, at John Fehn's Beer Garden and later visited other singing societies. The association, in its capacity as host as well as guest, was in a most jovial mood but appeared, nevertheless, in full numbers at the afternoon concert and sang, of course, in the evening.</p>
   <p>The Song Club of Pekin, Illinois, made its headquarters at Mr. Fischer's tavern, in the basement of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung building and appeared to enjoy itself hugely. Mr. Fischer naturally does everything in his power to entertain his guests, and the latter certainly recognized his qualifications as an excellent host.</p>
   <a name="p26" class="page-break">26</a>
   <p>The Buffalo Liedertafel and the Arion [Society] of Fort Wayne met at Baum's Pavilion yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>Frohsinn Club's Commerse</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: A Commerse is a sort of banquet; the largest item is beer. Frohsinn means joviality.]</p>
   <p>Joviality predominated at Baum's Pavilion yesterday evening, for the Chicago Frohsinn Club gave a banquet in honor of the Frohsinn Club of Pekin, Illinois, the Frohsinn Club of Cleveland, the Sozialer Maennerchor of Louisville, and the South Side Liederkranz. The festivities began when the clubs arrived at the Pavilion, after the concert in the Exposition Building. Mr. Baum used Bengal illumination and fireworks for the occasion. [Translator's note: The Bengal light is somewhat similar to a Roman candle and produces a brilliant steadily burning blue light; it was formerly used in German theaters abroad.]</p>
   <a name="p27" class="page-break">27</a>
   <p>The chairman of the local Frohsinn Club, Franz Kirchner, delivered the address of welcome.</p>
   <p>After the assembly had feasted, and while drinks were being served, speeches were made by Fritz Sommer and several others. Hermann Conrad recited a mirth-provoking poem in Yiddish dialect. Music, singing, toasts--all helped to provide pleasant hours. A coffin, duly shrouded, was mounted near one of the tables to provide a suitable resting place for any one who might be dead-drunk, but no such contingency arose. All held their heads high to the very end.</p>
   <p>The Druiden Maennerchor</p>
   <p>A jolly banquet was held at the headquqrters of the Chicago Druiden Maennerchor, Pfeiffer's Hall, 408 Sedgwick Street, in honor of the Cincinnati Druiden Saengerbund, and two busses were provided to bring the guests from the Exposition Building to Pfeiffer's Hall after the concert. Pfeiffer's garden was decorated with <a name="p28" class="page-break">28</a>the emblems of all the States of the Union and with the standard and the various emblems of the Order of Druids; illumination was provided by Chinese lanterns.</p>
   <p>It was nearly eleven o'clock when the guests arrived. They were welcomed by the Druiden Maennerchor, with songs and official Druid greetings, and the visitors in their turn replied in song. All together thirty guests were present. Ferdinand Frederich, president of the local Druid Club and one of its founders, acted as master of ceremonies and extended greetings which were reciprocated by Mr. Guthardt, president of the Cincinnati Druiden Saengerbund (Druid Singers' Alliance). The latter club has been in existence for twenty-six years and has excellent singers among its members.</p>
   <p>Although rather cool weather prevailed, every one was jovial and in good spirits. Songs were the order of the day, or shall we say of the evening? And the singing helped to maintain, if not to heighten the congenial attitude. The Druid <a name="p29" class="page-break">29</a>Singing Societies of Pekin, Milwaukee, and St. Louis also had promised to participate but had not arrived by midnight. At four o'clock in the morning busses took the singers to their respective quarters.</p>
   <p>The Swiss Male Chorus</p>
   <p>The Swiss Male Chorus met at Klare's Hall on Clark Street; four hundred guests came to the club's banquet at 11 P.M. The Swiss Male Chorus sang "Nach Den Bergen Moechte Ich Wieder" (I Want to Go Back to the Mountains). Arnold Holinger was appointed chairman. He delivered the address of welcome, and the Sennefeld Liederkranz sang "Der Alte Zecher" (The Old Toper) with its usual verve. Then followed the Arion Club of Fort Wayne, which was represented by twenty-three members.</p>
   <p>The next selection was the quartet, "Fruehlingslied" (Spring Song), by Karl Wilhelm, which the Swiss Male Chorus sang brilliantly, evoking prolonged <a name="p30" class="page-break">30</a>applause. Mr. Holinger then introduced one of the oldest and most prominent Swiss pioneers, Mr. Straub, three times mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee. The old gentleman said a few words of appreciation. The Sennefeld Liederkranz sang next. Otto Anner of Cincinnati then recited with pathos and enthusiasm the poem "Das Weisse Kreuz in Rothen Feld" (The White Cross in the Field of Red--the Swiss flag) and received loud applause. And so a diversified program was enjoyed, including choral selections, duets, quartets, toasts, speeches, and beer. The Swiss Male Chorus certainly proved to be most generous and able hosts, and the happy assembly did not break up till sunrise. Methinks the comet,vagrant of the universe, only made its appearance to take in the great song festival.</p>
   <p>The Cleveland Singing Society and the Germania Male Chorus of Chicago met at Fischer's Garden. Since only a few members of the latter organization were present, the Cleveland club sang alone, and other guests, in recognition of the rare treat, rewarded the members with generous applause.</p>
   <a name="p31" class="page-break">31</a>
   <p>The Odd Fellows' Chorus</p>
   <p>After the concert at the Exposition Building the members of the A. P. A. Male Chorus of Cincinnati went to the headquarters of the Odd Fellows' Chorus, Werner's place, 274 State Street, where a banquet was held. In the daytime both clubs had gone on a sightseeing tour of Chicago and had visited Lincoln Park, Fischer's Garden, the city water works, and the Stockyards. They even made a trip to the crib. Small wonder then that the club's president, Adolph Kuechler, was so hoarse that he could not deliver the opening speech at the banquet, and had to delegate this function to his friend Joel Steinberg. After the introductory address the Chorus sang "Auf Den Bergen" (On the Mountains), and it was a most effective performance. Then the A. P. A. Male Chorus sang the patriotic ditty "Schoener Rhein, Vater Rhein" (Beautiful Rhine, Father Rhine), and then attention centered on the sumptuous repast and the barley brew. Messrs. Leopold Goth, secretary, John Pfund, treasurer, W. Gobrecht, and H. Bembenick formed a <a name="p32" class="page-break">32</a>committee on arrangements which lays out the program every morning for the afternoon festivities. The singers on their tour of the city also visited one of their former members, Richard Kappes, now a resident of Chicago living at 279 West Madison Street, and serenaded him. Yesterday's banquet was a most enjoyable affair.</p>
   <p>The Singers from Buffalo</p>
   <p>The singers from Buffalo met at Weber's tavern, 160 South Clark Street, yesterday evening, and the Buffalo Saengerbund played host to the Buffalo Liedertafel. The singers congregated there after the concert at the Exposition Building, and many ladies were present. Mr. Allgewaehr, president of the Saengerbund, spoke and thanked the assembly for responding to his invitation; he proposed a toast to which the gentlemen present readily responded, and many a glass was emptied. At the suggestion of Mr. Brown, musical director, the members sang "Freunde, Brueder!" (Friends, Brothers!) in perfect form.</p>
   <a name="p33" class="page-break">33</a>
   <p>The Liedertafel, led by Mr. Mischka, sang "Er Lebe Hoch!" and then followed the Saengerbund with the song "Maedchen, vor Einem Wort Huet' Dich Sehr". After various recitations conversation became general, and many a drink was consumed ere the happy throng departed in the morning.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Orpheus</p>
   <p>The local Orpheus Society will give a banquet this evening in the reception hall of the Exposition Building, and all the singing societies have been invited.</p>
   <p>The Press Committee</p>
   <p>The Press Committee will again hold its session today at Quincy Number Nine because their office at the Exposition Building is difficult to reach. Out-of-town newspaper men will also receive their invitations to the Pacific Hotel <a name="p34" class="page-break">34</a>reception at Quincy Number Nine, since not all the members of the newspaper fraternity could be notified because of the incomplete list of addresses. It is hoped that all accredited members of the press will participate. The executive officials, the president of the board, the board of control, the chairmen of the various committees, the festival conductor, the soloists, and the members of the local press are all invited. A very interesting event is anticipated.</p>
   <p>The press committee will meet promptly at 10:30 A.M. in the Green Parlor of the Grand Pacific Hotel to make the final arrangements preparatory to receiving the guests at 11:30 this forenoon.</p>
   <p>An Invitation</p>
   <p>Mr. Kadish, in the name of the Lincoln Park commissioners, extended a cordial invitation to the soloists of the song festival to see the Park and provided <a name="p35" class="page-break">35</a>carriages for the occasion, and also offered the use of the Natatorium to the ladies of the Milwaukee Musikverein today between nine o'clock and one.</p>

   <p>The Decorations</p>
   <p>The exterior decorations of the Exposition Building are a credit to the <a name="p38" class="page-break">38</a>designers. Poles bearing emblematic shields, garlands, and flags were erected on both sides of Adams Street and of Michigan Avenue. Symbolic frescoes appear over the entrance of the hall, and it all conveys the impression of a castle surrounded by a forest with gaily ornamented streets leading to the stronghold. On the southeast and northeast corner of Wabash Avenue and Adams Street are the previously mentioned [earlier issue] pyramidal displays supporting a symbolic representation of the goddess of music, and the lower marbled part bears the following poetic inscription:</p>
   <p>"The victor of a gory battle</p>
   <p>Will often be bedecked with laurels,</p>
   <p>But this army, singing so jubilantly,</p>
   <p>Longs for greater achievements.</p>
   <p>"Though the Germans differ in thought,</p>
   <p>And thousands of opinions prevail,</p>
   <p>One fundamental force unites them all,</p>
   <p>The compelling power of German song.</p>
   <a name="p39" class="page-break">39</a>
   <p>"If any one is unmoved by song,</p>
   <p>Accept him not in your midst.</p>
   <p>Amphion's art affects him not,</p>
   <p>Though it could imbue stones with life.</p>
   <p>"Be not morose or sad,</p>
   <p>Since we have but few days of happiness;</p>
   <p>Be contented in the bustle of life,</p>
   <p>But never, never forget your goal.</p>
   <p>"Art is immortal,</p>
   <p>Elevating,</p>
   <p>Forget vulgar things today!"</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The following two lines appear in English.]</p>
   <a name="p40" class="page-break">40</a>
   <p>"The charms of music are never lost,</p>
   <p>She speaks the universal language of the heart."</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The next four lines continue in German.]</p>
   <p>"Where thousands congregate</p>
   <p>Euthusiasm reigns supreme.</p>
   <p>They came to the sacred shrine</p>
   <p>To listen to the anointed who have dedicated their</p>
   <p>lives to art.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The next two lines are given in English.]</p>
   <p>The man who hath no music in his soul</p>
   <p>Is fit for treason, stratagems, and spoils."</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung Building</p>
   <a name="p41" class="page-break">41</a>
   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung Building is decorated to the very top. Windows are framed with green garlands, and scores of flags, black, white, and red [German colors at that time] and red, white, and blue, are displayed on every floor. The main entrance on the Fifth Avenue side is elaborately ornamented, and above the portal a picture is mounted showing the goddess of music and poetry, and the following verse appears beside the painting:</p>
   <p>"German manners and customs</p>
   <p>We shall always defend</p>
   <p>And German songs are a</p>
   <p>Most welcome ally."</p>
   <p>Another motto, at the Washington Street entrance, proclaims:</p>
   <p>"A good song, a fearless word, and a happy Disposition</p>
   <p>Are man's greatest treasures!"</p>
   <a name="p42" class="page-break">42</a>
   <p>The Headquarters</p>
   <p>Feldcamp's Quincy Number Nine is headquarters for the singers, and the place is festively decorated in a dignified manner, as befits the occasion, without any gaudy gingerbread affects. The triumphal arch on the corner of Randolph and La Salle Streets is very impressive. The span is ornamented with a picture showing Orpheus with his lyre, and a plain coat of arms bears the legend: "Welcome to Headquarters". The interior is draped with fresh green garlands and with many placards bearing suitable inscriptions.</p>
   <p>The South Side</p>
   <p>A highly decorative scheme on the South Side was not feasible, nor could it be expected, for many buildings are occupied by thirty to fifty concerns, and there are few residential buildings in that part of the city. Nevertheless, Randolph Street and parts of State Street, Clark Street, and Fifth <a name="p43" class="page-break">43</a>Avenue have been attractively decorated. The various places which the singers selected for their headquarters were, of course, profusely decorated, and in a great many instances very artistic effects were obtained. To give a detailed account would require columns; so we shall mention only a few. Besides the Illinois Staats-Zeitung Building, the Times Building, and the Briggs House, various American business houses were ornamented with garlands and flags. Even as far south as 39th Street, Cottage Grove Avenue presented a festive appearance. Americans and Germans alike decorated their houses and places of business, and garlands and flags were displayed in profusion.</p>
   <p>The Julius Bauer Music House on Wabash Avenue, Grommes and Ullrich on Madison Street, and F. Madlener on Lake Street, all three German firms, have decorated their establishments very nicely for the occasion.</p>
   <p>The North Side</p>
   <p>The decorations on Clark Street, the "German Broadway of Chicago," show great <a name="p44" class="page-break">44</a>improvement. When we published the first account, in an earlier issue, the work was still in progress, but now this street is very impressive in appearance. With few exceptions all the houses are decorated as far north as Lincoln Park. On the four corners of North Clark Street and Chicago Avenue pedestals are mounted supporting beautiful large vases with natural flowers and plants; the corner of Ohio and Clark Streets, also, near Fehn's tavern, is similarly decorated. Brand's Hall, which still presented a plain exterior on Wednesday morning, is now bedecked with garlands and flags. On a canvas sign appears the inscription: "Headquarters of the Germania Maennerchor, Chicago". Yondorff Brothers' large clothing store at the corner of North Avenue and Larrabee Street was splendidly decorated. Highly ornate arches with German and American colors, garlands, green foliage, and flowers proved very effective. This firm hired a brass band which plays every evening throughout the duration of the festival and draws huge crowds. The Germans on the North Side did as much as their countrymen farther south. Nearly every place of business displayed at least a flag, and most firms added other decorations.</p>
   <a name="p45" class="page-break">45</a>
   <p>The West Side</p>
   <p>On the West Side decorations are noted only occasionally. Labor Hall at the corner of Waller and Twelfth Streets and the Vorwaerts Turnhalle are about the only places with conspicuous decorations. On Halsted Street, Randolph Street, Blue Island Avenue, and Milwaukee Avenue only a few flags and wreaths were seen. The residents of the West Side probably believed that the North and South Sides would monopolize the festivities and therefore considered it useless to bother with decorations, a conclusion which was more or less justified.</p>
   <p>Poetry</p>
   <p>If any one believes the assertions of various neighboring communities that Chicago is so prosaic a city that the businessmen, in their haste to make money, give a parting kiss in the morning to the comely servant girl instead <a name="p46" class="page-break">46</a>of the wife, since the men are so much absorbed in speculations that they do not know the difference, and that, therefore, there is no place for poetry in Chicago, then let it be known hence forward that this theory needs revision; the occurrences of the last few days warrant it. Much was written for the occasion; Pegasus, the divine horse, was heavily encumbered. Poets by the dozen mounted the steed, and some very good material came to light, as may be expected under the circumstances, considerable poetic license was indulged in, and the reader must therefore close one eye, or both eyes, to the metric combinations, and this leniency should be shown also to the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, which may have overlooked this or that poetic gem in spite of a dozen special reporters whom we hired to cover the event. Omissions of any sort were not deliberate, and it should also be remembered that the collector of all these poetic exclamations, verses, mottoes, and what have you, was chiefly bent on gathering humorous verse.</p>
   <a name="p47" class="page-break">47</a>
   <p>[Translator's note: Now follow two columns of poems, written by the various song clubs, which we omit. The subjects are singing and its beneficent effect on humanity as a peace-promoting agency, beer, which, of course, is indispensable at a festival of this kind, some laudatory comments on the soloists, etc.]</p>
   <p>The Flags at the Festival</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Nearly a column is condensed in the translation.] The various club flags form a very interesting part of the festival.......The oldest club standard is of silk with blue background with the inscription: "First German Singers' Alliance of North America, organized June 2, 1849." The other side of the banner is white and bears the legend: "Dedicated by the German women of Columbus to the Thirteenth Alliance Festival, August 29, 1865."</p>
   <a name="p48" class="page-break">48</a>
   <p>The Flag of the Frohsinn Club is of silk, with white background, showing a lyre, beautifully embroidered; the text is "Gesangverein Frohsinn". The reverse side reads, "Dedicated by the Ladies' Chorus, founded April 17, 1869, Chicago, Illinois".</p>
   <p>.....The North Chicago Maennerchor has the inscription, "Dedicated to the Nord Chicago Maennerchor by the women members of the club, October 20, 1873; founded May 1, 1869." The Schiller Liedertafel of Chicago uses a beautiful American Star-Spangled Banner with a blue and white pennant. The Teutonia Maennerchor of Chicago has a blue silk banner, showing an oak wreath and a lyre and the following words, "Founded May 13, 1869". The banner of the Orpheus Maennerchor of Chicago shows the name of the association and the <a name="p49" class="page-break">49</a>date of foundation, 1872. The Liederkranz Eintracht, Chicago, has a blue banner which, like the one preceding, shows only the club's name and the year of organization, 1876. The flag of the Freier Saengerbund of Chicago on a blue silk background shows the name of the club and the founding date, February 2, 1876. The reverse side on a white background, shows a lyre surrounded by a wreath on which appears the name of various composers. The Liederkranz Eintracht of Chicago [besides its own banner] carries a heavy silk American flag. The Sennefelder Liederkranz of Chicago, founded September 10, 1868, has a blue silk banner; on the reverse side an eagle is shown in beautiful embroidery. The Allemania Maennerchor of Chicago, founded on June 16, 1874, has a banner with the inscription, "Dedicated by the ladies on October 18, 1875". The next flag showed the following: "Swiss Male Chorus, Chicago, 1869, dedicated by the ladies". The reverse side of the banner shows the white cross on a red background. The Concordia Male Chorus of Chicago, founded January 6, 1880, has a beautiful Star-Spangled Banner with pennant.</p>
