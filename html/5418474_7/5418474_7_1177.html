   <p>The management and all the twenty-eight sections of the Gegenseitiger Unterstuetzungs-Verein (Mutual Benefit Society) held their annual picnic yesterday under the stately trees of Harms Park, at Western and Berteau Avenues. As usual, the picnic turned out to be a real popular festival, with all which that entails--children's amusements, and singing. Those who stayed at home on this day, because they thought it too hot for attending a summer festival, came in the evening, when cool breezes had sprung up.</p>
   <p>The picnic started early in the afternoon, and lasted far into the evening. There was a merry-go-round for the little ones. In the course of the day a children's procession took place, after which every child received a present. While the young folks engaged in dancing, which they seemed to enjoy in spite of the hot weather, the older people enjoyed a glass of beer and a bite to eat in the shade. Old acquaintances were renewed, and new ones made.....</p>
   <p>In the course of the festival, the president of the Society, John Cremer, had the opportunity of welcoming a number of politicians and political candidates who honored the Society with their presence. The singing section of the Society later, under the leadership of its director, Albrecht Wagner, sang a few jolly songs, which contributed to the gaiety of the festival. The committee was composed of John Cremer, president; John Sieben, secretary; and Lorenz Schlegel, treasurer, and also of one representative from each of the twenty-eight sections of the Society, which now has five thousand members.</p>
