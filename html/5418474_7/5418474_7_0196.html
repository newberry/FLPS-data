   <p>From reliable sources we have been informed, that influential and wealthy Germans are planning to build a German Theater in Chicago. In fact, further details in regard to this project may be available in a few days. The place for it has already been selected. It will be in Randolph Street, directly east of Epstein's Dime Museum. The land will be leased for a ninety nine year period and a twelve story office building is to be erected. Bonds, reasonably priced, to enable the less fortunate to participate in the venture, will be sold to raise the necessary funds. We greet such an enterprise in the interest of German art; it is most welcome indeed.</p>
