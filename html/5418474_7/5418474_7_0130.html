   <p>Judge Gibbons has granted to-day an injunction to Augustin Daly against Miss Lillian Walrath, thus preventing the latter from performing or showing a translation of Sundermann's "Ehre" on the stage. The injunction is taking effect, starting this coming Saturday.</p>
   <p>Augustin Daly, Judge Gibbons said, has proved sufficiently, that he actually obtained the performance-rights, which fact cannot be put aside, by any publication of the original in bookform.</p>
