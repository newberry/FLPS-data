The reception and entertainment committee reported that its ranks have now been filled by the election of additional members to its staff. The treasurer's account shows receipts of $319.80, and expenditures amounting to $227.55.</p>
   <p>The report of the railroad and transportation committee in regard to the problem of bringing the Milwaukee Turners, who participated in the Alliance festival, directly to the World's Fair and to eleminating the Chicago parade, brought about a lengthy debate.... Turner Charles Bary reported that he expects an answer in the very near future from the World's Fair directorate in regard to the specific days, when the large music hall and the arena will be available for regular class performances. The technical staff made the following recommendations:</p>
   <p>1.) To employ a gymnastics instructor for the duration of the World's Fair; <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a man who is... well known among both Germans and Americans, whose duty-it shall be to represent the Turner alliance before the Fair directorate and to be likewise a representative for the German system, if such a suitable person can be found.</p>
   <p>2.) To employ an instructor during the duration of the Fair, who shall teach gymnastics to the youngsters in the Children's building and who shall arrange the programs, subject to assent from the technical executive board, and who shall also serve on the gymnasium teachers course, if the latter should materialize.</p>
   <p>3.) To offer a recommendation to the local association to reconsider the locale of the gymnastic teacher's course (if possible, it should be held in Chicago for a duration of six to eight weeks during July and August, instead of in Milwaukee).</p>
   <p>4.) The gymnasium teacher who will be in charge of the children's division shall be given a salary of $600.</p>
   <p>5.) A recommendation to the local Turner administration, that it shall ask <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the various manufacturers of gymnastic equipment to donate the necessary apparatus for the Children's building at the Exposition.</p>
   <p>All recommendations were accepted and will be submitted to the St. Louis Alliance's executives. Various committees were incorporated into other bodies to facilitate the work.. After several routine matters were attended to, the administration adjourned until Feb. 18th.</p>
