   <p>Last night's performance of "Sodom and Gomorrha," at McVickers Theatre, was one of the most delightful plays.. The farce was excellent, not in the least offending--as is so often the case with modern farces. Mr. Luhr has proven again that he is not a fit person for light conversational plays; on the other hand, Miss Reinhardt, through her performance, acquired new friends. Miss Thyssen, the debutante of last night's performance, made a very good impression. Miss Wassmann was charming as usual. Mr. Ravene and Mr. Rodenberg deserve to be mentioned as having added to the fun. Mrs. Meier acted her part well, but the laurels for the evening go to Mr. Meier for the masterly character presentation; not omitting mention of Miss Gilbert and Mr. Heinemann, who completed the cast.</p>
