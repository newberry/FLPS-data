   <p>The Financial Committee of the Singer's festival held a well attended meeting in the Club room of No. 9 Quincy Street, last night. Mr. Adolph Schoeninger opened same and declared that the numerous attendance proves that the Germans still hold together for their National festivals. It is about 9 years since the peace festival has been celebrated in Chicago and he thinks that the intended singers festival will be a good opportunity to demonstrate German's glory.</p>
   <p>All Germans in Chicago should cooperate to make this festival a very distinguished one and worthy of the old country. Secretary Ad. Fuerstenberg explained the financial plan, which had been prepared for the intended festival under consideration of former similar festivals held in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, etc. The coming Chicago festival should be quite equal to the ones held previously in other American cities and should be in keeping with the reputation and importance of Chicago. The following proposals were them offered; 1. The amount necessary to carry the festival to success in a manner worthy of the Germans in Chicago should not be less than $50,000,00. 2. For this purpose Bonds of $10 and $20 denomination should be sold and they should be redeemed partly of entirely according to the financial success of the success of the undertaking. <span class="page-break">\2</span>3. Those who do not wish to become Bondholders can make voluntary contributions of any amount they wish. 4. It is recommended to elect a Committee of 5 members for the sale of these bonds and for the collection of the cash. 5. A Committee of 3 should be elected to work out the publicity for the whole population of Chicago and Cook County. This financial plan has been taken from the Cleveland plan at their last festival, which had been proved a great success. It is not probable that the $50,000 would be fully required as even in the small Cleveland festival $20,000 were taken in at the gates. No. 1 proposal has been accepted after a short debate. Opinions about No. 2 proposal varied. Some held the amount of the bonds too low and some thought by increasing it the whole amount needed for the festival could be collected more easily. Others thought that the original proposal to make the bonds as low as possible was right and that they would be taken up quicker by the middle class. In conclusion this proposal as well as all others have been accepted in their original form. A proposal to nominate a Committee of 5 to report in the next meeting was also accepted and Messrs. Buchler, Bocke, Kadish, Sommers and Beiersdorf were elected. Mr. Amberg the President of the Central Board said, that, he was pleased about the lively interest, which proves <span class="page-break">\3</span>that there is no doubt about the success of the festival. The Cleveland Club has advised to wait till the end of June, by which time also the Exhibition Buildings will be free. The costs of the festival were anticipated as $43,000.00, of which quarters will be, $11,250, publicity(ads and printing) $3,000.00, Music $15,860.00, Decorations $3,000.00, rent for halls $8,000.00, Miscellaneous $1,500.00.</p>
   <p>The meeting was adjourned till next Friday.</p>
