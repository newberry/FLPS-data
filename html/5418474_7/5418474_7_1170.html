   <p>Beneath the shade trees of Harm's Park, and favored by ideal weather, the Hungarian Nationals' Sick Aid Society of Chicago celebrated its annual summerfest. The organization's administration, in co-operation with representatives of various other groups, made the festival a success. The numerous visitors had a pleasant day and will, undoubtedly, remember it for a long time.</p>
   <p>Many families arrived around noon to eat, in the open, the food they had brought with them, or to recreate themselves in the dining room or in the veranda with the delicate viands prepared in the kitchen by the ladies of the organization. The bar had good wine and whisky on tap and those who wanted to refresh themselves on good ice cream or soft drinks were given a chance to do so.</p>
   
   <p>In the dance hall, music was furnished in the afternoon and evening. Quite a pleasure was it to sit in the Hungarian Csarda (pronounced tshardah-road-side ian), where genuine Hungarian Gipsy music could be enjoyed together with one's drinks. Other popular entertainments, varied in manner, were provided. Toward evening the singing section of the "Hungarians" entertained with songs.</p>
   <p>As is the custom among the Hungarians, youth was given the chief consideration yesterday. Following a procession through the park, preceded by the officers of the organization and by the band, every child received a nice present. Prior to this, President John Hess made special mention to the effect that the future of the organization lies with the youth. He said that when introducing the guests of honor by the president, and after he extended a hearty welcome to all the guests present.</p>
