   <p>In their hall on Diversey Parkway, the Lincoln Turnverein celebrated their harvest festival with a two-day bazaar. The attendance was very good on both days, so that the festival could wind up with a considerable net profit.</p>
   <p>On Sunday afternoon, a film of the last Turnfest at Moline was shown. The film was taken by Herr Adolf Oppenheimer of Davenport.</p>
   <p>A number of members from the ladies' section contributed songs. Toward evening an orchestra provided dance music.</p>
   <p>As guests of honor, there were present the first speaker of the Illinois Turn District, Leopold Saltiel, from Davenport, Iowa, Ludwig Berg, former secretary of the district of the upper Mississippi, and, from Rock Island, Mrs. Ida Mae Lange, a leading member of the women's section in the North American Turner-bund.</p>
   
   <p>The committee for the festival was composed as follows: Chairman, Joe Strohmeyer; vice-chairmen, Harry Waldhauer and Lydia Collopy; secretary, Wilhelm Sonter; treasurer, Henry Sisser.</p>
