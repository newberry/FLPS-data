   <p>Last night's performance at the Powers Theater brought honors in full measure to Chicago's beloved German actress, Victoria Welb-Markham. The artist celebrated her twentith anniversary of association with the German stage in Chicago. The play she chose for this occasion was "The Famous Woman" by Schoentan and Kadelburg. At her first appearance on the stage last night, she was greeted enthusiastically, by her admiring audience. Her acting was as usual beyond criticism, for which she repeatedly scored a generous applause.</p>
