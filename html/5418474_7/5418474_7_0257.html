   <p>"On the Hunt for a Bride," a comedy by Hugo Burger, was played yesterday in the Mc Vicker's Theatre before a well-filled house. It is a superb play, it refers to a "marriage of convenience" between Miss Potter(actress)Miss Scherzel) and Mr.Richards (actor, M. Paul Gersdorff), a man of the world and which is happily prevented through a friend of the bride, Mary Delmont( Miss von Troutmann( By a number of interesting conplications, it is joined together in wedlock as nature intended it to be.</p>
   <p>The players are very true to life and the scenes are very natural. Burger has declined to create cheap effects in order to get applause from the public. As regards the play only good can be said of it. Miss Von Troutmann, taking the part of Marie Delmont, won the sympathy and admiration of the public.</p>
   <p>In the role of Miss Potter, Miss Scherzel distinguished herself without doubt as a very valuable artist and the public will have many opportunities <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to admire her rich talent. Mr. Richard played Paul Gersdorff with the ability that belongs to the man of the world. His acting has been generally recognized as masterful. New laurels were given to Mr. Meyer who played the part of old man Potter. He acted the old man with great fervor. Miss Kaselovski won applause as Mrs. Potter and Messrs. Waldorf and Engel played their parts very satisfactorily. Ensemble, wardrobes and decorations were much better than in previous performances at the German Theatre.</p>
