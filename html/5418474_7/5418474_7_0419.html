   <p>The Singing Section of the Mutual Aid Society of Chicago, although founded in 1925, has, until now, been before the public only seldom. The concert performed last night in the Logan Square Masonic Temple was executed in such a manner that everyone wants to hear more from this chorus.</p>
   <p>"Norsaren-Gesang," by Baumann, and "Ewig liebe Heimat," by Briet, were the first two selections. The manner in which the two songs were rendered showed real co-operation between singers and the conductor, Albrecht Wagner. This impression was increased by the singing of Schubert's "Die Macht" and Christ's "'S war immer so".</p>
   <p>The vocal material is good, and the conductor was successful in his endeavor to make use of it.</p>

   <p>The Vorwaerts Schiller Men's chorus and the Chicago Liedertafel, both of which groups have Merr Albrecht Wagner for their conductor, as well as the delegates of the United Men's Choruses, under their president, Joe Keller, had the kindness to give a few numbers from the program and contributed their share to the success of the fest. The Vorwaerts Schiller sang "Alpennacht," by Beschmitt, and "Wie ich so lieb dich hab'," by Geis, and the Chicago Liedertafel gave Egles' "Schifferstaendchen," with tenor solo by Irge and baritone solo by Kaiser--also Bunte's "Winterlied".</p>
   <p>The United men's choruses won honors with Hurz' "Kroent den Tag" and Fuellekruss" "Waldluft".</p>
   <p>At the close, all the singers joined in "Rosenstock, Holderbluet," by Silcher, and in a great "Abschiedchor". It was a finale in which all singers--the singing section of the G. U. V. and the guests--joined in a great mass chorus which brought the concert to a close.</p>

   <p>A considerable part of the success of the concert is due to Graef's orchestra, offering German tunes, as well as heavy food first at the some-what protracted opening of the concert and then between the individual vocal recitals (sic). They acquitted themselves of their task to the satisfaction of all. John Frank entertained with his well-modulated, clear voice.</p>
   <p>The concert committee, having made preparations for the concert in such a successful manner, consisted of the following singers: President Gustav Theilmann, who also made the guests welcome with a few cordial words; Georg Nuernberg; Ticket treasurer William Derner, Emil Petter, Hans Wunderlich, John Wenzel and Julius Lindner.</p>
