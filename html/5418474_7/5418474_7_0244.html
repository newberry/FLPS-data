   <p>The Theatre management of Collmer-Isenstein, has received a lesson last night, in producing Bjorson's drama; "Ein Fallissement" (A Bankruptcy.)</p>
   <p>It would be advisable, that the management be more cautious, in the selection of the repertoire, and above everything else, consider the conditions and circumstances of the country. It can not be assumed, that every play, just because it has had a great success in Europe, would produce the same effect here. Just the contrary can happen, on account of peculiar conditions, and a fiasco is inevitable. Last nights performance was a proof of this. To the American merchant, bankruptcy does not seem to be such a great calamity as it is, to the Norwegian or German business man. To the average merchant here, insolvency does not seem a very serious matter, and there is no shrinking from the usual trick, by which the debtor enriches himself, at the cost of the creditors, who have to be satisfied and, consider it a special privilege and an act of mercy, on the part of the debtors, if they don't lose the last penny in such proceedings. This is apparently the reason why "Ein Fallissement" had no drawing power.</p>

   <p>That the performance received any appreciation at all, is due, not only to the exquisiteness of this work, but to the expert impersonation of each character. The scenery was beautiful. Next Sunday night, the opera, "Das goldene Kreutz" (The Golden Cross) will be brought to the stage of this theatre.</p>
