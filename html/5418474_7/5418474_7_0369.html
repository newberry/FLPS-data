   <p>A group of certain teetotalers proceeded very clandestinely to fight Sunday pleasures, and our German club festivities were also endangered thereby.</p>
   <p>The Vereinigte Maennerchoere (Allied Male Choruses) also led this fight and sent a delegation with a petition to Edward J. Dunne, mayor of Chicago at that time.</p>
   <p>The Mayor readily perceived how energetically the singers were fighting for <span class="page-break">\2</span>their liberty and sensed approaching difficulties. Hence he promised the delegation that no ordinances of such a nature would be enacted.</p>
   <p>Nothing more was heard of the league for the promotion of blue laws and it appeared that everything was quiet and peaceful.</p>
   <p>But in 1906, after the hypocrites and heroic moral crusaders had unobtrusively gathered their forces, they ventured forth anew, and this time used stronger tactics.</p>
   <p>The Vereinigte Maennerchoere were again the vanguard in the fight for personal freedom. At their meeting on May 5, 1906, it was decided to send a strong protest, in English, to the Associated Press. All German clubs were requested, moreover, to send delegates to the next meeting of the recently founded branch of the National Alliance. The new branch, however, <span class="page-break">\3</span>did not consider itself strong enough to complete its task, and other ways had to be found.</p>
   <p>As the Vereinigte Maennerchoere had resolved not to desist until success was assured, they consulted the old Citizens' Alliance, and the latter was willing to take the leadership.</p>
   <p>A special organization was founded and given the rather long name, The United Societies for Local Self-Government. [Translator's note: The Abendpost gives the name in English. It is not explained whether the United Societies for Local Self-Government and also the old "Citizen's Alliance" are American or German organizations.]</p>
   <p>Within a few weeks this newly founded association succeeded in arranging a <span class="page-break">\4</span>mass demonstration the like of which has not been witnessed before in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Thousands upon thousands filled the hall and crowded adjacent streets, listening to the fiery speeches and inspiring melodies of our singers.</p>
   <p>As a result of this impressive mass demonstration the City Council found itself compelled to make the desired concessions and thus a far-reaching victory was won. The fruits of the victory fell to the clubs, to be enjoyed by them in peace. The Vereinigte Maennerchoere may well be proud of the fact that they started the ball rolling.</p>
   <p>After all, we must note that these festivities represent the lifeblood of the associations and with the surplus derived from their arrangements the rent for the club hall, the salary of a music leader, etc., are paid.</p>

   <p>G. Ehrhorn, F. Amberg</p>
   <p>After the usual concerts and entertainment, a special event took place on November, 1907, when Franz Amberg, founder and organizer of the Vereinigte Maennerchoere as well as the Orpheus Maennerchor, celebrated his golden jubilee as a singer.</p>
   <p>His efforts to promote the cause of German song were untiring, over a period of fifty years! Oblivious to distress and storm, despite dissension and lack of recognition, he secured for German songs a lasting place in this city.</p>
   <p>Often he was compelled to face a bitter fight whenever his enemies, prompted by selfishness and jealousy, endeavored to belittle his life's work, and attempted to deny his just reward. But the man was honest in his convictions and worked unselfishly and faithfully in the interests of German song, and <span class="page-break">\6</span>the respect which the conservatives of the singing societies accorded him soon silenced his opponents and the "wise guys" who are found everywhere. He labored indefatigably, oblivious to personal gain. His enthusiasm for German folk songs was genuine, and he always gave time and effort in their behalf.</p>
   <p>The valiant old gentleman lived to enjoy the honors which he so rightly deserved. His golden jubilee as a singer was celebrated in the form of a banquet on November 21, 1907, and in spite of the extensive preparations which the festival entailed, it was possible to make it a complete surprise for Mr. Amberg. That splendid festival is still vividly remembered by everyone who participated.</p>
   <p>Another genial song leader, who always collaborated with the organizer of the song movement, was also able to celebrate a jubilee soon afterwards.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The Nestor of the Chicago choral directors, Gustav Ehrhorn, held his golden jubilee as music conductor on April 21, 1909. He surmounted all difficulties and under his leadership the song clubs proved very successful. The clubs showed their esteem and gratitude by giving an imposing concert at Orchestra Hall on November 21.</p>
   <p>The president and the officials of the North American Saengerbund (Singers' Alliance) came from all parts of the country to congratulate Mr. Ehrhorn. He was given a diploma, and thus became an honorary member of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Franz Amberg was also to be presented with this mark of distinction, but refused definitely to accept it on this evening as he did not wish to rob his old friend and companion-at-arms of the center of the stage. The diploma conferring honorary membership in the Alliance was therefore presented to him at a mass choral rehearsal in the presence of a huge and <span class="page-break">\8</span>enthusiastic assembly.</p>
   <p>This little episode shows the honest, upright character of the man who will always be remembered as a shining example in matters having to do with the popularization of German songs.</p>
   <p>On June 12, 1910, the singers were confronted with the sorrowful duty of being pallbearers to their founder and president for many years, Franz Amberg. His mortal remains lay in state in the North Side Turner Hall, where he enjoyed so many happy hours among the singers, and thus his countless friends were enabled to express before the bier their final tribute in speeches and song.</p>
   <p>Thus the man whose name was so affectionatly known among----all Germans of our city was brought to his final resting place and buried at Graceland <span class="page-break">\9</span>Cemetery. A grieving community numbering thousands constituted the funeral procession.</p>
   <p>Welcome Visitors</p>
   <p>Aside from their own regular concerts and entertainments the Vereinigte Raennerchoere were often asked to enrich with German songs the programs of other associations.</p>
   <p>I shall only mention a few of these many requests: On January 12, 1922, January 22, 1914, and January 20, 1918, the singers took an active part in the festivities which were given for the benefit of the local destitute veterans of the German army.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, March 24, 1912, a Goethe festival was given at the Auditorium <span class="page-break">\10</span>theatre. On this occasion the singers contributed several songs to the celebration in honor of Goethe's poetry.</p>
   <p>The organization also sung at the Land (sic) Exposition at the Coliseum, on Sunday, November 24, 1912, which was celebrated as German Day.</p>
   <p>On July 12, 1913, the singers accepted an invitation to sing at the simple ceremony of laying of the cornerstone for the German Old People's Home Annex.</p>
   <p>Again they were asked to take part in a program, this time in connection with the international Olympic Games at Grant Park on Lake Michigan. Here, also, the singers gladly acceded to the request, appearing on July 6, 1913.</p>
   <p>In May, 1914, the singers of the Alliance participated in the dedication of <span class="page-break">\11</span>of the Goethe monument at the northern end of Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Turnbezirk (Turner District) celebrated its fiftieth anniversary on Sunday, May 24, 1915, at Dexter Park Pavilion. The singers of the Alliance were well represented and turned the festival into a veritable jubilee.</p>
   <p>Again, the singers fulfilled their duty by appearing at a patriotic festival. In 1915, during the last week of May, from May 24 to May 31, the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Friedrich Wilhelm von Bismarck, Germany's greatest statesman, was celebrated at the Bismarck Garden. On every evening several of our clubs contributed German songs to the celebration of the festival.</p>
   <p>More dates could be recorded, but these few may suffice to show the reader <span class="page-break">\12</span>the willingness of the Alliance to help with songs to promote a favorable attitude toward the German people and the German culture.</p>
