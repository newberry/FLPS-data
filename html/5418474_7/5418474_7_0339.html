   <p>A very select public attended the entertainment given last evening by the Johanna Lodge for the benefit of poor children, and the large number of people present at the performance gives full proof of the visitors' philanthropic inclinations.</p>
   <p>One of the disturbing features, however, was the delay in ringing up the curtain--nearly an hour--but the excellent offerings of the evening compensated for that.</p>
   <p>The orchestra performed with precision and good taste throughout, and the pantomine was ably presented and met with acclaim.</p>
   <p>The feature of the evening was the operetta "Mamsell Rosa," given by the members of [Alexander] Wurster's theatrical company.</p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Claussen, Mr. Koch, and Miss Abel scored an exceptional success and the ladies were presented with bouquets in recognition of their excellent performance.</p>
   <p>A dance was given at the end of the festival.</p>
