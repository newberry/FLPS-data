   <p>The Richard Wagner Men's Chorus, an organization affiliated with the United Singers of Chicago, sounded the call to the singers of Chicago to rally them in a common performance for next year at the World's Fair. Rarely has such joyful news been brought to Chicago's organized life.</p>
   <p>Letters were sent out to the United Singers, to the representatives of the Saengerbund of the Northwest, to the representatives of the North American Saengerbund and the Organization of the City of Chicago (sic), and to the representatives of the Workers' Saengerbund.</p>
   <p>Side by side with these large organizations are a large number of male choruses which are not affiliated with any of these organizations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>This call is meant for them to create a united front. It is up to them to find, for the sake of the great cause, some form of approach for the great cause of the German Song at the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>The call of the Richard Wagner Male Chorus, "There are great days ahead of the National Groups. The German element must not stay behind. The German group is at work to create a dignified representation for the German element at the World's Fair. The singers know that the German group is going to ask the singers assembled in Chicago to enable the German song to be received by the public in a perfected form at a time when our German brethren from the other side of the ocean and from the whole world will have assembled here.</p>
   <p>"This will be possible when all German singers are willing to volunteer for unified work. We are dealing here, as every German knows, with the most treasured possession of the old homeland, with the German song, and with <span class="page-break">3</span>the German word. And what is more, and what every German knows, too, we are here endeavoring to stand together and work together. This requires--as it were--some self-restraint.</p>
   <p>The stone must be made to roll in its proper time so that the good intentions will not be frustrated by "lack of time" as such an excuse might be given by some singers to the questioning German group. The annual conventions are upon us, the United Singers have given their consent to follow the call with joy. Where there is a will there will also be a way, a way to a community of workers embracing all singers of Chicago. During the World's Fair the world will be shown, "These are Chicago's hosts of singers".</p>
