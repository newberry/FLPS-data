   <p>It is a well known fact that the Turner community is devoted not only to gymnastic work, but also to the art of singing. The Turner's Male Chorus assisted by the Senefelder Liederkranz, the Schiller-Liedertafel and by the Harugari-Liedertafel singing societies, gave a concert last night, for the success of which, the combined choruses and soloists deserve much credit.</p>
   <p>The composition "The Cradle of the Song", by Pache, so beautifully rendered by the Turner's Male Chorus, and supported by the brilliant baratone soloist, Mr. Dietz, was enthusiastically received and loudly applauded.</p>
   <p>The composition, "Morning in the Forest", was also executed to great satisfaction by the joint choruses. Miss Elsa Luebke, the well known singer, was acclaimed for her rendition of "Summer", by Chaminade.</p>
