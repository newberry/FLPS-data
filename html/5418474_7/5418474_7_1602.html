   <p>The General Committee for the participation of the Germans in the Chicago Day celebration held its session yesterday at the Title and Trust Building, with Mr. Hesing presiding. Up to the present time some very favorable reports have been received regarding the financial situation. The sub-committee which has the problem of obtaining the necessary funds, has been increased by eight additional members. Among those added were H. Wullf and Alderman Joseph Ernst. Messrs. Hesing, W. Stern, W. Hahne, as well as K. Haerting and L. Kindt have been appointed as an Executive Committee with full authority to select the subjects to be displayed on the floats. It was decided that one float should represent scenes of the participation by the Germans in the American Revolution and the Civil War; the second, should portray German Arts and Sciences; the third, should depict Germany's industrial activities. The executive committee will meet tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock in Mr. Hesing's office at the Illinois Staats-Zeitung Bldg.</p>
