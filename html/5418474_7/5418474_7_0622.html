   <p>The North Side Turner Hall concert, with which this year's season, under the auspices of the Chicago Turner Society opened yesterday, was successful in every respect, and a worthy beginning of the many musical enjoyments to be expected. The Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra and its director, Richard Czerwonky, were excellent, and the Chicago prima donna, Dorothy Greathouse acquired, through her talent, a new circle of enthusiastic friends.</p>
   <p>The program of yesterday's concert, was carefully selected, and offered many beautiful items. It was ushered in with "Tannhauser," by Wagner, followed by "Freischutz," overture by weber. Dorothy Greathouse sang, "Titania" from the opera, "Mignon" with orchestral accompaniment.</p>
   
   <p>The "Peer Gynt" suite of the Norwegian, Grieg, was played masterfully - the incomparable "Morning" in which the wood winds lead; "Aases Death," (Anitras Dance," and "In the Halls of the Mountain King).- As an addition, Czerwonky introduced Haydn's "God Preserve Franz the Kaiser" with variations, a piece which was familiar to everyone, because the "Deutschland Lied" is sung to the same tune.</p>
   <p>In the second part Czerwonky surprised the audience with two compositions of his own, one a Menuet in E with a soft grace, and a pretty "Air de Ballet." Loud applause compelled him to repeat the latter piece. Dorothy Greathouse sang a number of waltz melodies, from comic operas. She also tried a verse of the "Lorelei" but her lack of knowledge of the German language made itself felt. She sang, "Carissima," and as an addition, from "Loreley," the German children's song, "Who Wants to be a Soldier."</p>
   <p>With the "Beautiful Blue Daunbe," and Sousa's "Stars and Stripes," march, the concert came to a conclusion.</p>
