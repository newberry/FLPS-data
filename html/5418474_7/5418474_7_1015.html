   <p>The second performance of the present season of the German theatre was presented, as was the first, before a completely capacity house. There were, of course, two alluring attractions which drew the great audiences. The first was to view the new theatre; the other to enjoy the ever popular and lovely operetta, "The Gipsy Baron" by Strauss. The audience was carried away with enthusiasm, which made itself manifest in the loud and lasting applause. The presentation of "The Gipsy Baron" will be repeated several times during this week,....</p>
