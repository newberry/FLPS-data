   <p>When Professor Ludwig Rauch, the popular and capable leader of song-clubs, arrived at Hoerbert's hall yesterday evening to give the usual music lesson to the West Side Singing Society (Saengerkranz), he was quite surprised to find such an unusual attendance and exclaimed: "It never happened before!"</p>
   <p>But, without reacting to his comment, the president of the society informed him that the members had decided to share in the festive coronation spirit which now permeates Prussia, and, therefore, in commemoration of the director's consistent efforts and achievements, the singers intended to reward him with a golden, diamond-studded, lyra-shaped insignia. The astonished leader was speechless, but eventually regained his composure sufficiently to express his gratitude <span class="page-break">2</span>in adequate terms. After the singing lesson, the members enjoyed a repast.</p>
   <p>The recently elected officials of the club comprise the following persons: Alfred Heim, president; Professor Ludwig Rauch, director; etc. [Altogether, fifteen names are given.]</p>
