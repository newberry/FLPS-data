   <p>"On the Sunny Side," a comedy in three acts written by von Blumenthal and Kadelburg, was given yesterday under the auspices of the German and Austro-Hungarian consuls. The profits will be donated to the hotel employees of the two empires. The house was sold out for this performance.</p>
   <p>The plot of the comedy is as follows: Two young aristocrats who had squandered their fortune and now face destitution, chance to meet a potter who has recently acquired wealth, and whose wife has social aspirations. In order to be among the upper set, this plebeian family assiduously cultivates the friendship of the two penniless noblemen. This friendship developes into a sordid form of patronizing and the customary bribery. For a short time they succeed in their quest, but <span class="page-break">\2</span>only one of the impoverished gentlemen succumbs to the temptations of Mammon - The other, "Botho von Sandorf," firmly refrains from accepting any filthy, loathsome lucre. But there is salvation in distress. He falls in love with the tradesman's lovely daughter, and as he intends to have her for his wife and to support her by his own efforts, be bcomes an apprentice to his future father-in-law.</p>
   <p>His talent for creative drawing is a valuable asset to the stovemaker. His friend, "Richard von Brick," the other blue-blooded youngster, considers the practical aspect of the arrangement and is hired as secretary of the firm, head of the household, gigolo, and social stepladder. He feels rather comfortable in this questionable capacity, since he has hopes of marrying his employer's daughter. He is rescued from such a position by his friend's sister, who vehemently invokes his sense of honor thereby becoming a dominating force in bringing him back to the path of rectitude. The play ends with the announcement of the engagement of <span class="page-break">\3</span>one couple, and the prospects of a future alliance of the other.</p>
   <p>Mr. Juergens, who portrayed the happy-go-lucky "Botho von Sandorf," was afflicted with a severe cold, but nevertheless, he performed well and showed good taste. He played the part of the baron with a true sense of knightliness and sympathetic understanding. The role of the rather immoral "Richard von Brick" was entrusted to Mr. Haupt, who performed with his customary cleverness. The staid oven-builder, "Wulko," a splendid, honest, and straight-to-the-point character, was well portrayed by Mr. Loewenfeld. Mrs. Vollmer-Tietgens, as the manufacturer's ignorant, over-bejewelled, yet socially aspiring wife, was excellent. Miss Wagner, in the part of "Wulko's" daughter, displayed loveliness and grace, combining therewith the necessary bits of coquetry and impishness which brought acclaim. Miss Walden, as "Sandorf's" sister, characterized the part with just the right mildness and graciousness.</p>

   <p>The smaller parts, as the art dealer and the two butlers, were well played.</p>
   <p>Mr. Danner functioned as the stage manager and director. Under his direction the play progressed in a fairly lively manner, the parts being more suitably placed than customarily. The intermissions, however, were again far too long. Whether the cause is attributable to the manager, we do not know, but we do know that such long intervals seriously impair the effectiveness of any comedy or farce. The orchestra, strengthened by extra members, played an overture and provided a very welcome diversion during the intermissions.</p>
   <p>Thursday the German Theater (not the above New German Theater) will produce Stein and Soehngen's great military play. Tomorrow the famous "Brand" by Henrik Ibsen and directed by Ullrich Haupt will be presented.</p>

   <p>The premiere of this mighty work last Wednesday, which drew a larger attendance than the house could accomodate, induced the management to announce another performance.</p>
   <p>On Friday evening, there will be another performance of "On the Sunny Side. "Now in preparation, "The Jovial Double Marriage," by Krats. An operetta will be given on February 17, for the benefit of Emilie Schoenfeld.</p>
