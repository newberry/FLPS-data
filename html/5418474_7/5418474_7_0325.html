   <p>Mr. Alexander Wurster, the well-known German theatre-manager, opens the New Chicago this evening with the best German dramatic company that was ever brought together in this country. Mr.Wurster has made a new departure, and will hereafter give daily performances at the New Chicago, which he has rented for the season. There is no reason why Mr. Wurster should not succeed in his new venture. This city has a population of about 100,000 Germans, or persons that speak the German language,--more than most German capital cities, where there exist several theatres where daily performances are given. The new company that Mr. Wurster has engaged for this season is of such a calibre as to draw out the theatre-loving Germans, if such thing is possible. His company consists of twenty-four members, ten ladies and fourteen gentlemen, all of whom are able to take first-class parts.---</p>
