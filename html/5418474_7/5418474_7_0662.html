   <p>The South Hungarian Song Club arranged a popular festival at Kolze's Electric Park, a delightful shady place opposite Dunning. The program provided for singing, a concert, wrestling matches and athletic performances by the German Athletic Club Siegfried, dancing, and other entertainment, which attracted large numbers of this national unit. Anton Gertner, president of the festival, and his committee did all in their power to provide a pleasant time for all.</p>
   <p>A massed chorus, under the direction of Franz Beidel, sang many selections during the evening, among them "The Day of the Lord," "My Heart is in The High Lands," by Ferdinand Freiligrath, and "As it was at Home," by Peter Cornelius.</p>
