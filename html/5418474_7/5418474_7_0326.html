   <p>Because Mr. Worster's German theatre at the New Chicago was not as well patronized during this season as in former seasons, it was decided that the Germans of the city would and could not support a first-class German theatre permanently. Such, however, is not a fact. Chicago contains a large German population, as large as many German capitols supporting first-class theatres and theatre goers who visit the theatre at least once a week. They prefer good performances given in their mothertongue, provided such performances are as good as those given in the English theatres. The success that Mr. Wurster achieved during the two seasons previous to this one, proves the assertion. The companies he has then, were good ones, and each role was in the hands of a capable actor, which resulted in good ensemoles, and performances that gave satisfaction. The Germans are well educated, critical people and they know the difference between good and bad performances. They do not care to see plays where the principal parts are performed by brilliant actors, and the minor parts put in the hands of amateurs, but want to see every part, no matter how small, performed in an acceptable manner.</p>
