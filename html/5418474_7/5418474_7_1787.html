   <p>The serious-work for the next great Singer's and Musicians Festival starts now. The claims which are made for the great Singer's festival, generally, and especially for the Chicago ore, are such that only by cooperation of the best forces can a satisfactory result be gained. For this reason we invite all singers and songs-tresses of Chicago to join without delay, the newly formed Chicago Festival Chorus, which will hold rehearsals every Friday evening at 8 o'clock in the Methodist Church, corner S. Clark and Washington Street. The diflulties of the compositions to be enacted make a longer period of rehearsals necessary and the list of participants will be closed the end of January.</p>
   <p>A good musical herring and knowledge of musical notes is necessary for joining the Chorus. Applications can be made daily from 9 to 12 A. M. and 2 to 5 P.M. in the office of H. Balatka, Mamagar, 110 Randolph Street, Room 5.</p>
