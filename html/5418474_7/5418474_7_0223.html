   <p>McVickers: "The Strike" comic operetta in 3 acts by Anton Thornalen, Music by Christ Bach.</p>
   <p>The above; first work of the Milwaukee Poet and composer, will be presented at McVickers Theatre, Sunday, and we do not doubt a moment, that the performance will prove to be one of the season's most enjoyable ones.</p>
   <p>A report of the Milwaukee "Seebote", contains the following spots: That at yesterday's third performance, the public was overenthusiastic, that the house echoed from the stormy applause, that they had to repeat their songs a number of times and that the pleasant impersonators of the solo roles were overwhelmed with gifts of flowers. We don't need to point out, as it is understood by everybody, there is music in the Operetta, as we stated after the first general rehearsal. But we can also report a very interesting intermezzo. Among the spectators there were also two celebreties, who will <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>participate in a great concert today at the Music Hall, namely: Miss Emma Thursby and Mr. Kontski. Both were so delighted with the music, that Mr. Kontski could not refrain from introducing himself to Mr. Bach after the performance, and expressing his delight and appreciation of the play.</p>
   <p>Naturally, very often Singing Societies, tried their skill at performing operas, and achieved considerable success, but we must say, that no Singing Society has so far produced anything, that would equal or could be compared with this operetta; it is a glory which unquestionably is due to the "Milwaukee Liederkranz" of which they can be justly proud.</p>
