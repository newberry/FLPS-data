   <p>p. 1.. Repeated visits to the German section of the Industrial Palace which acquaints the visitor with the beauties of the work of individual manufacturers, convince one nevertheless, that the German Exposition Committee has made one serious error. A comprehensive picture of Germany's contributions cannot be obtained.</p>
   <p>... Take porcelain production for instance. In this branch Germany has eclipsed all neighboring countries, yet the exhibits have been scattered about in hallways, galleries, niches, etc.... the various German provincial earthenware products are also widely distributed...</p>
   <p>This regrettable arrangement manifests itself everywhere... While we criticize the commission in this instance, we give them credit for their fortunate selection of the location of the iron facade, the Armbruster portal, which is the most monumental Work sent to the World's Fair by Germany.</p>
   <p>(Translator's note: The newspaper gives detailed accounts of the German <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>exhibits,with a full page sketch of the above, ornamental metal facade. It also lauds the French displays. In regard to the latter, it commends the sensible, compact grouping, which is better than the German haphazard method and therefore more effective. It is particularly noticeable in the fine furniture division. A collection of sculptured objects, made of the rare, natural mountain crystal, is also displayed by German manufacturers. No other nation competed. Three large illustrations are published. The article covers two pages.)</p>
