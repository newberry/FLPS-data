   <p>The usual concert of the Tyrolean Maennerchor and Damenchor (Men's and Women's Choruses) took place yesterday at the Lincoln Turner Hall. Although the weather was inclement numerous friends of the organization made their appearance. When the musical performances began the hosts of singers were greeted by an almost full house. Toni Godetz, the director of the Tyroleans succeeded well in administering the legacy of Heinrich Marchetti. Both choruses are well trained and are capable of serving by honest performances. The Tyroleans are a generous people; they give few things for their neighbors also; thus they presented some Swabian and Barvarian songs, too. The two soloists, E. Moldenhauer and G. Denhoefer, drew exclusively from bucolic love idylls for their themes. A little more discretion would have been desirable. Quite pleasing were the recitals on the zither by Toni and Louise Godetz. The artist gave proof once again that the zither, when played by the hand of a master, is a very expressive <span class="page-break">\2</span>instrument.</p>
   <p>Naturally, humor was given its proper place in the program. This was particularily true of the gay and dramatically moving ensemble scene. "Volksleben aus der alten Heimat' (Folk Life in the Old Home), the last number on the program. The successful performance, in which all active singers of both sexes participated, portrayed a typical Sunday in a a Tyrolean hamlet. First came the church services; these quickly gave way to more worldly matters, such as drinking and singing, yodeling, and tap dancing, flirting and banter. There was also a minor brawl. But at the end all changed into a pleasant mood ending with a typical "schuaplattler" dance [Editor's note: a kind of a Tyrolean folk dance characterized by tapping and slapping].</p>
   <p>At the close of the program which was rewarded by loud applause, as it deserved a delightful supper was served. This was followed by a dance.</p>
   <p>The credit for the success of the entertainment belongs, in first place, to the <span class="page-break">\3</span>chairman of the festival committee, Herr Rudolf Wuertz. In this he was ably assisted by President Eduard Sturm, Franz Hosp, John Ott, and the director, Toni Godetz.</p>
