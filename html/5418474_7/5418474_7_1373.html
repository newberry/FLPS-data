These were the words spoken by Carl Schurz at the first German day of the World's Fair in 1893.

   <p>"It was the German scientist Hertz, who discovered this prodigy, it was the German Count Zeppelin who invented the dirigible, it was the German Professor Junker who constructed Koehl's and Hunefeld's aeroplane.

   <p>"We want to remember those things, now that we are called upon to emulate the example of our fathers in the year 1893. At the World's Fair in 1893 German intellect and skill revealed their products to an astonished world.

   <p>"The one-hundredth anniversary of our city of Chicago will be celebrated with a World's Fair. One Hundred years!

As the German-Americans have left their mark in imperishable letters of blood in the history of the United States during the Revolution and the Civil War, so also have the German-Americans contributed towards the development of the city of Chicago."</p>
