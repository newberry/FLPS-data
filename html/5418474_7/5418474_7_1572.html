   <p>An impressive ceremony at the north side Turner Hall was held under the auspices of the Suabian Society, (who have made it their task, to celebrate the favorite German poet's birthday every year). In the large hall of the north side Turner Hall last night a banquet was given which developed into an elevating memorial celebration. At the four long tables, sat about 400 guests, while at the table of the executive committee, the officers of the society, the official speaker and the guests of honor were seated. They were Messes assistant librarian C. F. L. Gauss, Consul Arnold Holinger, Harry Rubens, G. Henry Kraft and Julius Rosenthal. The principal speaker speaker of the evening, Mr. E. F. L. Gauss, dealt with the theme "The Popularity and universality of Schiller" in his usual masterly way. Speaker paid tribute to the Suabian Society for adhering to the ideals of Germans strength and German spirit, and closed with the words: and so today I do not want only to praise the good work begun, but also to issue the warning, not to be slack in spreading the fame of our Schiller, because with his fame comes his strength, contributing to the highest achievements to the whole human race. What is done in this direction, happens, like in the great poet's ballad of the Bell, with which, his public work can be compared: "It beats the metallic crown, till <span class="page-break">\2</span>it edifyingly spreads its sound", therefore cheers for Schiller in America. As second and last speaker, Mr. Harry Rubens dwelt on the importance of Schiller's, in regard to his civilizing influence upon the Germans in their adopted fatherland. He was rewarded with rich applause. Shorter speeches were held by Messrs. Holinger, Gustav Stieglitz and Julius Rosenthal. The Senefelder Liederkranz took care of a pleasant variation, by performing several of its most beautiful songs.</p>
