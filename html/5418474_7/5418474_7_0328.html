   <p>It was the general opinion of those who went to the New Chicago Theatre last evening to see Schiller's great play of "Marie Stuart," brought out by Mr. Wurster's German dramatic company, that they would see one of the best performances given at this theatre this season. In this,however, they were greatly mistaken, as the performance was real very far from a failure. While Mr. Wurster's Company, as at present constituted, is very good in farces and comedies, yet it has not the strength and tragic abilities to success fully cope with a classic production of such magnitude as "Marie Stuart."---</p>
