   <p>The executive committee in charge of the funds for needy veterans arranges a public performance every year for the benefit of needy unemployable soldiers seventy-two to eighty-two years old. Owing to present conditions this year's performance will consist in the presentation of "Mein Leopold" (My Leopold) by an able cast under the direction of Konrad Seidemann, on Thursday evening, January 23. The orchestra has been enlarged for this occasion.</p>
   <p>Every German who purchases a ticket helps to insure the success of this worthy charitable undertaking, and, in addition, he will have the opportunity to witness a splendid presentation of this popular musical comedy.</p>
