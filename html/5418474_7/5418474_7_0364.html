   <p>Yesterday's performance of Schiller's "Raeuber" again proved its popularity. The German House was crowded to capacity; and many persons were only able to find standing room. The smooth performance satisfied all who witnessed it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoym, who played "Karl," and Mr. Roepenack, who took the part of "Franz von Moor," were loudly applauded for their excellent presentations of these characters. The high light of Mr. Hoym's work was his performance in the fourth act. Mr. Koepenack, whose "Franz" cannot be surpassed displayed his excellent dramatic ability throughout the play.</p>
   <p>Miss Klein as "Amalie, "Mr. Koch as "Spiegelberg," and Mr. Schmitz as "Schweitzer," also enjoyed well-merited applause. We have attended quite a number of performances of Schiller's "Raeuber," but none that we enjoyed as much as this.</p>
