   <p>Tomorrow a German Folk Theatre will be opened on North Ave. Plays will be given alternately for three Sundays at Folz Hall and the fourth Sunday in DeValds Hall (formerly Fidelia). The director is the well known and much beloved humorist, Victor Sarne, and his endeavors are principally to make it possible for the workman and his family to spend a few happy hours on a Sunday evening, for a moderate entrance price of 15 cents.</p>
