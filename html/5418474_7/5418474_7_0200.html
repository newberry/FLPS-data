   <p>One could look forward with expectancy to his conception of "Nathan, the Sage." It was a part wherein proof was required whether he merely intended to seek effect or whether the true artist would subordinate the virtuoso. "Nathan" provides nothing to the latter, wherewith he can garner public acclaim, nomannerisms will succeed here, where only genuine art can emerge victorious. Lessing in the creation of this masterpiece did not produce a vacillating character like "Narciss," which may be interpreted in diverse ways. Who intends to play "Nathan" correctly, can only follow the dictum of the poet. Now then, did Possart give the proper version? Indeed-he did fully. After perusing Lessing's work, one must candidly admit; there was no superfluity of motions; who could not be appeased with this "Nathan," would never be pleased by anything. Especially grand was Possart's principal scene, in his dialogue with the Sultan, when he related the saga of the three rings. Therein the master of declamation showed his metal and provided a rhetorical gem. This success is the culmination of painstaking effort through years, not that of the lucky genius.</p>
