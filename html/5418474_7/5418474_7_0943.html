   <p>The first meeting preparatory to the song festival to be given in Chicago in 1881 was held yesterday evening in Wilhelm Wenzel's hall, Randolph and LaSalle Streets. Delegates of local clubs which participated in the Cincinnati song festival were present, and attended to the preliminary work.</p>
   <p>The delegates, and the clubs they represent, are as follows: Philip Maas, and Falter, of the Liederkranz Eintracht; Theodor Arnold, Franz Amberg, and Oscar Schmidt, of the Orpheus Maennerchor; Philip Koehler, and L. Tanner, of the Harugari Maennerchor; Emil Hoechster, Philip Henne, and L. C. Huck, of the Germania Maennerchor.</p>
   <p>The delegates were very enthusiastic and were convinced that the festival to be given here will be highly successful, because of the fact that Chicagoans in general like music.</p>
   
   <p>The procedure of the meeting was businesslike, and the delegates promptly formed an organization, electing the following officials:</p>
   <p>Festival president: L. C. Huck</p>
   <p>Festival conductor: Hans Balatka</p>
   <p>Festival secretary: Oscar Schmidt</p>
   <p>Festival treasurer: Philip Maas</p>
   <p>It was decided to appeal to all the German singing societies to become affiliated, and the secretary was requested to write to them.</p>
   <p>This, then, represents the starting point of the great song festival to be given in 1881. Chicago is honor-bound to make the coming festival the greatest event of its kind. But this requires more than mere effort on the part of the festival directorate; all members of our local song clubs must co-operate, and, later, the businessmen of the city, as well as the public in general, must do their share.</p>
   
   <p>If such unity is lacking, success cannot be expected.</p>
