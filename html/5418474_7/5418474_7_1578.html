   <p>To-day it is 25 years, since Wilhelm I, King of Prussia was made Emperor of Germany, in the French town of Versailles and received the highest ovation of all the German princes and the army. For the first time in many years, the flags again saluted a German Emperor. It was again a united Germany.</p>
   <p>The past year has witnessed great celebrations, for the 25 year-jubilee of the German victories, and has given the imperial chancellor, Bismarck, a birthday celebration as never was given a private citizen before. Here in Chicago the victories have also been celebrated, and the 80th birthday of the man of blood and iron, was greatly honored. There were very few Germans who were absent from these celebrations.</p>
