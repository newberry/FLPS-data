   <p>In spite of the terrible weather, numerous friends of the Evergreen Council No. 16, of the order of Chosen Friends, met last night at the Sevoros Hall at 43rd and State Street, to enjoy a few hours of good entertainment. The first part of the evening was filled by a concert of Prof. Wertheim's Orchestra. Among the 8 numbers of the music program, a remarkable violin solo of the orchestra leader must be mentioned particularly. After the concert, the younger people had a dance, which lasted until after midnight. During a dance interval, there was a raffle of useful and pretty gifts, which were a surprise to many guests.</p>
   <p>The arrangement committee of the evening consisted of Samual Wertheim, Hermann Becker, Charles Heime, Comrade Wick, William Madans, Henry Hopheinz, Wilhelm Rahner and Wilhelm Kuntze. The officers of the Evergreen Council are: Michael Wingering, President; Andrew Wchele, Secretary; Ludwig Herbold, Treasurer.</p>
