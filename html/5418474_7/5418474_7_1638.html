   <p>At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon the members of the "Unabhaengiger Schuetzen Vereins" (Independent Riflemen's Club of New York arrived at the depot of the Lake Shore R. R. The Chicago Marksmen were present in a body to offer their Eastern brothers the warmest welcome. Led by a Music Band, the guests went in a parade to the Auditorium Hotel, where they will have their headquarters during their stay.</p>
   <p>In spite of the long voyage most of the Marksmen undertook, after a light meal, an outing to the World's Fair. Of course, they paid a visit to the German Village and here it was, where the New Yorkers felt at home and enjoyed the precious Malt products. With sorrow, they learned, that on the fourth of July a planned celebration had to be cancelled as the German village could not provide enough space.</p>
