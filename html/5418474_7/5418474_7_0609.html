   <p>Yesterday's concert of the Bach chorus, directed by William Boeppler, was a grand musical performance. When William Boeppler conducts, it is a matter of course, that the concert will be masterfully played, that a well selected program will be heard and that a large audience will be present. But it also should be a matter of course for the public to be punctual and to be present when the concert begins, and thus to avoid disturbances.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's concert of the Bach chorus in Orchestra Hall will long be remembered by the audience. Soloists and the chorus proved their devotion to the works of the great master, Johann Sebastian Bach. Edwin Stanley Seder accompanied on the organ, and 45 musicians of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra also played.</p>
   <p>Soloists were Isabel Richardson Motter, soprano; Clara M. Schewill, alto; Walter Boydston, tenor; and William Quentineyer with his wonderful basso.</p>
