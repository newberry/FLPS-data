   <p>In spite of the great heat, the many picnics and excursions, which have jeopardized the pleasure of going to indoor entertainments for the majority of Germans, the Operahouse was fairly crowded. The performance of "Appel and Lehrmann" was accepted with considerable applause. The actors of the main casts, the three guest performers--regisseur (cenery manager) Moritz Hahn, Emma Nosta and Miss Von Berger--were applauded. The honors of the evening were shared by Messrs. Leon Deutsch, Sporn and Engelking. For the coming Friday, the extremely comical play, "Young Men and Old Women," is on the program of this excellently managed theater.</p>
   <p>Both large halls are kept open during the performances, and truly Freiberg's Operahouse is one of the coolest pleasure localities of the summer session.</p>
