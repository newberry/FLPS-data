   <p>The Vereinigte Damenchoere (United Women's Choruses) gave a concert yesterday afternoon, in the Social Turner Hall, 1651 Belmont Avenue, which was well attended and was a great success.</p>
   <p>By the performance of the individual societies which make up the Vereinigte Damenchoere, the audience, which filled the hall almost to capacity, in spite of the spring weather, was given a good picture of their work and aims. Under the leadership of their directors the choruses sang beautifully, so that it was difficult to decide which had carried off the honors. In order that the audience's impression of the performances might be completely unbiased, the managers of the choruses had, at the beginning of the concert, drawn lots for the order in which the performances were to be given. The concert was opened by the Steirer Damenchor under the leadership of its director, H. A. Rehberg, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and the other societies followed in the order determined by the lots. The other societies which participated were as follows: the Hammond Damenchor, the Almira Damenchor of Forest Park, and the Damenchor Edelweiss of the North Side under Reinhold Walter; the Damenchor Edelweiss of the South Side and the singing society of the Hermann Schwester (Hermann Sisters) , under Wilhelm Techtmeier; the Columbia Damenchor, under Max Schuh; the Damenchor Loreley under Ludwig Lohmiller; the singing society of the Deutsche Unterstuetzungbund (German Benefit Association), under Ernst Tamm; and the Damenchor Polyhymnia, the Lyra Damenchor, and the Independent Damenchor, under the leadership of Rehberg.</p>
   <p>The excellent performances pleased all the guests. The fact that the concert was played without delays is due to the preparations of the committee, which devoted great care to planning the affair. The committee was composed of Ida Huch, president; Mrs. Matthes and Mrs. Hager, vice-presidents; Cecilia Bade, secretary; and Augusta Tripphahn, treasurer.</p>
