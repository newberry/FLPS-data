   <p>The comedies "Nurnicht fluchen" (Only Do Not Swear) and "Kalt Gestellt" (Set Cold) were played on New Year's Day at the Labor Hall and pleased the audience exceedingly. Mr. Carl Knigge, who came from the Tivoli Theater in Hamburg, and has been engaged by the Labor Hall management, is now proving his abilities as an experienced, well-trained actor. He is a valuable addition to the staff of Labor Hall actors.</p>
   <p>The other actors also were at their best and will have an opportunity to show their talents in the coming plays at the Labor Hall, at first, "Die deutschen Einwanderer" (The German Immigrants) and then "Die Gruenen in America" (The Green Ones in America), next Sunday.</p>
