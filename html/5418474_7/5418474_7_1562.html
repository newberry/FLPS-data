   <p>The German and Scandinavian inhabitants of the Northwestside had yesterday a Rendezvous at the Schoenhofen Hall, Milwaukee and Ashland Avenues, where this year's festival season was opened by a grand well-prepared concert and ball. The number of the visitors was so large, that many had to be satisfied with a standing place in the Halls and Club-rooms, truly sufficient proof of the general popularity which Mr. Charles Richter, the jolly manager of Schoenhofen's Hall enjoys. The rich concert program was accomplished by mot less than nine well known singing societies namely: Ladies Chorus Flora, Conductor Otto W. Richter, Freier Saengerbund, Conductor O. W. Richter, Singing Society Edelweiss, Conductor Chas. Wolfskeel, Harmonien Singing Society (Danish), Conductor Victor Lansky, Harugary Liedertafel, Conductor F. H. Hesse, Normandenes Singing Society, (Norwegian) Conductor John W. Kolberg, Schiller Liedertafel, Conductor Willy Swensen, and Teutonia Male Chorus, Conductor Gus Ehrhorn.</p>
   <p>The Kreutzer Quartette, Conductor Grabriel Katzenberger did not appear in spite of their, given written promise. Officially represented were also the Danish Brothers in Arms, the German Landwehr Verein, the German Kriegerkameradschaft, <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Plattdeutsche Guild No. 4 and several other Clubs that have their headquarters in Schoenhofen's Hall....</p>
   <p>The Concert turned out to be a real triumph of German and Scandinavian folklore. Enthusiastic applause was also earned by the pianist George Hochleutner, who again proved himself an artist of rare talent.</p>
