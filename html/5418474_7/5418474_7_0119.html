   <p>The German Theatre audience which was present at last night's presentation of "The Golden Eva" spent a most delightful evening. This satirical play in three acts came from the pen of the dramatists Schoentan and Koppel-Ellfeld. The audience left the theater highly pleased with the performance. After last night's great success, the Wachsner management can no longer be in doubt about the type of plays the public prefers.... Indeed, if last night's reception of "The Golden Eva" could be used as an indication, the future repertoire selections should prove a simple task for the Wachsner organization.... It is a well known saying that "Many cooks spoil the broth." In this instance, however, the "cooks" being the dramatists, Schoentan and Koppel-Ellfeld, prepared a perfect and delectable "dish."</p>
   
   <p>"The Golden Eva" is a delightful satire, the plot of which is laid in the middle of the 16th century. The subject of the comedy is the dissatisfaction of the German nobility, especially of the one living in the Reich's capital. In their flight, they seek the aid of the Jewish upstarts from Berlin. The writers used diplomacy, when they laid the action in the 16th century. If they had used the present time instead, they would have encountered difficulties with theatrical censorship. Yes, these sons of an impoverished nobility seek Jewish assistence in their financial difficulties. In despair one young man seeks the hand of the daughter of his Jewish creditor in marriage, and thus, the faded coat-of-arms glitters, regilded, once more. And so, the two principle figures united by a strange fate, are ready to start on the road of marital misery..... But all is well that ends well, and the young people find in each other their soul mates..... The presentation of "The Golden Eva" was superb in every detail.....</p>
   <p>The title role was played by Miss Paula Wirth, who lived the part. Will Miss Wirth finally realize, especially after the success of last night, that comedy is her real field? Every member of the ensemble was excellent. This includes Messrs. Ewald Bach as "Peter," Julius Donat as the blunt "Schwetzingen," and Fritz Lindner as "Christoph." Equally as good were Trude Lobe as "Friedl" and Elise Kramm in the role of the countess.</p>
