   <p>Last Saturday the Hansa Football Club celebrated its fourth anniversary in the Lincoln Turner Hall. The festival was well attended, especially by members of other sport organizations.</p>
   <p>Following a welcoming address by the first chairman, Willy Weyer, the singing section of the Rheinischer Verein gave two songs which were heartily applauded by the audience. In the large hall the Alvien Bevier Orchestra played dance music, while Smutny's trio gave concerts in the "Gemuetliches" (room). Here the humorist Kurt Schlegel distinguished himself with a few samples of his art of recitation.</p>
   <p>The festival committee was composed of the following gentlemen: Willy Weyer, Raymund Huber, Julius Arnold, and Fritz Wolff. The entertainment, a complete success, is certainly going to bring many friends to the Hansa Football Club.</p>
