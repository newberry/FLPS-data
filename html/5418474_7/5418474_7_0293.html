   <p>One might have expected that the benefit concert of the German Society would have held down the attendance at Hoechster's theater, but it is gratifying to report that just the opposite was true; more people than ever were present. The performance was a deserved success, in so far as Mr. Hoechster is concerned, and, although some of the play's popularity must be attributed to its frequent presentation in other cities, the lion's share of the credit belongs to Mr. Hoechster, whose past productions have won the public's confidence.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's performance increased the audience's regard for the troupe's ability. The rendition was very good, and the play was of an appealing nature. Although the plot was far from fascinating, the dialogues were quite humorous, contributing much to the general excellence of the offering!</p>
   <p>The title role, "Dr. Claus," is by no means the principal one; that of Griesinger, the jeweler, has that distinction. Mr. Schmitz, who was entrusted <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>with the latter role, was temperamentally unfitted for the part, and was unable to convey an impression of depth of character. As an actor however, he proved pleasing as well as adequate, yet he could have made much more of his assignment. He showed particular restraint, and comported himself well, considering his tendency toward gruffness.....</p>
   <p>The title role was played by Mr. Meyer, who gave a highly effective portrayal of the outspoken, exceedingly busy, conscientious man.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Horn, as the housekeeper "Marianne," was given tremendous acclaim. The part of the grey-haired and irreproachable spinster was played by Mrs. Horn in a most satisfying manner; her appearance and speech were excellent. Mrs. Kuhn, as the young baroness, and Mrs. Claussen, as "Emma," were very good; both had rather difficult parts. Mr. Ravene, as the baron, was definitely in his element. Mr. Puls played the coachman who had acquired a smattering of medical terms from his master's books; he, too, was very good. Mr. Leuschner, in depicting the sick farmer, might have been somewhat better. Mr. Engel played the part of "Behrmann" very well.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Mrs. Vellguth, guest artist from Milwaukee, won favor by her appealing personality and ingratiating stage presence.</p>
   <p>The costuming and equipment in general were very good. Mrs. Vellguth and Miss Kuhn, in particular, were excellently costumed.</p>
   <p>The audience enjoyed the offering tremendously; irrepressible laughter broke forth on numerous occasions, and great applause was accorded the production. After the first act, Mrs. Horn was given an ovation.</p>
   <p>(Vorwaerts Turnhalle)</p>
   <p>At the Turnhalle, Carl Wintler's play, "That's Right," was presented--the first work of a German-American journalist from Rock Island. Unfortunately, the house was only moderately filled. The six-act play might easily be a sensation on the American stage, if a better cast were employed.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Baureis, as "Clara Holmes," deserves especial mention. The part provides <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>an opportunity to display her highly developed dramatic talent; in the sixth act she aroused the audience to intense enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The performances of the other players were of a very mediocre order.....There is no doubt that the play could easily be improved by eliminating some of the parts and replacing them with local characters, if the management cares to expend a little effort. Yesterday's performance showed little inclination in that direction.</p>
   <p>(Concordia Theater)</p>
   <p>Mrs. Frieda Tietz, the beneficiary, may well be pleased with the results of yesterday's offering, and the grateful audience will surely remember and appreciate the efforts of Paul Loebel, the stage director,....in presenting "Lorle".</p>
   <p>Suffice it to say here that Mrs. Tietz, Mrs. Ravene, and Miss Mueller, and Mssrs. Ed. Tietz, Bobene, Loebel, Paul, and Weidemann presented the Birch-pfeiffer play in a faultless manner, and were fully entitled to the audience's acclaim.</p>
