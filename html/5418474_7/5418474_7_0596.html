   <p>"When a society, like the Lyra Women's Chorus is fortunate enough, to celebrate its 25th anniversary, it indicates that even in this country men and women love German songs".</p>
   <p>With these words, the president of the "United Singers" and the "Union of Singers of North America", C. A. Wehrheim, greeted the Lyra Women's Chorus which yesterday celebrated its silver jubilee in Lincoln Turner Hall. And not only for the singing society was it a jubilee, but also for its conductor, A. H. Rehberg, who was the founder of the "Lyra Women's Chorus", and who had been its conductor throughout the 25 years; and likewise for Mr. Rehberg's wife who is the only one of the women co-founders still living and participating actively. Mr. and Mrs. Rehberg were honored, accordingly, with flowers.</p>
   <p>Participating in the concert besides the Lyra, were also the United Ladies Choirs, the West Side Singing Circle; and the Richard Wagner men's chorus.</p>

   <p>Accompaniment was furnished by A. Henke's orchestra.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rehberg proved with yesterday's performance, that he counts among the most prominent conductors of the German-American singing societies; the numbers offered by his group were fine specimens of the art of German choir singing, which affected deeply even those, who were not Germans.</p>
   <p>The concert reached its artistic climax with the two soprano solos, Santuzza's aria from "Cavalleria Rusticana", and "Yon Precious Halls" from the opera "Tannhauser", sung by Mrs. Hildegard C. Kraemer, formerly a dramatic singer in Vienna. She possesses an excellent voice, as well as an excellent technique. The youthful pianist, Margaret Willem, accompanied and merited a share in the rich applause accorded the soloist. Both ladies were given beautiful flowers in appreciation of their artistic performances.</p>
