   <p>"Die Dame In Schwarz" (The Lady in Black) was played last night at the German Theater and gave to Mr. Bollmann another opportunity to show his brilliant acting ability. This playing was perfect and genuine. The other actors were also at their best, but sometimes failed to attain the desired laugh-effect. Otherwise the play was a success and worthy of the German Theater's management.</p>
   <p>The Theater had a full house and the audience was generous with applause.</p>
