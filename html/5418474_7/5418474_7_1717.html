   <p>During the past year many things have been said regarding the celebration of a general German-American Day.</p>
   <p>The conviction has prevailed throughout, that such a festival could be carried on upon the broad foundation of mutual tolerance, as far as differences in political and religious matters are concerned, and that such a celebration could develop and establish the strength and power of the German-American element in the United States. This power could then be applied, whenever the opportunity was offered to combat and subdue mutual enemies. The unfolding of our united strength would have helped undoubtedly, to hip in the bud the plans of our adversaries, who would like to speak of us Germans as Uncle Sam's step-children. There is nothing more effective for the disconcertment and disillusionment of our enemies, than a powerful national activity and an outstanding, extraordinary demonstration of our United strength.</p>
   <p>A day is approaching in July which will be very appropriate to arouse the pride in every German throughout the world, and make him highly enthusiastic, because it is one of the most exalted days to commemorate an event in the history of two <span class="page-break">2</span>thousand years of our great and indestructible people. Since then all generations of all civilized nations have been illumined with its radiant and beneficial rays of light, and it has made them more god-like. I have reference to the day, which is to commemorate the 450th anniversary of the discovery of printing by the German Johannes Guttenberg.</p>
   <p>Even today, danger is threatening more than ever, and this time, our liberties are attacked. Must we "in the land of the free and the home of the brave" raise our children as they, the gum and tobacco-chewers want us to do? Or shall we proceed in accordance with our best methods? Therefore, unite again, German-Americans! Get ready and strengthen your hearts on the altar of memory of the glorious achievement of your great nation, and then in the fall, (election) you will win the fight against those who have attacked you unjustly.</p>
