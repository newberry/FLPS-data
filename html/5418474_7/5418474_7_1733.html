   <p>The "Aurora Turnverein" is holding a Picnic combined with a Summernight's festival in Kuhn's Garden, at the Terminal of the Milwaukee Avenue Street car line, and we can highly recommend it visit to the young people of the Northwest side. As a rule, the amusements of the Aurora Turnverein do not need any special recommendation; they are too well known and, we dare say, appreciated.</p>
   <p>This time the main object of same is to assist the Turnfest in Peru, which will shortly take place, and see to its proving a great success financially.</p>
   <p>Our readers will, no doubt, heed our hint.-</p>
