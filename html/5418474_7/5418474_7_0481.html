   <p>The Concordia Sing-Verein (Singing Club) has planned a program for its first concert which comprises much that is new and interesting. The concert, which is to be followed by a dance, takes place today, Sunday, in the West Englewood Masonic Temple, 64th Street and Loomis Boulevard.</p>
   <p>Following a prelude for organ, cello, and piano by the well-known artists, Hazel, Richard, and Franz Beidel, the Club, together with three other well-known organizations and the new singing club Suedseite Maennerchor (South Side Male Chorus), will perform separately and in mass groups; solos, duets, artistic dancing, and dramatics will be included in the program. An innovation, which may well be eagerly awaited, is that all numbers will be symbolized, either dramatically, pictorially, or rhetorically.</p>
   <p>It goes without saying that the best of care has been taken to treat the guests with ample food and good dance music. The concert has been scheduled <span class="page-break">\2</span>to begin at four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
