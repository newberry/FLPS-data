   <p>Chicago's new playhouse, the beautiful Schiller, was formally dedicated last night. It is a grand acquisition to the temples of art and places of amusement in the city.</p>
   <p>For forty years the German drama has been practically homeless in this great cosmopolitan city with its great German population. Before the fire, a hall on the North Side was devoted to the German drama, but it was swept away in the flames. Since the fire, the Germans have had to be content with an occasional Sunday night performance and once in a while a brief but uncertain season in some of the leading theaters.</p>
   <p>But loving everything connected with the Fatherland, something more than a year ago leading German citizens determined to erect a temple for their drama, and the splendid house which was dedicated last night is the outcome of their determination. They called it the Schiller in honor of Germany's famed and favorite poet. Of course, the theater will also be devoted to other attractions, including such English plays, operas, etc., as Manager Anson Temple may secure during the time that need not according to his contract and lease be given up to the German drama.</p>

   <p>For the dedicatory exercises, thirteen hundred cards of invitation had been issued to the stockholders and their friends. That tested the full seating capacity of the house. At seven o'clock the lights were turned on and the first persons to arrive were rewarded by a view of a spick and span auditorium, which is to the tastes of many, the most beautiful in the city. Representatives from the leading old theaters of the city pronounced the place a gem, and gazed about with envy.</p>
   <p>The lines of the Auditorium had been reproduced in miniature, it appeared to all who are familiar with the great home of music, art and oratory, on Michigan Ave. The Schiller is the Auditorium on a small sale, but even more striking in magnificence of decorative detail. Every seat in the boxes, parquet, the circle, the balcony, and the uppermost gallery was filled when music - the notes of Weber's "Jubel Overture" - resounded for the first time through the new edifice.</p>
   <p>Manager Temple was proud of the opening, for the audience was representative. The women were there in elaborate toilets; the men were appreciative; the oratory was of high order; the music was excellent; altogether the beginning was auspicious.</p>
   <p>After A. C. Hesing's address, in which he told of the struggles of the German drama for a home in Chicago and its final victory in the erection of the Schiller, <span class="page-break">3</span>Messrs. Welb and Wachsnev, managers of the German company which will begin a two weeks' season at the house Saturday evening, presented to him a great floral piece - a perfect image of the Schiller theater building, wrought in flowers, with its imposing tower.</p>
   <p>The dedicatory exercises were in charge of the following committee:.... When the curtain rose after the overture, Franz Amberg, Chairman, the speaker of the evening, and the members of the Orpheus Mannerchor appeared on the stage. Franz Amberg introduced C. F. L. Claus, who delivered a prologue in German. The poem was composed by the speaker and was heartily applauded. Important speeches were made by A. C. Hesing and Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, amid the continuous applause of the listeners. A number of notable and well known citizens of Chicago were present at the opening. A detailed description of the building follows:....</p>
   <p>The English dramatic opening will occur Oct. 17th, with the Charles Frohman company in "Gloriana". Anson Temple, formerly of the Auditorium, will be the manager. He was present last evening surrounded by his staff, the members of which were all in full dress, and looked impressive with silver badges. The members were as follows:.... The engagement of "Gloriana" will be succeeded by Frank Sangers company in "The New Wing". It is understood that the other organizations also controlled by Charles Frohman will go to the Schiller.</p>
