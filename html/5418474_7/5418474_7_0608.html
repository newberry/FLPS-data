   <p>The Arion Men's Chorus, the oldest singing society in Chicago, arranged under the expert direction of Mr. H. A. Rehberg, its well attended spring concert in the North Side Turner Hall. After an overture of the orchestra, the Arion Men's Choir sang "We Were Sitting on a Sunny Morning" by Sturm," "Weave, Weave" by Jungst, and the Strauss waltz "Wine, Women and Song."</p>
   <p>Mr. Wolfgang Wittich, of the Leipsig Opera, sang the aria "Charming Aida" by Verdi. He was warmly applauded. Miss Linda Sool, who charmed the audience with the pure clear tunes of her violin, also deserves great praise. The piano accompaniment was done by Mrs. Dora Wittich.</p>
