   <p>p. 8. The song festival given by the United Singing Societies of Chicago at Ogden's Grove yesterday, was a great success....The committee for the arrangements introduced a new idea on this occasion, which in our opinion was a most welcome one. The usual program numbers were omitted, and the fourteen singing societies participating in the concert, were free to select their own songs. This added greatly to the picturesqueness of the concert. Thus, melodies were heard, which would not have been included in a pre-arranged program....</p>
   <p>The main attraction of the evening was the mass choir rendition of the song, "Gruss an die Heimath," by Kramer, a favorite composition of every German-American. The massed choir was under the direction of the eminent conductor, H. von Oppen.</p>

   <p>This was followed by an address, given by Emil Hoechster. He said: "A living example of the success with which German song has penetrated into the soul of the Americans, is the Amphion Society, composed of American-born members, which has combined with the United Singers of Chicago."</p>
   <p>Under the direction of their youthful but highly talented conductor, H. Kornemann, the Amphion Song Club, (The society's official name), joined the massed choir, in the execution of Dudley Buck's "Hark, the Trumpet Calleth." The interest exhibited by the American public in German singers, is extraordinary. The city of Burlington has gone as far, as to hold a fair, the proceeds of which are intended to help to cover the expenses in connection with the festival, at which more than 1,500 singers are expected to participate, to be held at Burlington. The fourteen singing societies, associated with the United Singing Association of Chicago will be represented by 600 members.</p>
