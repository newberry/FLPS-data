   <p>The Vorwarts has accomplished wonderful results in the five decades of its existence, in the interest of athletics, physical and intellectual attainment.</p>
   <p>The society was organized on July 28th, 1867 with forty four members. In August, 1867, the society was initiated into the North American Turner Union. On September 18th, 1867, it held its first founding festival with the result of showing a surplus of $2,800.00.</p>
   <p>Immediately after its organization the society developed a very lively activity, not alone in practical gymnastics, but also in all branches with which physical education was connected.</p>
   <p>As fast as possible, gymnastic classes for children were organized, also a sick benevolent fund, a drum corps, a section for dramatics, and a library.</p>
   <p>Shortly after, the rented hall became too small, and on March 25th, 1838, the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>purchase of the property at 2431 W. 12th Street, for the sum of $9,500.00 was perfected, and the deal was closed. The new hall which was officially opened December 25th, 1868, was at that time, and many years later, one of the best and most convenient of its kind in the city.</p>
   <p>Through its building enterprise the little society had burdened itself with a debt of $26,000.00. Therefore, the difficulties were steadily increasing. To reduce the debt, remedies had to be found in order to increase its income. Under great sacrifices, the society was able to remain in its hall until March, 1878.</p>
   <p>The severe money crisis at that time, forced the society to sell its property. Peter Schoenhofen was the buyer. Through the efforts of the director of the Turnverein, William Zoeller, and other members, they finally succeeded in persuading Mr. Schoenhofen to present the complete gynastic apparatus, different furniture, as well as the library to the Verein. It remained in the lost home and carried on its activities.</p>
   <p>In spite of unstability with which the Turnverein had to battle, its prospects in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>regard to gymnastic endeavor were excellent.</p>
   <p>Convinced that a women's auxiliary would be of incalculable gain, such a circle was organized with eighteen members. Since these times, the auxiliary has co-operated in a true manner always to the benefit of the Verein, and the endeavors have been indeed, the best achievement the Turnverein has gained.</p>
   <p>The Verein in its fifty years of existence has won numerous prizes and honor diplomas, which are decorating the walls of the club rooms, and the place is not sufficiently large to have even the best diplomas framed. Numerous laurels of high value are well taken care of, and only are to be exhibited on festive occasions.</p>
   <p>The present hall of the Turnverein was erected in the year 1896.</p>
   <p>In regard to intellectual activity the society has accomplished much, yet never has it forgotten the social life.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Already in the first years of its existence the society always took care of well arranged spiritual, pleasant evenings, which through splendid recitals, were made instructive. Songs, declamations and music furnished pleasant entertainment for the visitors.</p>
   <p>The grandest success the Turnverein had, in regard to arousing interest, was the erection of the swimming pool and gymnasium in Douglas Park in 1895-1896. This was the foundation of the introduction of public play grounds and bathing beaches.</p>
   <p>Since 1907 the superintendent of the Turnverein Vorwarts is Theodore Gross, who was once a student of the Verein and is now an active member.</p>
