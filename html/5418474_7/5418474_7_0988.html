   <p>The offer of the Turner District Chicago to give to the School, that carries the name of the Turn-Father Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, a bust or a painting of the founder of Turning (Gymnastics), was accepted. In the name of the Turner District, that includes 26 Clubs, Dr. Richard Bachhusen appeared before the Committee for Real Estate that accepted the offer and transferred it to the Committee for educational affairs. A committee of five will be nominated to decide whether a bust or a picture of Jahn is to be preferred. As there is considered an offer of the Jefferson Club, to present for the Altgeld School a picture of the former Governor, this Committee will also tend to this affair.</p>
