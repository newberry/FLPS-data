   <p>Favored by the most beautiful weather yesterday, the United Austro-Hungarian Organizations of North America celebrated their great yearly festival in the Elm Tree Grove, 6519 Irving Park Boulevard. The usual parade of automobiles preceded the gay event. The procession of automobiles was this year greater and richer in colors than on many a previous year, as more than 200 automobiles, some wonderfully decorated, participated in it. It proceeded from North Avenue and Dayton Street through Clybourn Avenue, Larrabee Street and Lincoln Avenue up to Irving Park Boulevard, then straight to the Elm Tree Grove into which they all entered with music and banners. Then followed acts of welcome and addresses by John J. Hess, president of the United German-Austro-Hungarian Organizations, and Anton Schirmang, the fest president. Then followed the presentation of "Miss Liberty" (Miss Helen Kastelberger), "Miss Austria" (Miss Irma Gerstenbrand), and "Miss German Hungaria" (Miss Eleonore Thomae), and of the former presidents of the organizations and the various marshals of the parade.</p>
   <p>The grand marshal of this year's parade was Emmerich Dietz; functioning as marshals of the individual departments were Frank Webster, Anton Lojar, J. Lauer, Martin Marschall, John Schirmang, Arthur Hoffmann, Michael Hirsch, John Herman, Josef Graf, Eleonore Revill, Frau Anna Sander, Otto Wagner, John Schwiegerath, Mathias Siegl, Alex Niklos, Joseph Moss, Frau Minnie Boyer, George Kast, Hugo Prange, and John Letschke.</p>
   <p>In the course of the afternoon came a variegated program of entertainment to be staged at the Elm Tree Grove. Among other performances were given beautiful marching exercises by the guards of the German-Hungarian Ladies' Aid Society, Branch #2, a beautiful figure dance by members of the Schuhplattler Organizations "Gamsgebirg" and "D'Wildschuetzn" and of the Styrian dance group, and a "Swabian Kirchweih" (kermess). All these numbers were directed by Joseph Stein in collaboration with numerous young folks from German-Hungarian circles, and were quite successfully performed.</p>
   <p>A mass chorus composed of a male choir from the Alpine countries, (Alpenlaender Maennercher) Burgenlaender Liedertafel, steirer Saengerbund, Suedungarischer Saengerverein (Southern Hungarian Singing Club), Gesangsektion des Ungarischen Natiolitaeten Kr.-U.-Verein (singing section of the Hungarian Nationals' Mutual Benefit Clubs) and Wienerwaelder Saengerklub (singing club of the Vienna Woods) rendered a few songs under the direction of Franz Beidel. With the rendition of the Strauss Waltz "An der schoenen blauen Donau," the audience broke into stormy applause.</p>
   <p>A few humorous recitations were given by Kurt Schlegel. The musical entertainment was provided by the orchestra of the German-American Musicians' Sick Relief, under the direction of G. Lowitz, and by the musical quartet of "Edelweiss". M. Merklin's orchestra provided the dance music.</p>
   
   <p>There was certainly no lack of entertainment. That no one should suffer from hunger or thirst was so self-evident that it needs no particular mention. The children were provided for by the festival committee in their wanted liberal way so that the little ones were happy.</p>
   <p>During the evening hours, various city officials came to pay their respects. Some candidates for political offices sought the opportunity to widen the circle of their acquaintances.</p>
   <p>The fest committee which merited special praise for the success of the event was composed of the following:</p>

Hess, president of the organization; Anton Schirmang, fest president; Jack Himpelmann, fest secretary; Emmerich Dietz grand marshal; Konrad Heuman, treasurer; Jacob Andree, tickets treasurer; Frank Taborsky, Josef Kunst, Ludwig Gebert, Helen Hastelberger, Susana Andree, Anton Laughammer, Georg Kast, Fritz Beckman, John Herman, Karl Wirtz, Josef Hein, Kapar (sic!)
