   <p>"Die Beiden Reichen Mueller" (The Two Rich Millers) is the title of a farce-comedy with song and dance, produced at Mc Vicker's last evening by Colimer and Isenstein's German Comedy Company. It is by A. Anno, the author of the successful comedy "Familie Hoerner", which in construction and plot it resembles considerably.</p>
   <p>It is not a play of great literary merit, but it is well constructed and indescribably funny. It is long since a singing farce was produced here that gave such universal satisfaction and caused so much amusement as this one.</p>
