   <p>The animating play, "Der Raub der Sabinerimen" (Rape of the Sabine Women), was shown last Sunday at the Ashland Hall. The play itself is so interesting that no particular advertising is necessary. The filling of the casts was satisfactory. Mr. Wormser has played the roll of the comical theatre direcotr Striese. Whoever remembers his acting from last year in Freiberg's Operahouse, knows that he understands how to entertain the audience, which had without question an interesting evening.</p>
