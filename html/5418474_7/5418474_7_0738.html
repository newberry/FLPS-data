   <p>An interesting concert will be given at the Northside Turnhalle today. The program was arranged chiefly in honor of the Schwaben Verein, and for the whole Stammpublikum of these concerts. It will consist mainly of folk songs. [Translator's note: Stammpublikum refers to concert-goers who are members of the various countryman societies.] Miss Freya Maria Mack a public favorite, will entertain with German songs. Among the offerings to be presented by the orchestra are selections from "Carmen," and a fantasia entitled "A Swabian Farm Wedding". The members of the Schwaben Verein are requested to purchase season identification cards, which entitle them to admission for twenty-five cents. The regular price for admission is forty cents.</p>
