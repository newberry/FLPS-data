   <p>This Singing Society having been started scarcely three months ago, now has a membership of 70 and held its first concert and Ball in Lochner's Thalia Hall, 636 Milwaukee Avenue, yesterday. This young and very active society, to which most all of Harugari Lodges in Chicago sent their contingents, can already produce very capably, as the execution of the beautiful program of last evening proved.</p>
   <p>In the "Chair of the Armourers" from Wagner's "Riewzi" the singers showed remarkable talent and aptitude.</p>
