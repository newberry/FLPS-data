   <p>The Chicago Turner Society, the oldest Turner group in Chicago and one of the oldest organizations in the city, is preparing the celebration of its 75th (diamond) jubilee festival on October 2nd.</p>
   <p>The celebration will last from October 2, to October 5, and will offer an exceptionally rich program.</p>
   <p>The festival play will present episodes in the history of the Turner Society. The first part will show the founding of the society, the inaugural ceremony of the first Turner hall on Griswold Street (now La Salle Street), the brilliant festival ball, with the ladies wearing gowns in the style of that period.</p>

   <p>Such well-known characters as Carl Stone, Emil Dietsch, Dr. Ernst Schmid, Casper Butz, Lorenz Brentano, Casper Hesing, will be called back to life in this performance.</p>
   <p>The second scene will represent the Civil War, Lincoln's "Call to Arms," the enlistment of the Turners, Mayor Wentworth's speech, and the presentation of his pistol to the captain because he himself could not go.</p>
   <p>The third scene will stage the great Chicago Fire of 1871, showing Turner Hall in flames. The dance of the "Flame-ghosts," and the singing of the great "Fire Song" by the Chicago Singverein, will be added features.</p>

   <p>The formation by the Turners of a safety council in the burning Illinois Staats-Zeitung building, constitutes another dramatic episode.</p>
   <p>Scenes representing the rebuilding of Chicago close the play. A poetically beautiful epilogue represents the future in a rosy light; youth, full of confidence, promising to uphold the good cause; Turners competing in graceful exercises....</p>
   <p>The musical part of this program has been entrusted to Mr. William Boeppler. The costumes will be furnished by Minna Schmidt.</p>
