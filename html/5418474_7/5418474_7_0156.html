   <p>Shakespeare's drama, "Othello," was played here last Sunday before a well-filled house. The different roles were well studied and executed.</p>
   <p>On the following Sunday a musical comedy, "The Tramp of Berlin," will be presented. The title speaks for itself. It will not be necessary, therefore, to recommend it to all who wish to laugh.</p>
