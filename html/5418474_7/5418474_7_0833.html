   <p>The famous and much liked singing club "Forward" celebrated last night in the Northside Gymnastic Hall, its 16th Anni versary in an exceptionally magnificient way. The attendance notwithstanding the bad weather exceeded all expectations.</p>
   <p>The hall and gallery were crowded to the last place. The rich program ran smoothly and in an excellent manner. The vistitors showed their approval with much applause and gave their appreciation for the beautiful songs and performances. The song "Schoen Rothrant" had a charming effect and the finale of the program "O Spirit of the Sounds" (Geist der Toene) as persented by the Club and the Teutonia Man's Chorus gave the best testimonial to the excellent perforance of the artists.</p>
   <p>The individual musical performances of Mr. E. Schroeder, F. Muller, H. Detmer, Henry Sberebig, Christ Wolter and Peter Seye added greatly to the success of the evening. The solo plays of Mrs. Dr. Hemmi and the Cello virtuoso, C. Schroeder, were also good. The splendid festival finished with a ball and will be remembered for some time by all guests.</p>
