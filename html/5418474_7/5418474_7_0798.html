   <p>The wonderful idea of Dr. A. Brodbeck, to organize a great mixed choir, comprising the whole city-territory of Chicago, found the hearty approval of many lovers of music and singing and seems to become a fact more quickly than could be expected.</p>
   <p>Dr. Brodbeck himself will organize and direct this chorus, which will be composed mainly of German elements and will have the name "Chicago Chorus." The singers, living on the Southside, will meet every Saturday night in the Southside Turnerhall at 3143 S. State Street. The rehearsals of the Northside members will be every Monday evening in the Belmont Hall. A convenient meeting place for the Westside singers will be found soon too.</p>
   <p>New prospective members, meaning ladies and gentlemen with a good voice, are requested to communicate with Dr. Adolf Brodbeck, Lakeview Academy, 1790 N. Clark St.</p>
