   <p>It was the first time in many years that the anniversary celebration of the Old Settlers, held in the picnic grove of Riverview Park was not favored by fine weather. Though the downpour of rain was a boon otherwise, it would have been more to the liking of the Chicago turners had the weather been fair.</p>
   <p>It was the sixtieth time that the turners invited the Old Settlers to be their guests. A large portion of the history of Chicago is contained in the archives of the turner clubs, as well as a large portion of the history of all those who aided in the building of this gigantic city. Not much ado, however, attended this special festivity. Everything took its own course as it was wont to do in the years past, with one exception--one of the oldest members of the turners' community, Mr. Julius Zimmermann, was named honorary president of the festival. For years Mr. Zimmermann was in charge of registrations, distributing among the guests ribbons with the year inscribed upon them. Anyone who expected that Mr. Zimmermann would become excited because he was made honorary president was disappointed. The old gentleman sat there, busy with his cards, devoting to them the same affection and care he has always shown.</p>
   <p>Considering the inclement weather, the attendance at the festivities was good, especially in the evening, when the large park became filled. The festival continued until the early hours of the morning.</p>
   <p>It goes without saying that the registrations are behind those of last year; but this applies only to the younger generation, for the oldsters could not be kept from coming to the festival. Even in the pouring rain, automobiles filled to overcrowding arrived at the park. The older participants, beneath umbrellas and clad in raincoats, first walked to the place of registration, then sat down in the large recreation hall where the orchestra played dance music. Long before the program was officially begun dances went on gaily. The gentlemen from the committee had their hands full trying to calm the impatience of the oldsters. They insisted on having their prize dance, which was the high point of the entertainment.</p>
   <p>The refreshment stalls were also busy. This time those in charge of the festival engaged two hand-organ players, who entertained the guests with their unceasing melodies. In spite of the rain singing went on vigorously. When the sky became clear, sometime later, most of the business concentrated around these stalls, and the old order of the festival was re-established again.</p>
   <p>Turner Charles Schneider who, as always, directed this part of the festivities, did not have to call long before the necessary couples were together. He directed the singing in the usual manner and the same was done with the honor dances. Had the oldsters had their way the affair would have been continued much longer.</p>
   <p>The following couples participated in the prize dances and were honored with the usual flower wreaths: 1) Anna Keller, 83 years old, 715 West 16th Street, and Philip Brand, 91 years old, 3605 Buna Street--together 174 years.</p>
   <p>2) Marie Schaefer, 84 years old, 5351 North Kedzie Avenue, and Joseph Ontell, 87 years old, 3908 Grenshaw Street--together 171 years.</p>
   <p>3) Antonia Schallan, 81 years old, 1941 South Seventh Avenue, Maywood, and Andrew Specht, 87 years old, 10808 Hale Avenue--together 168 years.</p>
   <p>4) Hermina Schreperman, 84 years old, 309 South Spring Avenue, and Fred Schnehardt, 84 years old, Mundelein, Illinois--together 168 years.</p>
   <p>5) Agnes Hartman, 74 years old, 5320 Justine Street, and Arnold Schmitz, 90 years old, 4343 South Wells Street--together 164 years.</p>
   <p>6) Cardine Bennett, 82 years old, 1947 Howe Avenue, and August Hanke [82 years old], 6326 Cuyler Avenue--together 164 years.</p>
   
   <p>7) Bertha Winkle, 76 years old, 1730 North Hancock Street, and Julius Bock, 82 years old, 4427 North Bernard Street--together 158 years.</p>
   <p>8) Augusta Schreimer, 78 years old, 4436 North Artesian Avenue, and B. E. Hancock, 78 years old, 1745 Waller Street--together 156 years.</p>
   <p>9) Rosie Mohrer, 71 years old, 115 West 46th Place, and William Nohrer, 75 years old, 115 West 46th Place--together 146 years.</p>
   <p>10) Ida Lundeen, 72 years old, 1823 Chase Street, and Charles Otto, 83 years old, 4217 South Mozart Street--together 155 years.</p>
   <p>The prize dance was concluded with a polonaise.</p>
   <p>Not only the old ones but the children, too, had a place assigned them in the program of the day. As the time for the beginning of the games had to be delayed because of weather conditions, the leaders of the games had a hard time avoiding all the questions about when they were to commence. However, the desired moment finally arrived and in no time the place near the dance hall was crowded with children, especially the smallest ones, trembling with excitement and eager to win one of the beautiful prizes which were set aside for the individual contests. It is no wonder that the adults were carried away with the children's joy and, without trying to compete, ran and leaped along.</p>
   <p>The hands of the clock moved up to 7 P. M. At headquarters they were busy working out the names of those who were to receive the honor medals for the year. This usually constitutes the highest point of the festival, when the winners of prizes are announced. Just how much value the oldsters attach to being among the prize winners is evident from the fact that a large number of "scouts" kept loitering about the headquarters, trying by various ruses to find out who the lucky ones really were. But of course this could not be disclosed.</p>
