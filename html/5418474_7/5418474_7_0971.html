   <p>In an issue of January of one of the local papers I found a notice reporting the election of Mr. Otto Lob as Director of the Germania and Concordia Male Choir. This was erroneous, because, though among other names also that of Mr. Lob had been mentioned, Mr. Julius Fuchs was almost unanimously elected.</p>
   <p>...While I attended the singing festival at St. Louis I read some notices of which the following may be regarded as a fair sample. Yesterday we had the pleasure of a visit of Mr. Lob, Director of all singing societies of Chicago, to our office". How many or how few clubs Mr. Lob directs I do not know, but aside from the Germania and Concordia Male Choir, I could easily enumerate at least a dozen other singing societies of which Mr. Lob is not director.</p>
   <p>...It might be observed that Mr. Julius Fuchs has directed our Club with extraordinary devotion, and if a unanimous re-election is any sign of appreciation of merit, then Mr. Fuchs has received such a sign at the business <span class="page-break">2</span>meeting on July 3rd - even though, through still another war, the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, presents to the public a Mr. Matthieu (??) as director.</p>
   <p>Signed:</p>
   <p>A Member of the Germania and</p>
   <p>Concordia Male Choir.</p>
