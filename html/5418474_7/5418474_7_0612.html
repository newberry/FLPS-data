   <p>A Wagner program was offered by the 29th concert of the well known Muehlmann Opera Club,on the 12th floor of the Kimball Building. The hall was filled to capacity, proving the great interest of the public in these regular afternoon concerts.</p>
   <p>The program was opened with a violin solo by Miss Billy Ritchey, a pupil of Alexander Lehman. She played "Walter's Preislied" and was loudly applauded for her performance. Miss Mabel Gittelson sang "Dich, Teure Halle" from "Tannhauser". Being still a student - her performance was considered to be brilliant and she received several curtain calls.</p>
   <p>Claude Giras again distinguished himself by singing "Siegfried's Schmiedelied" (Blacksmith's Song) from Siegfried. Other performers were Miss Virginia Kingman, Miss Clara Stensaas, Miss Clara Grusendorf, and the baritone Benjamin Bagus, who, in spite of being a beginner, promises much for the future.</p>
   
   <p>The concert was concluded with the second scene of the second act of "Lohengrin." In the role of 'Elsa' Miss Gittelson performed well, and Miss Clara Stensaas Ortrud was also excellent.</p>
