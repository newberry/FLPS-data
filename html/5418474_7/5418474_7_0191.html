   <p>With the expectation of seeing a good performance last Sunday evening, a highly appreciative audience had gathered at Luth's Hall and followed with interest the playing of the Operetta (Comic opera) "The Rottenfanger of Hamelin" (The Pied Piper of Hamlin), and rewarded the actor of the title role (main cast) after a stormy, cheering introduction, with continuous applause.</p>
   <p>Next to him, Miss Bertha Wagner aroused the main interest of the spectators. Also Miss Barton and Miss Rossi, besides Messrs. Kischka, Paul, Bitler, Berger and Bauer, shared the applause of the audience. The taste of the costumes was very good. The management, by providing fans and other cooling accomodations, made the atmosphere very pleasant in spite of the great heat.</p>
   <p>For next Sunday, the play, "The Holy Genoveva," as second guest-performance is on the program.</p>
