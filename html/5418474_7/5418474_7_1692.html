   <p>Whenever there is an opportunity to help a charitable institution, the Chicago German people will always be ready and willing to do so. This was proven yesterday, in the beautiful decorated Hall, of the Northside Turnerhalle, where the numerous patrons and friends assembled, to celebrate in German style, this year's Altenheim Festival.-- The start was made, with an artistic concert, in which Miss Klein's rendering of the great Aria from the "Daughter of the Regiment" formed the climax.</p>
   <p>The applause of the audience was so impetuous, that the honored member of the great opera in the auditorium, consented to add a beautiful song: "O! How Delightful is The Time of Youth." Besides her, Miss Augusta M. Goetz has to be mentioned, who sung two lovely Schumann Songs. Not less praiseworthy is the duet from Donizetti's "Belizar" sung by Mrs. Katzenberger and Mr. Kurztisch. The latter has just moved from Milwaukee, and no doubt will be a Chicago favorite of the Chicago public, if he appears frequently among us. As always, Mr. Johann Wass, with his rendition of "Silvana" proved that he possesses an artistically trained tenor voice.</p>
