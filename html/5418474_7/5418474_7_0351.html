   <p>[Translator's note: There were five German theaters in Chicago, in 1875, as shown by the appended announcement, and that is the only reason why the otherwise trivial item has been included.] The German theaters have programs for tomorrow evening which should prove satisfying to people of diverse tastes:</p>
   <p>The New Chicago Theater announces the play "Die Gebrueder Bock" by L'Arronge, author of "Mein Leopold"; at the Vorwaerts Theater the farce "Sodom and Gomorrah", or "Der Kuester in Tausend Aengsten", will be given; on the program of the National Theater, "Hans Juerge"....at the City Theater of the West Side, "Daughter of the Regiment", and at the Adelphi Theater, "The Two Orphans" will be given for the last time.</p>
