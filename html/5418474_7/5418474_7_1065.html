   <p>Many Germans of Chicago assembled last Saturday night for the demonstration held at the Ashland Auditorium for the benefit of the women and children of former inhabitants of the Saar region, who will soon sail for their old homeland to cast their votes, on January 13th, 1935, for the reunion of the Saar with the Reich.</p>
   <p>The meeting was intended as a festival and demonstration of sympathy for the Saarland Organization.</p>
   <p>Ever since the conclusion of the Treaty of Versailles, the inhabitants of the Saar have been waiting for the day on which they could decide the future status of the Saar territory, which could only mean reunion with <span class="page-break">\2</span>Germany. This territory has been kept, to a large extent, under a powerful French influence, which has dominated the commission of the league of nations assigned to the Saar territory.</p>
   <p>There are 196 Saarlanders who have, in the meantime, settled in Chicago and vicinity, and whose return to the Saar region [for voting] has been made possible. So that the wives and children of these Saarlanders may suffer no want or misery during the absence of their providers, the Saarlander Organization arranged this fest, the proceeds of which would be used for the support of those who stayed behind.</p>
   <p>To the call of the Saarlander Organization, with which several German organizations are affiliated, the Germans of Chicago responded in large numbers, and there were about three thousand persons anxious to show that they are fully behind those who were going to do their duty by the old fatherland.</p>
   <p>Besides many other prominent German-Americans, among them Postmaster <span class="page-break">\3</span>Ernest Kruetgen, there was Elly Beinhorn, the German aviatrix who is on a visit to Chicago, the German Consul General, Dr. Rolph Jaeger, together with his staff, and Mayor Kelly--the mayor spoke a few words and donated one hundred dollars for the support of Saarlander families.</p>
   <p>The preparations for the demonstration were made by Gustave A. Brand, leader of the last German Day festival. Thanks to Herr Brand's direction, the program went off most smoothly.</p>
   <p>The evening was opened by musical numbers by Henry Johnk's orchestra. Then Herr Brand welcomed the guests with cordial words, pointing out the importance of this meeting for the coming referendum in the Saar territory. Then he read a number of congratulatory telegrams from local groups of the "Friends of New Germany".</p>
   <p>The procession of the miners upon the stage, with their dressy workman's <span class="page-break">\4</span>uniforms silhouetted against the background (formed by a picture characteristic of the Saar territory with its coal pits) was quite picturesque; they sang the workman's song which emphasizes the most important branch of the territory's industry. They received much applause. In a monologue, composed by Georg Giegold and spoken by Frau Mohr, the sufferings of the Saarland under foreign domination received eloquent expression. It ended with the anticipation of early release and reunion with the Reich. The United Singers contributed their share to the program, and, under the leadership of Reinhold Walter, sang two songs. Later on during the program the United Ladies' Choruses, under the direction of H. A. Rehberg, again glorified the German song. Frau Gertrude Klauss-Koehler sang a number of soprano solos, and was rewarded by rich applause.</p>
   <p>After the organization flags were paraded, the president of the Chicago Saarlander Organization, Joseph P. Martin, took the floor to give the fest oration. He gave a brief history of the Saar territory as an ancient German borderland, not forgetting to mention the brave miners of the Saar who laid <span class="page-break">\5</span>down their lives on the field of honor for their fatherland, and to those who, for fifteen long years, did not succumb to the beckoning and threats of the French administration, notwithstanding the sufferings they had to endure to preserve what is German in them. They are going to cast their votes for Germany in January. He concluded by saying that every vote is indispensable to solve, once and for all, the problem of the nationality of the Saar.</p>
   <p>The climax of the demonstration was the dedication of the flag of the young Saarlander Organization. It is the flag which the Saarlanders of Chicago are going to take with them on their journey to the old homeland. Preceded by the flags of the American and German governments, the flag was conducted solemnly to the stage by the flag's godmothers, Mrs. Doepgen, Mrs. Bosse, Mrs. Jenk, and Misses Doepken, Mistretta, Engel, Lamy, Mueller, Vogel, and Fritzen. Pastor Scherger dedicated the flag. The demonstration came to a close with the singing of the Dutch prayer of thanks, in which Gertrude Claussen-Koehler [elsewhere spelled "Klauss-Koehler"] had the solo part, and of the Saarlander song.</p>

   <p>Besides Herr Brand, Vice-president Joseph P. Martin, Ticket Treasurer Giesse, and Secretary Glanche all did outstanding work to insure the success of the fest.</p>
