   <p>Singing Brothers! The period of the opening of the World's Fair comes nearer and nearer. Everybody makes preparations to give his best for this opportunity. Is it not time that something be done so that the German Singers of Chicago should be honorably represented at this celebration? Would it not increase the reputation of the Germans if the German Singers of Chicago cooperate to form a general Male Chorus and by giving concerts combined with some choruses during the Fair make also a place for the German Singing Chorus in the history of the Fair?</p>
   <p>No doubt German Singers of all parts of the United States of American would participate in this German World's Fair Song Choruses. The Harugari Singer Club at the suggestion of its manager has resolved in a special meeting on March 1st to ask all German Singing Clubs of Chicago to send a representative to a meeting held April 12th at 3 P.M. at Uhlich's Hall, Corner of Clark, Kinzie. The. object of this meeting will be to form a World's Fair Song Chorus by cooperation of all song Clubs in Chicago.</p>
