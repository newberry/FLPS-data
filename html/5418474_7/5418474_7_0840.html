   <p>We have something outstanding to remember from last Saturday, the first Concert of the Oratorium.</p>
   <p>The Concert took place under the capable management of Mr. C. Katzenburger in the Central Music Hall, and was of particular interest due to the fact that the Concert Company of the famous violinist, Ovide Musin took part. Also the famous Louise Tanner as Soprano, the German Baritone, Carl Stone and the Pianist, Ed. Scharf, all of whom have been most successful in the larger cities.</p>
   <p>The Oratorium Club has over 400 voices and is doing well financially. The program for last Saturday was well prepared.</p>
