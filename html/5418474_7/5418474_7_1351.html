   <p>At the meeting of the German Day committee which took place last night in the Atlantic Hotel, most of the representatives of the German Societies agreed to the plan to extend the committee as a permanent organization. This question, which was the object of yesterday's meeting, aroused lively debates between the supporters and opponents of the proposition. While the opponents argued the difficulties of such a plan as in regard to the money question and the difficulty of bringing all societies under one hat, the supporters, on the other hand, pointed to the advantages of one complete organization of all German societies, not only for the benefit of the German Day committee, but also for all eventual occasions, which would demand the co-operation of the entire German element. This would furnish a good foundation for further endeavors.</p>
   <p>In this connection reference was made to New York and Seattle, Wash., where such combined organizations already are in existence. The previously elected commission was finally ordered to continue the work with the participation of members of the German Day committee.</p>
