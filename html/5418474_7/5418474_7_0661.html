   <p>To German immigrants with good voices, good hearing, and a love for singing a splendid opportunity is offered to mingle in the circle of Germans and German-Americans by joining the Chicago Singing Society. In this chorus the German songs are cultivated under the leadership of Mr. Wilhiam Boeppler. The Four Seasons, Odysseus, Judas Maccabeus, and Creation are only a few of the many great oratorios, which were performed by them. The opportunity is also offered in the singing society, of learning the English language, because English songs are also sung. The rehearsals are held every Wednesday evening at 8 o'clock in the banquet hall of the Chicago Lincoln Club, 108 Germania Place. Voices will be examined there before and after rehearsals by Mr. Boeppler.</p>
