   <p>A spontaneous ovation greeted Mr. Selig, at his first appearance on the stage last night. This celebrated artist of years ago, has forsaken the stage, to become manager of the Pabst Theatre company. Since then, his appearances on the stage have been very rare. To the younger generation he is almost unknown in the field of acting. Through the portrayal of the role of "Spangenbach" in Blumenthal &amp; Kadelburg's farce "Wall-Flower" he convinced his audience, that "true love never rusts". The distinguished actor received many beautiful gifts. The society"Schlaraffia Chicagoana" presented him with a wreath. This play has not been included in the repertoire of the German theatre for many years.</p>
   <p>The style is somewhat outmoded, for present day theatre audiences. All the participants joined forces, to make the evening a great success.</p>
