   <p>There are plays in each of the four theaters. On the Southside, Burlington Hall has been rented again by Messrs. Kost and Pelissier. As the opening play, they have chosen "Mutsegen Oder Die Neue Fanchon." The equipment and costumes are said to be very good. As first star, they have named the famous opera soubrette Miss Marie Schamnberg.</p>
   <p>On the Northside, Mrs. Louise Thieleman has taken over the direction at the Aurora Turnhalle. There will be plays every Sunday. The opening play will be the four act drama of Leiboldt, Drei Tage Aus Dem Leben Eines Spielers."</p>

   <p>On the Southwest Side, Mr. Louis Kindt intends to introduce a good new repertory at the Turnhalle Vorwarts. The opening play is Laube's play, "Karlsschuler." The stage has undergone many improvements since the closing of the last season. We hope Mr. Kindt will be able to carry through his programme and especially to make the Wednesday representations attractive.</p>
   <p>On the Northside, provisionally, Seamours Hall, 334-336 North Ave., half a block west of Sedgwick Street, is the seat of the Muse. Mrs. Louis Thieleman will give there today her second representation.</p>
   <p>Now one word to the theater managers: No complaint can be made of last year as to the support of the public. There was "money" in every theatrical enterprise. Since the fire the German theaters have been a paying proposition. We know that perfection cannot be expected, that the artists of first rank do not come to Chicago. But one can expect the actors to memorize their roles, that they speak correctly and do not improvise. The theater expects the support of the public and the press. Let's hope that the theater will do its best.</p>
