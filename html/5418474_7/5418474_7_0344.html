   <p>This whimsical play of a bygone dramatic period was given last evening at the National Theater. Mrs. Methua Scheller appeared in the title role and we must admit that she.... possesses the natural qualifications for the part, as few of her colleagues do.</p>
   <p>Franz Kuehne, of the Concordia Theater of Baltimore, was highly successful in his excellent portrayal of Count Wetter von Stahl.</p>
   <p>The bridge scene was splendid and those who came to the theater with high expectations were not disappointed.</p>
