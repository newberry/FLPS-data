   <p>The Bethany Church chorus gave a concert last night under the leadership of its conductor, William Boeppler and his piano accompanist, Miss Marie Stange. The concert will be repeated tonight for the benefit of the church building fund of the Bethany congregation.</p>
   <p>The big hall was filled to capacity; the performances were excellent throughout, and loud applause rewarded the performers for their efforts.</p>
