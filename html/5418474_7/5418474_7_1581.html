   <p>The "Seventh German &amp; Catholic Festival of the old Settlers" was held yesterday at Oswald's Garden under the auspicies of the St. Paulus Congregation. A large crowd of old and young people had come to enjoy this well arranged celebration. As in previous years, the main attraction of the day was the presentation of gold medals to the oldest members of the congregation. A jolly dance wound up the festivity, which will be remembered by all who were present.</p>
