   <p>The long contemplated project, the desire of the Germans to own a theater of their own, may now be crowned with realization. Messrs. Amberg, Buehler, Pose, Arnold and several others have founded a company for the purpose of acquiring the Randolph Street property, between Clark and Dearborn, adjoining Epstean's Museum. It is their intention to build an office and theater on this site, if the Germans of the city will subscribe and thus guarantee sufficient funds. No risk is involved, when signing, as the subscription list is merely intended to give the Germans an opportunity to share in this enterprise. Several gentlemen have vouched for large sums; to promote the financial status to better advantage, personal interviews with well-known Germans are comtemplated, to induce them to cooperate.</p>
   <p>This proceeding is considered very successful by the Committee and it hopes to give periodical reports of the subscription's progress, in which case the "Abendpost" will not fail to give its readers adequate news.</p>
