   <p>The comedy "Wo ist die Katz?" (Where is the Cat?), is one of the best plays, we have ever seen at the Labor Hall. Last night's performance was a real success, as indicated by a full house and the warm applause of the cheering audience.</p>
   <p>Particular praise must be accorded to the ladies Wagner, Rossi, Kraus and Winter, also to Messrs. Roesecke, Sispel, Alvin and Tempel.</p>
