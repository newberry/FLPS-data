   <p>The masquerade at Yonderf's Hall was one of this season's most successful festivities. The brilliance and originality of costumes surpassed the 'past' and as far as attendance was concerned, the promoters could not have wished for more. The gentlemen who managed the arrangements, can be gratified with their success. To give a detailed account of the excellent masks and groups, we regret that there is insufficient space and besides our reporter would experience difficulty in limiting his descriptions. Nevertheless, the appearances of Prince Carnival amid his splendid entourage, as he majestically paraded through a hush sliced blood sausage, was a classic. The humor of the evening, which everywhere made itself manifest can hardly be equalled. Within a fortnight 35 members of the Club will go to the song festival of New Orleans. Saturday's song performance was indeed faultless.</p>
   <p>Gustav Ehrhorn and Friedrick Mitt will be the Club's leaders at the impending New Orleans festival.</p>
