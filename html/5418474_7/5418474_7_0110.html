   <p>The German Public appeared in veritable regiments at Power's Theater to witness the performance of Schiller's Maria Stuart. The Theater was sold out, as was the Don Carlos and Tell performances, a proof, that the works of Germany's favorite poet are vitally interesting to Chicagoans. Taken as a unit, last night's performance was the best of this season's three Schiller productions. The managerial art of Mr. Marx proved itself in the ensemble.</p>
   <p>Prominent individual attainments cannot be reported, the actors did their best, but did not rise over a fair, acceptable mediocrity. (Then follows a detailed criticism of all members, not very complimentary.)</p>
