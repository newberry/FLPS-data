   <p>The first concert of the Glee Club "Cheerfulness" was held yesterday at the Freiberg Hall. Most of its members live on the south side and since all of the larger halls there are already engaged for the season, it became necessary ro have these concerts and entertainments on week days. In spite of this the concert was very well attended. The program was carefully arranged and the audience expressed their pleasure by extented applause.</p>
   <p>The Glee Club, "Cheerfulness" is in existence for 23 years and enjoys the good will of the "German-Americans."</p>
