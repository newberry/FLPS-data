   <p>A concert was given last night by the pupils of Miss Dora Kleiminger in the Lyon and Healy Hall at State and Monroe. Notwithstanding the bad weather and the first appearance of the little artists the concert was surprisingly well attended and every place was taken shortly after the entertainment was opened.</p>
   <p>The performances given by the pupils give very much credit and honor to the institution and several productions of the children made one forget that the performance was a school concert.</p>
