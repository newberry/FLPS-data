   <p>The Columbia Women's Society had its first annual Masquerade-Ball last Saturday at Walsh's Hall. This German Women's Society is in existence only 2 years, but already has a great many friends who lend at any given opportunity their useful assistance as shown by this successful Ball, which lasted until late in the night. All arrangements of the entertainment were in the hands of the ladies Augusta Apitz, Friedericke, Gerbing, Sophia Schohau and Augusta Obenauf.</p>
