   <p>The Germania Maennerchor (Male Chorus) honored yesterday its able conductor, Mr. Henry Schoenefeld on the occasion of his Benefit concert in the Central Music Hall by the presentation of a silver laurel wreath. In the opinion of his friends and admirers the celebrant has earned this wreath long ago and it was intended for presentation a year ago already but "what is good takes its time."</p>
   <p>Mr. Meyenschein, the poet of the Germania Maennerchor, delivered the address by presentation of the wreath and he did not fail to put a poetic extra swing into it.</p>
   <p>The Concert program containing an abundance of extraordinary pleasures was carried through in all its parts with splendid gallantry. The Thomas Orchestra, the Male chorus and the Soloists put in their best, and the audience appreciated the various performances.</p>
