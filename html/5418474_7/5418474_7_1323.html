   <p>The Turner Society "Eiche", yesterday celebrated the dedication of its new home. After much fruitless effort and under great financial sacrifices, the organization has succeeded in erecting its new Turner Hall. And none, after inspecting this building, would have thought, that the old hall, which served many years the purposes of the society could have been transformed into such a beautiful edifice.</p>
   <p>The Parade</p>
   <p>The various groups, headed by the drum and bugle corps of Roseland Post No. 49, and Chesterfield Post No. 695, of the American Legion, and the United drum and bugle corps of the Lincoln and Social Turner Societies, marched through the neighboring streets, thereby calling the attention of the people to the importance of the day. Allied societies were represented.</p>
   <p>The president of the entertaining society, Robert Brieskorn welcomed the festival guests</p>
   <p>The next speaker, city attorney A. M. Smietanka, as representative of Mayor <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Cermak, expressed the Mayor's regrets, that he was unable to appear in person at the dedication.</p>
   <p>The Turnerein Eiche achieved a lasting merit, by promoting the cause of gymnastics, and thereby helping to educate the youth in a national sense.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Southside Chamber of Commerce, Walter Roy spoke a few words of welcome. "The society has, during the many hears of its existance, always proved to be the shield of Germanism, and a worthy organization for all the people of the United States.</p>
   <p>Laying of the Cornerstone</p>
   <p>As the best known representative of the 1st Illinois Turner district, Mr. Leopold Saltiel was requested to lead the solemn act of the laying of the cornerstone and handing the hall over to its destination.</p>
   <p>All societies, who unite in peaceful co-operation in the Illinois Turner district, stand for the German idea of gymnastics and body development. Only old and faithful adherents of the cause of gymnastics like Fritz Bethig, Hugo Voege and August Reinecke can estimate, what such a festivity as the dedication <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of a new hall means to the organization.</p>
