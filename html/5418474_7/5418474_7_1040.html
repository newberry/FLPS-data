   <p>The drama "Kabale und Liebe" by F. von Schiller was staged last night in the New Chicago Theater. The great attendance proved that the public enjoys classical plays. The presentation was also interesting because two actresses of merit were taking part, namely Miss V. Stammwitz and Miss Wolf.</p>
   <p>It is hard to say who was the best player. Miss Stammwitz as Lady Milford deserves unrestricted praise. In the scene between herself and the major she proved herself to be an accomplished artist. The same can be said of Miss Wolf.</p>
