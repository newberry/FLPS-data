   <p>In one of the first concerts of the season, the Excelsior Maennerchor appeared before the public yesterday to give evidence of the work it has been doing during the summer months. In its musical performances of the evening the organization went far beyond the bounds of the conventional, making the celebration of the thirty-third anniversary of its existence and the honoring of its director, Ernst F. Tamm, an occasion to which the organization can point with pride.</p>
   <p>The tireless director rehearsed four new songs for the concert to be given at the founding festival. These songs had never before been heard in Chicago. An innovation of this kind is a decided enrichment of the musical life of Chicago's German choruses. Nor did it fail to impress the public which did not display its usual restlessness, but listened to the performances with complete attention and, by hearty applause, gave expression to <span class="page-break">\2</span>the pleasure experienced from the songs.</p>
   <p>Because of the training of its voices in harmony, and their freshness and flexibility, the chorus gave great pleasure by all its four songs, "Am Schoensten bist Du" and "Spielmansblut," by Sonnet; "Durch den Wald," by Reiter; and "Sonnenaufgang," by Hermes. The singing was more harmonious than used to be the case at previous concerts. In the excellent tone poem "Sonnenaufgang," it seemed as if the notes had been born from the words.</p>
   <p>In the singing of this choral song the Excelsior Maennerchor, the Schweizer Maennerchor, the North Chicago Maennerchor and the Junge Maennerchor participated. Hearty applause rewarded the efforts of the choruses and their directors.</p>
   <p>For his day of honor the director also assembled the women's choruses which he conducts, the Polhymnia Damenchor and the Damenchor of the Deutscher Unterstuetzungs-Bund, who sang, from the program for mass choruses at the Deutscher Tag (German Day), "Teure Heimat, suesser Friede," by Broell; and "Abend auf der Heide," by Uthman; and they sang these songs well. The <span class="page-break">\3</span>concert also included performances by the Chicago Zither Club which, under its director, F. Stabla, played a humoresque by Zipf and the waltz "Isarzauber," by Karl, and an encore whose rhythm aroused the enthusiasm of the public, making them applaud vigorously.</p>
   <p>During the course of the concert, President Ludwig Schappey indicated its purpose and the honors to be bestowed upon the alert director of the organization. With a few words expressing recognition of his work, Mr. Schappey presented him with a small gift. The ladies' societies followed suit by presenting him with a bouquet.</p>
   <p>A number of popular duets, impressively rendered by the baritone Felix Glasneck and the tenor Ludwig Schappey, were scattered through the remaining portion of the program. With her songs in German, French, and Italian, Ruth Farrar Andre, soprano, displayed a rich mezzo-soprano, but she was somewhat uncertain of the more subtle points of intonation. The mispronunciation of foreign phrases was often very noticeable.</p>
