   <p>The first anniversary festival of Brand's Liedertafel at Wicker Park Hall, Milwaukee and North avenues, was a great success, both from the artistic and financial angle. The association consists mostly of employees of Brand's brewery. Although the club has been in existence only for a year, yesterday's performance showed that good material is available, and if the members continue to follow their capable leader, Prof. C. Wolfskeel, in the same ambitious manner as they have done until now, they will soon be known as one of our best singing societies in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The festival committee, which was in charge of the arrangements, provided an excellent program and did everything within its power to create a pleasant environment. From early until late, the spacious hall was crowded, the best proof that the committee's labors were successful. Horace and Virgil Brand with their families, brewmaster Metzler, and other members of the staff, were present to help celebrate the anniversary, and expressed <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>great satisfaction for the general managing of the affair, as well as for its musical achievements.</p>
   <p>The vocal part of the program contained highly pleasing selections. Not only the club which inaugurated the festivities, but all who participated to help the cause in general, received and deserved unstinted praise. Mr. Wolfskeel has the knack of selecting effective numbers for his performances and of bringing individual parts to the fore.</p>
   <p>For the introduction, a festival march was chosen, followed by Verdi's "Overture from Nebuchadnezzar," played by Wolfskeel's parlor orchestra. Brand's Song Club offered "The Singer's Wreaths," the rendition of which was excellent. The Song Club Edelweiss regaled the audience with Wolfskeel's "Sehnsucht" (Longing). Both associations, led by Mr. Wolfskeel, proved, through these as well as other songs, that they attended their singing classes properly and are endowed with enough ambition to achieve greatness.</p>
   <p>Also, the other singing societies, which collaborated to bring about this <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>successful evening, were rewarded with justified acclaim. The Labor Song Club gave us Forschner's "Essteht Eine Linde" (A Linden tree stands). The Virginia-Damenchor (Virginia Ladies' Chorus) sang the "Rosenwalzer" by Peuschel, with orchestral accompaniment. The Gross Park Liederkranz selected the splendid melody "Beautiful Rhine, Father Rhine." The Club Edelweiss (Lion's foot, the flower) also deserves credit for its contribution to the program. They sang that well-known aria "Heimweh" (Longing for Home).</p>
   <p>John B. Hoffmann entertained the audience with a cornet solo, and Richard Zschoch sang the couplet "The Red Nose." Lehnert's aria "Nightingale and Rose" was reserved for Brand's Liedertafel, with the orchestra providing the obligato part. Truly, a splendid achievement. A surprise was in store for us. Amphion (song club) appeared in full strength and sang a waltz melody followed by a medley of American songs, which brought well-nigh unending applause.</p>
   <p>The final number of the concert was the humorous scene "The City Musicians <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of Bremen," in which the roles were as follows: The orchestra leader, tuba; "mule," August Lehmann, flutist; "rooster," Wilhelm Packan, horn; dog, Arthur Miepeter, clarinet; cats: first tenor, Mr. Keller; second tenor, Mr. Schrek; first bass, Mr. Bock; and second bass, Mr. M. Flucke.</p>
   <p>All played their parts in such an effective manner that they were greeted with unending laughter.</p>
   <p>Lively dancing proved a fitting "finale" for the splendid festival.</p>
   <p>The following committees did much to assure the success of the evening: The Arrangement Committee, headed by Michael Schrick; the Dance Committee, headed by Albert Bock; and the Reception Committee, headed by Norman Rigitz.</p>
   <p>The officials of this ambitious and highly promising club are headed by John Peter Gondolf, president of the club.</p>
