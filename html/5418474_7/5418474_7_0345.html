   <p>"Die Drei Staatsverbrecher" (The Three Political Malefactors) by Dr. von Schweitzer [Initials not given] is without doubt one of the best comedies by this author and, in fact, of the German stage. A splendidly wrought intrigue, fascinating to the very end, and terminating in a very plausible solution which leaves little to be desired, it presents an excellent characterization of the old French aristocracy with its severe views.</p>
   <p>The performance, though not faultless, was satisfying in as far as the actors were concerned. Miss Wolff, as "Clemence," did not give a full measure of that aristocratic behavior which the part requires, but the same can also be said of Mrs. Claussen, in fact, of all, except Messrs. Meyer and Donald. But it was a lovely "Clemence," and the actress endowed the character with all the consuming warmth and fervor she possessed.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Claussen, as the alert, ever jovial "Marie," found therein a part which <span class="page-break">\2</span>was virtually made to order.</p>
   <p>Mr. Meyer played....the "Marquis Louis" with great dignity, and Mr. Donald's "Marquis Charles" was excellent--this applies to characterization, acting and declamation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Koch played "Jaques" in a very restrained manner and with a great deal of humor--although the part in itself is likely to encourage exaggerations.</p>
   <p>The two lovers did not please us so much; Mr. Wolkenstein would probably have been better as "President Lagey," and Mr. Weber lacked his usual natural vivacity.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stephany last evening showed better control over his timidity. Miss Abel, as "Countess Lagey," was charming; the part, however, is unimportant. Also Mrs. Horn, in the portrayal of "Mrs. von Sormeaux," had little opportunity to display her talents, however she did her best, considering the limitations of the part.</p>

   <p>While most of the separate attainments proved satisfying, and the actors stand accused only of being somewhat ill at ease in an aristocratic environment, the stage management deserves sharp reproach for its faulty selection of costumes, furniture, and scenery. After all, the rococo fashion prevailed at that time and it is inseparable from the play. With a few exceptions the costumes were not expressive of the period. Moreover, two ladies, especially (Wolff and Claussen), failed to remember of the historical setting.</p>
   <p>Attendance left nothing to be desired, for there was not a vacant seat in the house.</p>
