   <p>When, on the evening of September 16, the last of the twenty thousand visitors who attended this year's German Day departed, all who had had the privilege of participating in this splendid festival were unanimous in saying: "German Day of 1934 was a complete success, and has shown what a united German community can do."</p>
   <p>It is all the more gratifying to be able to report that the festival was not only morally but financially successful, with the result that the German Day Alliance was able to make welcome contributions to a number of welfare organizations and institutions. It was possible to use $1,650 for this purpose, out of the surplus of approximately $2,500 from this year's festival. The committee in charge was also empowered to reserve a certain amount as working capital for next year's festival and to spend the small sum left over for incidental expenses as they saw fit. In this connection the financial secretary pointed out that there was still some money outstanding for tickets of admission; the societies involved, and their delegates, were asked to take care of this matter, so that the final account <span class="page-break">\2</span>might be checked by the financial committee and a financial report be published and put in the hands of the Affiliated societies.</p>
   <p>The decision about the distribution of the surplus was the most important business on the agenda of the last meeting of the delegates in the Atlantic Hotel. This was settled harmoniously, as was all the business transacted. The executive committee was instructed to draw up list of the organizations and institutions which should be taken into consideration, and all of its recommendations were Accepted. From the floor a few names were added so that the complete list of these receiving contributions is as follows:</p>
   <p>The German Society of Chicago, which received $300 a month ago, received an additional $600, with the stipulation that half this sum be used exclusively for the support of Austrians and German-Hungarians. The Uhlich Orphan Home, the German Old People's Home, the Bensonville Old People's Home, and the Little Sisters of the Poor received one hundred dollars each. The Angel Guardian Orphanage, The Martha Washington Home for Crippled Children, the Lutheran Old People's Home in <span class="page-break">\3</span>Addison, Illinois, the Gesellschaft Erholung (Recreation Society), the German-Hungarian Old People's Home Association, the German Winter Relief, and the Andoka Philanthropic Club (the president of which is Mrs. Vavrinek) received fifty dollars each.</p>
   <p>The meeting made the following decision unanimously and with great enthusiasm: "The German Day Alliance will give its complete support to the great demonstration about the Saar which is being prepared by the Verein Der Saarlacnder (Society of Natives of the Saar) for December 1 of this year; and will urge all affiliated societies, as well as the German community in general, to support this affair to the best of their ability."</p>
   <p>It was also decided that the Alliance would support the following affairs by attending them in large numbers: the big charitable affair of the German Society in December or in January, a similar affair of the Austrians and German-Hungarians in Schubert House on Tuesday, December 4; and the celebration by the Deutsche Krieger-Verein (German Veterans' Society) next Sunday of the sixtieth anniversary of its founding.</p>

   <p>President [Gustave] Brand announced that all the business before this year's German Day Committee had been transacted. He reminded those present that the general meeting and election of officers was to be held, in accordance with a decision made earlier, on Friday evening, November 30, at 8 P.M., in the Atlantic Hotel. He then read his final report, which is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Another year has passed by in the history of the German Day Alliance. It is now the task of the officers to survey and give an account of our activities during the twelve months in which we have held office.</p>
   <p>"Twelve months is a long time, but it has flown by as if it had wings. Much is now behind us, much work, many worries, and many joys.</p>
   <p>"Have we adequately performed the duties of our offices? Have we satisfied the expectations of the delegates, of the societies, and of the great German community of Chicago? You are the judges, ladies and gentlemen. We are all human beings, <span class="page-break">\5</span>imperfect and prone to err. Yet I feel justified in declaring that every person who took part in the work involved in the German Day celebration was conscious of his responsibility and at all times did all that he could to make the affair a success.</p>
   <p>"In order to obtain in a clear picture of our work, we must go back and take a look at its high points. The first job with which the committee was confronted was the placing of the business, and the Alliance itself, on a good sound basis. As the first step in this direction, it was decided to incorporate the German Day Alliance and set it on its own feet.</p>
   <p>"The second step was to put all money and finances under strict control, and to direct that the greatest economy be observed.</p>
   <p>"The third step was to prepare a new garb for the coming German Day.</p>
   <p>"The fourth: to visit all societies affiliated with the German Day Alliance during</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>the winter, and to persuade the unaffiliated societies to join us, in order that, on the day of the celebration, we might appear a united people.</p>
   <p>"These are the promises which the committee made to the delegates. How well were they kept?</p>
   <p>"The work is behind us. Our Alliance, the committee, and the German people of Chicago can look back on the past year with pride.</p>
   <p>"The business and deliberations were carried on in our meetings and sessions in a calm, realistic, and harmonious way, and often with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>"Every speaker was given the right to say what he thought, without interruption or hindrance. Every German found a hearty welcome at all times, and the door to the sessions of the committee was never closed to delegates or guests.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>"I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to the committee, the delegates, and every guest, for the way they observed every good German custom and way of doing things.</p>
   <p>"Great thanks are due the delegates and their societies for the unlimited confidence which they gave the committee at all times. The committee made every effert to justify and preserve this confidence, as if they were protecting the costliest jewel.</p>
   <p>"In December, 1935, the Women's Auxiliary was founded, under the leadership of the second vice-president [of the Alliance], Mrs. Vavrinek. It would be useless, in my opinion, to itemize the ork of the group. Every one of us knows what the ladies under Mrs. Vavrinek's leadership have accomplished.</p>
   <p>"The German Day Alliance owes these ladies the most sincere gratitude. During the winter, spring, and summer, members of the committee and the ladies were to be seen at every concert, ball, and excursion; they kept drumming up interest in German Day, and not only in Chicago, but visits were made during the course of <span class="page-break">\8</span>the summer to other cities as well, among them Milwaukee, Kenosha, Elgin, Joliet, Aurora, Racine, Michigan City, Hammond, South Bend, and Crown Point.</p>
   <p>"Everywhere--and I mean that literally--we met with a friendly, and often an affectionate, reception. I should like to take this opportunity to express once more, my heartfelt thanks to the various societies.</p>
   <p>"In the first months of my term of office I began writing the play for the German Day on September 16, and also began working out the many details. Sketches were made for 173 special costumes. The work slowly progressed. Many societies and the general public had developed prejudice against German Day celebrations. This prejudice had to be removed and other ideals and ideas inserted in its place. The new structure had to be built stone by stone. Jealousy and ill will played an important role, but gradually the rotten timbers beneath the old structure were removed, and new life, new spirit, new idealism developed in our German community.</p>
   <p>"With new hope we looked forward to a new German Day. During this time thousands of details were decided, and the festival began to take on form. Stage <span class="page-break">\9</span>properties and other materials, costumes and decorations were prepared by a tiny band of men and women who had dedicated themselves to the service of idealism. Dances and songs were studied and practiced. Hustle and bustle, from one place to another. But we worked in fertile soil, and built on a sound basis. And them, at last, our great day came. I said our great day! It belonged to all of us; we all stood together; we were united--brothers and sisters.</p>
   <p>"We were German! the German community was awake; the brilliance of a new epoch cast its light over all; a new spirit had put down roots. Our American fellow citizens learned that the culture, the art, the science, the character, and the customs of their German neighbors are not surpassed by those of any civilized country.</p>
   <p>"Who deserves thanks for the success of the affair? Probably our German press deserves it most, for the press supported this idealistic cause with the greatest enthusiasm. Others who deserve praise are the societies which were tireless in <span class="page-break">\10</span>drumming up interest and which, by the sale of tickets, made the festival financially successful; all those who did their best to give the groups in the festival plays real, artistic value; all those who did their mite without being in the limelight; and then, too, those who had charge of the work on the program. All these deserve our heartfelt thanks. I should like to clasp the hands of all of these people and say, "A thousand thanks! God bless you!'</p>
   <p>"And now we shall put this task which is begun in new hands. We shall retire into the background, but our hearts, our enthusiasm, our sympathy, will always be closely wrapped up in the German Day movement.</p>
   <p>"And now a word of warning to the societies and their delegates: Go now and consider whom you will elect for your new committee. Disregard your own interests, and consider only the welfare of the German Day Alliance. Elect men and women who are qualified to represent the German community of Chicago; officers who are in a position to continue the building of this structure of which we laid the cornerstone. Take to heart the lessons which this year's German Day has taught us.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>"Keep this association free of all political questions. Preserve German Day as the common possession of all German-Americans.</p>
   <p>"Protect your rights, and do not hand the German Day Alliance over to a special group, tendency, or combination. Let the German Day belong to you all! Do not lose this jewel, but cherish and treasure it. It is the property of every good German-American.</p>
   <p>"And with that I shall say goodbye."</p>
   <p>The president's remarks were heartily applauded. After First Vice-President Brummund had thanked the resident in the name of the delegates, the meeting came to a harmonious close.</p>
