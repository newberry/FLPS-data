   <p>If Paul Klein, the director of the Chicago Mandolin Orchestra, promised the audience of the spring concert in the Wicker Park Hall that a quite different performance would be given at the fall concert, he kept his promise completely and utterly. If, at that time, the concert was a hit, the concert of last Sunday may be said to have been a smash hit.</p>
   <p>There are three things which distinguished this exceedingly active organization: The brevity of the program, the good quality of what is presented, and the attitude of the audience toward the members of the organization playing at the concert.</p>
   <p>The program contained no more than ten numbers, and was completed within the space of an hour and a half. The individual numbers, on the other hand, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>were presented with such care and such musical insight that the director deserves a flattering testimonial. All of it was given in a pleasing rhythm. Witness of the diligent exercises were some particularly difficult passages in the "Pizzicato Polka", by Strauss.</p>
   <p>What was quite soothing was that the public sat in silence in spite of the very thronged hall, so that one could give himself undisturbed to the enjoyment of the performance. So, for instance, when the harpest, Frau Marie Ludwig, engaged as solo player, played the "Melody", by Thomas, it became so still at the end that the drop of a pin would have been heard.</p>
   <p>With the great overture to Salvetti's "Poesia Alpestra" the concert assumed a classical form, thus giving proof that the orchestra is more than able to play works of this nature with expression and with purity of tone.</p>
   <p>Then came the familiar "Humoresque", by Dvorak and the "Hungarian Dance #5", by Brahams. Afterward they played the triumphal march from "Aida", <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>"Spring Beautiful Spring" by Lincke, and the "Pizzicato Polka" already spoken of.</p>
   <p>With the "Salut d'Amour", by Elgar, and the march "Mit Lante und Fiedel", the concert came to a close. Upon receiving the roaring applause, the director allowed himself to be moved to play two more additions. If the public had its way, the artists--if we may call them that (sic)--would have had to continue playing for hours.</p>
   <p>Frau Ludwig, solo harpist, undoubtedly had a large share in the success of the concert. Needless to say that the lady handles the instrument like a master. All hope she will play again at the next concert to be given by the organization. The greatest impression was, without a doubt, made by the wonderful technique and the deep artistic feeling she displayed in her rendition of "Valse Caprice", by Cheshire.</p>

   <p>After all, the choice of the place was a very lucky one. The Hall's accoustics are excellent, and the equipment contributed to the festival mood of the audience.</p>
   <p>The customary ball followed the concert, holding the guests together for quite a while.</p>
