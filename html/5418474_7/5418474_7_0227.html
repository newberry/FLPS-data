   <p>Since Mr. Friedrich Haase left town last Sunday, the theatre loving public of Chicago again depends on the home talent under the direction of Callum and Isenstein. It is hoped that through faithful support a happy solution of the problem of worthwhile entertainment can we reached.</p>
   <p>In a way, it might be regrettable if big stars(like Haase) were to come here too frequently, as it naturally will make the public less appreciative of the endeavors of our own actors. This has happened in other cities. Our German actors in Chicago have already given us proof of their brilliant abilities.</p>
