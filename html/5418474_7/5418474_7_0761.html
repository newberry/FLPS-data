   <p>An artistic treat was the compensation awaiting the large audience of music lovers who withstood the temptation of the glorious spring day to be present at the concert given by the United Singers of Chicago at the Chicago Opera House yesterday afternoon. The first number on the program was the overture to "Zampa," played by Mr. Ballmann and his orchestra. Then followed the "Soldiers' Chorus" from "Faust", superbly executed by the United Singing Societies, under the direction of Mr. Rehberg and accompanied by the orchestra. Loud and lasting applause rewarded the performers. The Weber-Liszt composition, "Pollacca Brillante", a piano solo, was played by Dr. F. Balatka with the accomplishment of a master. The singers then offered "You Are My Ideal" and "Homesick", followed by a vocal solo, the "Polonaise" from "Mignon," by Mrs. Katzenberger-Lighthall, which concluded the first half of the program.</p>
   <p>In resuming the concert, the singers and the orchestra united in the performance of "Wanderlust". Then the renowned baritone, Mr. Max Bing, sang in his usual <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>beautiful manner Liszt's lovely composition, "You Are Like A Flower", and "The Two Grenadiers". Then there followed a splendid orchestral presentation, "Coronation March" from "The Queen of Sheba"; a duet by Mrs. Katzenberger-Lighthall and Mr. Bing; and the final offering by the ensemble, "The Power of Music".</p>
