   <p>Before 600 spectators, the students of the German department of Lewis Institute at Madison and Robey Street last night gave the principal scenes of Schiller's juvenile drama "The Robbers" in the German language. The roles were all given to students of all classes of the German department and have been enacted with great success in regards to the pronunciation of the language and the acting of the part, notwithstanding that the actors partly were Anglo-Americans or German-Americans born in this country. The scenery had been produced with great care. The costumes for the performance were brought from Milwaukee. The principal casts were played by Miss Mather as Amalia, M. Bloss as Count Koepke, Carl Grosberg as Franz, Taylor as Spiegelberg, Henderson as Herman, and Schmidt as Schweizer. Their performance was excellent.</p>
