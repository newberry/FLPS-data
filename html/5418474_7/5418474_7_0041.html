   <p>Following is the report published by the German Popular Stage of Chicago: During the short period of its existence, the German Popular Stage of Chicago is said to have won a most satisfactory success. The addresses delivered in the theatre last Sunday night by Leopold Saltiel, president, and Julius C. Hoch, vice-president, had an inspiring effect on the audience; as a result fifty more devotees of artistic drama became members of the organization.</p>
   <p>In addition, the receipts from the sale of coupon books will be used for the creation of a guaranty fund for the German Theatre. This fund in its turn will serve to assure the continuance and expansion of this temple of art.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the fact that our efforts have been crowned by success, we realize that the great task has only begun. The German Popular Stage of <span class="page-break">2</span>Chicago is not at all like a club; it is a German movement, guided by principles which affect all of us. No person who is a member of the German race can maintain an apathetic attitude toward this cultural mass movement. Infinite benefits may be expected from this organization, when adequately recognized by the German-American people. And in view of the fact that the prestige of that racial group which carries on the movement increases as the movement is strengthened, our urgent plea is: Join the organization!</p>
   <p>It would be needless to emphasize that this group observes strict political neutrality. Cultural development is the sole interest and aim of this movement. A sufficiently large membership will provide a guarantee for the future of the German Theatre in Chicago.</p>
