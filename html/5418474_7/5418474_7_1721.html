   <p>The Rheinlaenders (the Germans who live in districts bordering on the River Rhine) will have a grand prize masquerade at the Columbia Hall, corner Lake and Desplaines Streets. Several valuable prizes are offered. The humorous part of the program will be taken care of by Mr. Math. Bisdorf, with his genial poems. Mr. Kindler and Schwartz also will do their share. The Rheinlaenders are proverbially good natured and humorously inclined and so far have always succeeded in dispersing melancholy.</p>
   <p>Now they intend to combine the aesthetic with the useful by renting an office at Brandl's (Brandl's) Hall, where gratuitous advice and information will be given to all Rheinlaenders.</p>
   <p>Individuals willing to join will have that privilege on Sunday.</p>
