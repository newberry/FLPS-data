   <p>The Schwaebische Saengerbund held its semiannual meeting last Friday in the course of which the presiding vice-president made the announcement that President Wilhelm Maurer, who has served the organization for twenty-three years, is now going to retire from office because of ill health; also, that another secretary would have to be elected because Mr. Richard Moritz, who has been secretary until now, is returning to Germany for a permanent stay.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joe Beron, the former vice-president, was unanimously elected president, and Mr. Paul Kurfess, 1718 Albion Street, was elected secretary. To fill Mr. Beron's place, Mr. George Iberle was chosen vice-president. In accordance with the bylaws, the society elected Mr. H. A. Rehberg director for another term of six months.</p>
   <p>After the voting, the newly elected president announced to the assembled <span class="page-break">\2</span>members that Mr. Maurer had been nominated honorary president in recognition of his services. At the same time Mr. Maurer was given an artistically carved gavel and a diploma. As a token of gratitude and recognition Mr. Moritz was given a fountain pen and pencil set ingraved with his name. The two recipients expressed their thanks briefly.</p>
   <p>From now on, the regular singing session will take place every Friday night at 8 o'clock at the Lincoln Turner Hall.</p>
