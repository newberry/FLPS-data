   <p>Next Sunday "The Gypsy" will be presented.</p>
   <p>Our permanent German Theatre group, under the direction of the Messrs. Richard Welb and Muchsner, will present on Sunday "The Gypsies," at Hooley's Theatre. Mr. Emil from the East, who took part in the performance last Sunday and played the lead in "Kran," was no doubt liked very much by the public.</p>
   <p>He will again play the leading part.</p>
