   <p>With a sigh of relief, the six hundred United Singers of Chicago, last Sunday at about 6 P.M., put down their music. All these last weeks wore filled with endless rehearsals, to which hundreds of singers came through many miles of snow and wind. We are forced to respect genuine German striving toward ideal aims when we consider this valiant assembly of singers, driven by nothing but the love for the German song, and the joy over lays and tunes. They came from Forest Park and from Hammond to lend a hand. The eye too perceived a pretty sight--the ladies in white with red, white, and blue ribbons.</p>
   <p>With a sigh of relief the director put down his baton. For on his shoulders lay the chief burden of the last few weeks, often driven by the secret fear, "Will it succeed?" It was not only this concert he was concerned with. It was to be merely the testing stone for something much more important. The song festival is coming soon and the United Singers of Chicago constitute the backbone of the great mass chorus. It would be too bad if they should fail him.</p>
   
   <p>They shall not fail him! They proved it last Sunday. Not that everything went splendidly. Many a thing has still to be polished, the edges smoothed and planed. And yet beautiful performances could be noted. The term "excellent" was merited by the very first song, "Fruehling am Rhein" (Spring on the Rhine), by Bren. It was sung in a fresh and gay manner. The same praise is owing to Isemann's "Wo i geh' wo i steh'" (Where I stand, where I walk), rendered with the proper feeling. Something similar could be said of Kaiser's "O gruesst sie mit" (O give my regards), had it not been for the second tenor, who sang the lead in "Winde" (Winds), "Lieder" (Lays), "Sterne" (Stars) some-what too high--but that, of course, was noticed by the initiated only. Satisfactory indeed was Schulken's "Abendlich schon rauscht der Wuld" (In the Evening the Woods Begins to Rustle), while the wonderful "Sternennacht" (Night of Stars) is still in need of polishing. The last song "Deutsches Lied und Wort" (German song and word) by Rudolf Wagner should not have been undertaken without instrumental accompaniment. The two English songs showed little more than ordinary school singing. It is because, containing no enthusiasm, they could not be rendered with enthusiasm. In selecting English songs for German choruses, it is necessary to exercise greater caution. Used, as they are, to better music, the singers were unable to sing ordinary English music filled with cheap sentimentality. The old "Home, Sweet Home" may sound well in the light of the hearth fire in the family circle. But, sung by a German male chorus in a concert hall, it gives an almost ludicrous effect. "Love's Old Sweet Song" is little better.</p>
   <p>The women's chorus, which made its appearance for the first time, was a surprise. Not that a good performance was not expected, but the tone quality and voice blending were surprisingly good. The freshness of the voices, although the majority of the ladies no longer are young (the critic is compelled to speak nothing but the truth) provides real joy. Of the ladies' selections, I liked best "Sehnsucht nach den Bergen" (Longing for the Mountains), by Abt, "Mein Lied" (My Song), by Angerer, and "Das Elternhaus" (The House of the Parents), by Buechse. But also the "Begruendungslied" (Song of Why), by Stark, and "Santa Lucia" were given proper rendition. Also, in the selection of English songs, a luckier hand was shown than in the men's chorus. The "Autumn Lullaby," by Fearis, made a beautiful impression, but the "Grossvaterlied," having for its background a Beethoven minuet, lost a great deal because it was not sung in the strict tempo of a minuet. The slow movement interpolated by the director spoiled the effect of the grandfather dance; it should come out. But it pleased the public so much that it had to be repeated.</p>
   <p>The soloists were Rudolph Reiners on the violin, Lillian Rehberg on the cello, and Mary Hughes Call on the piano; these organized as a philharmonic trio, did quite beautifully in "Liebestraum," by Liszt, Schuett's "Maerchen" and Arensky's "D-flat Trio." The three artists introduced themselves in a manner which must have waked the desire in everyone to hear them again. That Miss Rehberg played Bruch's wonderful "Kol Nidrei" was no longer a surprise after what she has done before. I can not recall having ever heard the piece played with greater depth of soul. It is hardly necessary to add that Popper's brilliant "Spinnerlied" was performed with accomplished technique. Mr. Rudolph Reiners proved himself a skilled violinist in Wagner-Wilhelmi's "Albumblatt" and Vieuxtemps' "Rondier," but he is still lacking in depth of expression. His playing, however, was in general quite pleasant.</p>
   <p>The talented director, H. A. Rehberg, deserves congratulations for the success of the whole performance, even though it was highly deplorable that the house was half empty. The performance offered certainly deserved a much larger attendance on the part of the German public.</p>
   <p>But the singers, undaunted, will continue their forward strides. From now on, the slogan will be: "Up to Peoria!"</p>
