   <p>Again a whole week of performances in the German Theater is before us. The continuation of weekly performances will depend entirely upon the attendance of this week. It is clearly in evidence that no director of any theater can continue to produce at a loss,even if he were very rich,or if he were willing to do so for the sake of art.</p>
   <p>If during this week the expenses are not at least covered, the performances on week days will of necessity be given up. Another consequence would be a reduction of the number of actors which would deeply affect the efficiency of the troupe. It is impossible to maintain such a large and capable company of actors, as we have now at the Schiller Theater, by giving Sunday performances only.</p>
   <p>In a certain sense, therefore, it is a matter of "To be or not to be" for our German Theater. How will our people decide this question? The cultivation of art measures the degree of civilization of a people. Shall it be said of the German population of Chicago that their civilization, according to this standard, is rather inferior?</p>

   <p>The Germans of Chicago have just recently proven their strength in their struggle for their schools. May they now manifest the same capabilities in maintaining their art!</p>
