   <p>The jolly party held by the German Press Club at the Bismarck Hotel was well attended in spite of the bad weather. The celebration took on the character of a Lincoln festival. In his opening speech Mr. Fritz Gloganer, the chairman of the festival, declared that the many celebrations in honor of President Lincoln showed that he was dear to the Germans and recognized the value of the German element to the community. As an executive, moreover, he was generous in affording this element an opportunity to share in the administration of the State. Lincoln himself was more like a typical German than a New England Yankee. His was an ideal character, in its honesty and conscientiousness and also in its humor, and he is worthy of all the honors bestowed upon him.</p>
