With pride we have welcomed in our city the three musketeers of the air, Koehl, Hunefeld, Fitzmaurice, and also Dr. Hugo Eckener, and never have we neglected to prove our respect wholeheartedly and undividedly to the heroes and pioneers of German aeronautics, who have led the way of the entire world in more than one respect.</p>
   <p>Come then, Germans of Chicago! Visit the National Air Derby, to be held at the Curtiss-Wright-Reynold's Airport, near Glenview, from August 23 to September 1. In addition to the most prominent flyers of America and foreign countries, the foremost German flyers will also participate, among whom will be the well-known Fritz Lohse with a Junker airplane. To honor those German flyers who have come across the Atlantic to compete in the Derby, and to honor and <span class="page-break">2</span>acknowledge that which Germany has bestowed upon the world in the field of aeronautics, we should participate as one man on German Day, Monday, August 25.
