   <p>A carefully selected program, a splendid orchestra, an expert conductor, and well chosen soloists, these factors are the principal reasons, which make the Sunday afternoon concerts of the Philharmonic orchestra in the North Side Turner Hall so popular this season. The concert hall was filled to its capacity by a music loving public, in spite of the Siberian winter weather and in spite of Christmas time, an audience which listened with great attention to the different numbers, and expressed its satisfaction by applauding interminably.</p>
   <p>The soloist of the concert was the youthful violinist, Robert Quick, a student of conductor Czerwonky's. He has played previously with great success with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and has just returned from an Eastern concert tour.</p>
