   <p>At yesterday's meeting of the German Day Committee in the Atlantic Hotel, the most important decision was to abolish the larger part of the scheduled speeches at the celebration in the stadium. This was carried after a lengthy dispute. President Leopold Saltiel declared that he wants to interweave into his speech a short English address of welcome. Moreover, the mayor and the governor's representative will talk in English, therefore those listeners who did not understand German, would be fully satisfied.</p>
   <p>After the different ladies' committees had reported that they also were hard at work, George Landau, the honorary president, was received with great applause. In his speech he referred to events in the last meeting. He warned all to leave out all politics and religion, because these subjects only undermine friendship and harmony, which alone are the foundations of successful arrangements. His words caused great enthusiasm among his listeners.</p>
