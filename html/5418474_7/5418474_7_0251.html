   <p>For the opening of this new and tastefully decorated hall, corner of Sedgwick and North Avenue, a large and enthusiastic audience was present last night. The performance was preceded by a concert and all seats were were sold out. The program was opened by the playing of the "Jockey March" under the direction of orchestra leader Mr. Flodoardo Hoffmann. The musicians received much applause, and the other musical items on the program were much appreciated by the audience. Then followed a farce supposed to take place in a furnished residence; the ladies Nicolai and Thyssen, and the gentlemen Pelisaier, Uhlich and Kadlowski were the players. They gave an excellent performance, especially Mr. Pelisaier as Capitalist Aschendeck of Pasenvalk, Miss Thyssen as a pretty chambermaid did her best but her voice was not suitable for such a large hall; however, her acting was good, so all went on smoothly to the end. Another farce, "That was I" or the "Wheel Barrow Parade," was acted by Miss Johanna and Mr. Pelisaier in which they excelled themselves. Both plays won great applause. Mr. Pelisaier is a splendid actor and always draws a full house. At the end of the performance the chairs were removed, and young and old had a good time dancing till the early morning.</p>
