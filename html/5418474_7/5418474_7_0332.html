   <p>Concerning the reasons why I have severed my connections with the Wurster theatrical troupe, I wish to send you some explanations. Mr. Wurster's mind is afflicted with the idea that I intend to start a German theater on my own and consequently he only produces such plays in which I must appear to the public as insignificant, although my name was advertised on the bulletin as being a guest. As Mr. Wurster had scheduled only such plays for the next three weeks, I realized that he did so in order to withdraw me from the attention of the public. For that and no other reason did I resign.</p>
