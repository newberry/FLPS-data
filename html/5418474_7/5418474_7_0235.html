   <p>A new comedy by J. Von Moser and F. Von Schoenthau, entitled "Krieg im Frieden" (War in Peace). was produced by Collmer and Isenstein's German dramatic company at McVicker's Theater last evening, and proved quite a success. This play, like most of Moser's productions, is finely written, full of action, has well-drawn characters, and is interesting from beginning to end. It is a strong play, although not the equal of some of the author's former productions. The various parts, with a few exceptions, were in competent hands. Messrs. Heineman, Meyer, Engle, Richard, and Rodenberg distinguished themselves by giving fine character - representations, and so did Miss Fiebach, Mrs. Meyer, and Mrs. Markham.</p>
