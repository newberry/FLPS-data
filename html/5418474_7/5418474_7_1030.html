   <p>The Teutonia Dramatic Club celebrated yesterday their first festival of commemoration at the Northwest Turnhalle, Clybourn and Southport Avenues. "An Easy-going Person", a comedy by Pohl, was played by the members at this occasion. Of course, the play was abbreviated and simplified so that the players were able to master it well.</p>
