   <p>The Plattdeutsche (Low Germans) seem to be specially favored by St. Peter for, although it was quite murky in the morning, the sky became clear later and thus made possible the success of the Folkfest (popular festival).</p>
   <p>In order to make all the preparations the members of the committee worked from early morning. St. Peter must have watched them at their work, because toward noon his attitude became friendly. When the first rays of the sun began to appear, many people began to arrive at the picnic grove of Riverview Park, and in a short time the place became the scene of great activity. The Park became considerably gayer and more festive at 3 P.M., when a long procession of master bakers arrived. Headed by their own band of drummers and pipers the uniformly clad groups marched into the picnic grove where they were greeted heartily by the Plattduetsch Grotgilde (Great Guild of Low Germans).</p>
   <p>After marching once through the Park and receiving hearty greetings from everywhere, the festival procession was addressed by their former Grand Master, Fred Rixman, and by Grand Master Paul M. Wagner who, in the name of the Low Germans, extended a cordial welcome to the singing clubs as well as to the band of drummers. The president of the Baeckermeister Gesangverein (Master Bakers' Singing Club), Mr. Charles Klinckmann, thanked Mr. Wagner for the friendly welcome, and expressed the hope that the friendliness of the relations established during the festival between the two organizations would continue and increase.</p>
   <p>The Plattduetsche Grotgilde was particularly well represented yesterday. There were the Deutsche Kriegerbund (Alliance of German Warriors), the Schiller Liedertafel, the Schleswig-Holstein Saengerbund, and the Excelsior Maennerchor.</p>
   <p>The Schwaben Verein (Swabian Society) of Chicago which generally comes to visit the Folkfest of the Low Germans, likewise came in large numbers; they were conducted by the band of drummers and pipers into the Park and into the Burenkrug (farmers' tap room).</p>
   
   <p>The performances of the tap crew of the Illinois Turnbezirk were received with applause. Directed by Ernst C. Klafs, who is in charge of the District, the crew conducted itself commendably at the bars. Particular ovations were given to the only lady turner to participate in the performances.</p>
   <p>Those who wanted to dance had a really good time in the dance hall, and were entertained by Hartwig's orchestra. The "Hungry Five" in the Burenkrug put everyone in a gay mood.</p>
   <p>The eelstalls, especially popular at Low German festivals, were very much in demand. Those who arrived late at the Park noticed to their regret that the enormous stores had been consumed. They, accordingly, compensated themselves for this loss by eating Richter's sausages, which tasted very good.</p>
   <p>Until late at night there was a busy atmosphere among the Low Germans and there was no doubt that the Grotgilde may enter this festival in its books as a splendid success.</p>
   
   <p>The following were the chief officers of the committee: Paul M. Wagner, chairman; Willhelm Finnern, second chairman; H. L. Nordegg, secretary; Charles King, treasurer; Arthur J. Moeller, ticket treasurer; and Emma Goetsche, August Weigelt and Fred Rixman. There were also forty other members who were continuously busy, helping to make the festival a success.</p>
