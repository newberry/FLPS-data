   <p>The German song is a constituent part of German culture, which cannot be imagined without it. The old Germans celebrated their heroical deeds with songs, and a feast without songs was unthinkable. The minnesingers of the Middle Ages, the mastersingers of the modern times, have carried on this old tradition, and today the German singing societies are to be considered the most important supporters of the German song at least, as far as chorus singing is concerned. This is not done in Germany alone, but all over the world, where Germans live, particularly in America. The reputation of the German singers in this country is the very best. German chorus singing is highly esteemed and it deserves this high appreciation. The German singing societies render, in the average, artistic performances, which are of amazingly high value. It is always a real enjoyment to listen to their <span class="page-break">\2</span>performances. It is not the singing in itself, which makes the singers dear and valuable to us, but the German song, which touches our hearts, when sung by good voices, under good direction. The gratifying fact can herewith be confirmed with satisfaction that German singing societies are led by some good, even excellent conductors, under whose batons the German song in America could achieve so many beautiful triumphs.</p>
   <p>Only recently the singers of the united male choruses, with the German song and perfect musical performance, gained so many new friends and admirers. Under the direction of the Conductors Stock and Reckzeh, and partly accompanied by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the German singers provoked enthusiastic demonstrations of acclamation among the listeners and had to give several encores. The acknowledgment of the critics was not less than the appreciation of the audience. We quote: "The German singers were awarded the highest praise. The annual Musical Festival of the North Shore Festival Association, within which unit, the singing performances were offered, cannot <span class="page-break">\3</span>be thought of in the future without the cooperation of the German singers. The German singers as heralds of the German songs, fulfill with their performances a high cultural task namely, they build a natural bridge for a better mutual understanding between people.</p>
   <p>Folk lores, which are popular in every country of the globe, reproduce the true soul of the respective people. In its song text, the life with all its joys and all its sorrows is reflected, and in its melodies can be found in all forms and visions a heart rending interpretation. Joy and sorrow, day by day find its transfiguration in the song. And when the Americans hear German songs it will help them to understand German characteristics better. From this aspect the German insistence to form societies, which are not smaller than those, in the old homeland, must be considered a real blessing. The German singers here in this country are well liked and heard everywhere. It is very easy to listen to good or even high-class soloists in concert halls, but it is not so easy to find excellent or even good choruses, and here the German singers can be given <span class="page-break">\4</span>testimonial that they all offer good to high-class chorus singing. The German-Americans have reason to be proud of their singing societies, and should do everything possible to keep alive this German singing movement, because it has gained them so many friends and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
