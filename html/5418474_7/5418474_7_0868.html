   <p>The Socialist Men's Choir held its quarterly meeting yesterday evening in the "Thuringer Hall". After the usual business affairs had been disposed of the floor was given to a number of the Committee on arrangements of the last Commune Celebration.</p>
   <p>He declared the committee desires to apologize to the Socialist men's Choir, for having scrapped one of the songs which were on the program. This was due to the fact, that some of the participants were late; in consequence the performance of the play "The Nihilists" could not be delayed any longer.</p>
   <p>The apology was accepted as the members found the reason given entirely satisfactory. An invitation of the "Lehr and Wehr Verein" to its Sunday evening entertainment in Folz Hall was accepted.</p>
