The performance opened with the "RRRauss Polka," a choral song with orchestral accompaniment. Then came the comedian Michael Faust, a graceful dancing couple, a medley of drinking songs for the male chorus, and general singing with the orchestra. A mixed chorus, composed of the Damenchor (Women's Chorus) Lorelei and the Westseite Saengerkranz, concluded the program by singing a special arrangement by Director Lohmiller of the "Glueckswalzer" from the "Tango Prinzessin".
