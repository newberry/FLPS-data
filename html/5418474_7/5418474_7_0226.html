   <p>The performance of "The Devil's Mill on the Wienerberg" took place yesterday evening in the pressence of a large audience. As the study of the roles received the actors' greatest attention, there was no doubt of the success of the play, thanks to the excellent management of Mr. H.F. Bonnet.</p>
   <p>The two guests Miss Elize Roiner and Miss A. Bender justified their reputation as capable performers. Also Miss E. Bonnet in the role of "Genius" Iriel, played and sang very well. Mrs. Riclas filled her part satisfactorily. The role of the brave and courageous jester and shield-bearer of Knight von Schwartzeman was ably played by Mr. C. Horn. Also the Messrs. Bonnet and Uhlich must be favorably mentioned.</p>
