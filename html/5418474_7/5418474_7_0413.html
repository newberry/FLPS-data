   <p>In their usual entertaining manner the Tyrolean Men's and Ladies' Choir provided their guests with a few pleasant hours yesterday at the fall festival presented at the Swiss Clubhouse, 635 Webster Avenue.</p>
   <p>Under the direction of Tony Godetz a diverse program of features both frivilous and serious was presented and held the interest of the audience so that to them the hours slipped by unnoticed.</p>
   <p>The well-planned program, in which each number quickly succeeded the other, opened with a selection by a mixed choir. This recital was well received, by the audience--the applause was an indication of the appreciation of the audience for the care and patience with which the choir had been rehearsed by the conductor, Herr Godetz.</p>
   <p>Other features of the program were the recitations by the Wiemer Schrammel Trio, composed of members of the organization, and a zither duet, by Mr. and Mrs. Godetz, who took care of the orchestral part of the program. Beside the musical treats the Tyrolean Men's Choir gave humor its right place; the Bavarian comic artist, Girl Dennhofer, entertained the audience quite well with his humorous recitals, and Herr Joseph Fallbacher, the well-known Wurz'n Sapp (Sucker Joe) did his best to tickle the risibilities of the audience.</p>
   <p>In view of the versatile and well-performed program the performers must have enjoyed themselves, and they certainly deserved the hearty applause of the audience.</p>
   <p>The Tyrolean Men's Choir can look back with satisfaction to its fall concert, because the Swiss hall was filled to the last seat yesterday. After the concert John Krachtus band played dance music keeping the folks together in a joyous mood.</p>
   
   <p>As to the success of the performance, a festival committee, along with the other performers, was responsible for the concert program. It was composed of the following gentlemen: Joseph Waibl, chairman; Egon Mayer, secretary; and Louis Wastl, treasurer. The president of the organization is Frank Fringer.</p>
