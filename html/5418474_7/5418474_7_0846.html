   <p>The Singing Society "Harmony" gave a splendid entertainment last night at the Lincoln Turner Hall. The song "Ihr lieben Voeglein, singt nur fort" (You Darling Birdies, Keep on Singing) sung by Mrs. Dony, was really marvelous.</p>
   <p>Mr. Von Open (Open), the director of this young singing society, is in every way a capable man and doubtless will lend his ambition towards a bright future of the "Harmony."</p>
   <p>All the other recital numbers of the program pleased the audience.</p>
   <p>The Committee functions were in the hands of Messrs. Wertschaft, Pall, Reinking, Christ and Nordhold.</p>
