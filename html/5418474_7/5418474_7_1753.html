After the board had passed on bills presented by the finance committee and had granted the increase of $1,380 sought by the committee on music, Mr. Heinemann, financial secretary, submitted the following general account of receipts and expenditures:</p>

   <p>[Translator's note: According to the figures given the grants should be $68,980.94, and the expenditures $73,216.21, but $4,000 does not mean much when you treat a crowd to beer.]</p>
   
   <p>The accounting therefore shows the following:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Income</td>
     <td>$116,832.20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Expenses</td>
     <td>69,216.21</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Surplus</td>
     <td>47,615.99</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>This latter sum subtracted from $62,500 gives a deficit in the guarantee fund of $14,884.01.</p>
   <p>After receiving the report the board of control decided to declare immediately a dividend of seventy-five per cent, amounting to $46,875. Accordingly [the result is]:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Surplus</td>
     <td>$47,615.99</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Dividend</td>
     <td>46,875.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Cash remaining in treasury</td>
     <td>$ 740.99</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>This sum will undoubtedly suffice to pay all bills still outstanding, court costs, exhibition costs, etc. If a balance remains, it will be disposed of later.</p>
   <p>Upon Mr. Rubens' motion it was decided to pay the dividend forthwith to all claimants and to obtain receipts therefor.</p>
   <p>Messrs. H. H. Christmann, Christoph, and Madlener were appointed members of the revision committee and were requested to collaborate with a section of the finance committee to close the accounts.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rubens made a motion that Mr. Vocke should defend the Song Festival Association in the suit brought by the First National Bank of Illinois, which is trying to garnishee the dividend of Lawrence and Martin, but the assembly decided that Mr. Rubens should attend to the matter.</p>
   <p>The meeting then was adjourned to next Monday.</p>
