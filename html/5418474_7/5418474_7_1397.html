   <p>Professor Scherger, who is well known for his courage in interceding in favor of the German element, was chosen to hold the speech of the day, at the German Day Festival. The speech in its entire text is as follows:</p>
   <p>"What a glorious idea it is to celebrate a German Day yearly! And how splendid and sacred this demonstration of the German people of today appears! Without pursuing political or religious aims, we are assembled today in this wonderful stadium to prove that we Americans of German origin are still a united people of brothers, that we still are capable of enthusiasm for German ideals and endeavors, and to prove further that German thought still prevails in America, and especially in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, today, we shall sing, perform gymnastic exercises, hold speeches and enjoy life, in order that others may also witness the meaning of German ways of living. We do not desire that the German element of Chicago or America separate themselves from other nationalities of this great American nation, we do not desire to form a state within the state. We know - as the Americans say - "That it takes all kinds of people to make a world.'</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"Generally, it cannot be said of the Germans that they do not value foreign customs; on the contrary, it is rather an old hereditary defect of the Germans to accustom themselves too easily to all foreign ways, and thereby not to appreciate highly enough their own greatness.</p>
   <p>"The German, originally, is no swaggerer. What the English call "pride of race" which they possess in such a high degree, we certainly should adapt ourselves to. And so today, we want to feel happy about our characteristics. We ask ourselves, what does it actually mean to be a German? What are the German characteristics? And what has America actually to thank this German influence for?</p>
   <p>"No greater gifts could the Germans bring to America than their music - this most German of all arts. What the German people have given to the musical world, amounts to almost as much as the entire contributions of all the other nations together. If the names of Bach, Haendel, Beethoven, Wagner, Mozart, Hayden, Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Richard Strauss, and other German masters were separated from musical history, not much would be left!</p>
   <p>"And the glorious German chorals - which other nation possesses anything to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>compare with them? In this German music the depth of emotion of the German people reveals itself. Music has always been cultivated by the Germans in America! Let us today gratefully acknowledge what America owes to German masters, like Theodore Thomas, Anton Seidl, Walter Damrosch, Carl Muck. Let us remember here in Chicago the merits of Frederick Stock, Wilhelm Middelschulte, Wilhelm Boeppler, Rehberg, and many others. We will cultivate and keep this treasure in our men's choruses and singing societies.</p>
   <p>"The second gift from the Germans to America is gymnastics. When old Jahn, the father of gymnastics, saw his unhappy country trampled upon the ground, he felt the necessity of strengthening those Prussian people, physically and morally, by means of physical education, and thereby those people by their own strength became brisk, pious, free and joyous.</p>
   <p>"It was a pupil of Jahn, who brought these gymnastics to America. The first school in America to introduce this system was George Bancroft's school in New England. A German became the pioneer of the gymnastic and athletic education of the young people of America.</p>
   <p>"Furthermore, no other nation has exercised such far-reaching and deep <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>influence upon the entire educational system of America than the German, beginning with the kindergarten and ending with the university. Enthusiastic admirers of the German pedagogue, Friedrich Froebel, organized here in America the first kindergartens in Boston, St. Louis and Chicago. The pedagogics of Herbert, Rein and Ziller have impregnated the entire system of education in America.</p>
   <p>"And especially, the universities of America have adopted German methods, in the laboratories of physics, chemistry, zoology, and psychology, also in the conferring of Doctor's degrees, and German methods of research. Yes, our leading universities, like Harvard, John Hopkins, and Chicago are organized after the German pattern and are inclined to favor more and more the German system.</p>
   <p>"The greatest American historians like Bancroft, Motley and others have received their education in Germany. That is also true in regard to language, natural science and philosophy. Finally, I mention here the influence of German intellect upon the free institutions of America.</p>
   <p>"It is the Germanic perception of freedom, which was transplanted from German's virgin forests to England and America, to which we are indebted <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>for our political institutions. Great instructors of law and history like Stubbs, John Richard Green, Edward O. Freemann and James Bryce have also emphasized these facts.</p>
   <p>"And this Germanic love for freedom must not be lost. It is, especially today, greatly exposed to danger. The right of the individual, to form his own philosophy according to his own wishes, must be preserved against the assaults of narrow-minded Puritanism and against the interference of the state. The individual does not only belong to the state, but before everything else, to himself.</p>
   <p>"Indeed, it is a glorious history upon which the German element in America can look back! Proudly we can point to the facts that German-Americans have always taken a great interest in the affairs of this country. From colonial times we can mention the names of Jacob Zeisler, Herkheimer, Muhlenberg, Pastorious.</p>
   <p>"The first bible which ever was printed in America, was a German bible. The first school and church west of the Alleghany mountains were founded at Dover, Ohio, by the German missionary Zeisberger and his Moravian brothers.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"In the revolutionary wars and especially in the Civil War, German soldiers took a decisive part. The Prussian, General von Steuben, was a great organizer and drill master in Washington's Army. German generals like Sigel, Osterhaus and Rosecranz helped to win the Civil War. The first protest against slavery was made in 1688 in Germantown, Pennsylvania. And during the last World War, German-Americans with bleeding hearts, were compelled to send their sons to war to fight against their own blood relatives, - which other elements in America would have obeyed such demands? Perhaps the English or the Irish?</p>
   <p>"Then, the German mechanics and farmers should not be omitted here. The small man who through his industry, his faithfulness to duty, his economy, by far surpassed his neighbors, - who turned forests into arable land, changed them into blooming gardens; who accustomed themselves to prevailing conditions, while others would have perished. Nobody can accuse German-Americans of not giving to America as much as they have received. We have always done our duty as good citizens, and this we will do, also, in the future, on an even larger scale.</p>
   <p>"Whoever is ashamed of his German origin, is a poor American.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>"German ideals - love for freedom, ability, thoroughness, enthusiasm for everything that is true, good and beautiful - those are also American ideals!</p>
   <p>"Therefore, today, we will at this inspiring festival dedicate ourselves anew to these ideals."</p>
