   <p>Every time the Cannstatter Folksfest (Cannstatt Popular Festival) of the Schwaben Verein (Swabian Society) takes place, people throng to the affair. This has been true for the past fifty-six years. The fifty-seventh Swabian festival, which was held yesterday and today in the big picnic grove in Riverview Park, on Western Avenue and Roscoe Street, was brought to a close with its usual liquid cheer, and was no exception to this rule.</p>
   <p>It might have seemed, in the morning, as though Jupiter Pluvius had played a trick on the festivities. However, he took compassion upon the sorrowful faces he saw on the members of the administrative board of the Schwaben Verein (with the "Schabenkoenig" [Swabian King], J. Klein, and his faithful <span class="page-break">\2</span>"Eckehardt," Secretary George Iberle, as their leaders) when they felt the first rain drops. He therefore speedily closed the dams of his water basin and yielded the upper hand to Madame Sun, so that the festivities might not be disturbed.</p>
   <p>Early in the afternoon, when the festival was opened by Edward G. Hall's military band, with the "King Karl March," the weather was very mild, and there was not a trace of rain. Only a few umbrellas reminded one of the threat of the morning. They were brought along by some fearful persons, who either used them later for protection against the rays of the sun, or cursed the fact that they had ever brought them.</p>
   <p>No wonder that, right from the beginning, there was genuine Swabian life and gaiety. This was made the easier as the committee, profiting by its previous experiences, took every possible care that this year's Cannstatter Folksfest should by no means be inferior to its most celebrated predecessors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The entertainment was especially interesting and varied, and there is no need to mention the fact that the guests had plenty to eat and drink, for this is true at every Swabian picnic.</p>
   <p>The Stuttgart Hofkeller, displaying as its emblem a "fruit pole" with various fruits of the orchard, garden, and field, most artistically arranged, was the greatest point of attraction for the guests who know the value of a glass of good wine or of the more homely "Schorle-Morle". Other bars specialized in beer or in nonalcoholic beverages, so that all tastes were provided for.</p>
   <p>The kitchens had everything which a Swabian considers appetizing; indeed, the food would not be rejected by other countrymen from the old fatherland. Only some "Goaga" (natives of Tuebingen) seemed to miss their Swabian onion cake, and they took to consuming such enormous quantities of sauerkraut and beef that even the most modest bite of onion cake could not have found room in their "manger," had they succeeded in finding it somewhere.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The main attraction of the afternoon was a festival show performed by children. The arrangement was that of the Swabian Verein, with all its recitations and decorations (in word and picture), and was played under the experienced direction of Ellen Burckhardt-Schmidt. It was a huge success.</p>
   <p>The play consisted of eight tableaux, preceded by a meaningful prologue and brought to a sympathetic close by the singing of "Meiner Eltern Lied," which was composed especially for the occasion by Julius Schmidt.</p>
   <p>The tableaux symbolized, in chronological sequence the annual masked ball of the Schwaben Verein, its celebration of Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays, the Fourth of July, the Cannstatter Folksfest, the Schiller anniversary in conjunction with Goethe's memorial, and a tribute to mothers and wives (this, however, is not yet on the festival calendar of the club, but may be in the future because of this tableaux). The performance closes with the Christmas celebration, for which the Schwaben Verein prepares with special care and generosity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The individual groups of the boys and girls in the performance had costumes to suit their roles, and played their parts quite thoroughly..... [A list of the children in the performance is omitted in the translation.]</p>
   <p>Especially charming and refreshing were a few additional songs and dances. Gertrude Thinger played the piano accompaniment. Ruth Lumpp was excellent for a beginner.</p>
   <p>To commemorate the one-hundred-and-seventy-fifth anniversary of Schiller's birthday "Wallenstein's Lager" was staged, under the direction of Curt Benisch, who was assisted by Lucie Westen and other noted artists, as well as by the Schwaebische Saengerbund (Swabian Singers' Association).</p>
   <p>The spectators who witnessed the performance agreed that this presentation was the best ever given in this field at a Chicago Schwabenfest. What that implies, all those will know who have attended past stage shows.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>They will well remember that, in this respect, the Schwaben Verein always has been highly regarded.</p>
   <p>One would hardly go amiss in the assumption that yesterday's staging of "Wallenstein's Lager" made such a favorable impression upon the audience that a large number of those present will visit and enjoy the Schwabenfest again today. Those who did not see it yesterday should not miss today's performance. Good playing and good singing prevail throughout, and no one will regret having attended the theatrical performances of this year's Cannstatter Folk-fest. [Names of performers have been omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Between the performances of the afternoon and evening a brief address was made on the stage of the festival theater near the "fruit pole". It was made by F. W. Brummel, member of the tax-reviewing office, who, representing Mayor Edward J. Kelley, expressed the welcome and greetings sent by the head of the city.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Mayor Kelly had wired the Verein that his absence from the city made it impossible for him to attend the Schwabenfest. At the same time he sent his best wishes to the festival and hoped it would have a splendid success. He used to attend all such affairs of the Schwaben Verein.</p>
   <p>Speaking first in English and then in German, Mr. Brummel urged his audience to cultivate harmony among German-Americans, so that they would again play the same role in the public life of the city, the state, and the land as before the war--a role to which they are entitled by nature and by right. To give emphasis to his statement, the speaker named a number of German-Americans who occupy important positions in the public life of Chicago and Cook County. They administer these public offices in such a manner as to bring honor to their German fellow citizens.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brummel's words were repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause. At the end, he was given an ovation which was sufficient proof that his words had fallen upon receptive ears.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Mr. Brummel was introduced by the vice-president of the Verein, Wilhelm Reichelt. Subsequently, the floor was given by President Julius Klein to Mr. Gustav A. Brand, president of the German Day Organization, who made a forceful appeal to his audience to come to this year's celebration of German Day, which will take place at the Chicago Stadium on Sunday, September 16.</p>
   <p>Following this, the German song came into its rights, as was to be expected at a Schwabenfest. It was the Schwaebische Saengerbund which discharged this duty, under the leadership of its director, H. A. Rehberg, in such a manner that it won enthusiastic applause. The Verein sang "Des Waldes Morgangruss," by Wensel; the folk song "Im Schoensten Wiesengrunde," "Der Lustige Peter," by Paul von der Beck; Silcher's dance, "Bin i net a Buerschle," and one more folk song "Nun ade du mein liebes Heimatland". They gave splendid proof of their singing ability.</p>
   <p>The well-known magician, H. Roethig, added to the entertainment by a number <span class="page-break">\9</span>of tricks, which he performed with astounding agility, to the wonderment and general amusement of his public.</p>
   <p>Among the especially welcome guests present were delegates from the Swabian societies of Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis, South Bend, Benton Harbor, and Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>The German Consul general, Dr. R. Jaeger, together with his staff of officers, were absent because of the official six weeks' mourning for the deceased President of the Reich, Paul von Hindenburg.</p>
   <p>The customary festival processions did not fail to make an impression. They afforded an occasion for all to admire the becoming Swabian folk costumes which, of course, is the easier to do when pretty "Schwoaba maedle" are in them.</p>
   <p>The greatest activity could be observed in the dance hall. It was continually <span class="page-break">\10</span>filled, so that, at times, dancing was no longer the pleasure it was supposed to be.</p>
