   <p>Next Wednesday, October 17th, the Chicago Singverein will open its twenty-fifth season in the hall of St. Paul's Church, corner Orchard Street and Kemper Place. The director, Herr Walter M. Steindel, will submit his plans for the coming year at that time.</p>
   <p>Ladies endowed with voices, also gentlemen who would like to take part in the silver anniversary, are cordially invited to be present that evening, as performance of a great work is contemplated. The club, as is known, can look back with satisfaction to its past, for in the twenty-four years of its existence it has accomplished a great deal.
