   <p>The Evening-Entertainment, which the National Turaverein gave last night at the Apollo Hall, was a remarkable and successful affair. The young music-band of this Tarnverein surprised the audience by its high achievements. Also the duet: "Ich fuchle Deinen Odem" (I Neel Your Breath), sung by Mrs. L. Roos and Mr. C. L. Peehler, deserves particular praise.</p>
   <p>The two comedies following "Die Beiden Bauern, oder der Kuckuk" (The Two Peasants or the Cuckoo) and "Die Zerstreuten" (The Distracted), showed Messrs. A. Roos, P. Finster and C. A. Poehler as fine actors. The program wound up with a few musical recitals of Miss Schorr (Schorr), Miss Klussmann and Miss Krueger, Which were warmly applauded by the audience. A well arranged dance kept the young folks together until late in the night.</p>
