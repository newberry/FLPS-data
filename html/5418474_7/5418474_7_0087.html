   <p>The Birch-Pfeiffer plays do not exact a great deal of the actors. Whereas the conceptions of the truly great dramatists gradually weave the development of two lives into a definite entity, the Birch-Pfeiffer and kindred creations are not based upon the innate sentiments; they are strictly a product of intelligence, and one hears merely the manufactured wit and spirit of the author, who is quite comatose to the artist's part and provides sympathy, humor, and whatever is needed on the spur of the moment, all in conformity with the changing situations in his composition. Thus, in "Village and City," the characters are strict portrayals of Birch-Pfeiffer's joviality. The artists who play the various roles must, by necessity, relinquish their calling as "impersonators" and become "rhetorical exponents" only. One might say that the mimical abilities, the actors' virtues, become a negative force, while the elegant, leisurely graceful play asserts itself, the casual movements of the body serving only as a slight accentuation of the speech, which <span class="page-break">\2</span>preponderates.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's performance was given under auspicious conditions. The Stars augured well. The scenes in which the village spirit came to the fore, were the most successful. The action revolves around "Lorle," the attractive, spick-and-span daughter of an uncouth innkeeper; who, following the dictates of her heart, marries the man of her choice. As the wife of "Reinhard," renowned painter of pulchrous society damsels, she finds hersef decidedly neglected. Miss Schoenfeld played the part effectively, sympathetically, and in an ingratiating manner. The comely scene wherein she naively and quite unabashed gives well-meant and good advice to the serene aristocrat, to the consternation of her artist-husband, was profoundly effective and created convulsive laughter. The Swabian dialect was fairly good, although not as natural and convincing as Mr. Hansen's fluent speech. He presented a splendid impersonation of human qualities. The externally anstere but secretly generous and amazingly good innkeeper, proved a most delectable figure. Miss Niemann reveled in a part that appeared to be made to order <span class="page-break">\3</span>for her, -"Aunt Baerble," - who functions as a maternal substitute and bemothers "Lorle." Occasionally humorous and contrastingly affectionate, the actress always gave the proper potions, refraining from any undue exaggeration; she fully controlled her former inclination to overemphasize and therefore deserves particular approbation. Mr. Sternau, as the timid, unsuccessful suitor, played the small part satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>The other artists, in their parts as city dwellers, did not quite reach their colleague's lofty eminence. Mr. Danner's "Painter Reinhard" was somewhat flat, and his status declined considerably towards the end. He was at his best in the first act, where his fervent vivacity asserted itself in manner and speech; a truly perfect rendition. His conception in the first and second acts was appropriate, but later it might have been better if he had refrained from wearing somber black incessantly. Mr. Ludwig, in his role of "The not entirely impartial friend of the artist and advisory committee of one," was not very imposing. However, Miss Walden played the aristocratic "Ida von Felseck" in her usual capable manner. The stage management, under Mr. Danner, was satisfactory <span class="page-break">\4</span>in the main. However, - a mere trifle, - we like to remind him that when a gentleman leaves a parlor, he not only bows to the lady with whom he conversed, but he gives a respectful salute to others present in the room, particularly ladies. Furthermore, it is not customary to leave precipitously; instead, at the threshold, a man turns about once more and gives a general nod to include all. This rule of social behavior has been often overlooked of late.</p>
   <p>The performance was given under the auspices of the Teutonic Sons of America. The house was well filled, especially the galleries.</p>
