   <p>Section 28 of the Mutual Aid Society held its Christmas celebration in the large hall of the Lincoln Turnhalle yesterday. It was a very successful affair, and many were present.</p>
   <p>The program was quite jolly, and the program numbers were received with much applause. Dorothy Herz, six years old, entertained with a dancing performance. A great hit was made by Erhard Weiss and his son, who gave a zither duet.</p>
   <p>Then followed the honoring of members who have belonged to the organization for twenty-five years or longer. They were: Julius Klein, Walter Schmidt, Wilhelm Maurer, G. J. Werner, John Jossi, Paul Hartwig, Fred F. Huebner, John Marx, Josef Loeffler, Otto Schumann, Georg Zeitler, A. H. Habich, Edward Groh, and Leonhard Dasing. In honor of the jubilants, members of the Swabian Singing Bund and of the singing section of the G.U.V. sang "Das ist der Tag des Herrn."</p>
   <p>The main attraction of the program was the staging of a Christmas play "Der Streit der Monata" (competition among the months). The performers were fourteen children of members of the section. The author and member, Erhard Weiss, handled all rehearsals and supervised the stage decorations, as well as the performance itself. The youthful artists performed their parts excellently and the play received enthusiastic applause. The children, as well as the author, thanked the audience for the stormy ovations they received.</p>
   <p>The distribution of gifts to all the children was then taken over by St. Nicholas, one of the members, Jacob Jauch, who portrayed him in the customary manner. When the program was finished, a gay orchestra played for dancing, at which young and old found ample entertainment for many hours.</p>
   
   <p>The management of the highly successful festival was in the hands of the well-known president of long standing, Charles Klein.</p>
   <p>The committee was composed of the following members: Otto Schumann, Eugen Oeschler, Hans Thiemecke, and Alfred Behnke.</p>
