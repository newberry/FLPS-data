   <p>From all sides the complaints are being made that the socalled legitimate theater suffers severely from the competition of the movies. It is therefore unavoidable that the German theater also suffers at the same time. But this should be no reason for our German speaking population to neglect the theater, because it is extremely important and pleasant for them to own a place in which the German language and art is fostered and cultivated, and the German theater is the only place of this kind for the German speaking people. The movies certainly cannot possibly be considered a substitute for it. In this country it is quite customary to speak with contempt of the German theater.... There is no reason to oppose the sincere and artistical endeavors of an acknowledged and excellent theater company. The previous as well as the present performance of the local German theater can be favorably compared, in the opinion of the critics and the public, with the performance of a good German city theater, indeed one can expect more.</p>
   <p>Rudolph Back, the present director, relinquished the management, because of doubt of his ability to fulfill the duties, which would later arise. That of course does not indicate that the fate of the artists is sealed. The actors who were so successful under his direction have decided to keep up the theater although considerable expense is connected with this; therefore, their efforts should be rewarded <span class="page-break">2</span>in united and energetic support by all German speaking people.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the local gymnastic societies started an action for help to support the German Theater. This is indeed worthy of recognition, but we know from experience that it takes considerable time before such actions show results. Meanwhile every one can contribute towards the support of the theater by attending the performances and persuading his friends to attend also. The attendance of the performances produces the best and most effective action for help and if the German people should do their duty in this respect than the maintenance of the German Theater is assured.</p>
