   <p>The evening entertainment of the club "Vorwarts", which was held yesterday evening in the Saxonia Hall, 120 N. Wells Street, was well attended. A very happy mood prevailed. The abundant program amused the audience, which in turn produced songs, cheerful and serious declamations, and dances.</p>
   <p>Especially the well studied duets of Messrs. Altherr and Neebe were acclaimed. Comrade Grottkau made upon request of the comrades, a short, well received speech, and so even to those who did not dance, something enjoyable was of-fered.- The Hall was tastefully decorated by one of the members, with allegorical pictures. The beer was excellent and they drank and danced continuously.</p>
   <p>By the time we went to press, the crowd was still dancing to the tune of the Melody "Vorwarts."</p>
