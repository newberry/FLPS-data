   <p>Dear Sir: The Germania Male Choir having resolved to participate at the singing festival in Peoria on June 21, 22 and 23 it has become necessary to collect means, so that the Club will appear in Peoria worthy of its name. We have therefore decided to give a big concert in connection with a theatre representation and subsequent ball in the North Side Turn Hall. The Turn Hall has been rented for Sunday, June 11, and the participation of first rate artists both in the, theatre and in the concert has been assured. In order to draw up a definite program a meeting of all committee members has been set for Monday May 13 at 5 P:M, and you are hereby invited to be present at it (in the back room of the restaurant of H. Kenkel, 85 Dearborn Street).</p>
