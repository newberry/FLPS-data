   <p>"The Germania Mannerchor"(Germania Men's Chorus) held yesterday evening, in its clubhouse, in honor of its President of many years, Judge Theodore Brentano, a solemn festival-banquet, at which over one hundred persons took part. Speeches were made by Messrs. Otto C. Schneider, Harry Rubens, Consul Dr. Bunz, Joseph Brucker, A. G. Trude and Ex-Judge Prendergast, all of when praised the characteristic qualities of the celebrants.</p>
   <p>The speech, in returning thanks, culminated in enthusiastic cheers, for the Germania Men's Choir, which at all times should be a model to the later growth of German-Americans of the young giant city.</p>
   <p>In the name of the club, Mr. Harry Rubens presented to the guest of honor a beautifully bound album, in which in splendid caligraphic execution, the following resolution of thanks was inscribed:</p>
   <p>"The General-meeting of the Germania Men's Chorus herewith expresses <span class="page-break">2</span>its thanks to the retiring President, Mr. Theodore Brentano, for his diligent, considerate, and sacrificing conduct of the society's affairs, during the last three years. Under difficult and discouraging conditions, he has, with powerful hands conducted the clubs-ship over dangerous crags. In times of general financial crisis, and business exigencies, he has saved the funds of the club and even increased it, and at the same time, he has given consideration to every just request of the members. Supported by his amiable wife, the artistic part of the society's activity, was promoted in every way, and at the end of a three years troubled period of Chicago's history, the club still stands proud and virile at the head of the German Sociable societies.</p>
