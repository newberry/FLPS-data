   <p>To answer once and for all the rumors that German-Americans are paying no attention to the World's Fair, Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, the chairman of the World's Fair committee of the German group, has made a statement, the following part of which should be repeated:</p>
   <p>"The German Government states that it is unfortunately not in a position to participate officially in the World's Fair. This, however, does not prevent German-Americans from taking an active part in the Fair. For four years a committee under the direction of Ernest J. Kruetgen has been working to show those of different origins what the Germans have accomplished in the fields of science, commerce and industry, art, music, and literature.</p>
   <p>"The committee hopes that within a few days it will be able to publish an <span class="page-break">2</span>announcement which will be of general interest. I refer to the opening of our own building.</p>
   <p>"Because of the economic depression the committee had to proceed cautiously. The difficulties of raising money seem to have been overcome. This task is being accomplished. We have been receiving the best of support from all sides. We expect that the German as well as the American press will print this good news as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>"The plan is to be completed in the same form as was outlined by the committee as early as 1928. Naturally the latest developments will be taken into account.</p>
   <p>"It is our intention, for example, to open a restaurant which is to be exactly like those which enjoy such popularity in the old country, a restaurant with all the trimmings [Translator's note: The literal is "with all the tricks".]</p>
   <p>"German Day, on August 13, will be the high point of the arrangements made by <span class="page-break">3</span>the German-Americans. The festival will be under the direction of Bernard DeVry.</p>
   <p>"In the building ladies will be in charge, the members of the ladies' section of the World's Fair group, under the leadership of Miss Marie Becker and Mrs. Emil Eitel.</p>
   <p>"Furthermore, there will be in the building an information office which may be used without cost by all of German descent. Exhaustive information will be available, not only about the World's Fair, but also about Chicago.</p>
   <p>"It has been proposed that the German House be called 'Das Haus Willkommen' (The House of Welcome). This will be decided later, however.</p>
   <p>"Everything is planned so that only the bare expenses will be covered. If there should be a surplus, it is to be distributed to the various charitable organizations."....</p>
