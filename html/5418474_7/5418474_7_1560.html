   <p>On occasion of the celebration of its 32nd Anniversary, the Germania Maennerchor was presented by its member, John A. Weiss, with a portrait of the deceased former Vice-Governor, Gustav Koerner. This excellent picture was painted by Mr. Hermann von Michalowski. Mr. Weiss gave, in his presentation speech, a short sketch of the life history of Koerner, who participated at the famous "storming of the city guard house in Frankfort", and then had retired to the American hinterland to do his share in the cultural task of the pioneers.</p>
   <p>In his speech of acceptance President Schneider valued the importance due to Koerner's merit, and the same was done by the official orator of the evening, Mr. George E. Adams, who, as an expert American politician, used the opportunity to give the Germans in general the customary compliments.</p>
