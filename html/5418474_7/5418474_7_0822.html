   <p>The second annual commemoration day of the Chicago Concertina Club was held yesterday at the Lincoln Athletic Club. The net profit will be turned over to the director of the club, Mr. R. Kiesig. Because of this, we are glad to report that the affair was very well attended.</p>
   <p>A thunderous applause greeted Mr. Kiesig at his appearance. Greatly appreciated were the performances of the members of the club and also of the "Guitar Academy" and the "Lake View Men's Choir." These Clubs assisted the members in making the festival something which will be remembered by all for a long time to come.</p>
