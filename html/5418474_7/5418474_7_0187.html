   <p>"Sein Drittes" (His Third) or "America and Spandan" was played last Sunday in the Labor Hall, which had a moderately filled house. The performance pleased the audience. Particularly Miss Liebig, Messers Alvin, Roesecke, and Leist kept the audience laughing. Then followed the play, "Ein Zimmer mit 2 Better" (One Room with two Beds), which again gave an opportunity to Messrs Alvin and Roesecke to prove their ability as good actors.</p>
