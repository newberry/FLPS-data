   <p>Chicago celebrates its German day tomorrow. Originally these celebrations were given in memory of the arrival of the Krefeld Mennomites in America under the leadership of Franz Daniel Pastorius. In the course of years they have developed in many cities into big mutual festivals, celebrated by Americans of German descent, the same as in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The object and purpose of these celebrations consist in giving men and women of German descent an opportunity, at least once a year, to acknowledge publicly, and cheerfully that they are members of this race. Although they come from different parts of the big German Fatherland and although their opinions are divided, in regard to religion and politics, yet they are all children of Mother Germania. They all descend from one race, who can look back upon an honorable and glorious history; and on the German day celebration they remember and honor the great National Union of their ancestors. With speeches and songs they proclaim loudly and proudly, their everlasting gratitude for their descent from their German <span class="page-break">2</span>ancestors.</p>
   <p>At the same time they do not forget their love for the land of adoption in which they have found their new home. They are fully a ware of their duties to the new Fatherland, and renew their oaths of faith to the country of their choice, during the German day celebration. This faith does not consist in the surrender of all moral and spiritual gifts and possessions, which were bestowed upon them by Mother Germania, but in the cultivation of these endowments and talents, and their transmission to their fellow citizens, to the honor of the German name, to the enrichment and cultivation of our national life. In this sense the German day of Chicago is celebrated, therefore these festivals have always taken a brilliant course.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all fellow citizens of German descent to participate willingly and cheerfully at these festivals.</p>
