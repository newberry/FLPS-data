   <p>After the convention of the Baden Central Association of North America and had ended its session, last Friday evening, the delegates from the 14 cities assembled once more for a glorious festival, which was given by the Baden Aid Society of Chicago in collaboration with the Baden Song Club.</p>
   <p>An extensive program was provided, commencing at 8. The goal was Oswald's Grove. The singers met at their club, 69 Larrabee Street, where the parade started with military precision, led by a marshal and adjutants, followed in order by a division of Hanau equestrians, a music corps, the United States and Baden flags displayed in an open cab, representatives of Baden in authentic costumes, riding in open coaches, out-of-town officials and delegates of the Baden Central Association, and other guests and club members in coaches...</p>
   <p>The parade of the Baden Aid Society started from the headquarters, 2701 Went-worth Avenue, at 11... Participation was good and the arrangements were a credit to the efforts of the committee.</p>
   <p>Upon arrival at the grove dinner was served, and at 3 o'clock the program commenced. The singers gave suitable selections, and Mr. C. Eichin made the <span class="page-break">\2</span>welcoming speech. This was followed by the theatrical play "Ritter Von Rodenstein" (Knight of Rodenstein).</p>
   <p>It was indeed a pleasure to behold these virile, tall figures in their native garb and listen to the sonorous voices which brought a gain the familiar folk songs of yore to our memory. "Das Lied Vom Rodenstein" was sung by the chorus, grouped on a small stage, the background showing the castle of Heidelberg. (Explanatory: The Rodenstein burg is a famous ruin near Reichelsheim, Germany.)</p>
   <p>The rest of the day was spent in dancing and genial conversation...</p>
