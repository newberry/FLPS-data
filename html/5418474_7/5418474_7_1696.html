   <p>The second day of the great fete passed in the same jovial and delightful way. Although there were not quite as many visitors as on the previous day, the agreeable and pleasant mood was not lacking.</p>
   <p>Dancing, concerts, plays, games, stage performances, pictures, fireworks furnished splendid and abundant entertainment.</p>
   <p>The marvelous skilled pantomimic-scenic plays from the masterpieces of our great poets were one of the cardinal attractions. The teachers as well as the children received enthusiastic, well earned applause. All stage deocoratiens were planned and executed by that able artist, Mr. A. Steidle.</p>
   <p>Obviously the funds for the "Goethe" Monument will be swelled by about $1000.00 presenting the cash-balance from this festival.</p>
