   <p>The Hamburg Club held last night its Christmas celebration at Uhlich's Hall. A large, bright, wonderfully illuminated Christmas tree, ornamental garlands and flags gave the Hall the appearance of a fairy jewel box. The Orchestra started the program with a few good old German musicpieces. Then Santa Claus, represented by Mr. W. Detloff, made his appearance and enjoyed a cheering crowd of children with presents and candy.</p>
   <p>Several solo songs and musical selections followed. Also Mr. Detloff gave a speech in Flatt Dutch (dialect) which amused the audience enormously. A lively dance wound up tje entertainment, which was managed by Messrs. F. Lindemann, Ernest Steinhoff and H. Neumann.</p>
