   <p>The very popular play, "Shoemaker Pluster" (Schuster Pluster), was given last night at the Labor Hall and pleased the audience exceedingly. The main casts were filled by Messrs Alvin, Roesecks, Friedlander and Siepel and furthermore by Misses Rossi, Deisner and Emma Kraus. The performance had a full house and was again a success for the direction of this well-managed theatre.</p>
