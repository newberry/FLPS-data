   <p>In conjunction with its regular meeting last Wednesday, the Lake View Ladies' Club celebrated its fortieth anniversary in a seemly manner at Immel's Hall.</p>
   <p>The members appeared in large numbers, and a delicious birthday cake with forty candles adorned the table which was otherwise festively decorated, good coffee and cake, an address by the president, Frau Zoch, humorous recitations by Frau Mau, the secretary-treasurer, and Frau Winter, social games, and a little dancing, all made the hours vanish as if by flight.</p>
