   <p>"We, the members of the Sozialer Turnverein, declare herewith that the article, published by a malevolent reporter of the Chicago Press Association about the pageant of the Turner-festival, is a tissue of lies and of malicious distortions. We protest mainly against the assertion: That during the final historical tableau of the pageant the flag of the United States was trampled upon.</p>
   <p>"The tableau mentioned represented an allegorical representation of the French revolution in connection with the present social conditions and not as claims the press - "The Triumph of Anarchism."</p>
   <p>"We furthermore declare that during the performance of this historic picture, no United States flag was used at all and that to insult the flag of our country would constitute a violation of our own principles as turners and as citizens, as it is the duty of every member of the Nord Amerikanische Turnerbund to be a citizen of the United States.</p>
   <p>"We declare in answer to the malicious lies of the scoundrels from the press <span class="page-break">\2</span>that we are ready at any time to prove the truth of our statement through the testimony of hundreds of witnesses."</p>
