   <p>The Mozart Manner Chor gave yesterday at Miehle's Hall an evening entertainment, to which every member of the Choir contributed his best. The full house proved the popularity of the Manner Chor. Particular praise must be given to Mr. Suess for his song: "S' ist Fryehlingszeit" (It is Springtime). Mr. Suess has a wonderful voice, and it is to be regretted that he seemingly has no opportunity, to use his God given voice towards an opera career.</p>
   <p>All arrangements of the successful evening were managed by Messrs. Suess, Schweiber, Rudolph, Rosenberger and Heidenberg.</p>
