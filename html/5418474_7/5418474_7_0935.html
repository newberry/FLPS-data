   <p>In Uhlichs Hall to-night the first concert of the Typographic Men's Chorus takes place. This young and active club has done all that was possible to make its first public appearance a large success. Greatest care has been taken with the instruction and studying of the Chorus and the numerous friends of the Club and the public in general will be surprised with the superb Choral voices of the individual singers. A dance will follow the concert, which we have no doubt will be very gay and pleasant. The following program will be played:</p>
