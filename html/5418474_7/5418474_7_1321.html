   <p>The Turner Society Eiche, in a dignified manner, dedicated its new home. After many a long and fruitless attempt and financial reverses, the society succeeded in erecting a new Turner hall, thereby putting a new leaf of honor into the history of its organization.</p>
   <p>Representatives of friendly societies, the Roseland Post No. 49 and the Chesterfield Post No.695 of the American Legion,were present. The commander of the Roseland Post raised the American flag amidst the sounds of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>bugles, as a token of respect and gratitude to the American people.</p>
   <p>The Festival Speeches</p>
   <p>The parade returned to headquarters where the singing division of the Turnverein Eiche, under the direction of E. Holl, sang, "This is the day of the Lord." After this, the president of the society, Robert Brieskorn, addressed the meeting. He referred briefly, to the changes undergone by the society during its forty-one years of existence. The next speaker was City Attorney A.M. Smietanka, representative of Mayor Cermak. He expressed the Mayor's inability to be present.
