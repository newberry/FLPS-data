   <p>William Hale Thompson, our fighting Mayor, was the guest of honor at the German Theatre, yesterday afternoon. Of course, the Mayor does not master the German language perfectly, but nevertheless, his knowledge is sufficient to enable him to follow the proceedings on the stage with interest and understanding. Mayor Thompson greatly enjoyed himself. No points of the dialogue, no comical situations escaped him. Again and again, he burst out in laughter and rewarded the performances of the clever artists with loud applause. Asked by a representative of the Abendpost for his opinion and impression he answered as follows: "I am glad to have come, but still more glad that the German people of Chicago have their theater again. I am not afraid of provoking any opposition, because I have repeatedly expressed myself in regard to the German theater. During the war, German performances were given under my protection at the old Bush Temple; I have objected vigorously against the demands of fanatics to close the German theater." "Yes, I am glad to be here, and I am happy <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that the performance is so well attended; however I regret, not to be able to understand the German language better so that I could appreciate the performance to its fullest extent. But I have noticed that Mr. Bach has quite an excellent company of artists."</p>
   <p>The appearance of the Mayor at the German theater was a surprise to the public; but it was not less surprising to learn that the Mayor took this opportunity to turn the theatrical performance into a political meeting.</p>
   <p>The Fight Aganist McAndrew</p>
   <p>The Mayor took advantage of the interval between the acts to explain his fight against the "British lion" and against school superintendent McAndrew. He pointed to the fact that it was the duty of a mayor to take oath on the constitution.</p>
   <p>"I have taken this oath, the Mayor declared, that during my term it will <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>never be taught in the public schools of Chicago that George Washington was a rebel."</p>
   <p>In connection with this speech, assistant State's attorney Charles Mueller submitted a resolution which read as follows: "We, Herewith, publicly express our acknowledgement to Mayor William Hale Thompson, for his efforts to have the names of heroes of the American history such as General v. Steuben, General Sigel, Carl Schurz, Pastor Michlenberg etc., reinstated again in the text books of the public schools of Chicago.</p>
