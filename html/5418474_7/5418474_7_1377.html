   <p>Today is "German Day" at the Women's World's Fair in the Coliseum. At 8:30 this evening, the ladies' committee, under the personal leadership of Mrs. Consul General Simon, will present a program of Brahms songs, sung by Mrs. Schlewil; some dance numbers by the Ollendorf sisters and a rendition of Bruch's "The Bell" by the Chicago Singing Society, under the direction of Mr. Boeppler.</p>
   <p>Many products of German handicraft will be displayed. All these delightful trifles were produced by women's hands, and at the sight of some of the articles, we ask ourselves in surprise: "How is it possible that women in their homes without mechanical workshops, can produce such beautiful ornaments?"</p>
   <p>These knick-knacks are in demand among the large crowd of American housewives. They admire the handmade dolls, with their stupid peasant faces. The Americans who are used to manufactured goods, cannot believe that even socks, shoes, and panties can be made by hand.</p>
   <p>Dolls, books, painted wall ornaments, vases, leather boxes, embroidery, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>jewelry and German ornaments, every little piece has its own individuality. Everything has been produced by German handicraft. The originality of the German products has been clearly demonstrated.</p>
   <p>The glassware of a M. von Alesch, the bookbindery of Maria Luhr, the jewelry of Emmy Roth, the costume dolls of Betty Behrens, the porcelain of Ruth Schaumann, the embroidery of Jessie Hosel, the animals of Resi Brandt, the toys and children's books of Else Eisgruber, the pottery of Mrs. Hammasch and Mrs. Lobenstein, and the weaving of Mrs. Wedekind-Ottolarglin, - these all are true examples of German works of culture.</p>
