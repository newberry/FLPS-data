   <p>A very gay and real gymnastic affair was the May festival, Saturday night in the Gymnastic Hall, corner of Belmont Avenue and Paulina Street, given by the Social Gymnastic Club for the benefit of the participant gymnastic club of St. Paul. The entertainment started somewhat late as most members and friends had to come from outside Chicago but the time was well occupied in agreeable discussions and beer drinking. The main entertainment was presented by the performance of the 2nd act comedy. "The Golden Cross". The principal roles were enacted by Ernest Manser, Joseph Waneck, Dr. Theo Boll and Kramer and the ladies, Mary Boll and Hermine Waneck. The play was very good and well appreciated. After that an auction was held for a large May-bowl of which was eagerly drunk.</p>
   <p>A dance finished the gay entertainment. The arrangement committee consisting of Mr. George Marchmert, Hermann Tepe, George Kruse, Thomas Clausien, Chat Twin and Otto Schmoll has every cause to be satisfied with the success of the festival.</p>
