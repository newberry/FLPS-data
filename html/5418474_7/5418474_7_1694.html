   <p>The Annual festival and ball of the "Jolly Fellows", held last Saturdey at Miller's Hall, proceeded in a beautiful and jolly way. The attendance was very numerous. But most important of all every jolly "brother" and "sister" was determined to amuse himself or herself and others also in the most jolly and harmless way.</p>
   <p>That they succeeded in doing so is proven by the fact that the jolly crowd parted late the next morning.</p>
