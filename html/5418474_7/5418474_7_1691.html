   <p>The German-Austrian Verein Uindebona had its annual Hauern Ball (Peasant-dance) at the Union Hall, 70 N. Clark Street, last Saturday night. The occasion was a real peasant festival and started with a parade of German, Austrian and Hungarian groups in colorful costumes through the large Hall to the tunes of homeland melodies. Then followed the real dance, which was well arranged and showed besides the latest modern dances a lot of oldtime rural dancing. The dance-intermissions were filled with jolly song-solos and comical speeches. The orchestra was playing almost continuously and deserves particular praise for its first class music.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to recollect all happy and enjoyable incidents of this festival, which lasted until late in the night.</p>
