   <p>The venerable Chicago German element does not seem to realize that its apparent lack of interest is again making the existence of the German Theater precarious. Judging by the heavy attendance at the opening performance a fortnight ago, it was to be hoped that the period of insecurity for the theater had definitely passed. But this was apparently only a delusion. The performances in the Bush Temple Theatre are usually so poorly attended that one gets the impression that Chicago actually has no need for the German stage. It seems useless to look for a reason for this strange phenomenon. The quality of the performances certainly cannot be the reason for the empty auditorium; they are as satisfactory as can reasonably be expected. The competent director of the Bush Temple has gained the well-deserved confidence of art lovers during his stay here, and he has put forth almost superhuman efforts to make the theater successful and prosperous. The past performances of the present season show that in spite of all previous disappointments he has resolutely carried on his work, <span class="page-break">2</span>supported by the best efforts of his ensemble. The performers certainly could not be blamed if the Chicago Germans should lose their theater, which, as the only one of its kind, has withstood all the war years.</p>
   <p>Apparently the reasons for public indifference toward the German stage must be found some place else. It is possible that the abnormally hot weather last week had something to do with it. For if the heat is unbearable even in the open, one does not feel like sitting in a theater, although the "movies" are usually crowded each night, even during the hottest weather. The "movies," by the way! Could they have anything to do with the poor attendance at the Bush Temple? The German is sometimes thrifty when it comes to paying a relatively high price for an intellectual pleasure. Not that the admission fee to the German theater is too high! On the contrary, it is quite reasonable for what is offered there. It is true, however, that a man can take his entire family to the "movies" for the price of one seat in the "legitimate" theatre. In addition to that, there are neighborhood shows which are located near enough their homes for the families to save the cost of transportation. <span class="page-break">3</span>People have become lazy in this day and age, and it is quite possible that in many cases laziness and a desire to economize have weakened the German spirit of loyalty.</p>
   <p>Almost everyone is amazed at the poor attendance at the German theater; but with most of them that is as far as it goes. Everyone agrees that German art should be given better support, and that the German theater should be attended more often. But strangely enough, "everyone" invariably means the other fellow; one never includes himself. An alibi is always available for oneself. We find it inexcusable that others don't do their share, but as for ourselves--why, that's a different story altogether. Since many of us reason in this manner, the theater remains empty.</p>
   <p>It is about time our Germans take stock of themselves and overcome their inertia, instead of continually searching for excuses. The theater is dependent on a large attendance to continue its existence. The local German element should consider it to their own best interest to help promote and <span class="page-break">4</span>maintain their theatre. Tonight there is to be an informal discussion at the theatre on the question of increasing the attendance. All friends of the German stage should be present.</p>
