   <p>Yesterday's concert of the Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra, in the North Side Turner Hall was a musical treat. The violin concerto in E minor, by Walter Hancock, the concert master of the orchestra, was brilliantly played. But the orchestra and its conductor, Richard Czerwonky, should not be forgotten, because it was, as usual, excellent.</p>
   <p>The beautiful "Military March," by Schubert, started the concert; this was followed by Schubert's "Unfinished Symphony." Loud applause greeted Walter Hancock, when he took Czerwonky's place. He proved anew his talent, his art, practically amounting to virtuosity. Among other numbers he played a serenade by Czerwonky. Czerwonky himself, played the accompaniment on the piano. It was somewhat difficult, after all those soft melodies, to get used to Wagner's bulky music, when the orchestra intoned, the introduction to Act III of "Lohengrin," and played after that the famous "Bridal Chorus."</p>

   <p>The second part of the program consisted of lighter music. The melancholy "Andante Cantabile" by Tschaikowsky, was played by the string section. The last part consisted of the overture from "Beautiful Galathea" by F. von Suppe, "Molly on the Shore" by Grainger, and the "Theresen Waltz" from "Faust." The march, "True to the Flag" ended the concert, which was a success, in every respect.</p>
