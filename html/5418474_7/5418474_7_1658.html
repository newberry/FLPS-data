   <p>The German day has the double purpose of honoring the German Exhibitors, who brought great sacrifices to insure the success of the World's Fair, and to give an idea to the assembled representatives of the whole earth, of the power and greatness of the Chicago Germans.</p>
   <p>Both can only be attained, through a complete participation of all the Germans in the procession and in the festivities which will take place in the Exposition Grounds- To make a full participation possible, it is imperative, that the German but business world manufacturers, merchants and master workmen, close their stores and factories and grant their employees a free day; German-American parents should have their children excused, and in this way make it possible for their teachers to obtain a holiday.- The more powerfully the Germans of Chicago will appear on German Day, the more successful their efforts for the moral and commercial interests of the Germans are going to be.</p>
