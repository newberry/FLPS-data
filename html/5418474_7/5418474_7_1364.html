   <p>At the last meeting of the German groups for the World's Exhibition in the Bismarck Hotel, a resolution was accepted which recommends the co-operation of all German-American Clubs and organizations with the German Club for the Karl Schurz celebration. It was repeatedly pointed out that the impression of a large united celebration in memory of Karl Schurz would be far better than many small individual club celebrations.</p>
   <p>The German Club who for a year has already made preparations for a Karl Schurz celebration at the Morrison Hotel, invites all organizations to co-operate with it. Every organization who participates in the Karl Schurz celebration shall be named as a co-operating organizer of the celebration, just like the German Club, therefore each shall get its reward. The German club succeeded in obtaining Charles Nagel of St. Louis as official speaker.</p>
