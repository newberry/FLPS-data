   <p>Last Saturday evening, the comedy, "The Runaway Wives," was presented at the Schiller Theatre.</p>
   <p>The material with which the director and the cast had to deal was mighty poor. In fact, the comedy was more a copy of America's "Old Toms" or "Old Joes."</p>
   <p>Likewise, the music was bad. Surprising that the music director would ask capable musicians to play such silly pieces. The composition was simply very poor.</p>
