   <p>About 25,000 persons went to Brand's Park yesterday to participate in the celebration of the Swabian 33rd Cannstatter national festival. This is proof, that the most excellent of all national festivals has not lost its power of attraction.</p>
   <p>A Swabian could not forgive himself to neglect this great feast. It reminds him, more than anything else, of his beautiful homeland. Friends and acquaintances meet again, who perhaps otherwise have no opportunity. Here they renew their friendship. The "South-German" is certain to meet some of his country folks, and the "North-German" can always amuse himself brilliantly among them. In the large and shady park prevails nothing but cheerfulness and happiness. Everywhere one sees people dolled up for the occasion; everywhere one hears loud laughter. Glee Clubs rendered some of their best numbers. A music band played all variety of dances, which fascinated young and old. Children shouted; others enjoyed the imported German wine.</p>
   <p>Next to beer and wine it was the theater performances, that attracted most attention. During the afternoon the children played, "The feast of the troins", and evenings adults played; "The brave Taylor".</p>
   
   <p>All this exhausted, by no means the many things of interest. There was the "Punch and Judy" Show, amusing the children in particular. A group of acrobats presented the most astounding performances. There was a beautiful dance hall, well-prepared meals and refreshments and many were the entertainments and games. The festival will continue today and will be finished next Sunday.</p>
