   <p>The first family fest of the South Side Maennerchor, which took place last Saturday night in Bunzer's Hall, was a great success. Despite showers of rain that came down in the evening hours, the hall was filled to capacity. The goodly band of thirty-five well-trained singers first gave a taste of what they can do, with the song, "Horch, die alten Eichen rauschen," under the direction of Franz Beidel. It must be acknowledged that the voices in this new chorus are very good.</p>
   <p>Following an address by the singer Peter Gruen, the Vienna Trio gave a number of songs which were received with great applause. The prominent soloist, Willi Meier, gave proof of his talent with a few solos. He was warmly received. The truly German dance melodies which succeeded the real presentations kept the guests together until long after midnight. Kitchen and cellar were well cared for, and even the older folks, who are often pushed into the background at such affairs, received a good share of entertainment and dancing. <span class="page-break">\2</span>It was a really German family fest, and the organizers deserve full credit for the successful evening.</p>
