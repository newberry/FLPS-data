   <p>It would be silly to attribute to the German singers a special influence upon the weather, but it is remarkable that the two great singing organizations, the Vereinigte Saenger von Chicago (the United Singers of Chicago) and the Vereinigte Maennerchoere (United Male Choruses), had dry weather yesterday for their parties in the open. Accordingly, they had every reason to rejoice over the favor bestowed upon them by Jupiter Plurius, and to enjoy the weather by lingering long on the picnic grounds.</p>
   <p>In keeping with tradition, the Vereinigte Damenchoere (United Women's Choruses) and the Vereinigte Saenger met yesterday (Sunday) at the Luisenhain of the Old People's Home to observe the beginning of summer with a great singing festival. The day was a special one, not only for the members and friends of the two organizations, but also for the residents of the Home. The latter, as passive participants, mingled joyously with the gay people who were brought together, beneath the venerable trees of the picnic grounds, <span class="page-break">2</span>by their common love for German song and German customs. From the verandas of the Home, they listened to the German songs that were sung in their honor by the Vereinigte Damenchoere and by the Vereinigte Saenger under H. A. Rehberg.</p>
   <p>In the early morning hours, the participants began to arrive, some with, and some without, provisions, to spend the day in the open, in keeping with an old custom, and to while away the hours with games and entertainment of all kinds. The little ones were provided with a merry-go-round and a fortune wheel, and with an opportunity to play games and have a good time. A considerable number of older guests gathered around the well-known tanks, in the late afternoon and evening hours, to drink of the cool liquids that ran from them. Others found pleasure in dancing and in animated conversation with good old friends.</p>
   <p>Although the attendance was not up to expectations in the afternoon, the committees of the two organizations were relieved of this worry in the evening, <span class="page-break">3</span>when the sky brightened so that even the biggest doubter became confident of beautiful weather. The festival, conducted with old-fashioned harmony and gaiety, was also attended by a delegation of singers from the newly founded Aurora Maennerchor and by delegates of the German Day organization, who spread propaganda by word and picture in the interest of this year's German Day. John Conroy, clerk of the county court, and Alderman Terry Moran honored the singers with their attendance. The committee, which was active in bringing about the success of the party, was composed of officers of the United Ladies Choruses and of the United Singers. They were headed by their presidents, Mrs. Ida Huch and A. C. Wehrwein. Lady members of the committee were Mathilda Hager, Marie Schulze, Cecilie Bade, and Augusta Triphahn; gentlemen members were Artur Prommrich, Max Kirsch, Engelbert Leutner, Ernst Kuebel, and August Peitsch.</p>
   <p>Somewhat farther to the west and north, in Thatcher Woods, the organizations affiliated with the Vereinigte Maenerchoere held a family basket picnic last Sunday, at which a large crowd gathered. Almost all of the twenty-six affiliated <span class="page-break">4</span>organizations were represented. There was much life and activity in the pleasant picnic grounds, which are beautifully situated and which have comfortable benches on which to sit and enjoy nature, singing, and drinking.</p>
   <p>The large attendance at the festival gave proof of a common purpose which can weld together the singers of the Vereinigte Maennerchoere in perfect accord. Many a gay song was heard in the course of the afternoon and evening hours, which passed only too quickly for all visitors.</p>
   <p>Two of the men's choruses, the Schwaebische Saengerbund (Swabian Singers' Association) and the Excelsior Maennerchor, tried their strength in a game of baseball; there were incidents which made the audience laugh, and which were instrumental in furthering the good spirit that prevailed. The score of the game was close, as was to be expected. One of the players of the Excelsior team, whose swift legs carried him to a home run at the right time, made the victorious run, so that the game ended in a 21-20 score in favor of the Excelsior team. The teams will meet again in the near future as <span class="page-break">5</span>a sign that there is no enmity between them.</p>
   <p>Games and songs provided sufficient entertainment. It was a real pleasure to spend a day in the open with friends and acquaintances. The jollity lasted until dusk.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge consisted of: John Heidemann, president; Rudolph Faller, Carl Bernau, Robert Gill, Justus Emme, John W. Miller, A. G. Hambrock, Joe Keller, Theodor Pilgram, Karl Kraentzle, Hermann Loesicke, Wilhelm Thuering, Willi Stahl, Hermann Schneidewind, Henry Hieb, A. Glauche, Joe Giess, Kurt Reichel, Joe Reissner, Ferdinand Strenger, R. Steinweg, and A. Jessen.</p>
