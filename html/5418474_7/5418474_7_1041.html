   <p>The German Literary Association of the Chicago Atheneum gave a presentation yesterday in its building of "The Diplomat", by Scribe and Delavigne. The actors were Americans who had taken lessons in German. In a short time they have made much progress. Although their pronunciation betrayed several of them, their fluent expression was excellent. Mr. Ullmann and Miss Bushnell deserve special praise. This is the first attempt made by Americans and the results were most satisfactory. Special recognition is due to Mr. Groh, teacher of the German language who gave the impetus to this presentation.</p>
