   <p>A meeting which lasted from 8:30 last night until 1:30 this morning, and which was attended by one hundred and twenty-eight delegates, each of whom had the power to vote, is the best proof that at this meeting of the German Day organization something extraordinary took place. And this was the case, for yesterday the annual general convention and election of officers was held.</p>
   <p>Unanimously and by acclamation, Bernard De Vry was elected president of the organization. Just before the election the organization made a formal resolution to hold a German Day celebration next year as has been their custom in the past. Mr. de Vry received as his assistants a staff of officers who may be expected to devote their entire attention to the great cause, and to put aside all personal wishes to make the German Day of 1933--the year of the Worlds Fair--an imposing illustration of the union of all German elements.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the minutes of the last meeting, and after the usual business had been disposed of, the various officers submitted their annual reports.</p>
   <p>The first speech was made by, President Weideling. He began with a few introductory remarks about the course taken by this year's German Day, and about the work done by the committee on this and other occasions, such as the German reception. He continued as follows:</p>
   <p>"The speaker who spoke in English made an address of great interest concerning our first president, George Washington, and the wonderful services of General von Steuben and other Germans who at that time came to the aid of Washington and made possible the liberation of the thirteen states from the yoke of Britain.</p>
   <p>"The speaker who spoke in German discussed international conditions and politics, instead of holding to the line given him as a directive. It would have been his task to speak of the greatest poet of all times, Goethe, and the famous composer, Haydn, as this year's celebration of the German Day was, before all, meant to be in honor of the Father of the Republic and of those famous two German men.</p>
   <p>"To be the president of the German Day organization should be at once an honor and a joy. Instead, at the end of those meetings, I have often gone home with a heavy heart. The many frictions among the delegates, and, more important, the attempts to use the German Day for personal aims, were not only painful to the chairman, but damaging to the entire cause as well."</p>
   
   <p>Weideling's report was concluded with a number of recommendations, the most important of which was to keep politics out of the German Day celebrations, and to hold as ineligible for an office in the executive body of the German Day organization any person who seeks to obtain any political office.</p>
   <p>Then followed the reports of the other officers. They gave individual accounts of their activities during the past year, Some of them welcomed this opportunity to give vent to their emotions, and to become heated over those persons--within and without the committee--who on many occasions have failed to share their opinions, and who have even had the audacity to give expression to opinions of their own, and to act in accordance with their convictions.</p>
   <p>Secretary-Treasurer Gies and Treasurer Loesicke stated yesterday that they were still unable to submit a final report on the income and expenditure of the current German Day celebration. The responsibility for this situation must be placed on some few delegates and organizations who have not yet accounted for the admission tickets. There is hope that the money still unaccounted for will cover the amount of the few bills yet unpaid. But the treasurer hinted that a deficit of approximately two hundred and fifty dollars will have to be anticipated. The finance committee was instructed to have the final report ready for the next meeting of delegates.</p>
   <p>As Captain Weideling refused to be re-elected, and since a few other gentlemen declined the presidency offered them, Mr. De Vry, who was likewise among those reluctant to accept, was unanimously elected president. He expressed his thanks in a few well-chosen words, stressing the fact that he is glad to undertake this task, although it is by no means easy, and may even be regarded as thankless. He added that he is counting upon the full co-operation of all delegates and German organizations.</p>
   <p>The executive board for 1933 is now composed of the following: President, Bernard De Vry; first vice-president, Frank K. Waldherr; second vice-president, Mrs. Julia Gerts; third vice-president, Theodor Pilgram; fourth vice-president, Paul Wagner; corresponding secretary, Adolph Glauche; recording secretary, William Hellmer; secretary-treasurer, Joseph Gies; treasurer, Hermann Loesicke; finance committee, Adolph Gill, Anton Langhammer, and Georg H. Weideling; supervisor, William Huebner.</p>
   <p>The retiring president, Mr. Weideling, was, as is the custom, named honorary president.</p>
