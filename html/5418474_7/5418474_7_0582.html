   <p>Mr. Fritz Schollenberger, member of the Senefelder Liederkranz (Singing Circle), celebrated an event which does not occur every day, namely, his fiftieth anniversary as a singer in the Senefelder Liederkranz.</p>
   <p>He joined this society a year after his arrival in Chicago, and has belonged to the society uninterruptedly for half a century.</p>
   <p>The singing society, which the celebrant has faithfully served in various capacities, as registrar, financial secretary, and assistant conductor, did not overlook the opportunity to honor Mr. Schollenberger, who is one of its oldest members.</p>
   <p>At the society's entertainment last evening at the Swiss Clubhouse, Mr. Schollenberger was presented by the president of the Senefelder Liederkranz, Mr. Robert Schwane, with a gift in remembrance of his fiftieth year as a member. With words of thanks for his faithful co-operation, and hearty wishes for the future, Mr. Schwane presented him with a valuable cane, which was adorned with the golden emblem of the society and an appropriate inscription. After hearty words of thanks from Mr. Schollenberger, and songs by the society, the small but elevating celebration was ended. The participants in the entertainment stayed for a long time and joyously helped Mr. Schollenberger celebrate.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schollenberger was born in Wuerttemberg, Germany, and came to Chicago in 1879. He celebrated his golden wedding anniversary in 1928. He is by profession a mason.</p>
