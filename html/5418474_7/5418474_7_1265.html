   <p>The undersigned organization will not take part in the German Day celebration. The continual insults to the German flag and the Government of the German people during the committee sessions prohibit our taking part in a celebration which in our opinion dishonors the German name. At the same time we also wish to inform our friends and members that the German aviator Udet will not be present as guest of honor.</p>
