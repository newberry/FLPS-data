   <p>Blumenthal and Kadelburg's comedy, "Der Blinde Passagier" (The Blind Passenger), was played last evening at Bush Temple Theater before a large audience. The play is a genuine product of these well-known and popular writers of comedy. It differs from others of the same brand only in that the scene of action has been transferred to the high seas, namely, to the "S.S. Victoria Louise," which is making a pleasure trip from Hamburg to the North Cape. This ingenious idea makes interesting situations, blunders, and surprises possible; and the authors make full use of them. The three acts of the play abound in all kinds of comical blunders, illusions, and humor and comedy of every sort. And there is no dearth of the usual puns. It is well known that Blumenthal and Kadelburg's humor never goes beyond certain limits. Still, they have created so many characters during their career of writing for the stage that it must be difficult for them to create new ones.</p>
   
   <p>Therefore it is not surprising to meet characters with whom one has become acquainted through other plays of the authors. One cannot criticize the characters for assuming different names than those they bore in "Weisse Roessl" (White Rose)....And so in "Der Blinde Passagier" we are pleased to greet our old friend "Giesecke Aus Berlin," who was so warmly applauded in "Weisse Roessl". On the "Victoria Louise," however, he is called "August Bellerman". Conrad Seidemann apparently found great pleasure in playing this role. We also meet old "Hinzelmann" whose financial status must have improved, since he has the money necessary to travel to the North Cape, though he has just returned from a trip to Salzkammergut [scenic district in the Austrian Alps]. And he has also been promoted; he is now an aulic councilor. He, too, has changed his name, and is now known as "Franzius". His part was well played by Kurt Benisch. The "Roesselwirtin" (proprietess of the inn Roessel), a role played by Miss Emilie Schoenfeld, has moved her mountain hotel to Norway, and has forgotten how to speak the Alpine German. And her "Poldi" (Hans Zoder) has left her and become a railroad ticket agent in Vienna. He is spending his vacation by taking a boat trip to the North Cape, and occupies a stateroom on the ship. Aboard he meets and woos "Clara Heinzelmann" (Hannah Waizenegger who, a short time ago, lisped, and married the bald-headed "Suelzheimer," but very likely she recently divorced him and became the daughter of "Bellermann".</p>
   <p>We were much disappointed in "Dr. Siedler" (Adolph Stoye), who had made so favorable an impression in "Welsse Roessl," even though he did fleece his future father-in-law, "Giesecke". He, too, makes the trip to the North Cape, but under the alias "Freiherr Von Gellingen," who tries to seduce the wife of his friend "Erich Brueckner" (Max Juergens). Fortunately, he does not succeed.</p>
   <p>However, we also meet a few characters of some originality. Among them is "Scwerenoeterkapitaen (roguish captain) Larsen," and other officers of the ship....</p>
   <p>The scenery and the costumes were excellent, the performance was smooth, and the audience was not sparing in its applause.....[Translator's note: The final paragraph of this article contains announcements of future performances.]</p>
