   <p>The chairman repeatedly declared that the celebration, which will be held in Nov., does not conflict with the arrangements made by some of the Steuben societies, but it will be a celebration of the entire German element of Chicago, by which the importance of Von Steuben's interest to the United States shall be demonstrated to the American public also.</p>
