   <p>In a young city like Chicago a twenty-five year jubilee has a special value, especially when it is celebrated by a club that is anxious for the welfare of all its members. The "Arbeiter-Unterstuetzungs - Vereins-Orden" (Order of Workmen's Benevolent Society), usually called the A.U.V.O., belongs to those long-existing clubs that work their good deeds silently and do not show off before the outside world. But last night a lively audience came together at Brand's Hall, Clark and Erie Streets, to celebrate the Twenty-five Year Jubilee of Club No. 1 of this order. As the order consists exclusively of Germans, and the German language receives preference among its members, it was a true German festival that was celebrated by the brave because free and independent of all other existing labor organizations, laborers, and their families.</p>
   <p>The Order counts at present 450 members and is subject to the administration of a Grand Lodge. It pays weekly sickness benefits of $5.00 and a death benefit of $200. and $50.00 for funeral expenses.</p>
