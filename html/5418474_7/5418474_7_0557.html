   <p>The death of Bruno Knecht, the prominent veteran singer associated with the German singing societies, is mourned by all who knew him. His loss is keenly felt by the Harmony Singing Society of which Mr. Knecht served as president for many years. For some time, a stubborn heart ailment had interfered with his usual participation in German activities, and despite his heroic fight against invalidism, he succumbed yesterday.</p>
   <p>Bruno Knecht was born in Zurich on February 11, 1874. He came to this country thirty-four years ago selecting Chicago as his place of residence. He became intensely interested in the activities of the Germans of Chicago, almost immediately becoming their adviser and, in the course of time a prominent leader. Under the excellent leadership of Mr. Knecht, the Harmony Singing Society became recognized as one of the outstanding singing societies in this city. The United Male Choir owes its good reputation in part to the services rendered by that beloved singer, while his zealous activities in connection with the celebration of the National Singing Festival, in 1924, are still well remembered.</p>
   <p>He was the outstanding figure at all German activities which followed the dark years of the World War, including the subsequent campaigns for philanthropic contributions by the Germans of this country. And again - in response to the call - he worked untiringly to unite his people under the banner of the German Day celebration. The German Day committee has lost one of its most ardent co-workers and one of its beloved honorary presidents.</p>
   <p>Mr. Knecht followed the political affairs of the nation rather closely, taking a keen interest and an active part in election campaigns.</p>
