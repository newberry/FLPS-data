   <p>Nobody knows any more, where any when the German choral first sounded in America, but it is well known, that it belongs to the precious treasures, which were brought by the German immigrants, to their newly adopted Fatherland.</p>
   <p>For many decades, the German songs, in this country blossomed, if at all, only in the dark. It was not until 1835 that the first singing society, the "Men's Chorus of Philadelphia, was founded. But soon, the German singers of America were to get big support. The political refugees of 1830 and 1848 came, and brought a treasure of old and new melodies, along. Everywhere, societies were founded for the cultivation of German song, and in 1849 in Cincinnati, the first singing festival as held.</p>
   <p>The impression this festival made upon the Americans, was a divided one. Some could not find enough praise, while the others, especially the Puritans, condemned the festival, particularly since it had been held on a Sunday. Yes, a newspaper had the audacity to blame the singers for the appearance of the cholera in Cincinnati. It wrote: "These Dutch singers with their <span class="page-break">\2</span>intemperate jubilee, drinking sour wine, have brought the cholera upon us."</p>
   <p>In the course of this festival, the "German Choral Union of North America" was founded. But in other parts of the country there was also activity, and in recognition of the impossibility of holding a great mutual festival, attended by all choral societies, on account of the great distances in America, the "North-East Choral Union," the "pacific Singing Society", and the "North Pacific Choral Society," were founded.</p>
   <p>In the course of time, new societies, and new names were added. In 1866, in La Crosse, Wis., the "Union of Singers of the Northwest" was founded by seven societies, which will celebrate its 60th anniversary this summer in Peoria. These societies will do their utmost to celebrate the anniversary in a most festive manner. The festival administration of Peoria is fully confident of its success, because every single society is taking the greatest pains to contribute to a large success of the festival. With special pleasure the festival administration received the news, that the singing brothers of the "North-American Union of Singers", will participate at the festival. Their attendance will prove their not having forgotten the attendance of the North-West Union of Singers at the last singing festival of the North American Union of Singers in Chicago.</p>
