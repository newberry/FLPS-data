   <p>In this popular entertainment place on the north side several one act plays were presented last evening; as a request number and return engagment "Hans and Hanne" was presented first. Next also a return engagment "Man Ioll Den Teufel Nicht an die Ward Malen" ( Dont Paint The Devil On The Wall). For the third offering they gave "Ein Koenigreich fuer eine Frau" ( A Kingdom For a Woman)</p>
   <p>The best had been left to the end as was seen by bringing Madam Sarah Bernhardt to the stage. There is no question but that the public had plenty of variety.</p>
   <p>It is a well known fact, that, the Volkstheater under the managment of Mr. Sarner does not have to fear any competition on the North side, as the public still shows their interest and satisfaction in such a way, that the actors are playing nightly to a sold out house. Needless to say, the appearance last evening of Mr. Leopold Kaiser, the famous singer, made the evening more interesting than heretofore.</p>
