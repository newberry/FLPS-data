   <p>One of the last numbers of the "Frankfurter Zeitung" contains the following news:- " We reported already some time ago, that it has been thought by some German-Americans, it would be a good idea, to send a number of young Germans, to the World's Fair in Chicago, so they could study the exhibited articles closely. These German-Americans, offered for this purpose, a larger financial assistance. The German chancellor notified in a circular the Techinal Industrial and other schools in the German Empire, that the well known German-American, Henry Villard, remitted 50,000 marks into the Chance llor's hands, for the purpose of making it possible to the interested students, to make the trip to the United States. According to Mr. Villard's wishes, 3/5 should be artisans, small manufacturers and technicians, 2/5 the other professional branches with the exception of Government employees.-Amounts of 1800 to 2000 marks will be loaned, partly to pay traveling expenses, partly for subsistence in Chicago.</p>
