   <p>Last night, the German people were entertained by Mr. Hochster in the North side Turnhalle with the comedy "Bummelfritz" same being played two weeks at Mc Vicker's Theatre with great success. The Northside Turnhalle was filled to the last seat and great applause was given. After the show the people danced in the New Year, and all had a very pleasant and joyful new year's eve.</p>
   <p>On Sunday theatrical director Hochster played the tragedy "Magda", by Madame Irschick of the Munchener Hoftheatre, in one of her star roles as Johanna in Schiller's "Jungfrau von Orleans." Tickets at the box office are in great demand, and it is advisable to buy your tickets at once. Fraulien Irschick arrived last night and registered at the Palmer House, where she expects to have her rehearsal.</p>
   <p>It is a very welcome program and we are sure all will enjoy it very much.</p>
