   <p>The Bund of the Friends of New Germany have arranged for Saturday, June 8, a Deutsch Voelkischer (German national) evening at the Lake Shore Athletic Club, to which all Germans of Chicago are invited.</p>
   <p>A festive orchestra composed of the combined bands of the Bund, under the direction of E. Hennecke, will give a concert of German masters. Noted artists have been engaged for the evening.</p>
   <p>Arias from Tannhaenser and "Die Freisehultz" will be given by the German singer Frau Ellen Wilson Meibes from the city playhouse of Duesseldorf. The "Second Polonaise," by Liszt, for piano and orchestra will be played by the concert pianist Erwin Goerlitz. It is the intention of the Bund to prove by this concert that Germans stand in first place culturally.</p>
