   <p>Today every German must unite in cheering the German Empire. Today we do not celebrate past victories, which have been deathdays for many thousands. Today we celebrate the birthday of the whole German Empire. On the 18th of January 1871 in Versailles, France peace was born together with the German Empire. If the peace, which was concluded later in Frankfurt for an eternal period has lasted for 25 years, thanks are due to the German Empire. Without a strong Germany the various German States would have been crushed a long time ago in bloody battles. Without the German Empire the German states could not have developed the economic and industrial progress which Germany has made. All political parties must agree that only a united Germany will be strong and for this reason every German in Chicago and the united German will be strong and for this reason every German in Chicago and the United States regardless of party must give his applause to the German empire on the day of its 25th birthday.</p>
