   <p>"There are men and classes of men," writes Robert Louis Stevenson, "that stand above the common herd: The soldier, the sailor, the shepherd not infrequently, the artist rarely,.....the physician almost as a rule".</p>
   <p>Dr. Nils Remmen belonged to the men and to that class of men that stand above the common herd. He stood above and apart from the average individual in his idealism, is his altruism, and in his almost passionate love for the beautiful.</p>
   <p>The personal qualities that went to make up his character and personality were those that go to make up the character and personality of the ideal physician. Generosity, discretion, tact, cheerfulness, kindliness, courage and possibly most important of all, honesty, were some of those attributes.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Dr. Remmen was generous--generous in his dealings with his patients and generous in his relationship with his fellow practitioners. Many a needy patient enjoyed the benefit of his generosity, and many of his fellow physicians can testify that patients whom they referred to him for some eye ailment would often return to them with even a better opinion of themselves than they had before.</p>
   <p>Discretion he had, and tact, important qualities in the physician because of the frequently very confidential relations existing between him and his patient. Never in my more than forty years of rather close acquaintanceship with him did I ever know him to violate a confidence.</p>
   <p>Dr. Remmen was cheerful and kindly, and of an optimistic temperament; he radiated cheer and optimism and hope in the presence of physical distress. If his patients were troubled and dejected as to the outcome of some illness, Dr. Remmen would always stress the bright side of the situation, and speak <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>an encouraging word. Even in his own last, long, and lingering illness he was cheerful and philosophical and courageous, though he well knew that the end was not far away.</p>
   <p>I said Dr. Remmen had courage, and courage he had--physical, intellectual and moral. He had always the courage of his convictions. He was not the man to be swayed hither and thither by new fads and fancies or by waves of popular emotion. Although he was, in a measure, emotional and sentimental, his good sense and judgment kept him from losing his balance. He was firm in a stand he had once taken, and he clung to his position with a tenacity which at times might appear to those who differed from him to border on stubbornness. He had the moral courage, in his dealings with his patients, to do only what he felt it was right to do, and he had the courage and the honesty, always, not to do or advise to be done or undertaken any procedure which he did not feel satisfied would be for his patient's benefit. No monetary or other sordid consideration ever entered into his decisions. To him,medicine was a profession, not merely a business. And so it was that he was outspoken in his opposition <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to commercialism in his profession and in his antagonism to cults and schools of pseudo-medicine that masquerade under high-sounding, pseudo-scientific names, and which serve only to delude a credulous public.</p>
   <p>Dr. Remmen's parents emigrated from Valders, Norway, to America in the early fifties, and settled in Goodhue County, Minnesota. Here Nils Remmen was born May 6, 1863. He spent his boyhood on the farm and attended the public school. As a boy, he was physically robust and strong, and was fond of sports, particularly those involving tests of strength. He was especially fond of wrestling, and many a bigger boy on the school grounds and on the college campus fell before his superior strength and dexterity. As a youth he attended, for a time, St. Olaf's School, then an academy, now St. Olaf's College. After that, he became an apprentice in a drugstore in that city. It was probably here, during this period, that he conceived the idea of taking up the study of medicine. He knew the importance, however of a good preliminary education and so, in the fall of 1881, he entered Luther College. It was here that I first made his acquaintance. He was then 18 years of age. As a student at Luther he made many friends.</p>

   <p>His fine appearance, his neat attire, his good sense of humor, his unassuming ways, his attractive personality withal, together with his sturdy character, endeared him to those of his fellow students who knew him best. In the early part of his sophomore year at college he rather abruptly, as it appeared to me ,decided to leave and at once take up the study of medicine. Ludvig Hektoen, now famous, who had been a schoolmate of ours, had, that fall (1884), entered the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Chicago. This circumstance probably influenced him in the selection of this particular medical school. After three years of medical study, he graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, now the Medical Department of the University of Illinois, in 1887. Immediately after graduation, Dr. Remmen opened an office for the practice of his profession in Chicago, at the corner of May and Erie Streets. After two years of practice he proceeded, in 1889, to Vienna for a year of postgraduate study. Here I had the pleasure of sharing a room with him, and from our stay in Vienna that year we had many an interesting memory that we were often fond of reviving. On his return to Chicago in the fall of 1890, he resumed his practice at his former location. On January 1, 1891, he was united in marriage to Miss Inga Halvorsen, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>my cousin. She survives him. His practice increased rapidly and in a few years he found it was taxing his health. The idea of taking up a specialty then began to appeal to him as a less arduous method of gaining a livelihood, and as offering an opportunity for doing better and more efficient work. He chose opthalmology as his specialty , and in 1895 he again went abroad to take up his study of diseases of the eye. Most of his time he spent in Copenhagen and in Vienna. In later years from time to time, he pursued postgraduate study in various places in this country.</p>
   <p>Dr. Remmen was connected as opthalmologist with a number of hospitals and other institutions, among them the Norwegian-American Hospital. He was for many years surgeon at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, and held membership in a number of local, state, and national medical and ophthalmological societies. During the last few years of his life, Dr. Remmen was in rather delicate health. A chronic purulent tracheitis which troubled him for years, no doubt, had its effect on his general condition. His large practice further taxed his strength and energy. He became the victim of that insidious and little understood <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>disease, leukemia , and he passed away on February 28, 1926.</p>
   <p>His passing left a void, particularly in this section of the city where the qualities which he possessed, both as a man and a physician, coupled with his knowledge and his skill in his special field of practice had gained for him many friends and a large following.</p>
   <p>This brief sketch of Dr. Remmen would be incomplete, indeed, were not some reference made to his many interests outside of his profession--interests which made his life fuller and added much to his enjoyment of it. He was especially fond of art, and he became quite a connoiseur. His home, which he loved and where he enjoyed extending hospitality to the many friends of himself and Mrs. Remmen, was a veritable little art gallery. Here he would lay aside his cares and find rest and recreation, surrounded by his beautiful collection of paintings and other works of art.</p>
   <p>Dr. Remmen was interested in good books. His reading of both English and <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>Norwegian literature was extensive. Blessed with a good memory, he remembered what he read. Second only to his interest in art and literature was his interest in politics and current events. In politics he was independent. Theodore Roosevelt was his ideal.</p>
   <p>Dr. Remmen was interested in the church and, to the end, he kept the faith that had been taught him at his mother's knee.</p>
