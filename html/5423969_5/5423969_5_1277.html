   <p>Mathisen's Hotel on Milwaukee Avenue was the scene of a very nice gathering on April 10th, when a host of friends and admirers assembled to honor our own Dr. Ingeborg Rasmussen on the occasion of her birthday.</p>
   <p>The hotel dining room was beautifully decorated with an abundance of Norwegian and American flags, and flowers. It put one in real gala humor immediately upon entering. So busy were all with congratulations to the Doctor and greeting to seldom-seen friends, that they hardly found time to listen to various numbers on the program that had been arranged. Recitations by Mrs. Halfdan Jebe were listened to and greatly enjoyed, however, but the musical and of the program had to be dispense with on account of the bad condition of the piano. Dr. Rasmussen is a wonderful personality of great intellect, and among our physicians, she in an outstanding practitioner.</p>
