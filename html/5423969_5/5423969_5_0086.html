During the several days preceeding the 17th, signs of activity and a coming event evident all along West North Avenue, the American "Karl Johans Gade" (Karl Johan St.). Norwegian flags and other decorations in the national colors were prominently displayed in every place of business; from Western Avenue to California Avenue and throughout the park, the route to be taken by parade was a veritable avenue of flags. As early as 9:00 A.M. Humboldt Park was teeming with milling crowds of celebrants seeking advantageous points from which to view the colorful parade. Their early gatherings was made pleasant by an informal concert by a band provided by the Norwegian National League) playing a group of Norwegian marches and folk songs. The Leif Eriksen Statue was marked by a large Norwegian flag. The excitement, already great, was increased when a street car caught fire sending up a cloud of smoke worthy of a good sized building. The fire was put out, however, when a hose was run out from Scandia's office and, to the volunteer smoke-eaters credit, it must be said that the usual damage by water was reduced to a minimum. The children's parade, arranged by Chicago's Norwegian churches was a sight long to be remembered and an honor to our people. Heading the parade was a detachment of twelve police officers, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>all Norwegians. The first banner in the parade was that of"Henrik Ibsen"Lodge of the I.O.G.T.
