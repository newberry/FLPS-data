   <p>In four years the Norwegian University will celebrate its hundredth jubilee. The organization of the university in 1811 was the first long forward step toward national regeneration of Norway. It is true that the school was barely three years old in 1814 at the time of the great events which came to hold such revolutionary significance for the people and nations of Europe. But the moral significance of having a university was immeasurable, and probably is best illustrated by the attitude of Professor Georg Sundrup toward Prince Christian Fredrik. It is more than doubtful if the events of 1814 could have ended so favorably for Norway had the University not been founded in 1811.</p>
   <p>A contributor thinks that the Norwegians in America should prepare for participation in the University jubilee by collecting a fund, the interest of which should be used for scholarships or fellowships to enable Norwegian-American <span class="page-break">\2</span>students to complete one or two years' residence work at Christiania University. He believes--and rightly so--that in this manner a permanent bridge would be built between the Norwegians who moved west and those who remained at home. He directs his appeal particularly to the students from Christiana University who have settled in this country; but his appeal is also addressed to all Norwegians in the United States, since this proposal should be of interest to all.</p>
   <p>The matter deserves consideration and an exchange of opinion. This proposal may be realized through the collection of a comparatively modest sum. Skandinaven requests the teachers at our schools to have a voice in the discussion. And of course the opinions of our oldest Norwegian students in this country are sought. One of the oldest among us is Dr. W. Koren. He would, for example, be the obvious choice for chairman of a committee to be appointed to take charge of the work. We would be glad to have Dr. Koren express his opinion on this matter.</p>
