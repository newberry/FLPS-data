   <p>Norwegian papers have shown considerable concern over the attitude the American Government may take in regard to export to neutral countries. The American press has presented quite sensational tales, indicating that export to neutral countries is to be stopped altogether. All in all, the expressions employed have been rather threatening. It is significant that the American press seems to consider dealings with the small neutral countries in Europe a sort of benevolent act.</p>
   <p>It is well to take care not to accept this agitation on the part of the press as representative of the attitude taken by official America. It is natural that newspaper articles indicating opposition to export will be most readily telegraphed to Europe, but there are also voices in American papers of standing and influence that have a clearer concept of the situation.</p>
   
   <p>From the point of view of America it is natural to require that in this time of shortage in goods, the neutral countries receiving wares from America must reciprocate as far as possible. But of course, Norway is paying with the service needed most of all at present, the use of its ships. Norway is placing at the disposal of the world traffic at sea, nine tenths of its commercial marine, a marine which ranks in size among the very largest. Remembering the words of Lloyd George concerning the three things most sorely needed at present will create less derision of the return services rendered by the poor little Norway.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian people have the very strongest confidence in the judgment and sense of justice of President Wilson, as also in his ability to withstand unreasoned agitation. The man who has declared that America is fighting official Germany, the German people will hardly sanction a commercial policy which in fact would mean a cruel war against the small neutral nations.</p>
