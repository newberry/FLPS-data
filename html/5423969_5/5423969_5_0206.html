   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club held its Christmas celebration last Sunday in truly Norwegian style, playing host to many children who came to enjoy themselves by singing and dancing around a big beautiful Christmas tree. Christmas fairies (Jule Nisser), from whom Norway's children receive their gifts, were there, but in deference to American tradition, the distribution was left to Santa Claus, the American friend of children and adults. Santa was there, true to the best traditions, with bags seemingly bottomless, and no one left the hall without evidence of his generosity.</p>
