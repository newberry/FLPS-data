   <p>The opposition to unity in the Norwegian Church is still a fact. The discussions, pro and con, are long and heated. We wish at this time to give our opinion, hoping that it may influence some of the people who oppose the union.</p>
   <p>The opposition to the union and the proposed constitution is all based upon Opgjor. Can it be that Opgjor promulgates any new doctrine? No! But the Norwegians of America seem to have been so long steeped in church strife and doctrinal controversies that it has become a mania, and has produced warring divines and disagreeing theologians who cannot rid themselves of an underlying hostility and suspicion toward their former opponents. Hence the difficulty in becoming reconciled to the acceptance of Opgjor and organic union.</p>
   <p>What is there to all this cry about Falsk Laere [false teaching] in Opgjor? Here is Pontopidan's doctrine of election that the Church has had for over 150 years,....and which the Synod has tolerated since its organization. We have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>been taught to accept it as orthodox. When it seemed to be questioned during the doctrinal controversy that raged in 1882, the laymen demanded a clear and definite explanation of the doctrine, and put the question directly up to the Synod. The answer was as follows: "The Synod agrees with the congregations when they say that they believe the teachings found in Pontopidan's doctrine to be true."</p>
   <p>Yet, in spite of all this, a storm of opposition has arisen because we have Pontopidan's doctrine in Opgjor. If we disregard Opgjor on account of false doctrine, we must also disregard Pontopidan; we must repudiate the record of the Synod since 1882.... Yes, and we must also forget the approval of Opgjor by that grand old pioneer, Lauritz Larsen, and the approval of many other prominent theologians connected with the Synod.</p>
   <p>If Pontopidan's doctrine of election was right when it was taught to father and mother, when it was taught to us, when the Synod said it was true--then can we consistently recommend that it be forgotten? Can we now join with the "technical" <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>ministry in defeating the union because this same doctrine has been accepted by Opgjor? Splitting hairs, fighting over technicalities too fine to be noticed, have wrought too much dissension among our church people.</p>
   <p>No historian has ever pictured the suffering endured and the loss occasioned the church by doctrinal differences into which the ministry has plunged itself from time to time. If the laymen were united, if they would stand by the doctrine of Pontopidan and by the record of the Synod, if they would stop listening to disrupters and disturbers, all this strife would soon end.</p>
   <p>The clergy and the theological teachers also do their bit in increasing the strife. When the laymen call their attention to the failings they have, they should take heed. It is to be hoped that they will give some consideration to the wishes of the people. We, the members of the Hauge, the United Church, and the Norwegian Synods, have the same religious background, the same hymnbooks, the same sacraments, and the same understanding of sin and of grace; we come from the same mother church, we have the same ancestry--then why, in God's name, can <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>we not unite, and preach and pray in unity?</p>
   <p>The clergy and the laymen are responsible for it all. They are the ones who have crippled the influence of the Church; they are the ones who have lowered the dignity of the Church; it is they who have caused all the friction and misunderstanding in our colleges.</p>
   <p>If there ever was a time to work for unity, it is now. The time has come when the laymen must demand their rights, use their power, and win this uneven battle. The congregations throughout the land are for the union; they vote for union, even if their pastors ask them not to. After years of strife, we are sure the people are prepared for final action--action that will win.</p>
