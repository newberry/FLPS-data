   <p>The work done by the Norwegian United Lutheran Church in the missionary field is quite interesting. In 1911, in the mission stations in China, 301 were baptized, 2,402 received communion, 3,575 attended sermons every Sunday, and 578 attended schools. Twelve thousand books were sold. At the Lutheran seminaries in China, sixteen Chinese students passed the examinations and are now assigned to missionary work. The United Church has appointed Marie Anderson as principal of the higher schools for women in China; she has two graduate native women as teachers, and about thirty-eight native students. A special course was given last year for Chinese workers; sixty native males attended these classes.</p>
   <p>The school for males was well attended. The school for girls, in which Miss Anna Wilhelmsen was teacher, always had a capacity enrollment. The grade school has been attended by 239 children each year.</p>
