   <p>The church on the corner of Peoria Street and Grand Avenue is again the property of the Norwegian Trefoldigheds [Trinty] Congregation. The Catholics did not worship their saints and the Madonna very long in the old church, and the Chiesa Cattolica Italiana sotto il Patrocinio di Sant' Antonio di Padova [Padua] no longer receives the blessings of the holy Antonius.</p>
   <p>The Norweigan Congregation sold the church to the parish of the Polish Bishop Anthony Koslowski. The Archbishop did not approve of the fact that an independent Catholic bishop controlled the church, so he sent two nuns and a priest into the parish to put a scare into the parishioners, telling them that if they supported Bishop Koslowski, he would never be buriel in holy ground and would go to hell never to see the inside of heaven. All this worked so well that soon Koslowski stood alone. Today, the Norwegians were presented with the keys to the old church.</p>
