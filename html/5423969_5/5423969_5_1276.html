   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Frank W. Johnson, well-known in church and fraternal circles within Chicago's Norwegian Colony, celebrated the 15th anniversary of their marriage on Sunday, April 28th. A host of friends gathered to do them honor, and at 6:00 o'clock they sat down to a tasty wedding dinner. Several speakers addressed the group, and Chr. Mathiesen, tenor, entertained with several numbers, accompanied by Miss Anna Meyer.</p>
   <p>Presents were many and beautiful; outstanding among these was a large painting by Chicago's own Norwegian-American artist, Ben Blessum. Guests who have seen nearly all of Blessum's works proclaim this painting one of his very best (and they are all very good). The evening was thoroughly enjoyed by all.
