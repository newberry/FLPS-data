   <p>The Scandinavians of this country do not wish to be known as "hyphenated Americans". Of course, there is a great love for the old country, but we are, first of all, Americans. There are no exceptions to this attitude; it seems to meet with universal approval, as it should, from all American citizens worthy of the name, no matter what the lands of their birth or ancestry. No man can serve two masters, and a resident of the United States is either an American citizen wholly or not at all, regardless of his technical or legal status.</p>
   <p>Our citizens of Scandinavian extraction are to be congratulated upon their clear perception of this truth and upon their evident firm resolution that this badge of hyphenation shall not be attached to them. They want none of it, and by their rejection of it they prove themselves loyal Americans.</p>
