   <p>The St. Matthew and the Covenant congregations have consolidated. The Covenant congregation is English Lutheran, and St. Matthew's is a member of the Norwegian Synod. It was quite unusual to see so many pastors from two different denominations at the festival held in the Covenant Church to celebrate the consolidation.</p>
   <p>Reverend J. Nordbye spoke in English for the Synod, and Reverend H. P. Ausan spoke for the Synod in Norwegian. The new congregation was appropriately named the "First Evangelical Lutheran Church of Logan Square". Reverend Moe, of the Norwegian Synod, will be the temporary pastor. The congregation will use the old Covenant Church, Fullerton Avenue and Ballou Street.</p>
