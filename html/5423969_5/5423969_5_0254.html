   <p>It is hard to believe twenty years have passed since the Norwegian Ebenezer congregation was organized. The beginning was not a brilliant success. The old church at 52nd Street and Fifth Avenue cost only $50, and it was a long hard struggle before a new and up-to-date church could be built. The new church was built at 71st and Aberdeen Streets in 1917. Today the congregation has no debts and cash resources of about $7,300.</p>
