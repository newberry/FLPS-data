   <p>The St. Paul Norwegian Lutheran Sunday School held a picnic last Thursday at Pottawattomie Park..... The Park is located on Fox River, near St. Charles. The Reverend O. Heimdahl gave a talk to the children, and the rest of the time was spent in various types of games. The weather was excellent, and everybody found the picnic enjoyable.</p>
