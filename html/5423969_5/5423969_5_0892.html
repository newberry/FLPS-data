   <p>On par with the rule forbidding one class of the population to study law is the suggestion that there shall be no newspapers or other periodicals printed in foreign languages. That reminds you of the lady who permitted her daughter to go out to swim, undress, and hang her clothes on a hickory limb, but not to go near the water.</p>
   <p>How do you expect a man who speaks no English to learn the language when he first arrives here? You consent to the use of signs in teaching a man who is deaf and dumb. Why not use in print the signs that a man understands, teaching him your own signs as quickly as possible? Why talk of Americanizing foreigners, and begin with an exhibition of foolish, provincial prejudice? Did not Christ confer upon his followers the mysterious "power of tongues," <span class="page-break">2</span>enabling each one to speak ten or a hundred languages in order to spread His truth everywhere? He did not say "Let them learn the Jewish language if they want to know."</p>
   <p>The trouble with many Americanizing patriots is their pitiful provincial ignorance and prejudice. Many of them could learn from an "ignorant foreigner" more than that foreigner could learn from them.</p>
