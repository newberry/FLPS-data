   <p>The new office building and entrance to Mount Olive Cemetery was opened last Thursday....The first funeral procession arrived there led by Mr. Alfred Wold, representing the oldest Norwegian undertaking firm in Chicago...Superintendent Christiansen of Mount Olive Cemetery opened the new gate, and at the same time the new bell sounded for the first time. The bell had been hung in the tower over the entrance the previous day.</p>
   <p>By comparing the new building with those of the other cemeteries in Chicago, one finds inevitably that it is superior to any of the rest both in regard to design and practicability. Both the board of directors and the architect deserve credit for the new entrance.</p>
