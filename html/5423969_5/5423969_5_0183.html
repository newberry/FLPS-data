   <p>Tomorrow will be the first of the special days of the Exposition. The Norwegians of Chicago will gather to hear from eloquent lips the story of the independence of the sturdy Kingdom of the Northland.</p>
   <p>The celebration has a double meaning to all the subjects of King Oscar. It marks not only the practical completion of the Norwegian Building at Jackson Park, but is as well the annual day of rejoicing in commemoration of the separation of the kingdom from Denmark. Every year on May 17, there is a general holiday throughout Norway. So tomorrow these dwellers in an alien land will follow the custom of their country. The Norwegian societies of the city will meet at Scandia Hall on the West side. Commissioner General Ravn and his fellow Commissioners, representing the imperial government, will be there also, and, headed by bands which will play Norse airs, they will march to Jackson Park.</p>

   <p>In Festival Hall the celebration will begin with the singing of the Norwegian national hymn, "Ja, vi elsker dette landet", "Yes,we love this land", the first line reads when translated into English. Every Norseman knows the song by heart, and its singing by 7000 patriotic voices should make such music as the wall of Festival Hall have not yet echoed.</p>
   <p>Some of the Norwegian singing societies will celebrate Independence day by a festival at Kuhn's Park.</p>
