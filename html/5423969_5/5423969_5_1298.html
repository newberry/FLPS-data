   <p>p.8...Scandia regrets to learn that Robert S. Nelson, one of our prominent Norwegian industrialists is shaking the dust of Chicago, and is leaving for Long Beach, California.</p>
   <p>He was one of the founders of the washing machine manufacturing concern, Nelson-Kreuter Co., which has been absorbed by the trust. Mr. Nelson speaks very highly of Long Beach, being especially impressed by the scenery and its similarity to his birthplace, Bergen, Norway. He came to Chicago in 1879, and in 1881 was one of the most active workers in organizing the "Bjorgvin" Male Chorus, of which he was made an honorary life member.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nelson has sold his Chicago home and severed all business connections in Chicago,leaving here on Tuesday evening for Long Beach where he has built a villa overlooking the ocean, and its many small islands.</p>

   <p>A large group of friends gathered at "The Tavern" to bid Mr. Nelson farewell, and if even a small part of the good wishes materialize, he and his family will spend a wonderful future in the land of sunshine. He arranged for Scandia's weekly visit to help him keep in touch with the old Chicago friends.</p>
