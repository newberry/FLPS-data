   <p>Last Sunday Jan. 16, Dr. Hub, president of the Norwegian Lutheran Synod, gave a lecture in the Lutheran Church and its Mission in this country. The large First Lutheran Church on Fullerton Avenue, was, in spite of the inclement weather, filled; present were 22 ministers, and representatives from most of the Norwegian Lutheran churches here.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hub's lecture was largely a reiteration of the Dogmas of the Lutheran church. He also went into details upon the large field the church is privileged to work in; with a population of nearly two millions of Norwegian decent, the church carries a large responsibility in bringing the strayed sheep back to the fold.</p>
   <p>The lecture was preceded by an excellent musical program, consisting of renditions by the churche's choir, and several soloists of note. The lecture was very well received.</p>
