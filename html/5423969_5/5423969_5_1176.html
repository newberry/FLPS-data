   <p>The committee in charge of Dr. Nansen's reception invited Mayor Harrison to greet the distinguished visitor on behalf of the city. His honor's presence was not necessary by any means, but the Mayor is wont to assist on such occasions and the committee did not wish to slight him by dispensing with his services.</p>
   <p>Carter Harrison was not bothered by a similar regard for proprieties. He kept carefully out of sight, and in order to emphasize the insult administered to the famous explorer and the committee, he sent a minor city official to act in his place. The corporation counsel, or the comptroller, generally represents the Mayor when he is prevented from performing an official function in person. But Mr. Harrison evidently was of the opinion that one of the obscurest city officials was a good enough substitute on this occasion.</p>

   <p>It is true that Mr. Taylor made a much better speech than his honor could have made or ever will make. But Taylor's eloquence is no excuse for Mr. Harrison's rude discourtesy.</p>
   <p>It is understood that the committee in charge of the banquet to be given in honor of Dr. Nansen by Norwegians of Chicago and the Northwest at the Auditorium on November 27th has invited Mayor Harrison to be present at this banquet as a guest and to respond to the toast to Chicago. The committee consists of good, loyal Chicagoans, who desired to honor the Mayor by giving him an opportunity to meet the great explorer. This invitation was extended to the Mayor before he saw fit to insult Dr. Nansen, hence no blame can attach to the committee. But as matters now stand, the committee has but one thing to do, viz., to cancel the invitation. It cannot afford to invite as a guest a man who has insulted the guest of honor. Mr. Harrison's presence is not wanted under any circumstances.</p>
