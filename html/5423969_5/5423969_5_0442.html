   <p>The men's club of St. Paul's Church held a very interesting meeting on Saturday evening, May 25th, at the home of Trygve Siqueland. This was the first meeting of the season, and Mr. Siqueland was elected president for the coming year. The club was fortunate in being able to start the season with such a prominent speaker as Pear O. Stromme, editor, lecturer and globe trotter. Mr. Stromme is an able speaker with a great sense of humor, and his discriptions of different places visited and incidents that occured on his round the world trip, from which he has just returned, held the interest of the audience throughout.</p>
   <p>The lecture was characteristic of one who sees the brighter and most comical side of life and can and does portray things in such a way as to inject one's own impressions into others. The club has gotten off to a good start; we trust it will be able to keep the pace.</p>
