   <p>Of late not only the railroads but also the transatlantic steamship lines have been carrying on a bitter "price war." They have reduced their rates considerably. The railroads now charge one dollar to travel from New York to Chicago. The steamship companies charge ten dollars for the trip from Norway or Denmark to New York.</p>
   <p>The result has been that thousands of Scandinavians are now taking advantage of these opportune rates to come to America. As a result, the colony here in Chicago has nearly doubled in the last year.</p>
