   <p>The Chicago branch of the Norwegian Singers' League at their last meeting passed a resolution mourning the recent loss of Martin Losby, faithful to the end and a friend of all.</p>
   <p>Mr. Losby was one of the founders of Nordmendenes (Norsemen's) male chorus, and when the Singers' League was organized, he was one of those responsible for the perfect harmony and co-operation between the choruses constituting the league. Singers and their public will long miss the wonderful voice and genial personality of Martin; his place will be hard to fill.</p>
