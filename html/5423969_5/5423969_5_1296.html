   <p>Sigvard Sorensen was born in Kristiansund, Norway, and is now in his early forties. During his youth he fraternized with Kristiania's poets and artists, one of his most intimate friends being the well-known Nils Collett Vogt, who still is Mr. Sorensen's idol and ideal.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sorensen's experiences in America have not often made his life a "bed of roses," nor has the sun always warmed him in times of adversity, but an unconquerable spirit and a happy disposition have carried him through. For a number of years now he has been the kindly and efficient librarian of Chicago's Newberry Library, a position requiring knowledge, personality, tact, and integrity.</p>
   <p>His mastery of English and his wide acquaintance with writers of many nations have enabled him to contribute many worthwhile compositions in both poetry <span class="page-break">2</span>and prose. His lyric verse is especially pleasing in English, as well as in Norwegian, and a visit to his friendly home gives one an insight into the truly wonderful nature of the man, the thinker, the idealist, and the realist.</p>
   <p>One's first impression, of Mr. Sorensen, is that of a placid, easygoing man with an expressionless face; but with the mere mention of a masterpiece of poetry or art, an astounding transformation instantly takes place. The easygoing posture becomes military in its carriage; the eyes twinkle like stars; and the erstwhile poker face lights up with a smile that warms the heart of the observer. He speaks, and one is instantly captivated by the rich, mellow, well-Modulated tone of his voice, and by the way his every word seems to pierce one's innermost being, injecting therein a glowing warmth that remains indefinitely. Such a man is Sigvard Sorensen--Norseman and American.</p>
