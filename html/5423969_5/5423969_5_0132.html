   <p>The 17th of May, the Norwegian Day of Liberty, was a great success. The parade started with three thousand Norwegian children each holding a flag in his hand; fifteen hundred men and women followed them. It was a beautiful parade; first, the Liberty Band, second, a company of policemen, third, The Norwegian Turner, fourth, children from the Childrens Home, and fifth, members of churches and the Sunday schools. President A.B.Rahamsen of the National League bid all welcome and he introduced Pastor Ring who spoke very nicely to the children. The people then started for Brands Park to have their dance and play.</p>
