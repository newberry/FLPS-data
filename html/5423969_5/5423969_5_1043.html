   <p>p.4..........This week marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the United States Embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark. As Norway was, at that time, affiliated with Denmark it was at this time given its first official diplomatic connection with the U.S.A. since the time of its discovery and the establishment of the Norse Colony on Massachusetts Bay in the 11th century. It was not till 1905 that Mother Norway was able to enter into independent diplomatic relations with the land,her adventurous sons were the first to set foot upon.</p>
   <p>In spite of all this no people has a greater right to feel proud of its relationship to America, historically and otherwise, than the Norsemen. Let this fact be indelibly impressed upon the minds of Norsemen the world over. By so doing we render a cultural service of untold importance to ourselves, our descendents and to the birthplace of our ancestors.</p>
