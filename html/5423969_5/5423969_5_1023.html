   <p>p.4...............The majority of Scandia's readers have undoubtedly been wondering just what Norway will offer as an attraction to 1914 visitors. The Norwegian press carries very little if any information that is at all encouraging. On the other hand, every thing seems to be at "sixes and sevens; " confusion reigns, and the plans of our department are contradicted by others, and no one at present is sure whether there really will be a world's fair at Christiania in 1914.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian "Storting" (Congress) has decided not to sell "Hoved Oien" (Main Island) to the city of Christiania as a site for the proposed "world's fair" and now all plans are at a standstill. The "Ting" has also decided that the National lottery to raise 800,000 crowns, with which to help finance the exhibit, is not to be held.</p>
   <p>Late papers from Norway express disappointment over the poor prospects of putting on something worth while in the way of an exposition. At present they can only see an exceptional celebration of May 17th that will in a very small way compensate for the failure of a fair to materialize.</p>

   <p>The Norwegian-American singers who were planning trips to Norway during the centennial celebration are wondering just what good such a trip will do if the authorities over there do not get together and make definite plans for a celebration, worthy of the significance of the year 1914 in Norway's history. Leaving America in April to arrive in Norway for a May 17th festival is not to be thought of, and many are becoming disgusted with the apathy of the Norwegian authorities. Here we are wearing our fingers to the bone to raise money for a memorial gift to the mother country, and her own citizens and authorities seem to be doing little more than relax and twiddle their thumbs for pastime. A festival spirit can not be conjured up in this way, and unless Norway awakens and puts on an affair worthy of the country and her history and traditions we are confident that literally thousands who have planned to be in Norway in 1914 will remain at home. It will require more than a May 17th celebration to lure us from the land of the "Star Spangled Banner."</p>
