   <p>The May 17th program, arranged by the Norwegian Theatrical Society, turned out to be quite a success, in spite of the National Festival, in Brand's Park, May 17th.</p>
   <p>The program was opened by Mrs. Borgny Hammer, with a recitation of a beautiful prologue, by Finn R. Simonsen; that instilled a spirit of happiness and festivity in the audience. The audience, standing, put heart and soul into the singing of "Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet", (Norwegian National Anthem),and the "three times three" was given with a will.</p>
   <p>Ivar Aasen's May 17th play,"Ervingen," (The Heir), was presented by the talent of the society, the amatuer cast, several of whom played their role for the first time; they gave a very good performance. Rolf Hammer, always obliging, and always appreciated,sang several numbers appropriate for the occasion, and the evening was rounded out with several hours of dancing.</p>

   <p>Considering the fact that Brand's Park had drawn a crowd of nearly 10,000, the theatrical group was more than pleased with the size of its audience, and those who preferred the play, were enthusiastic in their appreciation. The roomy, nicely decorated hall with its excellent dance floor, was a revelation to many, for this was their first visit, and our west siders are justly proud of the beautiful place.</p>
