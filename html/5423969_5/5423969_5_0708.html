   <p>Reverend John Grevstad, of Deerfield, Wisconsin, speaking for Reverend O. E. Heimdahl in St. Paul's Lutheran Church on North Avenue, reports that of the 50,000 Norwegians in Chicago only seven thousand belong to the Lutheran churches. He also reports that the Norwegian Synod, organized here in Chicago in 1862, has contributed $884,000 to the foreign mission. He remarked that the explorer Livingstone had done much for the Synod in Africa, and that he at last gave his life in its service.</p>
   <p>In his closing prayer Reverend Grevstad wished the new Lutheran Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota, all success.</p>
