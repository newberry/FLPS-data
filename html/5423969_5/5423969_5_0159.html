   <p>The Viking Marine Band's Seventeenth of May celebration at Scandia Hall was very well attended. The Hall was decorated with flags and bunting in national colors. Starting at six o'clock in the morning, a music wagon, with loud-speaker, drove about the streets on the West Side, playing Norwegian melodies.</p>
   <p>The social in the evening opened with a potpourri of Norwegian folk songs by Reissiger, which, as well as other numbers in the program, was well executed. Mr. M. Pedersen played a cornet solo; Mr. Robert Sjogren sang "Four Leaf Clover," by A. Paulsen; and Mr. George Bass played a violin solo. All the soloists reaped well-deserved applause.</p>
