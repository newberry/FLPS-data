   <p>The meeting of the Norwegian National Committee, held yesterday, was one of the liveliest in years. Red tape and a few disrupters made the meeting a sort of battleground, but even so, great plans were laid for the Seventeenth of May celebration.</p>
   <p>As usual, many of the delegates who took the floor spoke at great length, without bringing forth any definite proposals. Too much of the time was spent on personalities, and not on issues. Several of the delegates were not recognized because the committee on credentials was a bit too technical. This will naturally give a pretty bad impression of the Norwegian National Committee.</p>
   <p>The meeting was at last called to order by the president, Birger Osland. Mr. A. T. Juul demanded a report from the nine delegates who had been elected <span class="page-break">2</span>to the memorial meeting at the Sherman House. Quite a bit of criticism was directed against these nine delegates, "good and true". The vice-president Andrew Anderson, rose in their defense, and soon the usual argument--instead of discussion--was heard.</p>
   <p>It was finally decided that the Seventeenth of May festival should be held in Brand's Park, on Saturday, May 16, and Sunday, May 17. The members of the festival committee are: B. Osland, chairman; H. Jentoft, secretary; Andrew Anderson, John Malmstrom, and ten others.</p>
   <p>It was decided to give a concert for the benefit of the Children's Home. John Anderson editor of Skandinaven, was elected honorary chairman.</p>
   <p>Much was accomplished up to the point of the agenda that was set aside for the Tabitha Society; then the fireworks started. Mr. Juul took issue on the <span class="page-break">3</span>acceptance of the credentials of the Tabitha delegates. He also became very technical, and the debate (?) that followed reminded us of a session in the "Polish Parliament".</p>
   <p>It was finally decided to accept the credentials of the Tabitha delegates.</p>
