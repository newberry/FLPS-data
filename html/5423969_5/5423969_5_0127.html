   <p>The festivities of the day will be opened by Sleipner with the great public festival at Brand's Park. This festival starts at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The sports club, Sleipner, has gained a sort of prerogative among the Norwegian societies in Chicago, in regard to the outdoor celebration of this national day, and so far nobody has attempted to compete for the honor. It is, however, by no means the intention of the society to try to substitute the June 7th festival for that of May 17th. But the leaders of Sleipner believe that the May 17th memories will not fade by the celebration of June 7; on the contrary, they think, those memories will become re-vitalized and intensified.</p>
   <p>The program in Brand's Park will be of high grade. Music and singing will be excellent; Lawson's Orchestra and the Norwegian Glee Club will see to that.</p>
   <p>There will be speeches by Birger Osland, Consul Gade, and Senator Mason.</p>
   <p>The second phase of the festivities will start in Wicker Park Hall. Mayor Busse <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will be present and speak. Other speakers will be Consul Gade and Doctor Doe. The Norwegians Singing Society will sing. So also, will the well-known Eleonora Olsen, and the new wonder, Ethel Olsen, (the child of nature), will be introduced by Judge Torrison.</p>
   <p>Many have expressed their joy that Mable Krag is to render piano solos. The ladies class of the Norwegian Turnforening will give an exhibition.</p>
