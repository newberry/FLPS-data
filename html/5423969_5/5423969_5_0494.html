   <p>Our "distinguished friend (?)," Dr. Daa, in correspondence to Aften Posten (The Evening Post), states that America is no longer an El Dorado; he says that even in Chicago thousands are starving and stations serving free rolls and coffee are crowded day and night.</p>
   <p>Were it not that we know this is the "dope" that Aften Posten demands from its Chicago correspondent, we would be prone to think that Dr. Daa had become a Socialist.</p>
   <p>A more biased report has never appeared even in the Socialist press, and the article can have but one object in view: to discourage prospective immigrants and belittle the country in which the owners and employees of that paper are earning their living. Their attitude is that of the animal that "bites the hand that feeds it".</p>

   <p>In addition to his disparaging statements about the United States of America, Dr. Daa sagely advises that, in order to keep her citizens, Norway must provide a great deal of good land at a low price, reduce taxes (city and rural), and, above all, supply work for all those who are able to work. As to this statement we fully agree with Dr. Daa, but can Norway do all this under present economic conditions?</p>
   <p>As for America's no longer being an El Dorado, this statement is not only disrespectful but also misleading. America has never laid claim to this title, nor has America ever been an El Dorado for at least ninety per cent of its people, immigrants included. However, we do have certain advantages over every other country in the world.</p>
   <p>Our natural resources are practically unlimited, and the opportunities for people with initiative and the will to achieve are not equalled in any other country in the world. The population is steadily increasing in every section of the land, and along with it has come an increased demand for food, wearing apparel, housing, etc., all of which means heavier demands for work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In normal times the standard of living has been far better than could ever have been attained by our foreign-born citizens in any other country in the world. We at Scandia are Norwegians by birth or ancestry, and in our following statements let us emphasize that we do include Norway.</p>
   <p>Skilled workmen are always better paid here than in the old countries, as are common laborers; but to quote from a late report of the Labor Bureau of the British Board of Trade: "The skilled workman (with a trade) is receiving the highest rate of pay in the world, and the common laborer in the United States draws better pay, lives better, is better housed, and dresses better than the same type of worker in England, France, Belgium, and Germany, which, with the United States, constitute the five countries where the comparative survey has been made. Technical and professional incomes are also highest in the United States."</p>
   <p>One would imagine, after reading Dr. Daa's tirade, that Chicago was expected to do the impossible, i.e., absorb all immigrants west of New York and Brooklyn. This is impossible, though as far as our city is concerned we are doing more <span class="page-break">\4</span>than our share in the absorption program. In the building trades alone we might mention that under construction at the present time are no less than a dozen skyscrapers, with their attendant armies of architects, engineers, technicians, skilled mechanics, tradesmen, laborers, and clerical help.</p>
   <p>The fact that wages, work, living conditions, and opportunities are more attractive here is evidenced by the vigorous efforts being put forth by other countries to keep their citizens from emigrating to America. This outflow of population forms a difficult problem which requires the attention of each country's most brilliant minds. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Ireland all have felt the drain on their manpower, and even bonnie Scotland reports whole districts depopulated by the wanderlust with which all Europe seems infected.</p>
   <p>No--America is not an El Dorado where dollars can be picked up freely in the streets, but for such as have learned a trade or profession (including farm and dairy work), we present advantages and opportunities that no other country can or dare offer.</p>
