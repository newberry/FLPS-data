   <p>The Humboldt Park Mission on North Avenue, near California Avenue, opened yesterday evening with a well-arranged and successful social. Norwegian and American flags waved in front of the building, and the hall on the first floor was attractively decorated. The place was filled when Reverend C. S. Finwall welcomed the audience at eight o'clock.</p>
   <p>The audience sang, and Reverend F. L. Anderson, D. D., read from the Scriptures. The leader of the mission, Reverend C. W. Finwall, explained the reasons motivating the creation of this mission for young Norwegian men. A most interesting program was presented, and a strong appeal was made to the people to aid in maintaining the extensive work started.</p>
   <p>Tonight, from seven until ten o'clock, will be the young men's social evening.</p>
