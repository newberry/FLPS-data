   <p>Yesterday was a day of festivities at the Young Women's Home. This Norwegian-Danish institution has filled a long-felt want in the Scandinavian colony. More than two hundred young women lived in the Home during the past year. Miss E. Sorensen, the matron, has done a great job in making this institution a real home for the young women.</p>
   <p>Last week, the house in which the girls live was completed, hence the festivities. Ten new rooms were made available during May. There is now room for thirty-five more young women, and, no doubt, these rooms will soon be occupied.</p>
