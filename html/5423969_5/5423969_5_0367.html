   <p>The Chicago district of the Norwegian-Danish Methodists held its ministerial conference here a few days ago. The meeting was called to order by the district chairman. A resolutions committee was elected. Then followed a discussion on "Sermons as They Are, and as They Should Be". A rather long discussion on the saloon evil followed. A resolution was passed to appeal to all Christians to help in bringing about a national prohibition law.</p>
