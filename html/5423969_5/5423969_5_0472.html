   <p>p.4..........We hear a great deal of complaint regarding the slackness in our Norwegian churches, and attacks on "secret societies" are becoming more and more violent. While we have nothing against foreign missions we believe that in order to perpetuate our home churches, our pastors and lay preachers should change their tactics and do more local missionary work and make less effort to tear down organizations created for the welfare of their respective congregations and their families.</p>
   <p>In 1896 the students' missionary movement was started and has proved greatly beneficial. It was at this time too that the late Bishop Bugge (strictly High Church) paraphrased Mohomet thus-" When people will not come to church, the church must go to the people." The narrow-mindedness of our clergy (combined with splitting of hairs) and petty jealousies are gradually depopulating our churches and swelling the attendance at meetings of fanatics and atheists.</p>

   <p>Thousands of our best Norwegian people stay away from church on account of the attitude of our preachers toward all lodges that come under the terrible (?) head of secret orders. Many of our preachers, in private and from the pulpit, denounce members of all lodges as heathens, carrying a one way ticket to the heated regions, while lodge members, knowing the truth, smile, shrug their shoulders and choose the lodge in preference to such a church.</p>
   <p>Even a fraternal insurance society like the "Sons of Norway" is banned because it has a sign and password without which an outsider cannot enter the place of meeting. When such a lodge member dies, our preachers refuse to perform the burial ritual, and in many cases refuse to allow funeral services in the church; the lump of clay that once was a man is not fit to be born through the portals of what is supposedly a "House of God." Or - possibly a few of our Norwegian preachers have a monopoly on Heaven or have built one of their own.</p>
   <p>The result of the attitude of these preachers is that lodge members, their families and friends lose faith in our churches, and stay away from them entirely.</p>

   <p>Only a year ago one of our preachers thundered and roared, in pulpit and press, because the "Nordfelles" Lodge read its simple ritual at the grave of a departed brother,and the ecclesiastical higness refused to perform the ritual of the church (ashes to ashes,etc). This departed brother and especially all masons are irrevocably bound for the lake of fire, according to our learned pinheads of the church.</p>
   <p>Some of these same authorities on righteousness, who condemn the souls of their fellow men, see nothing wrong in joining hands to steal the life savings of their congregations and making their churches a stock exchange for mine swindles.</p>
   <p>The church (as our preachers are making it) may be acceptable in the less enlightened backwood districts, but to our wide awake, intelligent city dweller it is a cross between idiocy and intolerance. A modern reform is badly needed. Let it come before the whole churchly structure collapses.</p>
