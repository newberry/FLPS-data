   <p>It is not often the Chicago Daily News can find time to discuss matters Scandinavian, but whenever it does turn its attention to Norse affairs, our esteemed contemporary never fails to produce something novel and interesting. A fresh instance of this kind is a grave and learned editorial published by the News a couple of days ago and which in part reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Sweden and Norway"</p>
   <p>"There has been a long contest going on between the two nations that compose the empire of Sweden and Norway. The quarrel dates back to the union of the little states in 1815, which was then supposed to be a permanent one. But the stipulations upon which the union was based were, at the very start of the new government, found to be so loosely and vaguely drawn that the rights of the two powers under them could not be determined. The consequence is <span class="page-break">2</span>that the organic law of the empire is capable of two or more constructions and for eighty years this has been a constant bone of contention between the two countries.</p>
   <p>"The point that has been the most sharply contested has been that dealing with the local affairs of the states. The act of union reserved to the general government all action relating to their common affairs but the local interests of each remained under the jurisdiction of the individual states themselves. The prolonged dispute has been over what constituted common and local interests. The Norwegians have contended that, as their economical interests conflict with those of Sweden, they should have a separate consular service, and to this the Swedes have objected. The wrangling over this continued unabated until 1893 when the Norwegian Storthing, exasperated by Swedish opposition, refused to appropriate its share of money to the support of the joint consular service of the empire. To this the council of state at Stockholm replied by assessing the amount against Norway 'for unforeseen expenses'. This was an additional brand to the rather active quarrel between the two states.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"So far, neither country has been willing to yield and the contest now involves the subjection of Norway to Sweden. The Norwegian Storthing has adopted a distinct flag, which has created indignation at Stockholm. This act of Norway is, in the opinion of the Swedes, unconstitutional and the king refuses to ratify it. It is believed his refusal to approve will add to the determination of Norway to insist on what it claims to be its rights under the constitution."</p>
   <p>The article closes by asserting that the Scandinavian quarrel has a most ominous and sinister bearing upon the peace of Europe and, incidentally, upon the general welfare of the world at large.</p>
   <p>It is probably rude to pick flaws in such a nice expose of the "Scandinavian question," yet the Skandinaven feels constrained to correct a few minor inaccuracies which have crept into the article of the News.</p>
   <p>To begin with, there is no such thing as "the empire of Sweden and Norway". There is a kingdom of Sweden and a kingdom of Norway, both sovereign states.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>They form a union for certain specified purposes; but they do not constitute an empire or one individual sovereignty. Hence the "organic law" of the empire is a fiction also. Their relations are set forth in an "act of union"; but this compact is not an "organic law": in Sweden, it may be changed as easily as a law prohibiting vagrancy; in Norway, not quite so readily.</p>
   <p>Like most partners, Sweden and Norway have had their differences, but never concerning "the local affairs" of the states. Inasmuch as each of these "states" is a sovereignty, the one has nothing to do with the "local affairs" of the other. They have nothing in common except the king and the administration of foreign relations.</p>
   <p>The present arrangement of foreign affairs is unsatisfactory in some respects, and this has been the cause of friction; but a final adjustment acceptable to both countries is in sight.</p>
   <p>The Storthing did not refuse, in 1873, "to appropriate its share of money to the support of the joint consular service of the empire." Nor did Sweden "assess the amount against Norway". There was a disagreement concerning <span class="page-break">5</span>the legation in Vienna, but no amount was "assessed against Norway".</p>
   <p>The contest does not involve "the subjection of Norway to Sweden." The latter country is content with the status quo, if a more satisfactory arrangement of their common affairs cannot be effected. The Swedes do not maintain, and never did, that the adoption of a "distinct flag" by Norway is "unconstitutional". Norway has a "distinct flag" now, and, moreover, the constitution with which such an enactment is supposed to conflict does not exist and never did. The party of the left in Norway desires the removal of the "union jack" from the flag, and while they regard such a step as unwise, the Swedes are rather indifferent in the matter.</p>
   <p>A committee composed of fourteen members, seven Norwegians and seven Swedes, is now at work endeavoring to harmonize the differences between the two countries by devising a juster and more equitable system for the administration of foreign affairs.</p>
   <p>Having thus pointed out the trifling mistakes of our contemporary, the <span class="page-break">6</span>Skandinaven is pleased to acknowledge that in all other respects the expose given by the News is perfectly faultless.</p>
   <p>Another thing it shows us is that few American journalists know European history; yes, we can go so far as to say that they do not know the history of their own United States.</p>
   <p>It has been said time and time again that the Scandinavians are further advanced in this respect than any other nation, even further advanced than the "full-fledged" bluestocking.</p>
