   <p>The roster of the Dewey reception committee presents an imposing array of more or less well-known names. But although the committee is as strong in numbers as it could be without becoming too unwieldy, it fails to represent adequately the cosmopolitan population of Chicago. The Norwegians and Danes constitute important and valuable elements of our people; they were among our early settlers and had done a great deal of hard work for the upbuilding of the city long before His Honor was born into this hustling community. But they are not represented on Mayor Harrison's committee. The Swedes have received some recognition, if not all that they are fairly entitled to; but Danes and Norwegians will look in vain for representation among His Honor's "three hundred". In a supplementary list appears the name of H. L. Hertz [Dane], but this attempted afterthought reparation only serves to emphasize the slight.</p>
   <p>If these nationalities had remained unresponsive to the call of patriotism; if they had taken no part in defending the flag on the field of battle, their <span class="page-break">2</span>scornful treatment might have been justified in a measure. But none responded more readily to the summons of the country. They had their full share of the hardships, fighting, and honors of war. The first shot in the battle of Manila was fired by a Dane, and the only man who in that battle received a wound that ended his life was a Norwegian. Rudolph Clausen, one of the heroic crew on the Merrimac, is a Dane. A large number of blue-jackets on our warships are Norwegians and Danes, and in all of the Northwestern and Western volunteer regiments who have fought with such courage and dash in the Philippines, the Scandinavians constitute a large percentage of the rank and file of these organizations.</p>
   <p>In view of these facts, which are potent to all who care to know, the slight put upon the Norwegians and Danes in making up the Dewey reception committee can hardly be regarded as an oversight. It is but just to assume that in performing a function of this character, Mayor Harrison exercised great care, and that the Norwegians and Danes were left out because they were not wanted. They can bear the insult, but regret, in common with other good citizens, that public officers <span class="page-break">3</span>called to voice the sentiment of Chicago on an occasion of great importance should have been controlled by such a puny spirit of prejudice and pusillanimity.</p>
