   <p>In our Saviour's Church a very interesting discussion took place last Thursday. The question was, "Punishment after death as pictured by Pastor W. Becker, Dr. Thomas, and others".</p>
   <p>It must be admitted that the subject brought many things to light, which would have been very good for the ears of our unfaithful. Pastors Juul and Mikkelsen and Dr. Julson were present to answer any questions. The church was full to the last seat.</p>
