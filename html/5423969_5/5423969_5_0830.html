   <p>Chicago now has a new Norwegian youth society that is different. Ordinarily we would not encourage the organization of another society of this kind, as there are too many of them now in dead water. The reason for this lethargy seems to be that their officers are too prone to hold onto the old ideas. They are practically trying to put old heads on young shoulders, while the young people today demand more recreation and light entertainment rather than staid old programs of long readings, dry lectures, and psalm singing.</p>
   <p>Young people's groups in Norway noticed the changing times when music and dancing across the street drew their members away and left their own halls empty. They have since made the necessary changes.</p>
   <p>The new Chicago group takes its name from a well-known place in Norway, Lindenes. They plan a program of socials, dances, concerts, debates, and all other clean-cut entertainment that may be demanded. A performance of a play by Hulda Garborg is in preparation, and it should prove highly entertaining <span class="page-break">\2</span>when coupled with real Norwegian music, folk-dance exhibition, and folk-songs.</p>
   <p>Scandia predicts a good future for this new society, and wishes them every success.</p>
