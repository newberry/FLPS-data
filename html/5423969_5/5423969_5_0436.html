   <p>The convention of the United Lutheran Church appropriated $50,386.96 for the past year. This figure included an outstanding debt of $7,756.56. Income for the year totaled $45,222.13. Accumulated debts to date amount to $12,876.74. Experience has taught us that we cannot anticipate an annual income of more than $45,000; a yearly deficit of from $5,000 to $6,000 is therefore inevitable.</p>
   <p>The income from 1,094 congregations this year was $44,444.22. This is an average of $40.70 from each congregation. The assessed amount for each congregation should be $41.77.</p>
