   <p>The arrival of the "Viking" on July 12, 1893, will be remembered as one of the most interesting and memorable incidents in the history of American Scandinavians. It was only after much effort and trouble that it was arranged, and the Scandinavians here can now say that the effort was worth it.</p>
   <p>The "Viking's" reception in this harbor was the most brilliant naval demonstration Chicago has ever witnessed. The whole city turned out to view the coming of the swan-like craft, and the press extended generous and enthusiastic greetings to the ship and its crew of brave, daring sailors..... The voyage of the "Viking" had been a victorious one from the hour it left its home port until it approached the port of the "white city". Great and enthusiastic crowds lined the shores of the inland waters it traversed, and the reception given it on the coast of New England has been repeated everywhere that its sail has been furled. The "Viking" is an especial object of eager and justifiable pride to our Scandinavian population.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Their fellow Americans recognize their special claim to the honors of the day, but insist on sharing the interest with them. The hardy craft that carried its high and doughty stem across ocean billows before the science of navigation had made progress adequate even to the later needs of Columbus is well worth the wonder and admiration with which it is everywhere hailed. Now with the caravels and the "Viking" in port, the waters at the "white city" present a more complete appearance of historical dignity and beauty. The little ships will be among the most pathetic (sic) and noble attractions of the Fair from the time of their arrival until the snows of next winter will hide their frail but heroic forms from view.</p>
   <p>...The "Viking" comes on a peaceful mission. Its errand is only to remind the people of America of the voyages made by the daring Bjorn, the son of Herolf, in the year 981, and by Leif Ericson, in the year 1000, to the eastern shores of this country. The ancient Vikings have received too little credit for their discovery of the New World; their fame has been overshadowed by that of Columbus and the Spanish navigators. It is not to set history right that the"Viking" is brought here, for history has duly recorded the achievements <span class="page-break">3</span>of the Norsemen, but it is to impress the historical facts more deeply upon the minds of the people. The thousands who will look upon the staunch little ship while it remains at the World's Fair will not soon forget that to the Norsemen belongs the honor of first having seen and set foot upon the new continent. That is the lesson the "Viking" is meant to teach.</p>
   <p>.... Today is Leif's day, and the model of his little boat is queen of the Chicago harbor. What a wonderful little craft she is to be sure--this "Viking"!</p>
   <p>Last week you wondered at the caravels and at the skill and daring of the sailors. Now go look at the tiny, open boat in which the bold Norsemen went to sea, not only to discover lands, but to conquer them and to pile up material for the romancers of a later century. It is wonderful, yes, wonderful; no less so whether the stout Leif really went a-continent-hunting or whether he was blown out of his course to the rocky coast of Vineland (sic).</p>
   <p>.... Neither the "Viking" nor the Vikings who sailed it all the way across <span class="page-break">4</span>the stormy Atlantic and the great fresh-water lakes can complain that there was any lack of warmth in the reception tendered them yesterday on sea and shore.</p>
   <p>They were received in Evanston by a flotilla larger than that which went forth to greet the caravels, and crowded with men more imbued with exuberant enthusiasm than those who went to meet the Santa Maria and her consorts.</p>
   <p>Nor was the Mayor absent from the reception. The reception at Jackson Park, though late in the afternoon, was a great success.</p>
   <p>.... Another ship of discovery now rides at anchor off the "white city". The "Viking" is at last side by side with the three caravels, the Santa Maria, Pinta and Nina. Their wonderful voyages of discovery were five hundred years apart in time and still wider apart in routes and accessories, but they find common anchorage at Chicago.</p>
   <p>Judging from the public interest taken in the arrival of the "Viking" one <span class="page-break">5</span>would suppose Leif Ericson's discovery of America was the beginning of the New World's history. The "Viking" may be said to have come into her own and to have been received with a sense of national fellowship. But even had there not been a Scandinavian in our entire population, the "Viking" would have been assured of a most cordial welcome, for every intelligent American must recognize in that voyage of nine centuries ago one of the most remarkable feats of human enterprise.</p>
   <p>When the route of the original Vikings is taken into consideration it is not surprising that no more came of it. That was before the days of the mariner's compass. America reached from Europe only via Greenland and Iceland would have probably remained an unexplored wilderness. Columbus discovered a practical route, having the compass as a guide to his rudder.</p>
   <p>The "Viking" was ahead of the times. The science of navigation needed to be further developed before the New World could become a veritable annex to the Old World. But the very fact that the Norsemen made their great achievement <span class="page-break">6</span>before the day of modern navigation had developed so much as a morning star to relieve the darkness of the horizon, makes it all the more astonishing that Scandinavian sea kings crossed the Atlantic just as the tenth century was making room for the eleventh, and while Europe was still black with medieval night. No welcome could have been more cordial or sincere.</p>
   <p>While she remained at Jackson Park the "Viking" was admired by countless and eager throngs from all parts of the country.</p>
   <p>Captain Magnus Anderson intended to present the ship to the national government, and in the fall of 1893 she left Chicago to make her way to Washington by way of the Illinois Canal and River and the Mississippi River. But among the Scandinavians of Chicago it was generally held that the ship ought to remain here. A committee of representative men was formed to ascertain whether the Columbian Museum would accept the "Viking" as a gift from the Scandinavian citizens of the United States, if the ship could be secured for that purpose. To a letter addressed to him by the chairman of the <span class="page-break">7</span>"Viking" committee, Mr. Ed. E. Ayer, chairman of the finance committee of the Field Columbian Museum on December 16, 1893, replied as follows:</p>
   <p>"Your letter asking whether the Columbian Museum would like to have the 'Viking', at hand. We do desire it very much. The caravels will be in the Museum, and we want the 'Viking' with them. There will be a special effort made to show the evolution of transportation by sea and land, and nothing would fit in better than the 'Viking'. I trust you will have no difficulty in securing her and having her brought back to Chicago in the Spring."</p>
   <p>This authoritative reply was considered satisfactory. The "Viking" committee immediately went to work to collect funds. The ship was bought from the committee in Norway, and on October 13, 1894 it was formally transferred to the board of directors of the Museum with the understanding that it was to be placed in the Museum in accordance with the letter of Mr. Ayer.</p>
   <p>But thus far the directors have failed to fulfill their part of the agreement. From October 13th, 1894, until last fall the "Viking" remained in the open air without any protection whatever. That she suffered great damage while thus <span class="page-break">8</span>exposed to wind and weather goes without saying. Last fall she was housed in with boards and has remained in that condition until recently. Now it is proposed to put her in the lagoon, which cannot but work speedy and complete destruction.</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven is loath to believe that the Museum directors will fail to prevent what would be a flagrant instance of disgraceful vandalism. The ship is a gift to the Museum, solicited by the representatives of the board and accepted on the express condition that it should be put in the Museum to form, permanently, part and parcel of its collection of ethnographic and historical specimens. As yet the board has done nothing to fulfill its agreement, and now it is proposed to make such disposition of the historic craft as would make her speedy destruction inevitable.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to explain the attitude of the directors in this matter by assuming that they have not been fully aware of the precise nature of the terms upon which the ship was presented and accepted. They are honorable gentlemen who would not knowingly commit such a self-evident breach of faith.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Now that their attention has been called to the character of the contract they have entered into, it is confidently expected that they will take prompt and final action regarding the situation and place the "Viking" in the Museum where she belongs. This paper will do its part to make them do so.</p>
