   <p>A new men's society was formed in the Chicago Norwegian colony last Monday. A number of the male members of St. John's congregation gathered at the church rectory and organized the St. John's Norwegian Men's Society. Any man interested in religious matters may become a member of the Society, but the board of directors is to consist of members of the congregation. Meetings are held on the third Monday of every month.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Society is to join the men of the congregation in common understanding and interest in activities for the extension and upbuilding of the affairs of the church.</p>
   <p>The Society will sponsor social gatherings to further its purpose.</p>
