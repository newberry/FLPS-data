   <p>At the annual meeting of this congregation a board of trustees was elected. The meeting instructed the secretary to send a letter of thanks to the Ladies' Aid Society and to the Young People's Society, both of which have donated large amounts to the building fund of the church. The finances of the church are in good condition, there being a surplus of $92 in the treasury. It was resolved not to print the treasurer's report.</p>
