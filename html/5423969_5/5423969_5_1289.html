   <p>Anton E. Heier, the well-known Norwegian-American theatrical artist, passed away at his home on So.Park Ave.on Nov. 13th. His death means the loss of one of the old stand-bys in the theatrical world, and theatrical and lodge circles lose a cherished member. Mr. Heier was a pupil of Wergemand, who painted all scenic decorations of the beautiful Christiania theatre, and later he worked with Bjornstjerne in completing the decoration of the People's Theatre. Here his talent was given recognition for the first time.</p>
   <p>As a young man he immigrated to America, arriving in Chicago two weeks before the great fire. He has worked steadily at his profession, since his arrival, and has been commended for his excellent work at all times. In spite of his continuous work and its high quality, Mr. Heier did not accumulate much of this world's goods. Graft and shrewdness had been left out of his make-up and his modesty was, like virtue, its own reward; he died a comparatively poor man.</p>
   <p>A throng of friends and admirers attended the last rites and many spoke <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>feelingly of his life's work, his generous and loving character and his quiet unobtrusive manner.</p>
   <p>Except for his wife, who survives him, he had no relatives.</p>
   <p>Rev. Kittelsby, Mr. Heier's pastor and friend for many years, officiated at both church and cemetery services.</p>
