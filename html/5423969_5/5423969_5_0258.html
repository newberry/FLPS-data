   <p>At a meeting held yesterday at the Christ Church, Bishop Stuyen took up the question of English in the Norwegian churches. He spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"On the vital question of language in our church work, we must use English whenever the youth, who usually do not understand Norwegian, are present at our services. Never try to preach the Gospel in Norwegian to those who do not understand it, but preach in English, and the old people and others that understand only Norwegian should be patient and speak that language as long as they can."</p>
   <p>This is a very sensible statement. We have in our churches many pastors who either wish to speak only Norwegian or change entirely to English. This change should come gradually. The bishop is right.</p>
