   <p>We published an article in our last issue concerning the unifying movement among the synods of the Lutheran church in America. We are now advised that the joint committee, which has been in session during the entire week, has agreed on a plan of union to be presented at the annual meetings of the individual synods. Let us hope that the newly awakened spirit of tolerance will prevail, so that the good work of the committee may materialize.</p>
