   <p>A news item appearing in Skandinaven about a week ago needs correction since it tends to support a mistaken opinion by a large number of our Norwegian Lutheran people in and outside of Chicago concerning the religious paper, Evangelisten, as well as concerning the Norwegian Evangelical Free Church in this city.</p>
   <p>Evangelisten is not a Lutheran paper and it is not published by the Norwegian Lutheran congregation. The paper contains much good edifying material, but it supports the Norwegian free church movement which is connected with the American Congregational Church....The paper is worthy of recommendation to Congregationalists but not to Lutherans...I feel it my duty to call the attention <span class="page-break">\2</span>of Norwegian Lutherans to the fact the Evangelisten is not Lutheran.</p>
   <p>Many of our Christian people who on coming from Norway are not acquainted with church conditions in America; but, being opposed to the state church in Norway, they get the impression that our Norwegian Lutheran Church in America is identical with the state church in Norway, and that the free church movement here corresponds to the Lutheran Free Church in Norway. The truth is, of course, that every Lutheran congregation in America is a free church. We have no state church here. But not every free church is Lutheran....Why need we have this lack of clear information in regard to the confession of faith and the true character of the Norwegian Free Church?</p>
