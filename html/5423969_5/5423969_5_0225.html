   <p>The Stavanger Society conducted a well attended meeting last Sunday at Wicker Park Hall, preliminary to the great Stavanger Convention to be held at Ottawa, Illinois. This convention is an annual affair, with participants from places in U. S. and Canada where there are people hailing from the ancient city of Stavanger, Norway, and enough interested to go to the convention. Indications are that a very large delegation will meet from Chicago.</p>
   <p>A special train has been charted for the group, a special music corps will render service, and special flags have been provided for the parade from the railroad station in Ottawa to the park where the convention is to be held.</p>
   <p>The objective of the Stavanger Society is purely social, to bring together old acquaintances from the districts around Stavanger, and to develop new acquaintanceships and friendships between people having a common back-ground.</p>
