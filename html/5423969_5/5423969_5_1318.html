   <p>A festival was held in Wicker Park Hall last night in honor of one of Chicago's most prominent Norwegians, Dr. Niles T. Quales. Nearly every representative Norwegian attended this affair. Of the several hundred present, we want to name the following who were seated at the main table: Consul Oscar H. Haugan, Hauman G. Haugan, Nicolay Grevstad, Dr. Anders Doe, Revrend F. Ring, Andreas Erickson, Henry Haugan, Dr. H. G. Stub, Hans Oftedal, Reverend [H. B.] Kildahl, E. A. Erickson and Richard Haugan.</p>
   <p>L. Haugan's orchestra furnished the music, and the Norwegian Singing Society, under the direction of Emil Bjorn, rendered the most delightful Norwegian songs.</p>
   <p>The main speaker of the evening, Nicolay Grevstad, spoke as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"Mr. Toastmaster, Honored Guest, and Other Friends! I am very much afraid that I shall fall short of what we all feel here tonight. Anyone of us has in his or her heart a speech that is far better than any that I can make. Perhaps none of us could express in words what we really think of our honored friend, nor the fullness of our respect and love for him. His upright character, his fine public spirit, his generous kindness, without display, to people in distress, have won for him the good will of all. However, there is also another, a special reason why we think so much of him: We love him for his amazing skill in getting into the pockets of everybody. And everybody seems to like it; those who have been made to pay most honor him all the more for it.</p>
   <p>"We are proud of Dr. Quales. He is what a citizen born in Norway should be--a good Norwegian and a good American. He has served his own people well, and he has served his adopted country well. He came here, a young man in his prime, on the eve of the trememdous struggle for the life of the Union. He heard the call of his new mother and enlisted for the war. A few years later, <span class="page-break">\3</span>when Chicago was in the throes of the Great Fire, we find him as head of the Marine Hospital, cool, resolute, and resourceful; no harm touched any life committed to his care in that awful crisis.</p>
   <p>"Since then, his life has been devoted mainly to the welfare of our people in this city. No one knows all that he has done to help the needy during all these years, for he has always concealed from the left hand what his right hand was doing. But go among our people, ask those who have had a hard time of it, and you will get touching glimpses of the work of this ministering angel as he has been going about quietly from home to home, healing and comforting the sick and distressed, often leaving a dollar for medicine on top of his prescription, and maybe another dollar for bread.</p>
   <p>"In later years, he has become the foremost representative of organized charity among us. When we, as a people, had reached the stage where it became a pressing <span class="page-break">\4</span>duty to make better provisions for our sick, our orphans, and our old people, Dr. Quales was one of the first to take up the work. It was soon found that it would be best to specialize, so to speak, and he came to devote his labor mainly to one branch of it; the old people's home. But his influence has been much wider. His early call to arms for organized charity work, his inspiring faith and enthusiasm, his wise counsel and moderation, his courage and perseverance, his rare power to harmonize, to unite and to lead, and to get other good men and women to work with him--especially the women, for what they have done and are doing is really wonderful--all this has done much to build the other splendid institutions we now have among us, not only in Chicago, but also in many other places in the country. This is truly a great and noble work. As we now look back upon the modest beginnings and the many trials, we can only wonder that so much has been accomplished in such a short time.</p>
   <p>"Nor is he done yet. He may slacken his pace, but he cannot rest. He is <span class="page-break">\5</span>still full of plans and work. Only the other day he spoke of the home in Norwood Park, the largest old people's home in Chicago--which certainly is something every Norwegian may justly be proud of--he spoke of this fine home as merely the first wing of the institution to be built there. Before we know it, he may have another wing ready.</p>
   <p>"The days of our years are threescore and ten; and if by reason of strength, they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow, 'says the Good Book. Our friend has had the strength to reach fourscore years. For that he owes thanks to his Maker and also to the sturdy Norse stock from which he sprang. His life has been useful, in the very largest sense. For that, his native land and his adopted country, his own people and his fellow citizens, owe thanks to him. His has indeed been a life of labor, but largely for the welfare of others. Like most of us, he has also had his measure of sorrow, and he has himself added to it by sharing the sorrows of so many others. Such a life is a sweet, a beautiful, and a blessed life.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"For all his good and noble work we give him our most sincere thanks. We rejoice in having him with us tonight, hale and hearty, full of years and honor, yet young and strong in mind and heart. We fervently hope that he may keep his splendid powers for years to come, and we hope and believe that a broad span of usefulness is still before him. We pledge him that as long as he leads we will cheerfully follow.</p>
   <p>"Dr. Quales, our most cordial and sincere greetings to you and yours on this happy day! May continued health and strength and all other good things of life be yours in the fullest measure! And God bless you!"</p>
   <p>Then the members of the Singers' League stepped forward, and under the direction of Mr. Bjorn, sang "Jeg Vil Vaerge Mit Land" [I Will Defend My Land]. The president of the Singers' League, Carl Gulbransen, then rose to congratulate Dr. Quales, after which the entire audience rose to sing the Norwegian <span class="page-break">\7</span>national anthem, "Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet" [Yes, We Love the Land that Towers].</p>
   <p>The next speaker, Hauman G. Haugan, spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"Write me as one who loves his fellowmen,' said the Arab to the angel, and lo! his name led all the rest'. The poet's description fits our guest of honor perfectly. By his kind acts and deeds he has proved to our satisfaction that he loves his fellowmen; and I assert, without fear of contradiction, that as a true philanthropist he heads the list among our people.</p>
   <p>"Day after day, year after year, we have seen him labor patiently and perseveringly to build up and maintain that institution to which he has devoted the best part of fifteen years of his life. His enthusiasm, integrity, and good common sense brought to his side the support of other good men and women.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Through their united efforts and under his leadership, all obstacles and difficulties were overcome; success crowned their struggles and now stands completed that grand monument to which the name of our dear old doctor always will be linked--the Norwegian Old People's Palace, I mean Home!</p>
   <p>"Dr. Quales! Our friends have given me the pleasant duty to present you, on this eightieth anniversary of your birthday, with this loving cup as a token of our admiration and high esteem. It is filled plumb full with love and the best wishes. And with it goes a heartfelt, God bless you and keep you!"</p>
   <p>Then came the reading of telegrams, cards, and letters of congraulations from everywhere, including a telegram from the Scandinavian Physicians Society, a letter from the Home for the Aged, and a number of private cards, letters, and telegrams from various doctors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Then Reverend Ellestad spoke for the Norwegian Orphanage; Dr. Marie Olsen for the Scandinavian hospitals; Reverend Anda for the church Dr. Quales joined in 1879; Carl B. Becker for the Norwegian National League; and a host of others spoke as individuals or in the name of various organizations.</p>
   <p>At this time, calls came from the guests requesting to hear from Dr. Quales. The doctor responded in the following words:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen! You have overwhelmed me with kindness. I am at a loss: I cannot find words wherewith to express adequately my high appreciation and my sincere and deep gratitude for this great honor which you so kindly have bestowed upon me. These kind words, so kindly spoken, have impressed me deeply, and these beautiful and costly gifts are treasures that will be highly valued and prized by myself, and will remain as a precious heritage in the family for generations to come.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>"In behalf of my good wife, my family, and myself, I thank you all from the very bottom of my heart. I thank you a thousand times. I would be less than human if I did not feel elated and pleased by this manifestation of kindness and of honor. Yet I should not be worthy of your confidence, Mr. Toastmaster, if I selfishly arrogated all this to myself. It is, I take it, a testimony of approval of our efforts to ameliorate the sufferings and needs of our people, and the credit and the honor for this justly belongs to those noble-hearted men and women whose faithful and unselfish labor has brought about such desirable results.</p>
   <p>"As for myself, I have done but little to merit consideration, I have been plodding along in a humble, homespun sort of way, striving neither for riches, nor for honor, nor glory. It has been my good fortune to have been associated, in our benevolent work, with men of means, of ability, and of character. Many of them have now laid down their burdens of life, and we are enjoying the fruits of their labor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>"We are all children of circumstance and environment. In 1866, when I took up my lifework in the city, the Cook County supervisors established the first hospital, and I had the good fortune to be chosen house physician. In this capacity I came in contact with a large number of Scandinavian immigrants, and got a fairly good understanding of what it meant to be an immigrant in those days. They came over the ocean in small vessels, a voyage taking from three weeks to three months. When they reached the American shore, they were crowded into filthy cars and transported to their destination. Many whose resources ran short were dumped off here in Chicago. Generally, they were in a miserable condition. The railroad companies made no provision for them. For days and nights, in rain or shine, they were left without shelter. Those brought into the hospital were not only sick but downhearted and discouraged. They were strangers in a strange land; they could not even ask for a drink of water. My heart went out to these people, and it came to me then that I had a mission in this field--a conviction I have not been able to shake off.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>"With the exception of the Scandinavian Emigrant Society, we had no charitable organization at this time. How different it is now! Our charitable work is now carried on systematically and along well-defined lines. Our institutions are now well established and well taken care of . Last year was a year of special progress. The Tabitha Hospital paid its debt. The Deaconess Hospital completed its main building, modern in construction and with modern equipment. The Norwegian Orphanage is permanently located in Edison Park with plenty of ground and commodious buildings. The Home for the Aged, in Norwood Park, has about doubled its capacity. What we now lack is a home for our incurables and a sanitarium for our consumptives.</p>
   <p>"In closing these disjointed remarks, I wish to state as the absolute truth that I harbor ill will toward none and good will to all, and with this confession I again thank you with all my heart."</p>
   <p>This ended the affair. Everyone unanimously agreed that it had been a grand affair--for a grand man.</p>
