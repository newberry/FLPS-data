   <p>The annual meeting of Matthew Norwegian Lutheran Church shows the congregation to be in good shape. Reports show that one hundred and three services were held during the year, fifty-four in the Norwegian language and forty-nine in English. Under the new arrangement the attendance at the English services increased until of late it has been twice as large as at the attendance at the Norwegian services. Sunday school was held on forty-seven Sundays; Saturday school, sixteen days. There were eighty-six hours of instruction for confirmation.</p>
   <p>Thirty-two adults and eight children were received into the congregation....The minister has also served as a substitute for other ministers in a few cases; he held Sunday school on seven Sundays at the Home Finding Society's Receiving Home and held three services there also.</p>
