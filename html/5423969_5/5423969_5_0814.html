   <p>The remaining battalion of the Fifteenth Regiment of the Wisconsin Volunteers will hold a reunion at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the Grand Encampment of the G. A. R., on August, 1889.</p>
   <p>All comrades of the old Scandinaven Regiment are ordered to attend. Arrangements will be made for headquarters during our stay.</p>
   <p>Our membership is decreasing and we are getting older. This opportunity will be the best that we shall have in years--and to many of us it will be the last.</p>
   <p>A number of our old brigade comrades have signed expressing their intention to be present.</p>
   
   <p>The above notice brings to us the thought that time flies, and that this is a grand opportunity to meet our old friends of the Wisconsin Regiment again.</p>
   <p>A great many of the comrades live in Chicago; we should turn out 100% strong. Chicago comrades of the Scandinaven Regiment, let us show Wisconsin that we are alive.</p>
