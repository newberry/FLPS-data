   <p>Editor of Skandinaven:</p>
   <p>The most remarkable Norseman of contemporary history is on his way to Chicago. He will be our guest in a few days. How deeply his career has stirred his fellow-countrymen, no one knows better than the men of the press, through whose hands has passed every item of the Saga of our new Fridtjof Nansen and "Fram," [that] will live in song and story as "Ja Vi Elsker Detta Landet" [Yes, We Love the Land that Towers] in ever self-renewing youth, because Nansen's and his fellow-comrades' exploits have reincarnated national ideals, half-buried sometimes under the dregs of weary commonplace, but never extinct. From Leif Ericson to Tordenskjold [Dane], thence to our Fridtjof of today seems but a span. In the person of Nansen are embodied Erik the Red, Snorri Sturluson, King Olaf of Stiklestad, the men of Eidsvold, Henrik Wergeland, and all that <span class="page-break">2</span>is noble between Lindesnes and North Cape, and more--for our own pulses beat quicker in his presence, because in him all Norway and her noblest manhood and womanhood stand erect, breathe, and move before our eyes.</p>
   <p>Now were we in Norway instead of the United States, there would be no difficulty about the final form the feeling our heart and mind would assume in regard to such a personality. There is only one means by which it can find its truest expression, i.e., through art. The artist becomes an essential supplement of the national life of any people who give the world a hero. Genuine heroism in all spheres is immortal. When the special form it assumes reincarnates specific aspirations, it transforms the very mountains and endows [us] with imperishable and inspiring memories.</p>
   <p>Here we are in Chicago, a Norse-American colony upwards of a hundred thousand souls, conceded by all to be model American citizens; but how deeply our heart strings vibrate to the music of the magnificent surf which beats against our <span class="page-break">3</span>native shores we realized only when [the] "Fram" was making her way southward from the "Farthest North".</p>
   <p>Now then, Mr. Editor, may I be permitted to suggest that this is the time above all others, when we should call on our artists in color or marble [to depict] this immortal page in our history. The great Art Institute of Chicago, so far as its permanent collections go, is absolutely destitute of a single art work in oil or marble of direct Norse origin. When we remember that Thorwaldsen was an Icelander and therefore a lineal Norseman, and recall our Tidemand, our Gude, our Eilil Petterson, our Skredsvig, our Sindings, etc., of today, this is a deplorable and needless wrong, and injures us in the estimate of our fellow-citizens of discriminating culture and refinement. This is precisely the time when this ought to be righted. Mr. C. Asbjornsen has proven by his bust of Boyesen that he is master of his art, and he is an honor to us. He ought to have not only one, but several commissions for first-class portrait busts of Fridtjof Nansen. Not cheap plaster affairs, but bona fide marble or bronze busts that will honor any parlor or art institute.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>A subscription for such a work to be placed among the permanent sculpture division in our Chicago Institute would undoubtedly meet with response.</p>
   <p>For emulation it may be mentioned that the well-known lumber merchant Thorsen has placed two beautiful Norway landscapes in Layton's gallery in Milwaukee. Surely, Chicago has favored not a few of our countrymen more than sufficiently to do as much in behalf of the far older and wealthier Norse colony here. We ought to have a first-class bust of Nansen. We ought to have a picture of [the] "Fram" by Sindings.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. Editor, allow me once more to call attention to the fact that Sindings' wonderful work, "Along Northern Seas," is still unsold and in the hands of the Anderson Art Company. It is one of the most powerful portrayals of snow-clad mountains along the Lofoten Islands ever made. It is there where the North Polar and the Gulf currents meet, and by so doing,bring down the mighty schools of cod that feed all Catholic Europe during the Lenten season.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>It is exactly these very Northern Seas that have bred men of the Nansen type and so made the "Fram's" journey the Saga that it is.</p>
   <p>"Art" says the poet, "is long, time is fleeting," and to our artists and to those of them borne along the Northern Seas, we must go if we wish to permanently and truly commemorate Nansen's visit to America.</p>
   <p>Chicago leads the Northwest in all matters. Let it be said that we Norsemen of Chicago lead Nansen's countrymen of the United States in this worthy, and as the writer believes, the only certain method by which Nansen's presence can be adequately commemorated for the living, and convey its lesson to those who come after us.</p>
