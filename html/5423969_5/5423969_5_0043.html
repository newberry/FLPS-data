   <p>About 1,500 people turned out for Leif Ericson Day. The weather was raw and chilly, the lake breeze adding additional discomfort for the many Norwegians who had assembled on the Outer Drive. The festival started in Humboldt Park, at the statue of Leif. Thousands were at the festival in the Stevens Hotel. The total participating amounted to forty or fifty thousand. Consul Olaf Bernts and Professor Julius E. Olsen spoke in Humboldt Park. About 11 A.M., the people assembled near the Chicago Yacht club. Hundreds of sail and motor boats were ready to sail out on the lake to meet the Viking Ship and Leif Erikson. Soon the salute sounded from the yacht pier. The official guard boats were manned by "Vikings" clad in chain mail armor, the boats having a row of shields along each gunwale. Later, after landing, the "Vikings" murched to the club auditorium; what a sight, one could easily imagine just how the historic landing on the coast of North America had appeared to the Indians of that day! The Danes were well represented in the parade, every Danish organization being present with banners and flags. The Swedes were represented <span class="page-break">2</span>by only eight men, the Germans by only fifteen men, and a few Icelanders were seen here and there in the crowd.</p>
   <p>Professor Rasmus B. Anderson was one of the main speakers. Capt. Folgero spoke briefly. Cleng Peerson, L. Larsen, John Ericsson, and Ludvig Hektoen were lauded as the greatest pioneers of their day. Dr. Fenger [Dane], Dr. Carlson [Swede], and Professor Michleson were mentioned as being the leading citizens in the Norwegian America of this day and age.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Bertha C. Petersen was the toastmaster at the affair in the Stevens Hotel. City Attorney Saltiel spoke at length about Professor Rulvarg's latest book, "Giants of the Earth," stressing the fact that it was the most outstanding book in American literature today. Other speakers were: Rasmus B. Anderson, Birger Osland, Judge Oscar Torrison, City Treasurer Chas. S. Peterson and Reverend Roseland.</p>
   <p>Christian Olsen, president of the Norwegian National League, stressed the importance of the day, and pointed out that, "with the naming of the outer drive <span class="page-break">3</span>"Leif Ericson Drive,' it would appear that Leif was finally accepted as the rightful discoverer of America."</p>
