   <p>p.4...Johannes Irgens is the first Norseman to be elected to a state office in the United States. A number of histories of Norsemen in America, have been written wherein authors, musicians, artists, etc., have been thoroughly acclaimed, but those engaged in political activities have in every case been neglected. Johannes Irgens is one who has received little or no mention in these histories, and he is entitled to recognition among outstanding Norwegian Americans. Mr. Irgens was born in Modum, Norway, in 1832, arriving in Chicago in 1849. He served as a Lieutenant in the famous Norwegian regiment, the 15th Wisconsin Infantry, Colonel Hegg, commanding, coming through unscathed, although he did not miss a battle in which the 15th was engaged.</p>
   <p>He was an intimate friend of Reverend C.L.Clausen, regimental chaplain, and later became a member of his congregation in Mower County, Minn.</p>

   <p>Mower county elected Mr. Irgens to various county offices for a number of years,and in 1875 he was elected Secretary of State on the Republican ticket; he was re-elected, serving two terms. So far as is now known, Mr. Irgens is the first Norseman in the country to hold a state executive office. Our Chicago Norwegian colony regrets that he did not return to us after the war and still wish him every success.</p>
