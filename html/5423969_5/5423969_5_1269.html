   <p>C. F. Arnet, for 30 years, a resident of Chicago and an esteemed member of our Norwegian colony is leaving for Port Huron, Michigan to assume the duties of works manager of the new Auker-Holth factories there.</p>
   <p>His friends, in lodges, churches and singing circles, will miss him sorely; the male chorus of the Norwegian Club gave a farwell banquet in Mr. Arnet's honor and presented him with a large loving cup.</p>
