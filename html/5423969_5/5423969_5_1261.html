   <p>Mr. Einar Kling, of Kling Brothers Co., celebrated his birthday, Tuesday, Nov. 19, but he could not remember which one. The Kling company is one of Chicago's oldest decorating firms, and Einar Kling has been prominent in the activities of the Norwegian colony longer than any of today's leaders can remember. One of his first hobbies and still his greatest, is his work with male choruses. He is one of the oldest members of the Norwegian Club here.</p>
   <p>On his birthday, a host of his friends, from a number of organizations, gathered to do him honor with flowers galore and music in great volume. Miss Inga Aga contributed much to the evening's enjoyment with her piano solos and singing, and a group of singers from all four of our male choruses offered some very good, close harmony. Scandia joins in wishing Mr. Kling many more happy active birthdays.</p>
