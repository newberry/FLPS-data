   <p>Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are having a hard time keeping their inhabitants from coming to America in a body. It is estimated that there are as many Norwegians in this country as there are at home, and one can travel for hours in Minnesota without being out of sight and sound of the industrious Swede. "There is no place like home" is not a popular song on the Scandinavian peninsula.</p>
   <p>Sweden is awakening to the danger to its welfare of this continous drain upon its population in order that America's Western wheat fields and Eastern kitchens may be supplied. The Swedish Society for the Prevention of Emigration, backed by the government, is lending money and land on easy terms in an effort to keep the people at home. Norway is trying to solve the problem by Americanizing itself; not an easy task for a small and unfertile country.</p>

   <p>Solving our immigration problem from the European end is not a bad idea, but it would be unfortunate if the movement influenced only what is probably our best class of immigrants, the sturdy, thrifty, and law-abiding Scandinavians. Denmark's problem is less acute, though the drain there is mostly from the agricultural districts.</p>
