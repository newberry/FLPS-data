   <p>p.8..........Mr. Nokleby passed the 76th milestone on lifes journey on Sunday April 2. The venerable gentleman who is fondly known as evig-unge Nokleby" (forever-young Nokleby) as spry and well as a man half his age and possesses a youthful sense of humor that is the envy of his friends. Several of our singing societies gathered to serenade him on his birthday and a real jubilee lasted till daylight.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nokleby was, as a young man, a member of the Norwegian Guard at Stockholm, Sweden, and had the honor of being detailed to stand guard before the queen's door whenever the royal pair were traveling.</p>
