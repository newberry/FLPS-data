   <p>There is quite a discussion going on as to which boat the Norwegian American Singers' League will take when they start on their festival tour to Norway in 1914. Sangerhilsen (Singers Greetings), the official organ of the League, states that the transportation committee is conferring with "various" European lines. We would say, at least, it would be unwise for the League, on such a trip, to travel on any line other than our own Norwegian-American Line.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that our singers, for such an undertaking as the 1914 tour (when all Norway celebrates), will need all possible friendliness and support both in the U.S.A. and in Norway, it would be to their advantage and also be the patriotic thing to sail on the one and only line that is owned entirely by our own countrymen. The N.A.L. is financed 50c or better by Norwegian-American capital.</p>

   <p>Scandia suggest that the committee stop its flirting with foreign lines and show the proper colors in arranging this tour, a tour of good-will that will live through the ages to come. To go to Norway on a foreign boat would be an insult to Norsemen throughout the world. A protest, signed by the majority of members of the Chicago Norwegian colony, has been sent to the committee and we trust it will have the desired effect.</p>
