   <p>p.8...Mr. Sig. Sorensen, one of our best known and highly respected Chicago Norwegians, celebrated a birthday on Sunday, although the number of years was not stated. Gifts and good wishes of many friends, who had gathered for the occasion, together with music, song and recitation, made up an evening long to be remembered. Mr. Sorensen is the genial and efficient librarian at Chicago's great Newberry Library.</p>
