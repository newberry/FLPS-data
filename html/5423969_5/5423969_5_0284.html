   <p>The Norwegian-Danish Methodist Deaconess Society gave a festival for the tag day workers at the Church on Kedzie Avenue. All the ladies who participated in the tag day were invited. Mrs. Hjalmar Andersen, president of the Society, acted as master of ceremonies. The program included the singing of "America," and songs by the Arion Quartet. Colonel Brewer and Miss Swartz, of the Salvation Army, told of their experiences in France during the World War. The highlight of next week's program at the Church will be an address on "The Right Citizenship are the New Nationalism".</p>
