   <p>Skandinaven is pleased to print the following information from Horsemens Union, and we hope that the "Union" more so, that the "Society to restrict Emigration", will endeavor to authentic information regarding conditions both here and in Norway.</p>
   <p>The announcement reads as follows:</p>
   <p>The Norsemens Union have just organized as a separate department under its head-office in Kristiania an Information Bureau. The "Bureau's" service is open to its members throughout the world and others interested. The Bureau's object is, without compensation to reply to all oral and written inquiries.</p>
   <p>For our countrymen in foreign lands it will furnish reliable and quick information regarding conditions in the home-land; for example: Norwegian Laws, <span class="page-break">2</span>Economic Development, Working and Employment condition, Properties for sale, Missing Persons investigation, Addresses, etc. For people in Norway it will furnish information, as far as possible, regarding conditions and persons among our countrymen in foreign lands, and thus promote a closer tie between Norwegians throughout the world.</p>
   <p>Through its many connections and its nine years of existence the "Bureau" should be singularly well equipped for this object and purpose.</p>
   <p>"The Norsemen's Union will save no efforts in order to make fully effective this last addition to its educational program, and hopes that our countrymen at home or abroad will call upon us for information whenever necessary. The address is:</p>
   <p>Nordmandsforbundet's Oplysnings bureau,</p>
   <p>Hortingsplads 7,</p>
   <p>Kristiania, Norway.</p>
