   <p>At a meeting last Thursday afternoon of the board of directors of the Deaconess Society, the treasurer informed the board that $600 is needed to pay in full for the lots of the Deaconess Hospital and Home. Several members of the board were of the opinion that the lots ought to be paid for at once, and that a subscription for the purpose ought to be started immediately. This was done and the money was subscribed by the members as follows: Mr. A. P. Johnson, $250; Dr. N. T. Quales, $100; Mr. Adolph Larsen, $100; Reverend C. M. Weswig, $50; Mrs. J. P. Howland, $50; Mr. S. H. Holstad, $50; total, $600. Architect Thislew is working on plans for the new building. At the same meeting, Reverend G. T. Rygh was elected secretary in place of Reverend C. Weswig, who is preparing to leave the city. It was decided to comply with insistent requests from the Norwegian Hospital Society in Crookston, Minnesota for two deaconesses to take charge of the hospital in that city.</p>
