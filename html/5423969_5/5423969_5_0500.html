   <p>The main speaker at the dedication festival of St. Marks Church, was the well-known leader and pastor of St. Paul's Church, Reverend G. A. Gullixon. He spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"This day is a day of rejoicing for you Christian friends, members of St. Karks Church, and also your fellow Christians. It is a day of rejoicing because this beautiful church building, now so complete, is to be dedicated--set apart as a house of worship. We rejoice with you in the success which has crowned your efforts in this material way.</p>
   <p>"But we rejoice the more with you because of the fact that it is your purpose and prayer that this house of worship shall be dedicated in the name of Jesus Christ, the King of kings and the Lord of lords; that it shall be set aside as his possession to be used for the worship of him and to the glory of his</p>

   <p>name..... We rejoice when we think what that name stands for. It is the name, says the Spirit of God speaking through St. Paul the Apostle, 'at which every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.'....</p>
   <p>"And to this name and in this name you dedicate this house, that here all knees shall bow in humble adoration of him, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God, the Father.... Before this name the Angels of Heaven rejoice in an everlasting joy, and with even greater rapture than you and I join in the everlasting song of love and praise to him unto whom all power is given in Heaven and on earth.</p>
   <p>"There are those who refuse today to receive him as the King of Grace. These are the powers of darkness which rebel against him, but every knee shall once bow before him, and even the Prince of Darkness shall once be compelled to acknowledge the power and majesty of that name.....</p>

   <p>"The purpose of this house and the service to which it is to be dedicated is the salvation of souls from impending damnation. For the continued success of this work you are praying today, and in this prayer we join with you. May God prosper his glorious work in your hearts, and enable you and all of us thus to render his name the honor and the glory of true Christian adoration; we ask this in Jesus' name. Amen."</p>
