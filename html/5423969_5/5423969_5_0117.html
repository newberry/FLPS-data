   <p>The discussion concerning the memorial gift to Norway so far has been somewhat one-sided. All those who have submitted suggestions have spoken of what we ought to do for Norway; few if any of the writers seem to realize that in 1914 Norway may rightfully demand that we do certain things for ourselves in connection with the festival. When a mother, safely located on her own estate, is celebrating a day of honor, then it is quite appropriate for her children, far out in the world, to send her gifts of remembrance. Equally great, however, if not greater, is the joy that comes to that mother through the knowledge that her children have been doing well for themselves and have prospered in the strange places where they are located. If, in addition, they have traveled far away and have been long gone, so that she has lost sight of them, there will be a lessening in her joy at the time of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the festival if she is not informed of how the children have fared during the years of absence; what they have accomplished; what they now are. It is quite all right that the children be proud of their mother, but these same children need also remember that the mother wants very much to be proud of her children. If the latter do not understand this trait in their mother's nature they make it apparent not only that they are lacking in tact, but also that they do not possess the true sense of respect for their mother, nor the right filial attitude.</p>
   <p>The celebration in 1914 will be the greatest festival in the history of Norway and that of the Norwegian people everywhere. The Norwegians will then be a people of five million, three millions at home and two millions in America and in other countries. And Norway will be the center of one of the greatest and most important industries in the world--the waterfalls of Norway will be working day and night to give to Europe's worn-out sail the forces which will produce bread for the people of the world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>A historical survey of the saga of the Norwegians down through the ages will form a necessary and significant link in the festivities.</p>
   <p>Various speakers will, of course, dwell on this, but that is not enough. Only through a historical work can the Norwegian people raise themselves a historical memorial worthy of the occasion. Not a history of Norway in the ordinary sense of the term, but a lively, broad presentation of the chief traits in the life and development of the Norwegian people on land and at sea, at home and abroad, from the most ancient dates to the present; a presentation of their contribution to the world evolution through the literature of days past and of days present, through their work in other branches, and not the least their influence upon the racial development in other countries, France, England, Scotland and Ireland, upon the islands of the western seas from Iceland to the Isle of Man, and America.</p>
   <p>It is only lately that the significance of the viking trek, both in their own <span class="page-break">\4</span>time and for succeeding ages, has been realized. The vikings were not simply bands of robbers as one might think; first of all they were colonizers, builders of new communities. It is largely due to them and the personal and political seeds of liberty which they planted, that northwestern Europe and America became the leaders of the world in freedom and progress. The recognition of this has of late awakened not only in Norway but also in England and other countries. But the saga of the Norwegians in this, its broader significance, is yet a closed book for most of the people of the foreign countries. The celebration in 1914, offers a unique opportunity to present it to the world in a manner and form which will guarantee general attention for it. And the foremost historians and artists in Norway will unite in producing a work which, in regard to text, illustrations, and general appearance, will be equal to the best that can be produced in any country.</p>
   <p>Special editions in English, French, and German will make the work particularly accessible for foreigners.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The saga of the Norwegian-American constitutes an important section of the work as mentioned, especially of the Norwegian and the English editions. This section, however, must be written by ourselves; Norway cannot do it for us. The section is worthy of being written. If it is put together in the right manner we can safely present it in 1914 and say, "Here, Mother Norway, is the saga of your children in America, a part of your own saga. Here you can see how we have behaved, and what we have accomplished."</p>
   <p>Our saga does not go very far back in time; yet it is not just of yesteryear. Norway in America is not quite as old as the Norwegian constitution, but it lacks only a few years of that age. The constitution was only eleven years old when the first sloop set sail for America with its human freight from Norway. Only a few years will elapse before we can celebrate our own centennial, after Norway has celebrated its day of independence.</p>
   <p>It is none too early to start planning for that occasion. The work we have <span class="page-break">\6</span>spoken of here must represent, in plan and in execution, the best we can produce, and the preparations, the planning, and the execution require time. Already there is rich material available; many hands have been instrumental in providing it. The execution will mainly consist in the suitable use of easily accessible sources, although there is also new land to cultivate.</p>
   <p>There are books on Norwegians in America designated for readers in Norway, but none of them are satisfactory. Now we have the opportunity of presenting to our fatherland our true saga; this will be expected of us; we cannot participate worthily in the celebration in 1914 unless we meet these expectations to the best of our ability. We have good, capable forces; let us utilize the very best we have, whether they are found within or without the Norske Selskab (Norwegian Society).</p>
   <p>In this manner we must prepare to present our own case, our own saga, in 1914. It must accompany the memorial gift, whichever form the latter is to take, and <span class="page-break">\7</span>the preparatory work must be done while our people are discussing the form of the memorial gift. The expenses will not be great and, besides, it will only be a temporary expense since a book of this type will undoubtedly pay for itself.</p>
