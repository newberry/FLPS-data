   <p>The Norwegian Baptist Church in Logan Square celebrated Christmas last Wednesday night in a wonderful way. It was the Sunday School's celebration. The church was decorated with so many Christmas trees that it looked liked a forest. The children of the church were told to bring one Christmas gift each for some poor child. Large barrels were placed inside the door, and each child dropped his package into them,saying at the same time: "It is a greater pleasure to give than to receive."</p>
