   <p>"Bjornstjerne Bjorson," Lodge of the "Sons of Norway, at its meeting last Monday evening, took exception to the statements made by the Rev. Hauge as published in last week's issue of Scandia. A resolution was unanimously passed, requesting the officers of the Grand Lodge of the "Sons of Norway" to write Rev. Hauge demanding a retraction of his untrue statements of the Church vs. the "Sons of Norway" controversy.</p>
   <p>The narrow minded selfish leaders of the Church can not dominate the "Sons of Norway" so they have sought, in every way to discredit the organization even as Rome attacked and still attacks all orders not servile to Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>Our culture and civilization seems to be having queer pains and not growing pains either.</p>
