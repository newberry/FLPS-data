   <p>The Scandinavians [Danes and Swedes] assembled last Sunday, May 22, 1910 resolved to express in your valuable paper their sorrow and sympathy on the occasion of the death of your never-to-be-forgotten and world--famous Bjornstjerne Bjornson, the poet, the writer, and man of irreproachable character.</p>
   <p>Having learned about the unbearable conditions under which our brothers in Europe are compelled to live, Bjornstjerne Bjornson, prompted by a sense of justice, and notwithstanding his age, took up arms and fought in behalf of our just cause to the end of his life. Hence, your sorrow is our sorrow, the sorrow of the thousands of our people. It is not the first time that Scandinavian hearts have beat as one.</p>
   <p>Was it a mere accident, or was it a fact of more than passing importance <span class="page-break">2</span>that, after so many years, a Norwegian took the lead among the warriors for our rights? Not a duke, to be sure, but a most noble knight, a son of the people, the best son of Norway, the most human man, fought and suffered in our behalf. Then wonder not why we feel greatly indebted to the people, and that our sorrow, because of the death of your genius and our defender, is, if not deeper, then equally as deep as yours.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Memorial Committee.</p>
   <p>[Following is the resolution adopted by the Swedes and Danes in a mass meeting honoring Bjornson:]</p>
   <p>"To the Great and Noble Norwegian People! The best and the most noble son of Norway, Bjornstjerne Bjornson, is dead; we believe there is not a single person belonging to the industrious Norwegian nationality who does not feel this loss from the very bottom of his heart. Although of a different nation, <span class="page-break">3</span>we, too, mourn the loss of the late Bjornstjerne Bjornson, and express to you our deepest and most sincere sympathy.</p>
   <p>"But we are not the only ones who are shedding tears today over the fresh grave of your greatest poet and writer. All our compatriots on the other side of the sea, from the shores of the Baltic to the sea to the north, are sad and downhearted. For our best friend and defender, the noblest among the noble, and most illustrious among the famous, Bjornstjerne Bjornson, is dead.</p>
   <p>"Let the tears shed by our millions fall upon the blessed soil of Norway, so that it might produce not one, but thousands upon thousands of men of such fame and high moral standards as was Bjornstjerne Bjornson.</p>
   <p>"Farewell thou, our great friend, forever. We thank you for all your labors you have undertaken in our defense, and we call blessings upon the people that produce such men as you."</p>
