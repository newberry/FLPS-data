   <p>The three "Technical Days," as they were called, have passed. This was the first meeting of its kind, and was held under the auspices of the Chicago Technicians and Engineers. Engineers and technicians from afar, from the United States and Canada, attended. And lest we forget, they were all of Norwegian birth or descent. The original invitation read as follows:</p>
   <p>Informal Congress and Reunion of</p>
   <p>American and Canadian</p>
   <p>Engineers and Architects of</p>
   <p>Norwegian Birth or Descent</p>
   <p>To Be Held in Chicago from</p>
   <p>Thursday, September 27 to Saturday, September 29, 1917</p>
   <p>at the Chicago Norwegian Club</p>
   <p>Thursday, the first day of the meeting, was an interesting day. The "Arc-tecs" held their get-acquainted meeting at the Chicago Norwegian Club. Birger Osland presented the Club's "key of gold" to the chairman of the congress, Joachim Giaver. He accepted the key, thanking the Club, and informed the guests that the key was a token signifying that the Club was at their disposal at all times. He added that it was very sad that many of the invited guests had been drafted and were already defending their country. If it were not for the war, he was sure that there would have been five times as many people present.</p>
   <p>At about 2 P.M. City Engineer Thomas G. Pihlfeldt invited the guests to inspect the Chicago subway [the Illinois Tunnel Company]. The tunnel winds its way under the streets of Chicago at a depth of forty to sixty feet. The volume of freight and baggage handled in the tunnel is enormous; it was said that more than five thousand drays and vans were kept off the Chicago streets by the use of the tunnel system.</p>
   
   <p>The banquet following the trip "inside the earth" was attended by some two hundred ladies and gentlemen. A song written by Mr. Philfeldt was sung by the audience. After an address by Birger Osland another song, this one written by Dr. Anders Doe, was sung. The next speaker was Mr. Charles S. Petersen [Swede], president of the Swedish Club. He gave the Norwegians credit for many accomplishments. Attorney A. Hummeland then gave a short address in honor of the ladies. Among the speakers who reside in Chicago were John Ericson and Oscar A. Haugan.</p>

   <p>Tuesday was the most enjoyable day. The city furnished three small steamers that carried the visitors up the Chicago River into the Drainage Canal, and back to Lake Michigan and the Municipal Pier. The visitors saw what they thought was impossible: the Chicago River flowing in the opposite direction of its natural course. In the evening of the same day the visitors were the guests of the American Institute of Architects at the Chicago Art Institute. A curious incident happened in the lobby of the Art Institute where four tables had been set for the guests. The guests had just been seated when someone laughed, soon others were laughing, and finally everyone laughed.</p>
   
   <p>What was the joke? One of the attendants had dropped a Norwegian flag over the chest of Michelangelo's "Moses," causing Moses to look still more patriarchal, while our old friend Thor and the winged Victory stood along side of Moses, both looking very serious.</p>
   <p>A new song, "We Will Make the Kaiser Wiser," was sung for the first time, and soon the guests were roaring the chorus with such gusto that, as the attendants put it, Moses and the other permanent tenants moved an entire foot.</p>
   <p>Sunday was devoted to sight-seeing, and ended with a banquet at the Norwegian Club where the following resolution was passed.</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We, American and Canadian Engineers and Architects of Norwegian birth or descent, assembled in informal congress and reunion in Chicago, have come to the United States of America or Canada to make our permanent homes, and have become citizens of these countries; or, being born here, are native citizens of these countries, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We have enjoyed every opportunity in time of peace to participate in the progress and prosperity of these, our countries, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The future of ourselves and our children is indissolubly bound to the destinies of these our countries; be it therefore</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we severally pledge to the President of the United States of America, or to the Government of the Dominion of Canada, our full and undivided support in the prosecution of an unavoidable war to a successful conclusion. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we pledge ourselves to make any sacrifice required of us, whether it be our fortune or our lives, in this war for democracy and peace."</p>
