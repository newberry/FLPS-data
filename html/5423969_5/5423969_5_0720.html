   <p>Every legitimate effort for the Christian culture and Americanization of the young people of foreign extraction in our city should meet with the hearty support and encouragement of all good men. Hitherto no movement better calculated to reach this goal has been inaugurated than the mission work now being organized by the United Norwegian Lutheran church of the North West. It may not be generally known that this Church is the result of an effort for the union of the various factions in the Lutheran church which, for many years, has been rent by doctrinal discord. The union of three of these factions was accomplished a year ago, and the United Church is showing a commendable zeal in a wiser and more wholesome work than in dogmatic hairsplitting. This Church now numbers about three hundred ministers and one hundred thousand church members or communicants. Cessation from learned debates has given the church the leisure to look about and it has discovered that its young people are rapidly drifting away from the church and from all religious association. Especially in the great cities are they more likely to be influenced by the saloons than by any civilizing and elevating institutions. This demoralization has largely resulted from the dissensions in their church, and the consequent failure to provide adequate places of worship attractive to the young, and an opportunity to study the English language, which is preferred by the young Scandinavians. Fortunately, the Church is now beginning to see the error of its ways, and the United Church, especially, is putting forth vigorous efforts in order to recapture the young people, and throw about them the influences of Christian refinement in the true spirit, and in the free use of the language of their choice, which is the language of the land.</p>
   <p>At the recent annual meeting, liberal appropriations were made for this kind of mission work, and it was decided to make the first and most determined onslaught here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It may be remarked incidentally that this is not the branch of the Lutheran Church which is antagonistic to the American school system, or opposing the laws for compulsory school attendance. The United Church has put itself on record as being heartily in sympathy with American institutions, and it is this spirit which now is at work in the movement here described.</p>
   <p>Here in the city several missions have been established in the outlying districts, as for instance, at South Chicago, Englewood, Moreland, and three or four in the west and northwest divisions of the city.</p>
   <p>But for a work so extended, large funds are needed. Men can be furnished to do the work, but to provide suitable places of worship is not a small matter. Chapels which might be attractive and an ornament to their surroundings should be provided in order to insure the success of the movement. As an aid to this work, a committee of well-known Christian merchants from Iowa, Minnesota, and other states prominent in this Church, are now visiting Chicago, and will lay the matter before business men, especially wholesale merchants, with whom they have been accustomed to deal, in the hope that the work will commend itself to their judgment, and elicit their sympathy and aid. We think nothing could be more opportune or more worthy of generous support than this work, and we bespeak for it the kindly consideration of all men who have the moral elevation of all classes of citizens in our great metropolis at heart.</p>
