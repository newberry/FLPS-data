   <p>All the congregations in Chicago belonging to the "Norwegian Lutheran Church in America" will have a jubilee festival to celebrate the event of several other groups that have joined the new society.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian part of the program will be presented at St.Paul's Church, Hirsch Blvd.and Washtenaw Ave., at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and the English in Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>The program here will be largely of patriotic nature. The Lutheran Ghurch is loyal towards the government, and when our young men are sent abroad to maintain the rights of our country, we desire to uphold them further with the assistance of the church.</p>
