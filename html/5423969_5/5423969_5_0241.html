   <p>In June, 1870, the Scandinavian Augustana synod was disrupted. A Swedish Augustana was organized to take care of its Swedish members and a Norwegian Augustana was created to look after the Norwegians. In August, 1870, there was a division in the Norwegian Augustana, which added another synod to our list, the Norwegian-Danish Conference.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian-Danish Conference had a total of 11 foreign-born Danes in the ministry. The Danes withdrew from the Conference in order to form a Danish synod. In 1884 they organized the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association. In 1896 they united with another Danish body, the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and organized the United Danish Lutheran Church, still in operation, with headquarters in Blair, Nebraska.</p>
