   <p>Carl J. Backer, president of the Norwegian National League of Chicago, will act as marshal of the League's section of the "Safe and Sane Fourth" parade. The committee has provided indentification bands to be worn on the arm of each member; the band is white with crossed American and Norwegian flags and the words "4 de Juli, 1911" (July 4, 1911), printed in official colors, making a beautiful and ornamental badge.</p>
   <p>Lots were drawn for positions in the Norwegian section of the parade; the sectional band will be followed in order by the Norwegian Ski Club, the athletic and gymnastic clubs, and the singing societies, all bearing flags and the banners of their organizations. The parade is scheduled to start at 10 A.M. and our Norwegian group is to assemble on 29th Street between Michigan and Wabash Avenues promptly at 9:30 A.M.</p>
