   <p>Lucius J. M. Malmin is the only Norseman on the Democratic ticket. He is running for nomination as municipal judge, and should be supported by every voter regardless of nationality.</p>
   <p>Mr. Malmin is a competent attorney and has practiced law in Chicago for twenty-five years. He is highly esteemed in legal circles and by his many clients. During Mayor Dunne's administration, he was appointed special corporation counsel by J. Hamilton Lewis, and his conscientious service won him the highest praise of his superior and his associates.</p>
   <p>More than 500 of the legal profession in Chicago endorse Mr. Malmin, and Scandia urges our people especially to cast their votes for Lucius at the coming election.</p>
   <p>We of Norwegian blood are proud of the achievements of our countryman and want to see him continue in successful service to our community.</p>
