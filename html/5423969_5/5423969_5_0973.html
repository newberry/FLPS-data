   <p>The banquet given by the American-Norwegian Chamber of Commerce in honor of Norway's Minister to the United States, Mr. Byrn at the Blackstone Hotel, was the Chamber's first official festivity and turned out to be a very successful affair. More than one-hundred guests were assembled, this in itself is proof of the "Chambers" usefulness; the many following speeches also carried this out.

   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The speakers were Consul F. Herman Gade, who spoke for the guest of honor Governor Dunne, Consul E. H. Hobe, who spoke for the "Chamber of Commerce", Dr. Pratt who spoke of "Our Mutual Trade", W. S. Keis, who spoke of "Possibilities and Problems of our"Foreign Trade", Minister Bryn, John W. O'Leary, president of "Chicago Association of Commerce," and Judge Oscar M. Torrison, the latter was the only Norwegian speaker from Chicago and had to cut his speech short, due to the advanced time. He spoke of a more extensive commercial and culture intercourse between the two countries and from which both would benefit largely.</p>
   <p>Later Mr. Andred Hummeland, toastmaster and secretary in chief of the "Chamber of Commerce" wished everybody a hearty welcome to this banquet, he added. "We have the great pleasure of having with us Norway's representative in Washington and in behalf of the "American-Norwegian Chamber of Commerce" I extend to him a hearty welcome. He then introduced Consul F. Herman Gade, who spoke very highly of Minister Bryn, as Norways representative in Washington, D.C., as well as chief of the Norwegian Consular Service in America. Mr. Gade mentioned how the minister had worked with marked success to improve the commercial intercourse between the <span class="page-break">\3</span>United States and Norway, and he was proud to know, that in Minister Bryn, Norway had a representative equal to the occasion, with these remarks he called for a toast to Minister Bryne in which everybody joined under great applause.</p>
   <p>Governor Dunne's speech which followed, was time and again interrupted with applause. "In behalf of my state" he said, "I feel particularly pleased to be present to honor a man like Mr. Bryn and Norway, a country with the most democratic government on earth. I am glad to press his hand and tell him that his country men and women do honor to their country and prosper, and I hope they always will prosper".</p>
   <p>The toastmaster then introduced Consul Hobe of Minneapolis, the president of the "American Norwegian Chamber of Commerce". After first having paid his respect to the guest of honor and the preceding speaker, he spoke at length on the "Chamber of Commerce", its organization, goal and possibilities. "Our organization, " he said", is not a selfish one, we wish to bring together representatives from both <span class="page-break">\4</span>countries, and to foster that "good will", which must be the foundation for a true commercial intercourse. We must consider others and others must consider us. Our association must rest on the ground of mutual understanding and this again on the still deeper foundation, which is the growing principle of the "Golden Rule," the worlds great moral law."</p>
   <p>In the period 1903-1913 Norways export trade grew from 51 millions to 116 millions, and the import from 68 millions to 159 millions, at the beginning of the war half of Norways foreign trade went to Germany and England. In 1913 Germany sold Norway to the amount of 47.5 millions or 29.8% of the whole import. England for 39.5 millions or 24.7%, while the United States sold for 10.5 millions or 6.6%. These figures are taken from the "Norwegian Trade Report for 1913". Since the Americas export to Norway has grown to 45 millions or 45 times as large as it was 1 1/2 years ago. Norway has at the present time under construction in the United States 29 ships of from 2000 to 7000 tons. This also has some significance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>To retain this trade and eventually increase it is the purpose of our organization. I know of no more effective means of doing this, than through the help of our directors, with their knowledge of trade conditions and demands in both countries, and who without any compensation whatsoever are willing to use their time and money to perpetuate a commercial intercourse with Norway, which should prove mutually beneficial in the future. The speaker then spoke on "Trade-credit" which had to be improved upon. They hoped to inagurate a new "Credit-system", based on the knowledge of the financial status of the eventual trade - connections in both countries.</p>
   <p>Exhibition and Excursions</p>
   <p>In order to advance American exporters' knowledge of Norwegian business conditions the "Chamber of Commerce" is arranging a trip to Norway next summer for American businessmen, and another trip will be arranged next fall from Norway to America; <span class="page-break">\6</span>an exhibition of American products in Kristiania and other Norwegian cities , and an exhibition of Norwegian products in New York, Chicago, the Twin Cities and other places is also under consideration.</p>
   <p>The chief of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce in Washington, D.C., Dr. E.E. Pratt has promised us all possible co-operation, and we also expect support from the "United States Chamber of Commerce", Washington, D.C.</p>
   <p>Permit me to close with the remarks that our organization has met with unusual support from all quarters, both here and in Norway, and we are inclined to believe that the "American Norwegian Chamber of Commerce" will eventually prove to be one of the most effective means towards fostering trade between America and Norway. Consul Hobe's speech was received with great applause.</p>
   <p>The toastmaster thereupon read several telegrams</p>
   <p>The next speaker on the program was the president of the "Chicago Association of Commerce", Mr. John W. O'Leary. Mr. O'Leary dwelt particularly on Chicago and its <span class="page-break">\7</span>great growth, which today made it the largest trade-center in the United States. He also touched upon the eventual peaceful war of commerce which was bound to come, when the war ceased. Norway with its large merchant-fleet was sure to reap full benefit from this; in addition to this Norway is steadily adding to her already large merchant-marine, while we in this country just talk.</p>
   <p>In conclusion Mr. O'Leary, in behalf of the Chicago Association of Commerce extended to the "American Norwegian Chamber of Commerce", his best wishes.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. S. Kies, vice president of the National City Bank of New York, then spoke at length on "Possibilities and Probabilities of our Foreign Trade".</p>
   <p>Dr. E. E. Pratt chief for the "Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Trade", of Washington, D.C., spoke on "Our Mutual Trade". Dr. Pratt's speech was the evening's most outstanding discourse. In a clear and concise language he clarified all questions <span class="page-break">\8</span>concerning trade connections between America and Norway, and in so doing displayed a profound knowledge of conditions as they exist in Norway.</p>
   <p>After having expressed his pleasure of being present and greeting the different members of the "Chamber of Commerce", in behalf of himself and his office, he went back in history of Leif Eriksen and other "Vinland" sailors, and on which he seemed well posted. America was discovered by a Norwegian, he said, and this is not without significance in our time for a mutual understanding between the two countries. Of the three Scandinavian countries, Sweden sent the largest contingent to America, but Norway sent the largest contingent in proportion to its population. There was only one other country which had proportionately sent us a larger number of her sons and daughters and that was Ireland. There were many reasons why the Americans should be interested in promoting the trade with Norway. Statistic tell us, that the value of property owned by Norwegians in America is equal to Norway's National Wealth. This alone is of some significance. But the old immigration from the Scandinavian countries has changed in the last twenty years. Emigration had diminished, and whatever there was, went to the cities, it was Americas Commerce and Industry which now was the drawing power.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>When we speak of foreign trade, import as well as export must, as a matter of course, be considered. Norway earlier had sold America something, she had very little of, this resulted in ocean transportation. It was almost with jealousy that America eyed Norway's gigantic merchant-marine, which was exceeded only by England, Germany and the United States, and which in proportion to her population, was the largest in the world.</p>
   <p>What is now the course of Norway's great progress on the "high seas"? It has been said that Norway's merchant-marine was subsidized by the government, but this is not so, Norway made "Business" of her overseas trade, while to the United States it was just a pastime.</p>
   <p>After a short resume' of Norway's Commercial development, Dr. Pratt mentioned that this had grown very rapidly in the last years. The speaker examplified this with statistics, and emphasized, that many of the products imported by Norway were manufactured in the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Particular attention was given to Norway's export of fish; dried frozen and preserved, and its import of iron, steel and machinery, which was on a steady increase in proportion to the country's development of its industries. The larger portion of Norway's import in these lines as well as other could be taken over by the United States. Dr. Pratt further mentioned the great role the Scandinavian countries played in the steadily increasing American trade with Russia, particularly so since completion of the Bergen Railway, in this connection the Atlantic Steamship Line would also reap a benefit.</p>
   <p>In conclusion Dr. Pratt promised the American-Norwegian Chamber of Commerce all possible assistance from his office and would do everything possible to further its purpose and progress.</p>
   <p>The Washington Bureau would also draw upon the American-Norwegian Chamber of Commerce whenever necessary. He also said that an attempt had been made to create an office of "American Commercial Attache' " but without success as yet but hoped to have such an office in the near future. He would also propose the "Chamber of Commerce" organized a branch in Norway.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>The speaker concluded his remarks with extending to the "American-Norwegian Chamber of Commerce" in behalf of his office his best wishes for its success.Applaus.</p>
   <p>The toastmaster then called upon the guest of honor, Minister Bryn , who thanked for the honor bestowed upon by the "Chamber of Commerce". He spoke on the trade relations between America and Norway; while difficulties will arise, he said with the present commercial connections and set up, they should be easily surmounted. The speech was very well received.</p>
   <p>Duting the speeches of Governor Dunne and Minister Byrn the guests arose and applauded vociferously.</p>
   <p>Judge Oscar M. Torrison concluded the speechmaking of the evening and was heartily applauded.</p>
   <p>During the banquet the first quarterly issue of the "American-Norwegian Trade Review" edited by H. Jundby Hansen, was distributed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>Photographers from the local press took several pictures of the gathering, one of which is shown herewith.</p>
   <p>Wednesday Consul Gade gave a luncheon for Minister Bryn at Chicago Club. Present were, beside the Guest of Honor and Consul Gade, Consul Hobe, Consul Haugan, Mr. Boaky of R. B. Boaky Co., Consular Seerborg, Olaf Bernts, Birger Osland, Alfred Gabrielsen, Mr. Bright of P.B. Bright &amp; Co., Mr. Andrew Hummeland and Dr. Anders Doe, the later acted as toastmaster.</p>
