   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Congregation in Chicago combine for Festival.</p>
   <p>This year, 1917, is a significant year for the Lutherans. It is both a Jubilee year and a year of church combinations. The three greatest Norwegian Lutheran groups in America have been combined into the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America, and three of the greatest English-Lutheran groups will probably combine before the year draws to a close.</p>
   <p>But the present year is also the four hundred year jubilee for the reformation by Martin Luther.</p>
   <p>In the month of September the Chicago congregation of the Norwegian Lutheran church in America held festivities on account of the union of churches, at Saint Paul's church. This was a splendid occasion, very well attended, and with an excellent program of speeches and in singing.</p>

   <p>On November 4, the same congregations will celebrate the reformation anniversary by a still greater festival; the program is part English, part Norwegian. A chorus of several hundred voices will sing a reformation cantata, supported by soloists and music.</p>
   <p>Chicago is the greatest Norwegian city in America, having about thirty congregations belonging to the Norwegian Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>As soloists in the cantata Mildred Romsdahl-Bruns, Soprana and Ove Prcus, Barytone, will be heard. Mrs. T.C.Thompson is the organist.</p>
   <p>The cantata is written by Reverend W. Pettersen, and the music is by Prof. F.M.Christiansen.</p>
