   <p>The "Markus" Church will be dedicated today, at 3 P. M. It is located on ther corner of Tripp and Wabansia Avenues. The congregation was organized in the '90's. A Sunday school was organized at that time, its classes being held on the corner of Tenth Avenue near Grand Avenue. A few years later the school moved to the German Church at the corner of Springfield Avenue and Hirsch Street. The school's first teacher, Reverend Olaf E. Brandt, served for a while; he was followed by Reverend S. T. Reque who served until the fall of '97. At that time the "Mission" took over the school and church, and the pastor, Reverend J. R. Birkeland, who had just returned from Japan was made a sort of bishop. He, together with Reverend <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Ramberg, organized tghe "Mathaeus" and the present "Markus" congregations.</p>
   <p>The first meeting under this new arrangement was held March 2, 1901, in the German Lutheran Church. At this meeting it was decided to rent a small room in a building at Harding and Springfield Avenues (sic). The congregation met there for over four years and later purchased lots on the corner of Tripp and Wabansia Avenues, and in 1904 the basement of the new church was started. After a long and hard struggle, finances were raised and the church finished. Today the congregation is proud of its beautiful building</p>
