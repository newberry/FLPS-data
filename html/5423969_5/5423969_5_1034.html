   <p>A group of young Norwegian-Americans met at a luncheon in the Bismarck Hotel at the invitation of Birger Osland, to discuss the new Norwegian-American steamship line.</p>
   <p>All the youngsters were very much interested, and after a lengthy discussion Mr. Osland spoke as follows: "Gentlemen: I assure you that I appreciate your coming here today, and I do think we have quite a representative gathering of the younger Norwegian-American businessmen of our city. I think you will all agree that it is well for men who have the bond of common nationality uniting them to come together, whether for the sake of mutual acquaintanceship, for discussion of the lighter or more serious questions of life, or for common action where such may be called for. Throughout history we know of no sentiment more sacred, no trait of character more productive of lasting benefit to the family and to the nation, than that which bids us revere and honor the memory our ancestors. No matter of what faith one may be, this sentiment, and the actions <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>rooted in it, are lauded and respected by everyone. The name of father' and mother, in other words, the family ties, forms the root of this sentiment, and from the family it branches out to embrace your kin, your nation, and your race. You glory and rejoice in their achievements, you share in their sorrows, and you feel the shame of their shortcomings.</p>
   <p>"One day a Japanese student at the University of Chicago handed me his card which road 'Kamasuto Eichi'. I called him Mr. Eichi, thinking that the last name on his card was his family name, but he corrected me at once, saying that Kamsuto was his family name and that in Japan it was always placed first, because one's individual or Christian name was considered of small importance, merely a link in a long chain. Don't you believe, gentlemen, that this sentiment of the Japanese, so deeply rooted in reverence and love for family and race, is the principal Keystone in the great power these little men have gained? Is it not a sentiment worthy of emulation by every race on earth?</p>
   <p>"We Norwegian-Americans have nothing to be ashamed of in respect to ancestry and kin. We are fortunate to have sprung from a race of real men who, a thousand <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>years ago, by their courageous deeds and enterprise, planted the fame of their race firmly in the respect of all mankind for all time to come. England is proud of that strain in her blood, and France is today inviting the world to celebrate at Rouen this year the advent of our ancestors upon her shores, though they did not originally come as her friends.</p>
   <p>"Still, we need not go back so far, nor need we fear that the old spirit has succumbed. All over the vast prairies, valleys, mountains, and forests of this, our new fatherland, our race is welcomed and respected. Each and every one of us who claims the name of Norwegian-American owes a great debt to our ancestry and to our kin for what they have left us and for what they are still helping us to uphold; and we should not forget that we cannot discharge our debt by mere admiration of the deeds of our sires, nor by merely applauding the merit which our race is maintaining in the eyes of the world today. We can only do our share and pay our debt in the same manner in which that national treasury of an honored name was won for us--by action.</p>

   <p>"Sound sentiment and sound business have always and will always go together. We may try to make ourselves and others believe that sentiment has no place in business, but we are deceiving ourselves. A man is not an adding machine or a phonograph; sentiment crops out at all times and everywhere in our mutual relations, and if anyone really made an earnest effort to separate himself from such sentiments throughout his life, he would finally discover that he had succeeded in separating himself from life's sweetest joys and life's deepest sympathies.</p>
   <p>"As you all know, the one big issue of today, common to Norway and Norwegian-Americans over here, is the organization of a Norwegian-American transatlantic steamship line to run under Norway's flag. That highly respected and much beloved old man of our nationality in Chicago, Mr. Hauman G. Haugan; another greatly respected businessman from St. Paul; Consul Hobe and several other men of our race....have placed themselves unreservedly at the head of this national movement, and there can be no better guarantee of the soundness of a business enterprise than the participation of such men.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>...."Let us above all, as Norwegian-Americans, not forget that no matter in what station in life we may be placed, we have one common bond of nationality and national honor to uphold, and that the old proverb is true: 'United we stand, divided we fall'."</p>
