   <p>The following remarks describing the life and work of Norway's great patriot and singer come at an opportune moment. He was a strong and good man who worked for his country, strove for freedom and progress, and for the welfare of all his fellow men. After a long parley with Death, lasting nearly a year, Bjornstjerne Bjornson, the Norwegian, has paid the debt of Nature. With him passes away the last and perhaps the greatest of the great men who have illuminated the golden age of modern Norway.</p>
   <p>The fame of Henrik Ibsen, doubtless, is wider because of the changes he made in the modern drama, the influence of which have extended to every civilized country. That such a man should come out of little Norway and change not only the form but the spirit of the modern play, is indeed wonderful. But world-wide though the influence of Ibsen has been, Bjornson holds the happier title of being the typical Norwegian. He has been the protagonist of the liberties and the aspirations of the Norwegian people. In every battle for <span class="page-break">2</span>reform he has been the giant in the van, leading the way and drawing after him the people, not only those who still live in old Norway, but the thousands here in America and in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It was Bjornson who first made of Norwegian a literary language, who differentiated it from the Danish, and who embodied in it the language and the spirit of the Norwegian peasantry. It was he who founded a national drama and made it independent of Denmark. As Ibsen was the great pessimist who despaired of human salvation, so Bjornson was the great optimist who had the faith that moves mountains. To Bjornson anything that was right was possible and worth fighting for. He never hesitated an instant to dash into the fray no matter what the odds against him. There lived again in him the old viking courage. He was possessed of a berserker's rage, beating down all obstacles and rushing straight to his goal.</p>
   <p>In the political fortunes of his country he cut a large figure. We are accustomed to think of Bjornson as a fine lyric poet, as a stirring dramatist, as a <span class="page-break">3</span>pioneer in literary endeavor. All these he was, but chiefly he was Norway epitomized. He wrote the great national hymn, " Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet" (Yes, We Love the Land That Towers), and wrote it in his youth. But he never lost the spirit of his youth. He was a boy, impulsive, generous, idealistic, until his dying day.</p>
   <p>The story of Bjornson's life, from whatever angle viewed, is an inspiration. He was sometimes wrong, but never knowingly. He was a fond husband and a good father. He was the best of patriots because he was not content with merely feeling patriotic; he worked incessantly for Norway. Yet his horizon was not confined by the boundaries of his country. He cherished the ideal of the great Scandinavian union in the North, a tripartite alliance in which each member of the Scandinavian family should be equal, and which should protect it from all foreign aggression. For that reason he regretted the abruptness with which the union was dissolved, though he believed that Norway's destiny required the separation. Once the step had been taken, however, he supported the Michelsen Ministry and his countrymen in their project of independence. "Norway," said <span class="page-break">4</span>he in the dramatic hour, "is now one man." Yet he had only love and admiration for the brother nations. The Swedes, he always maintained, are a great people with a great destiny.</p>
   <p>One of the choice spirits of the world has passed away in Paris, but his benign influence will shine on through the ages.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven (Daily Edition), Apr. 3, 1910.</p>
   <p>With form and face like one of his viking ancestors, and the soul and spirit of an ancient scald, Bjornsterne Bjornson, who for half a century fought for the independence of his beloved Norway, has died with the happy knowledge that his struggle succeeded. No other contemporary nation can boast of a man who impressed his personality upon his country's social life and literature with such vividness and force as did this great Norseman, who today lies dead with his honors thick around him.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>With a most happy combination of inherited traits, Bjornson burst upon the literary and political field of Norway at the age of twenty-four, and since that time he has maintained an easy supremacy. As poet, novelist, dramatist, theatrical manager, editor, and reformer, he was ever a force to be reckoned with, a leader in radicalism and progress, an uncompromising reformer and fighter of the berserker type. His was one of the first, as it was one of the boldest, voices to be raised demanding the separation of Norway from Sweden, and never was it stilled until this consummation was attained. By dramas, by novels, by songs which stirred his countrymen to the wildest patriotism, by pamphlets and impassioned speeches, he urged Norse independence. When all others hung back he boldly defied the king and parliament, and, like Tolstoi, he cowed the powers. He advocated democracy; he even went further in his effort for social progress and was claimed by the advanced socialists.</p>
   <p>A natural poet, he sang as Burns sang. His lyrics, lacking maybe in finish, were songs that gripped the heart of the common people, couched as they often were in the vernacular. His prose writings, a formidable list, ranged from <span class="page-break">6</span>exquisite tales of country life to romances of the more complex modern civilization of the cities. But everything he wrote or said had for its object the liberation of his country or the social betterment of its people. While not blind to realities, and while capable of the saeva indignatis, his wrath seldom or never shared the bitterness of Ibsen's. Though he was moved deeply by social wrong, he could also sing the simple joys of life and sound the praises of nature.</p>
   <p>Chicago had an early introduction to Bjornson. Not only did some of its settlers who were Norwegian bring here and spread the fame of their great countryman as a writer and advocate of liberty, but fully half a century ago Chicago had a chance to read one of his books in English, probably long before any other American community had the privilege.</p>
   <p>It was in 1859 or 1860 that there came to anchor at the mouth of the river a strange foreign craft with an unusual flag. It proved to be the bark "Sleipner", direct from Norway with a cargo the like of which had never before arrived <span class="page-break">7</span>here. It consisted of herrings and Bjornson's "Arne" in translation. As Mr. George P. Upton relates it, the herrings found a ready market, but "Arne" landed in the customs house for duty. This not being paid, the edition was confiscated. Mr. Upton has forgotten the translator's name, but his work was accomplished by a felicitous rendering of Bjornson's lines into English almost as limpid as the original. The Chicago Fire years after wiped out the edition, but it could not efface the memory of this first introduction of the great Norwegians idyll to the western world.</p>
   <p>Free, democratic Norway has lost her most versatile genius in the death of Bjornson, the friend, literary rival, and co-worker of Ibsen. Bjornson's career resembles that of Ibsen in many respects, and the two poets and dramatists had much in common morally and artistically. Both started out as romantic poets fond of historic and heroic themes--to modern social and political problem plays or novels. Both were militant progressives and ardent reformers. Both were idealists who could and did write most realistically of their time and its representative men and women. Both won great fame, national and international.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Yet the two great men of Norway were temperamentally and fundamentally very different one from the other. Ibsen commanded admiration and reverence; he was regarded as an austere, censorious judge; a chastiser of social and individual vices; a strong individualist; a foe of all compromise. His intellectual eminence and his fearless candor inspired awe.</p>
   <p>Bjornson was a true leader of men; a popular idol; and orator; a writer of national songs; an active political guide. He had pronounced socialistic leanings, and his sympathy and geniality were constantly manifested in personal relations and not merely in literary productions. He could, however, write with mordant irony or with absolute objectivity. He was at home in many forms and styles, and he marched with the times in thought, speculation, and tendency. His "Gauntlet" and "Beyond Human Power" are intensely modern plays that strikingly illustrate his marvelous mental alertness. He had too many interests to concentrate as Ibsen did, and he was big and generous enough to recognize the superior work of his only rival in the dramatic field.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Norway's loss is also the loss of the whole civilized world. But Norway has the consolation of knowing that the work of Ibsen and Bjornson will endure and continue to influence letters and the stage for decades to come.</p>
   <p>Free Norway is the splendid monument of Bjornstjerne Bjornson, who has just died in Paris after a long illness. No one could ask a better. It was said years ago by Brandes, the Dane, that the mention of Bjornson's name in any company of Norwegians had the same effect as the unfurling of the national flag. This was true throughout his long and fruitful life. Poet, dramatist, novelist, patriot, faithful interpreter of a strong people's emotions and aspirations--after long labor he led his countrymen peacefully back to self-government and independence. Thus he lived to see his great dream realized.</p>
   <p>The poems and prose writings of Bjornson knitted together the people of Norway and exalted their hopes to the point where nothing short of independent national existence was endurable to them. He stood up boldly among them to lead them on, and by the might of his genius he exalted their minds and opened their <span class="page-break">10</span>understanding to the greatness of their heritage. He made their language still dearer to them by his songs and simple tales which went to their hearts. The world at large mourns with Norway for this fallen leader.</p>
   <p>In the heart of Norway the flag flies at half-mast today. Her great son, her emblematic man, Bjornstjerne Bjornson, is dead. The character and achievement of the hero it worships is no mean gauge of the moral worth and soundness of a nation. If its admirations be nobly directed it has in its soul the strain of nobility from ruler to peasant. So in honoring Bjornson, in singling him out as the embodiment of the national uplift and ideal, the Norse people honor themselves.</p>
   <p>Bjornson was the many-sided man, his spirit a gem of many facets whose rays were ever bright and pure. Bjornson was a patriot whose love of country made his name almost synonymous with his country's; a soldier of Liberty who bared a berserker's breast to her mailed foes when her torch was dim in Norway; an <span class="page-break">11</span>orator whose eloquence swung the hammer of Thor, or cast the spell of Mirabeau; a novelist whose tales snatched the secrets from the hearts of the people; a poet whose lyric notes sprang native from the soil like Burns' mountain daisy; a dramatist whose characteristic work has the noble heart beat of Schiller's.</p>
   <p>Such, in the broader aspects, was this Norse colossus of the fjord--the blue eyes, the flaxen mane, the viking frame. The soul of an upward and onward striving nation was incarnate in Bjornson the patriot. He is dead, and the nation mourns.</p>
   <p>He loved America. At our eastern portal, Liberty with uplifted torch thrice welcomed the champion of Norwegian independence. On his bier Columbia may claim a special right to lay her chaplet of cypress and laurel.</p>
