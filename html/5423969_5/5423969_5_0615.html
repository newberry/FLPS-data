   <p>From the Norwegian Deaconess Home two sisters, Matte Hagen and Caroline Thompson were called upon to leave for Madagascar to do mission work; Matte as housekeeper and nurse, Caroline as school-teacher. Their destination is the girls asylum at St. Luce Madagascar. Before their departure the two sisters were dedicated and blessed for their holy work among the heathens by Pastor Kald and Pastor H. B. Hildahl. A sign which the deaconeses of the Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess' homes always carry with them after taking their holy vow is a cross of silver surrounded by a wreath.</p>
