   <p>Scandia takes exception to a statement made by Mrs. Dick-Waaler who lived in Chicago for some time, but more recently has been lecturing in Canada. In an interview with the Montreal Gazette, she is reported to have said that "Canada today offers greater opportunities for the Norwegian immigrant than does the United States....." We have made several trips to Canada and fail to see any evidence of the truth of her assertion. Mrs. Dick-Waaler, whose home is in Minnesota, is leaving soon for Norway, where she will write and publish a book entitled, America As Seen by a Woman.</p>
   <p>We are awaiting the publication of this book with interest, as we are curious to know on just what she bases her comparisons of Canada and our own United States. Among those especially interested in the forthcoming book is our own Dr. Anders Doe. (We are waiting to see the fur fly!)</p>
