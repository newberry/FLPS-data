   <p>Two years ago, at a national gathering of Norwegian-American organizations, it was decided to raise funds for a memorial gift to Norway in 1914, the occasion being the 100th anniversary of the adoption of Norway's constitution. L. A. Thorpe, of Willmar, Minn., is the president of the committee, and H. G. Hangan, of the State Bank of Chicago, is the treasurer.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday, May 1, at 2 P.M., a mass-meeting is to be held at St. Paul's Norwegian Lutheran Church; all Norwegians of Chicago are urged to attend, as there will be good music and speakers.</p>
   <p>Norway's centennial gives us an opportunity that comes once in a lifetime, the chance to honor our mother country, and therefore, the committee has set a goal of one million crowns as Norwegian-America's gift to Norway. The gift will be turned over to the Norwegian Parliament, to be used in what that body considers to be the best manner.</p>
