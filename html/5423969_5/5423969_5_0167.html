   <p>Yesterday's Seventeenth of May Festival at the Auditorium was not as well attended as had been expected and hoped, and the reason for the small attendance was attributed to the weather, which was unpleasant. The program was opened with "March Solemnelle," by Alfred Paulsen, played by the orchestra directed by Emil Bjorn, after which Mr. Olaf E. Ray Chairman of the Committee on Arrangements, made a brief speech of welcome. The speech was followed with "Ja, vi elsker dette landet" (Yes, We Love this Country) sung by the public, under the direction of Mr. Emil Bjorn and the Norwegian Singing Society, and accompanied by the orchestra.</p>
