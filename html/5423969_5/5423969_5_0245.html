   <p>The school committee passed several resolutions and decided many important questions. The committee consists of Reverend J. N. Anderson, chairman; M. M. Stensland, secretary; and Olof Holen. The following report was given by the committee:</p>
   <p>"The Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, in general convention assembled, expresses its thanks to Almighty God for the prosperity our schools have enjoyed during the past year, and again directs the attention of its membership to the fundamental importance of the cause of Christian education.</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch as the bylaws of Luther Seminary (par. 16, p. 551, clause 191) fixes the maximum salary of theological professors at $1,800, and inasmuch as this sum is entirely inadequate in meeting the requirements of prevailing conditions, steps should be taken to change the bylaws of Luther Seminary so as to permit a necessary increase in salaries.</p>

   <p>"We hereby express our appreciation of the work done by Professor C. K. Preus in raising funds for a library at Luther College, of the good will with which he has been met, and of the enthusiastic interest shown by the students and alumni in planning for the erection of a gymnasium and the creation of a fund for equipment at Luther College. The college authorities are asked to provide for a proper observance of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the institution.</p>
   <p>"The convention rejoices in the remarkable growth of St. Olaf College, and hopes that it may continue to progress along substantial lines. We express our profound appreciation of the long and faithful service of Professor Eikeland who now ceases his active work as a teacher of Norwegian at St. Olaf College. No man among us has done more for the maintenance of interest in the language, history, and traditions of our people.</p>

   <p>"Whereas, We view with equal satisfaction the fine beginning made in foreign lands, and particularly in Scandinavian countries looking toward universal prohibition, and we are thankful in knowing that the example of America has been an inspiration and help to the temperance leaders of our fatherland; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we express our profound thanks to almighty God for the great moral, social, and economic victory won by the Christian sentiment of this country in outlawing the liquor traffic, and in order that the full benefits of this victory may be realized, we urge upon all law enforcement officers the strict and thorough enforcement of the Volstead Prohibition Enforcement Law. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we urge upon the leaders of both political parties the <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>absolute rejection of all proposals to repeal or weaken the Volstead Act. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we extend to the Anti-Saloon League the assurance of our hearty support in every possible way that it may battle successfully with the powerful liquor organization until it is completely overthrown and prohibition established as the settled policy of the United States and of the world."</p>
