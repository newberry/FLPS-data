   <p>Our Savior's Church celebrated its sixtieth anniversary yesterday. The first speaker on the program was Reverend A. Oftedahl, rector of the Deaconess Home. Reverend Oftedahl has just been elected president of the Chicago Norwegian Lutheran Ministerial Conference. Reverend H. P. Ausan spoke briefly on the future of the Church and the congregation. Professor J. C. M. Hanson, librarian at the University of Chicago, told about the past activities of the congregation. Professor Hanson was the first principal of the Ministerial School in the late 80's. Erik Johnson covered the work done by the women of the congregation in the past forty years. O. Alfred Johnson spoke for the youth and especially stressed the work of the choir. Miss Hevle sang many beautiful Norwegian songs. Otto Clausen directed the choir.</p>
   <p>On the third Sunday of January, 1858, Reverend Gustav F. Dietrichson preached to a small group of Norwegians at North Market Hall; later in the day Reverend Johan Storm Munch preached an excellent sermon. On the following day, Monday, January 18, 1858, the same group met to discuss the organization of the congregation. On March 7 of same year, the congregation again met and decided upon the name "Our Saviors Norwegian-Evangelical-Lutheran Congregation of Chicago". The total membership was fifty-two, and none of the charter members are alive today.</p>
   <p>It was proposed to build a church, and $700 was immediately subscribed. It was decided that the building should be seventy feet long, forty feet wide, and twenty feet high. Reverend Dietrichson, the first pastor, served for about a year. It was decided to hold twelve prayer meetings a year, and the salary of the pastor was set at $150 a year. The church building was officially dedicated on July 7, 1859.</p>
   <p>The congregation, through the years, has always fought the various secret societies, especially the Knights of Luther. The second church built by the congregation was destroyed in the great Chicago Fire before the building was completed. On November 5, 1873, the new church was completed at a cost of $42,000. It was 116 feet long, and 62 feet wide. The tower and spire was 200 feet high. The present pastor, Reverend Nils M. Ylvisaker, has served the congregation since 1912. Today the language problem is so great that half of the sermons are in English. It is only a matter of time before Norwegian will cease to be used in this or any other Norwegian church.</p>
