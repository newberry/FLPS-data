   <p>The Scandinavian settlement in the vicinity of Springfield and Glenview Avenues had no neighborhood church up until now, but yesterday the dedication of their new church, the Emmaus Scandinavian Lutheran Church, took place. The building is located at the intersection of the previously mentioned avenues.</p>
   <p>The building of this church was made possible through the support of the Home and Inner Mission of the United Scandinavian Church. The new church is the first one to be built in Chicago to which the Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians have jointly contributed and it is intended for their use in common.</p>
   <p>The actual dedication ceremony took place yesterday in the presence of the officiating clergymen, Ellestall J. Olsen, Aarestad, and Avensen. The service was held in Norwegian; it was plain but impressive. Reverend H. W. Roth delivered a sermon in English in the afternoon, and in the evening J. N. Kildahl, pastor of the Bethlehem Church, preached.</p>
