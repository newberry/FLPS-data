   <p>The news that Roald Amundsen discovered the South Pole swept like fire through our Norwegian Colony, and became not only the main subject of all conversation, but created a new form of greeting, i.e., "Gratulerer Med Amundsen" (congratulations on Amundsen).</p>
   <p>The Norwegian club called messages of congratulation to Roald Amundsen and King Haakon of Norway.</p>
   <p>King Haakon replied with the following cablegram:</p>
   <p>Kristiana, Norway</p>
   <p>Mar. 10, 1912.</p>
   <p>Norwegian Club</p>
   <p>Chicago</p>
   <p>Thanks for kind telegram. Felt sure all Norwegian would rejoice at good <span class="page-break">\2</span>news.</p>
   <p>Haakon, Rex</p>
   <p>Last night the Club held a meeting for members only. After the business session came lunch, with music, singing, and readings to complete another enjoyable evening.</p>
