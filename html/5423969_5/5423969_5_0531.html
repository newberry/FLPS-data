   <p>For a number of years, Reverend C. W. Finwall of this city has planned to start a practical institution specially designed to appeal to and aid young Norwegian men. The institution as planned would provide for an employment office, reading, room, song and music entertainment, lectures on practical topics, a hall for gymnastics, practical religious services, etc.</p>
   <p>Reverend Finwall now has secured ample support from Americans and Norwegians interested in the idea; he has rented a hall centrally located for Norwegian men. The hall is on North Avenue, four doors west of California Avenue. The plan will not be fully realized until the latter part of November, but the hall will be opened with a free social on Friday evening of this week.</p>
