   <p>Mount Olive Cemetery is one of the most frequently visited places in the neighborhood of Chicago. Norwegians and Danes visit it on week ends, not merely to take care of the graves of their dear ones, but to breathe the delightful fresh air and smell the fragrance of fresh grass.</p>
   <p>During the summer many improvements have been made. The whole cemetery looks like a flower garden; all the graves are well cared for, and the roads are good. New waterworks and new barns have just been finished at the cemetery, and if the strike had not intervened, the new gate at the entrance, with offices and other conveniences, would also have been finished. The board of directors expect to start this latter work in the near future.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paul O. Stensland, the business manager and secretary of the board, is usually present every Sunday to show the visitors the places of interest.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Nygaard, the manager of the cemetery, may be seen at the cemetery every day.</p>
