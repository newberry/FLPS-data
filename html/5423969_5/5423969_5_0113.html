   <p>Democracy and love of liberty ever have characterized the Norwegian people. These traits, coupled with their industry, their thrift, their vigorous physique, their high intellectual development as a race, and their seriousness of purpose in whatever they undertake, have made Norwegian immigrants in the United States and their American-born descendants among the most valuable of the non-English elements in American life.</p>
   <p>Norwegians in all parts of the world today are celebrating the birthday of modern constitutional liberty in Norway. The day marks the ninety-sixth anniversary of the adoption of the present Norwegian constitution, an instrument recognized, with the American Constitution, as one of the world's great bulwarks of liberty. The day is to Norway what the Fourth of July is to the United States, with the distinction that the advancement of democracy is celebrated by reason of obtaining a greater measure of self-government through a democratic constitution, as Norway, nominally at least, always <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>has been independent and never conquered.</p>
   <p>There is a lesson for Americans in the manner in which Norwegians celebrate their great national holiday. There is no insane use of firearms, cannon, toy pistols, and other means of noise and human destruction, that disgrace our own national day. There is no list of dead and injured.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the celebration will take the form of processions of school children and outdoor patriotic exercises. Speeches in Norwegian and English will tell the story of the Northland's struggle for liberty since the saga times and the days of fair-haired Harold, who defeated the numerous petty kings and united the nation under a single crown in 872 A.D.</p>
   <p>The present constitution was adopted at Eidsvold, a provincial town near Christiania, May 17, 1814, in the face of determined opposition of Bernadotte of Sweden and the allied European powers.</p>
