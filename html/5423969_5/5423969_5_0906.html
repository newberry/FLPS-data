   <p>The new Immigration Law passed by Congress has been vetoed by President Taft, his objection being centered on the clause requiring immigrants to be able to read and write some language. The President does not consider the ability to read and write an assurance of the desirability of persons wishing to enter the U.S.A. The veto, it seems, kills the bill, for the House seems unable to muster the necessary two-thirds majority to pass the law over the President's veto.</p>
   <p>This law has been throughly discussed throughout the land, and the foreign press has condemned it from the very start. As far as our Scandinavian people are concerned, the law is no bar to entrance, as illiteracy is practically unknown in these countries. Every boy and girl has learned to read and write and the only illiterates one finds there are the feebleminded and idiots, against whose entry we already have laws on our statutes. The great immigration from Southern European countries is bringing a double <span class="page-break">\2</span>menace to the U.S.A. The vest majority come under one or both of the headings, "illiterate" and "criminal." This is the element against which the vetoed law was drawn up, but the form in which it was set up proved to be its downfall. A literacy test should be part of the regulations, but not the only deciding factor.</p>
