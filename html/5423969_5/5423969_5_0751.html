   <p>General Agent, Berger Osland, has been appointed captain of infantry in the National Guard and already this afternoon he went to Washington to report for duty.</p>
   <p>The appointment, for most of Mr. Osland's friends,came as a surprise, at least as to form; for he was asked in advance whether he wished to accept the appointment. In other words, the position sought the man, not vice versa.</p>
   <p>Mr. Osland received a telegram this morning requesting that he report as soon as possible. Being a man quick of thought and action, he boarded his train this afternoon.</p>
   <p>As is well-known, Captain Osland, is the president of Chicago Norwegian Club, recently re-elected by a large majority, and now the club, to which he is strongly attached, through him will get its tenth service star in its service flag.</p>
   <p>It will be remembered that Captain Osland was serving in 1915 at the Fort Sheridan Training Camp.</p>
