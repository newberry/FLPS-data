   <p>The Eielsen Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church held its seventieth annual meeting last week. The first day of the conference was devoted to the election of National officers and a discussion on the future religious program.</p>
   <p>On Friday, the second day of the conference, The Christian Layity was discussed. It was resolved that Reverend A. L. Wiek, the editor, should have an increase in salary of $25 per month. It was reported that there was a deficit of $21.13 The reason for the deficit is that subscribers fail to pay their subscription fees in time and many do not pay at all. A collection totaling $77.65 was taken up to cover the deficit. A recommendation to change the bylaws was discussed.</p>
