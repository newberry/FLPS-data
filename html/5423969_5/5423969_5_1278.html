   <p>The well known baritone soloist, Joel Mossberg, recently returned from a very successful concert tour, from which our Norwegian Colony welcomes him with open arms. Mr. Mossberg, beside being our favorite soloist, is our dean of conductors in male chorus circles.</p>
   <p>The recent concert tour was a financial and artistic triumph, and Scandia congratulates Mr. Mossberg and his ultra-capable accompanist, Paul Hultman, a pupil of the great Scharwenka.</p>
