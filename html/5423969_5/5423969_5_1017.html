   <p>A recent issue of Addresse Avisen (The Address), a paper published in Trondhjem, Norway, printed an attack on Dags Posten (The Daily Post) and its editor, Mr. Oppedal. Mr. Oppedal, a former member of the Chicago Norwegian colony, is well known, and has been respected for years as a man of vision, intelligence, and justice; however, in this article, a young journalist, Andrew Foss, attempts to belittle Mr. Oppedal by stating that "he has lived for awhile in Chicago, a heavenly section where civilization and culture can hardly be said to have taken root." The reason for the attack seems to be that Foss at one time had surreptitiously obtained a certain public document which had not been released for publication, and sent this to the Aften Posten (The Evening Post) in Christiania. In Chicago this would have been called a scoop, in New York a beat, but in Norway it is considered unethical, and Editor Oppedal sharply criticized the young man's ideas of good journalism.</p>

   <p>The controversy in itself does not concern Scandia, but when The Address prints an article, written by an inexperienced and ignorant cub contributor, attacking Chicago and comparing it unfavorably with an insignificant place the size of Trondhjem, our civic pride must be given utterance. We are sending both the young upstart and the publication for which he works, marked copies of this issue to enlighten them as to what Chicago has to offer in the way of "civilization and culture." We feel that it is our duty to correct the false impressions of this arrogant piece of self-importance.</p>
   <p>One hardly knows whether to laugh or curse when Chicago, the metropolis of the west, the world's greatest city in the way of progress and culture, is publicized by an uninformed and inexperienced boy as a "heavenly section lacking culture," and when a man of Oppedal's education and experience is described as having received in Chicago a "bringing up" that falls short of the standard of Norway in general and Trondhjem in particular.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Chicago educational institutions are on a par with the world's greatest and best. We have two of the world's greatest universities (both in Chicago), two of the world's greatest and most used libraries, Rush Medical College, College of Physicians and Surgeons, College of Dental Surgery (the world's best), Technical schools (which have turned out many of the world's greatest engineers), and the twenty million dollar Field Museum of Natural History (in which the entire city of Trondhjem could be lost). We have the Theodore Thomas Orchestra, the equal of any orchestra in the world; the Grand Opera; and countless theatres, unexcelled for beauty of structure, interior decoration, acoustic properties, and attendance. Where else can one find such an abundance of massive buildings, institutional and cultural, to say nothing of beautiful homes? We could continue along these lines indefinitely, but this would be superfluous.</p>
   <p>Chicago cannot be harmed in any way by the drivel of one still suffering from growing pains; but when Chicago's eighty thousand Norwegian-Americans, who love their adopted city and country, read such twaddle in a Norwegian paper <span class="page-break">\4</span>they are ashamed to think that this foolishness is countenanced by Norwegian editors. We would like this man Foss to come to Chicago--his ego would be promptly and effectively deflated, and he would begin to realize that he is merely a small toad in a small puddle.</p>
