   <p>The young people's society of Zion Lutheran Church gave a social last Wednesday evening, which was a success in every way--large attendance, and a good program well executed.</p>
   <p>Misses Agnes Anderson an C. Olsen gave recitations that were loudly applauded; Dr. Stillion played a violin solo; Miss Dahl played a piano solo; Mr. Post and Miss Loeb gave vocal solos. The well-known Jubal Male Chorus rendered several songs, and the church choir under its leader. Mr. John Croeger, never sang better than on this occasion.</p>
   <p>Reverend [J. H.] Meyer read the report from the Society's first meeting, November 30, 1897, giving a brief address in connection therewith....He emphasized that the future of the Society is in the hands of the young people.</p>
