   <p>In Skandinaven some time ago, I read a letter from a layman, under the caption, "Take away the partition". I wish to thank you for that article. If we could have a number of expressions from laymen in the same spirit, I would then have faith enough in our Lutheran pastors in America to believe that they would take into consideration such expressions of a public demand for peace within the church; a demand for peace between the church groups, because such expressions would carry proof that the people are weary of the continued strife.</p>
   <p>I am not a hater of pastors; the pastors who know me would testify to that fact; but I must confess that when quietly considering the long continued strife within the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America, which had its inception at the very start of the church within the Norwegian groups, then I cannot escape the conclusion that the divisions that took place and still persist, <span class="page-break">2</span>have largely been caused by the pastors. Many of the pastors among us are able men, and these men I respect and love...But if the clergy would disregard the points of disagreement in their sermons, turning instead to the presentation of the plain straightforward word of God, then, I am convinced, they would do more good among our people than they now do through their emphasis on points of strife.</p>
   <p>There was much rejoicing when the United Church was founded, not only because of the fact that churches which had been disunited until then were joining hands, but also because it seemed probable that such churches that were standing outside would join the united groups later. Much sorrow has been occasioned because the hopes, bright at the time, were unfulfilled. A new split occurred within the Lutheran Synod, and now we see the division between the United Church and the Free Church.</p>

   <p>It is a subject for much praying among the believers.... that the day may come soon when the Norwegian Lutheran sects may say begone to the old strife and may extend to each other the hand of brotherly love so that the many minor congregations may find their way to unite into larger ones, and the many sects into one large Lutheran Church.....</p>
