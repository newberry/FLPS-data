   <p>During the first part of the coming week Chicago Norwegians will entertain two prominent clergymen from Norway. Bishop Boskman and Reverend Hans Nilsen Hauge were delegated to attend the unveiling of the Hauge memorial monument at the Concordia School in Moorehead, Minnesota. They have visited several cities of the West, where they have held meetings, and it is expected they will preach in several of Chicago's churches during their stay here. While in Chicago they will be entertained in the home of Reverend J.H. Meyer, 2614 North Kedzie Avenue next door to Christ Church, of which Reverend Meyer is the pastor. The pastor and members of Chicago's Norwegian churches are planning an active week of meetings, banquets, etc., for the eminent clergymen and Scandia joins with our people in a hearty welcome to our guests.</p>
