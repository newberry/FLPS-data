   <p>Our "Minor and Major" column has received many articles criticizing the National Singers League's choice of soloist for the coming convention. One of them voices resentment against Emil Bjorn, the conductor. The complaint is in reference to Mr. Bjorn's decoration, by decree of King Haakon of Norway, as a Knight of the Order of St. Olaf. One of our readers, Dr. Thomas Warloe, takes exception to what he frankly labels a dirty, anonymous attack on Emil Bjorn. Dr. Warloe writes, "When King Haakon honored Mr. Bjorn for his outstanding work in the realm of Norwegian music in America, the honor was honestly earned and well merited. Every fair-minded and appreciative singer or lover of music proclaims the justice of the King's choice, though in this case, as usual, one will hear from a very few who always say that the 'grapes are sour, anyway.'</p>
   <p>"When one recalls," writes Mr. Warloe, "the enthusiasm of the assembled singers at the announcement of the decoration of Mr. Bjorn, it is both disgusting and laughable when a man, signing himself 'D. D. S.,' in an exaggerated idea of his own importance, presumes to criticize this choice. The egotism of this man, <span class="page-break">2</span>who hides his identity behind an anonymous signature, in demanding that Mr. Bjorn refuse the honor and return the jewel of the Order, makes one long for an open season on self-important bigheads (empty, of course).</p>
   <p>"There is no call for Mr. Bjorn to return the decoration nor any reason for his resigning as director-in-chief of the National Singers' League. Mr. Bjorn is too well-known in musical and art circles and too well-loved and esteemed by all decent, sensible Norwegians, both here and in Norway, to even give a thought to the mouthings of egotistical fools like 'D. D. S.'"</p>
