   <p>Paul O. Stensland, former president of the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank, has shaken the dust of Chicago from his sandals and now resides in Brunswick, Georgia. Here, among the palms, roses and lillies he can relax in all comfort and enjoy the health he has regained. Mr. Stensland, no longer suffering from bronchitis is enjoying better health than he has had for many years and is now engaged in the real estate business in the sunny south. We trust he will, once in a while, think fondly and longingly of Chicago, where he lived so long, and where he has a host of friends in spite of all. Scandia wishes Mr. Stensland every success and real enjoyment in his new abode.</p>
