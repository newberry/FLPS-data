   <p>In the nineties people from all over the world came to Chicago, the metropolis of the West. Many of the arrivals were Norwegians; the majority of these came at the time of the Columbian Exposition. The newcomers had different reasons for coming here. Some came just to visit; others came on business; many of them came to stay, hoping in a short time to become wealthy and return to Norway and live in comfort ever after. The great majority of this last group stayed; they found that the riches of America were not so easy to get, and were sadly disappointed.</p>
   <p>Most of the newcomers thought that they knew a lot about American politics; they too were disappointed, for they soon found that they knew very little about our politics, and they also learned that American politics was a business, and a business for the most part unclean.</p>
   <p>The old Norwegian settlers knew more about our politics than did the visitors.</p>
   
   <p>But our Norwegian-Americans learned about a change in Norwegian politics that was news to them. In Norway the left-wing and the right-wing parties were deadly enemies. Here in America they apparently were quite good friends, even during a "mudslinging campaign". The old colonists thought that this was also the case in Norway, but things had changed.</p>
   <p>Many of the newcomers were short of funds, and their friends here in Chicago tried to get work for them, but usually without success. What a disappointment! America, where gold is found in the gutters, where every one is rich, America the land of golden opportunity! One cannot believe anything nowadays.</p>
