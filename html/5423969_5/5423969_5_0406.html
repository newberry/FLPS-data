   <p>It was thirteen years ago yesterday that the Marcus Congregation was founded in a German church at the corner of Springfield Avenue and Hirsch Street.....For four and a half years the pastor preached to his flock in a store across the street from the church that the Congregation eventually leased. Later, construction on a church building was begun, but for some years only the basement was completed.....</p>
