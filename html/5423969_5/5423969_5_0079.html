   <p>p.8.......Chicago's celebration of a "Safe and Sane July 4th" was a decided success in every way. The participation, in the parade, of our Norwegian people, while not conspicious by vast numbers, was colorful and in keeping with the spirit of the occasion. The boys from the Ski Club, white sweatered and with their ski on their shoulders, made a very good impression and were heartily applauded all along the line of march.</p>
   <p>Following the Ski Club came the Norwegian Glee Club, and other units of the Singers League, Sleifner Athletic Club and Norwegian lodges, each group designited by artistic banners and plentifully supplied with Norwegian and American flags. The Norwegian division was headed by Math Petersen's Band, furnished by the Norwegian National League. Two of the musicians were overcome by the heat, neither one of them was a Norwegian; a Dane and a German being the casualties.</p>
