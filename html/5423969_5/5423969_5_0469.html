   <p>Last Wednesday evening the Bible classes of Johanne's Church and the Hope Mission were consolidated. The speakers for the evening were Professor Oscar L. Olsen and Reverend Trollestad.</p>
   <p>The classes were combined because of the necessity for larger quarters and in an effort to popularize the Bible Institute.</p>
