   <p>A couple of weeks ago I was at Mathiesen's Merchants Hotel to solicit ads for the Old Peoples Home program; I was introduced to a lady from Norway who unknown to me was a philanthropist who was traveling all over the U.S.A. for the purpose of contacting Norwegian girls and boys. She told them about their mother country and bringing them a message from Norway. She is going to give free lectures in all sections of Chicago. She asks all Norwegians to come and have a chat with her. She will take names and addresses of their families and call upon them on her return to Norway.</p>
   <p>She is the wife of Major Hjalmar Waalers of the Norwegian Army, and a daughter of Bishop Christian Dick in Norway.</p>
