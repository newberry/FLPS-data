   <p>Certain correspondents appear confused in regard to the several opinions expressed concerning the proposed memorial gift to Norway. They fear that the whole will end in "newspaper brawls."</p>
   <p>Skandinaven cannot look upon the matter in this way; as the paper sees it, the many proposals offered furnish a pleasant testimony to the general and broad interest in the proposition. The Norwegians in America are people of opinions, and they are accustomed to express their thoughts in the newspapers. It would have been strange indeed and also rather sad if everybody at once had taken a similar stand in this matter, for that would have indicated that few if any had real interest in the matter. The strong expression of opinions in the case shows that people are interested and, therefore, that when the time is ripe one may expect general participation in the undertaking.</p>

   <p>It will be merely a matter of time until the most suitable form for a gift to the homeland has been found, and we can all participate together in the Freedom Festival in Norway in 1914.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven cannot see any danger of a "newspaper brawl" in this matter. Everybody has the right to present his plan and give his reasons why the particular plan seems best to him. Such an exchange of opinions is not "brawl"; on the contrary, the presupposition of the whole discussion is simply that everybody presents the best plan he can think of; the acknowledgment by everybody that the desire to find the best plan is the basis for the discussion will inevitably lead to an attitude not of "brawl" but of co-operation for the purpose of finding the plan which will appeal to all.</p>
   <p>A look at the list of proposals so far presented will indicate that broad discussion of the proposals and of others to come not only is important, but it is absolutely necessary. It becomes clear that the Norwegian-Americans of our day are not familiar with the Norway of today; present-day Norway is to them a strange country.</p>

   <p>These people remember the kind of country Norway was thirty, forty, or fifty years ago, but they do not know Norway as it is. The Norwegian-American newspapers have tried their best to keep their readers abreast with developments in the homeland, but many of the people have probably had but little time for reading because of the struggle for existence in their new homes. Tasks close at hand have claimed their attention, and under these conditions the old country has, so to speak, slid away from them; they have lost track of it. Yet the country of their fathers has not lost its hold on their heartstrings, and they will want to join in the greeting to Norway on the great day of honor of that country, the centennial of Norwegian independence. In their speculations on the nature of that greeting they cling to the picture of Norway which is dear to their memory, a Norway as it was before they left for America, not the Norway actually existing now.</p>
   <p>The necessary presupposition for a worthy participation by the Norwegian-Americans in the Norwegian centennial of independence is that we learn to know the land of our fathers as it stands forth today. Only then can we determine suitably what we can and ought to do.</p>

   <p>As mentioned above, the list of proposals show that some of those making suggestions were doing so under mistaken presuppositions. As an example of this the plan for an insurance fund for fishers may be cited. In itself this is one of the most appealing thoughts presented. The matter has already been taken care of by the Norwegian government: a public fund has been established to be applied to fishermen's survivors in case of accident. Nowadays if a Norwegian fisher dies at sea his widow and children will be supported by the fund until the children are grown....The plan is to have the fund enlarged so as to make it possible to include also sailors under the insurance plan created by the fund. Accident insurance has also been put into effect by the government in other fields. The example referred to will make it clear that if a memorial gift to Norway in connection with the coming centennial is to assume a suitable form we must gain knowledge of the actual conditions in our old homeland.</p>

   <p>Our first task, then, is to learn....how the Norwegian people have been building and developing their country during these latter years; the state of that country today; what definite plans have been laid for future work.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven is hoping and believing that the discussion on the memorial gift may be conducted in a manner, by our press and our public, that the fruits of the exchange of opinions may become of greater value to Norway and to the Norwegian-Americans, even than the amount of money collected and forwarded, however large this amount might become.</p>
