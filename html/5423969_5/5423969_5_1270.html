   <p>On the occasion of the farewell of Rev. Kildahl, for many years rector of the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital, the entire medical staff will assemble on Monday, Aug. 19th, at a banquet to be given in honor of this beloved leader. The hospital staff are unanimous in crediting Dr. Kildahl with having been the moving spirit of the institution and all regret his leaving the highest post of honor in the Lutheran Church to take up his pastoral duties at Our Saviors Lutheran church, in Wilwaukee.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian colony join the hospital group in wishing the kindly old pastor the best of everything life can bring, and congratulate Milwaukee for having obtained the services of this excellent clergyman,</p>
