   <p>St. Johannes Church, on the corner of Humboldt and Cortez Streets was dedicated last Sunday. The new Church was full, and finely decorated. Rev. J. Nordby made the dedication sermon. Rev. H. K. Blecken, the pastor of the church, also spoke. Rev. A. K. Sagen also said a few words. The congregation has worked for twelve years to see its dreams come true. There is also a parsonage in connection with the chruch. No wonder that all felt proud and happy.</p>
