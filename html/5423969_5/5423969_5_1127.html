   <p>The Chicago Record-Herald has learned that Peary has discovered the "Swedish explorer, Sverdrup, on the western coast of Greenland". This interesting information comes in the form of a "special cable dispatch" to the Record-Herald, reading in part as follows:</p>
   <p>"Gothenburg, September 3.</p>
   <p>"News has been received here that Peary has found Sverdrup, the Swedish explorer who left for the North Pole three years ago, on the western coast of Greenland.</p>
   <p>"It is believed that Sverdrup who sailed in the 'Fram,' the ship that carried Nansen so far north, was unprepared to go around Greenland. The report has caused a great deal of anxiety here among those who hoped that Sverdrup would <span class="page-break">\2</span>find Andree somewhere on the east coast of Greenland."</p>
   <p>This alleged "special cable dispatch" is a fake on the face of it. Everybody in Gothenburg knows that Sverdrup is a Norwegian, and nobody in the city would make himself ridiculous by attempting to parade the explorer as a Swede.</p>
   <p>Everybody in Gothenburg knows that Sverdrup did not "leave for the North Pole"; that he was "prepared to go around Greenland" as far as practicable; and that the sole purpose of his expedition was to explore the unknown parts of the eastern coast of Greenland.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to understand why the Record-Herald should persist in making a specialty of printing idiotic and insulting fake "dispatches" about Norway and the Norwegians.</p>
