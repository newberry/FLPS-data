   <p>Several English-speaking contemporaries have published an alleged dispatch dated Christiania, June 27, and reading in part as follows:</p>
   <p>"The program of the leftists for the coming Storting elections has created a great stir on account of the radical departures proposed. Among other things, it declares for a Norwegian consular system independent of Sweden, referendum on important acts, and suffrage for taxpaying women. 'This,' says the Verdens Gang (World's Progress),' is the program which our party will later develop and on which we will stand against the politics of humiliating milk-and-water politics and the party of beaten-track policy and wholesale promises.'</p>
   <p>"The Verdens Gang's version makes the program more radical than many in the party can swallow, and while there is no doubt that the referendum idea would prove popular with the electors, its final acceptance into the program by the leaders is doubtful. The proposal, however, serves to illustrate the strides which <span class="page-break">\2</span>the people of Norway are making in self-government.</p>
   <p>"The conservative or union party in Norway is about to lose several of its most influential leaders and will have difficulty in replacing them. V. Ullman, president of the Storting, will, it is reported, resign his seat and devote himself to educational work. Prime Minister Steen seems likely to retire in the fall, owing to his great age."</p>
   <p>It is probably unnecessary to state that this "dispatch" never touched any wire. It was written for a Chicago paper by a gentleman who knows as much about Norwegian politics as does the man in the moon. There is not a single correct statement in his "cable"; it is all a maze of errors.</p>
   <p>The program of the leftists was adopted several months ago. It was rather vague and indefinite on the leading issues of the day and hence created no stir at all. The plank insisting upon separate consular service for Norway has appeared in every liberal platform upward of ten years. The program demands neither the referendum nor suffrage for taxpaying women.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Dissatisfied with what it calls the "do-nothing policy" of the present liberal government, the Verdens Gang, one of the leading champions of the party in the press, has turned upon the liberal "organization" with the evident intention of defeating it at the polls. The program attributed by the dispatch-maker to the liberals has been launched by The Verdens Gang to afford it a vantage ground for attacks upon the liberal flanks.</p>
   <p>In Norway, as in the United States, the principle of the referendum applies to constitutional amendments and in local regulation of the liquor traffic and other strictly local affairs. But no party has proposed that it be made applicable to general legislation, though it is gaining ground, especially among the conservatives, who take the ground that the referendum would operate as a check upon the increasing production of the law mills.</p>
   <p>The present government is liberal, as was the Storting recently dissolved. It follows that Steen and Ullman are liberals, not conservatives. They will retire if rejected by the people, not otherwise.</p>
