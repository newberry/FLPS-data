   <p>The Norwegian Turner Society held a Christmas social last Sunday evening in Voran Turner Hall. The attendance was far larger than had been expected. Exhibitions of the boys' turner activities interested the audience greatly; the boys did a splendid job.</p>
   <p>Mr. Einar Bergendahl functioned as Santa Claus, assisted by Mr. Simon Thompson. These two men distributed baskets of fruit, candy, etc., and also gave a number of humoristic exhibitions, all of which were received with thunderous applause by the festive throng.</p>
   <p>Miss Elvira Anderson gave declamation numbers; violin duets were played by Messrs. George Tolzien and Charles Lund, and by Messrs. Einar Debes and Birger Stockflet.</p>
   <p>The Christmas tree, beautifully decorated, reached all the way up to the <span class="page-break">2</span>ceiling. Among the decorations were several Norwegian flags. The social was a success in every respect.</p>
