   <p>A jolly and cozy farewell social was held by the Norwegian Singing Society in its club rooms at Wicker Park Hall last Thursday evening for the young members who have been drawn for military service and are now ready to go to camp. From start to finish the social was a great success. Patriotic enthusiasm gave added warmth to the prevailing feeling of comradeship and good will, and the entertainment given was in harmony with both.</p>
   <p>The loss of members going to war was to some extent compensated for through the entrance of nine new members, announced as the evening was drawing to a close.</p>
