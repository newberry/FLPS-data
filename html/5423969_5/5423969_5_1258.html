   <p>The Norwegian Turner Society gathered at their club rooms on Saturday, Mar. 15th, to honor their president, Mr. Martin Arneson, and his wife, with a surprise party. It was a double surprise so far as the guest couple was concerned; the first surprise came when a sizable committee called for them at their home, and the second came when they were ushered into a hall full of people who startled them anew with lusty shouts of "Surprise!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Arneson has been an active member of the Turners since 1888, and a few years ago was a member of the championship team that went to Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Turner Society, some time ago, seemed to drift into a back-water eddy, and it was the unceasing effort and optimism of Mr. Arneson that brought it back to life and to greater prominence than ever.</p>
   <p>A fine banquet was served, seasoned with speeches, songs, and music by the society's own orchestra; this was followed by dancing until the early hours.</p>

   <p>Not one of those present will soon forget the Martins' party; nor will they soon forget the Martin who in 25 years has never missed a meeting.</p>
   <p>It is men like Martin Arneson who not only build but maintain what they have built.</p>
