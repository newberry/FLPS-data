   <p>p.8..........Dr. Bohmer and landscape artist G. Sather, two of our well-known Chicago Norwegians are about to begin on an extended trip to foreign shores. Their first stop will be Lisbon followed by a trip up the Nile. Mr. Sather is to paint and Dr. Bohmer is to write for Scandia and we expect some realistic pictures and descriptions of the Sahara with these talented men collaborating. From the Sahara their tour leads through Italy to Switzerland, where Mount Blank will be climbed, painted and described. The autumn season will be spent in Norway and Scandia confidently looks forward to new scenes and word pictures of the world's most scenic section.</p>
