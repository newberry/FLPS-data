   <p>Sunday, February 16, 1913, was a banner day for the Ebenezer Norwegian Lutheran Congregation; on that day the new church building was dedicated.</p>
   <p>Following is the history of the Congregation as read by Reverend O. J. Mundahl after the morning sermon:</p>
   <p>"In 1899, we find Reverend H. A. Hason, Reverend Lars Harrisville, and Reverend G. O. Paulsrud, of the Hauge Synod, preaching to the people on the South Side-not in a church, but in the homes of the people. After a short time, four families met to discuss the problem of organizing a congregation. At a meeting held on March 19, 1900 in the home of Fred Thompson, a congregation was officially organized and given the name "Ebenezer". The above-named pastors were present.</p>
   <p>"In a few months the Congregation rented an English church where prayer meetings were held several evenings each week, and two regular sermons delivered on Sunday. Several business meetings were held, and finally the Congregation decided to call a permanent pastor. It was unanimously decided to call Reverend S. S. Westby from the Hauge Synod. He accepted, and began his activities immdiately.</p>
   <p>"At the end of a year, the members bought the church that they had previously rented, but the owners of the property wanted to build a new church on the lot. The Ebenezer congregation thereupon moved its church to two adjoining lots which had been purchased for $2,000. In the summer of 1902, the Congregation became a member of the Hauge Synod, and the new church was dedicated in July..... Reverend Westby was moved by the Synod to the Newman Grove Church, and Reverend Odland was called to serve Ebenezer.</p>
   <p>"About a year later changes were again made, and Reverend K. M. J. Mjaanes became the permanent pastor late in 1905.....Early in 1911, the Congregation had paid all its debts....</p>
   <p>"Reverend Mjaanes resigned in January, 1912. On February 3, 1912, the Congregation decided to build a new and more modern church. Two lots were bought at 71st and Aberdeen Streets for $1,550. O. J. Munddahl, who had been ordained by the Synod during the previous summer, was installed by the district superintendent, Reverend A. O. Mortvedt.</p>
   <p>"On Sunday, October 13, 1912, the cornerstone was laid and the erection of the church began. The church, as it stands today, cost $10,000."</p>
