   <p>Christmas was celebrated in the Norwegian churches as usual, with services, special music, and Sunday-school activities. In a number of the churches, Lutheran, Methodist, and Baptist, there were both morning and evening services. The attendance was very good and, especially in the Lutheran churches, many outsiders joined with the members in the festivities. In some of the churches services were held also on December 26.</p>
   <p>In the Bethany Church, Reverend J. Z. Torgersen, pastor, there was a Christmas tree festival for the Sunday-school children on the evening of Christmas Day. The minister delivered an address, the children and the regular choir of the church sang, and Christmas gifts were distributed.</p>
   <p>In the Bethlehem Church, corner of Huron Street and Central Avenue, a Christmas festival was held on Thursday evening. In front of the altar a large Christmas tree was placed, decorated with candles and other trimmings. The church was crowded and there were a large number of children present. The celebration opened with scripture reading and prayer by Reverend G. T. Rygh. A number of entertaining readings and musical numbers were rendered, most of them by the children of the Sunday school.</p>
   <p>In the Trinity church, Peoria Street and Grand Avenue, a large audience gathered for the Christmas tree festival on Thursday evening. A beautifully decorated Christmas tree was placed in front of the altar and at the top was placed a star with the inscription "Good Tidings". Reverend H. A. Hansen opened the celebration with prayer and a speech in which he called to mind the true Christmas star that leads to Jesus. Afterwards the children entertained with songs and declamations, and the celebration ended with the distribution of fruit and candy to the children.</p>
   <p>In the Church of Our Savior, corner of May and Erie Streets, so many people were present that it was not possible to find seats for all. Reverend Alfred O. Johnson opened the social with prayer and reading from the scriptures. The children of the Sunday school gave evidence of their ability to entertain by individual and choral singing, and by declamations and orations. Peter Johnson, assistant superintendent or the Sunday school, functioned as master of ceremonies, and before the celebration ended, eighty-four gifts were presented to as many children--those who had been regular in their attendance throughout the year. To Reverend Johnson was presented a fine gold watch chain from the teachers of the Sunday school. The Society of Confirmands presented twenty dollars to the treasury of the church.</p>
