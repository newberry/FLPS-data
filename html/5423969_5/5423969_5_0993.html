   <p>During the past week Chicago has entertained an unusual group--the delegates to the International Commercial Congress at Boston, Massachusetts. Norway's representation, per capita, was the largest of all foreign countries. This shows that our little mother country is as wideawake and progressive in commercial lines as any other country in Europe, if not more so. Our own Norwegian colony was well pleased with the visit of our countrymen, and every effort was put forth to make the visit a pleasant and profitable one for our Norwegian delegates who came from all parts of Norway to represent many of its various industries.</p>
   <p>Business between Norway and the United States in general, and Chicago in particular, is certain to benefit from the increase in knowledge of the possibilities for both countries. The new Norwegian-American Line, whose two new liners will start early in 1913, was a topic of much discussion. It was the undivided opinion of visitors and Chicagoans alike that the new Line will be one of the greatest factors in increasing commerce and passenger traffic between Norway and the United States.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian-American Line will be the only direct line between New York and Norwegian ports and will undoubtedly be well patronized.</p>
