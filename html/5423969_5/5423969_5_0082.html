   <p>p. 4..................The aftermath of the celebration of May 17th remains sour. Throughout the Norwegian colony the conversation still inevitably swings to the May 17th parade. In the opinion of practically all our people the children's parade, arranged by our Norwegian pastors, is spoken of as a miserable exhibition, brainlessly planned and arrogantly defended by the pastors. Scandia agrees wholly with the critics.</p>
   <p>The one phase of the parade that aroused the disgust and indignation of our people as the music. Three bands had been obtained at a cheap price and cheap music we <span class="gap">[gap]</span> heard. The manner in which they played our Norwegian music was a decided disgrace and when "Ja Vi Elsker" (Norway's national anthemn) was sung the accompanying music by the massed bands was nothing short of rotten. This number as a scandal of such magnitude that we can almost see Rekard Nordraak turning over in his grave in agony over the musical murder perpetrated.</p>
   
   <p>One can imagine the effect such a showing has on the younger generation; the shame and embarrassment of Norwegian youth and the ridicule heaped upon our people by other nationalities. We try to instill in the minds of our Norwegian-American children a love and respect for our mother country, its culture and traditions, then along come our Norwegian preachers who should be our teachers and leaders, and they stage a farce that makes our blood boil. Gross ignorance and arrogance was displayed by our Norwegian clergy in their choice of music and in their asinine management of the whole celebration. Of one thing we may rest assured - our Norwegian colony will, hereafter, see to it that the preachers are left on the shelf as far as May 17th is concerned.</p>
