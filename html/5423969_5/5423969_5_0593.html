   <p>Referring to the article in last Friday's edition of Skandinaven, by Reverend C. K. Solberg, I beg to make the following observations:</p>
   <p>The paper referred to in the article, the Evangelisten never sailed under false colors. In Evangelisten's first number of the present year, issued on January 1, one week before the article by Mr. Solberg was written, the following appeared, announcing the policy of the paper:</p>
   <p>"Evangelisten represents an organized, biblical, evangelical free religious activity in which every believer is a priest and has the right to read and interpret the Bible under the guidance of the Holy Spirit....."</p>
   
   <p>Reverend Solberg is a subscriber to the Evangelisten and has undoubtedly read the statement quoted. In addition, in a conversation with him, I definitely emphasized that in the paper the question of doctrine is considered of less importance compared with the central figure in Christianity, the crucified Christ.</p>
   <p>In his article Reverend Solberg says that the contents of the Evangelisten are good and even recommendable....Everything considered, I can but come to the conclusion that Reverend Solberg finds that the paper under discussion is not very dangerous--even for a Lutheran. I am afraid that there are other than doctrinal fears which have been inducing Reverend Solberg to make his attack.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The paper and certain churches connected with it had been comparatively successful in their work. Mr. Andersen intimates that the cause of Mr. Solberg's attack is jealousy.]</p>
