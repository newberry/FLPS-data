   <p>Mrs. Ulrikka Feldtman Bruun, the organizer for the National W. C. T. U. among the Scandinavians in America, was born in Norway, February 1, 1854. When 21 years old she came to America, landing in Chicago, June 30, 1874. The struggle that followed prepared her for the great work she has since accomplished. She entered Kalamazoo College in Michigan for one year. In 1881 she married Mr. J. N. Bruun. Mrs. Bruun has been a widow for many years. Mrs. Bruun is the author of three books, all religious temperance stories, printed in the Scandinavian language; as well as three sacred song books, together with articles and stories for the press. In February 1899 she began the publication in Chicago of Det Hvide Band (The White Ribbon), the only Norwegian-Danish Christian temperance paper published in this country by a woman. Her greatest work has been the founding of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Hope Mission now on West Ohio and Noble streets, Chicago. With the assistance of Mathilda B. Carse, president of the Central W. C. T. U., she was first able to open a small Scandinavian reading room in October 1888. For eleven years the W. C. T. U. paid the rent for this room and Mrs. Bruun gave her services entirely free. From the mission sprang the Scandinavian W. C. T. U. of which Mrs. Bruun is president, the men's Scandinavian Prohibition Club, a local of the Loyal Temperance Legion and a Sunday school. For seven years a free dispensary was maintained. One thousand have frequented the reading room during each year. In 1900 she opened a Scandinavian working girls home and employment bureau in connection with the mission. In 1895 Miss Frances E. Willard secured Mrs. Bruun's appointment as national organizer among the Scandinavians for the W. C. T. U. She has traveled and lectured in Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, and the Dakotas, everywhere lifting up the banner of Christ and temperance. She spends five or six months every year lecturing. All money saved goes to her Chicago work.</p>
