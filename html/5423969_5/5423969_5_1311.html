   <p>p.8...............Chicago's Norwegian colony, especially those interested in athletes, music and other forms of entertainment are recipients of bad news. Engineer Anton P. Jaeger, champion of the "Ski Club", baritone of the "Kvartet Klubben," entertainment chairman of "Den Norske Klub" has left for Philadelphia, Penn., having been promoted by his employers and transfered to the new location. We all congratulate Mr. Jaeger upon his promotion, but the entire colony will miss the genial and energetic Anton wherever a good time is being planned. Another promotion with his return to Chicago would meet with nothing short of a Norwegian jubilee.</p>
