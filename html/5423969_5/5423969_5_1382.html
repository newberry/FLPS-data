   <p>The well-known Norwegian is sleeping his last sleep in Chicago. An old newspaper man and professor. He was followed to his grave by many old settlers.</p>
   <p>Professor Thrond Bothne's funeral took place from St. Pauls Church, West North Avenue, of the Norwegian Synod, on Thursday afternoon. A large procession of mourners, most of them old settlers attended the funeral. Of out-of-town people, representatives were present from Decorah Posten, Hamline Seminary, and Luther College.</p>
   <p>Among the tributes paid Bothne at his bier, the most striking one was, perhaps, by Prof. O. E. Brandt of Hamline Seminary, and a former student of Prof. Bothne's.</p>
   <p>Few men in the Norwegian church here in the United States, said Professor Brandt, have exerted greater influence than Thrond Bothne. As a teacher he was unexcelled; he had a unique way of dealing with the students; he won their confidence, and his confidence in them was a source of strength for them.</p>
   <p>Professor Bothne is buried in Mount Olive Cemetery.</p>
