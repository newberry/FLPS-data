   <p>Ole Theobaldi, Norwegian violinist well known in Chicago, is at present in Mexico and as usual is in the middle of things. In a letter from Cindad Juarez, he writes that on the 17th, he and his company were to give a concert in Mexico City, but whether or not they would come through alive he did not know as the insurgents had issued a decree that no foreigner was to be permitted to cross Mexico. Viking-like Theobaldi swore that he would go to Mexico City and play the concert even though every insurgent in Mexico were a devil and all mobilized to stop him, for here was a question of five hundred dollars (American). Theobaldi also wrote that if he comes through in good order he will be in Chicago by Jan. 15th, when he will gladly assist the Chicago Singers if they can get together for a joint concert. He announces that the members of his troupe are artists in their various branches of music and the combination is a winning one.</p>
