   <p>Bjornstjerne Bjornson Lodge of the Sons of Norway held a little impromptu festival at its last meeting in honor of Abraham Abrahamsen, who on that day reached his 47th birthday. Mr. Abrahamsen is an old and active member of B.B. and is also the manager of the employment office maintained by the Sons of Norway.
