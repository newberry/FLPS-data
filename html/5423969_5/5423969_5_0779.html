   <p>On June 24 a special examination is to be held at the post office in Chicago, for young men wishing appointment as mail carriers or mail clerks. Those wishing to take the examination must apply not later than June 23. The applications are written on blanks which may be had by applying to Peter Newton at the Chicago Post Office.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven suggests to the young men among its readers that they try for the examination. If they pass, it may mean quite a lot to them; if they fail, no great harm has been done. Nobody is on the lists now; those who pass the examination, therefore, have the prospect of being appointed right away.</p>
   <p>According to a new law, in force from July 1, the wages will be as follows:</p>
   <p>The first year $600. If a man proves suitable for the work, he will be advanced after one year to the next grade, salary $800 per year. After this he will receive an increase of $100 per year until the salary reaches $1,100. Provided he proves to be of reasonable ability.</p>
   <p>These positions are secure. Once a man is appointed he cannot be discharged unless his work is unsatisfactory. He is safe from the uncertainties of political change. There are many Norwegian young men in Chicago who can hardly expect to do better in any other position. They ought to investigate this chance as soon as possible. Peter Newton, 13th floor at the post office will give the desired information. He is a Norwegian and would like to see capable Norwegians in the service of the post office.</p>
