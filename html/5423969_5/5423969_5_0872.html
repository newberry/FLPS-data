   <p>All civilized and semibarbarian countries in the world, except one, rejoice in the possession of a more or less appropriate name. The exception is the greatest of them all, this western republic of ours.</p>
   <p>"The United States of America," the name adopted by the Constitution, is a purely political designation. It is not a geographical name; it cannot be used as a common name for the people of the commonwealth, nor does it lend itself to the formation of any derivative adjective or verb. This great nation is, in fact, a people without a name, while the name of the country is colorless and extremely unwieldy in its lumbering length.</p>
   <p>Discussing the subject of a new name, Professor Moses Coit Tyler the well-known historian, recalls the various names which have been suggested. The <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>list is as follows: Columbia, Alleghania, Appalachia, Vesperia, Freeland, Fredonia, Cabotia, Vineland.</p>
   <p>Professor Tyler presents these suggestions as an amusing illustration of freakish nations. He thinks "America" should be adopted as the name of the country, replacing "the United States of America," and asserts that we have a perfect title to this name, notwithstanding the fact that it is also used as a designation of both continents of the western world.</p>
   <p>"The colonists," Professor Tyler says, "called themselves English, but that seemed to require some definition, and as early as the year 1646, I find in the writings of the time, they began to speak of themselves in a collective way as Americans. The earliest instance that I have ever noted is in a book written in New England in 1646, and this usage continued to grow.</p>
   <p>"Of course, there was not much need for it, for the colonies were separate <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and it did not become decided as a general designating term for the English in America until the approach of the American Revolution. Then it was that the absolute need of some common designating word other than local words and other than English, became absolutely imperative, and then it was that this word, 'America,' already in use for more than one hundred years, with its derivative, 'American,' sprang into nearly universal use in this country and in England, long before the Declaration of Independence, as a name for this particular group of people."</p>
   <p>Professor Tyler would seem to have demonstrated that the American people have a clear title to "America" as a name for their country. If, however, the Canadians and the people of Central and South America should succeed in obtaining an injunction against the use of "America," we have another historic name in reserve. The original name of this continent is Vineland. This name was given to the new world by the Norsemen who discovered America about 1000 A. D. and was adopted by the Icelandic and Norse historians in their famous <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>sagas. Inasmuch as the early history of the white man's America is found in the sagas and nowhere else, "Vineland" is the true historic name of the North American continent; and it so remained until "America" was adopted by the colonists in the seventeenth century.</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven agrees with Professor Tyler that we ought to give legal sanction to the use of "America" as the name of our republic. But if our title to "America" should be successfully contested, we may have recourse to the euphonius name of "Vineland". Every one of us would rather be an American than a Vinelander; but "Vinelander" is manifestly preferable to "United States-ite".</p>
