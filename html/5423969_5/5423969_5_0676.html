   <p>Vacation being over, the monthly meetings of the Lutheran Ministers Society once more will be held. The Society will meet on Monday morning, September 10, at ten o'clock, in Room C, Y.M.C.A., 153-155 South LaSalle Street.</p>
   <p>The executive committee has arranged an interesting program including a paper by Reverend George T. Rygh on the topic "Christ and the Social Problem".</p>
   <p>The Society comprises ministers of the Lutheran church without reference to synod connections, who are living in Chicago or suburbs. It was organized early this spring, and its success during the brief time of its existence has been very satisfactory. Representatives of most of the synods have joined, and new members are constantly being added.</p>
