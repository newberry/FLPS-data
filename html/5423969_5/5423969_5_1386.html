   <p>The famous singer was sitting at a corner table down at Fimstad's , when I found him, loudly discussing our Italian cooking. He was the same cozy Hammer as before, not a hair less than last, I would say, certainly not a hair more.</p>
   <p>"You have not changed much, as far as I can see!"</p>
   <p>" I should hope not! Did you expect me to have grown so much older in the two years since last, that it would show on the outside? - But as I was saying, it is amazing what they are able to produce from a patch of dough and a few strands of roots, those fellows down in Lombardy. Just take a look at this spaghetti I am consuming. The man who invented that was creating a new era--he was a born factor of humanity if ever there was such a one. Spaghetti, I tell you..............."</p>
   <p>" I beg your pardon, Skandinaven would like very much to learn of your career, Mr. Hammer, and my time is so limited, so that I would be much obliged - "</p>
   
   <p>"Why of course, - as I was saying, Spaghetti........."</p>
   <p>"I beg your pardon, where were you born, Mr. Hammer?"</p>
   <p>" Just wait till the coffee gets here, and I shall reveal to you the deepest secrets in my life. Won't you take a plate of this?-What! you do not like Spaghetti? But my dear Sir! really, Spaghetti is........."</p>
   <p>" You studied at the university in Norway, Mr. Hammer?"</p>
   <p>"Why, yes, I was supposed to be doing some studying - part of this and part of that. Was even killing two years in an attempt to become a doctor. - No, not a veterinarian, a doctor, I said. - Well, after all it was fortunate that I learned something in medicine. Our stomachs are among the most important possessions of ours, not to mention our hearts and our lungs. But you simply have to take care of your stomach. Mine for example is quite bothersome; it is not at all easy to satisfy. - But Spaghetti........"</p>
   
   <p>"I understand you studied under Lammers?"</p>
   <p>"Why, what an aggressive fellow you are! But I suppose it is part of your profession. Perhaps I had better submit, you won't give in till I do. Well, what do you want to know? Oh, yes I studied under Lammers--I studied medicine. But this latter did not amount to much. I was fonder of red stripes than of red blood corpuscles."</p>
   <p>"Red Stripes?"</p>
   <p>"Why, of course, on my trousers. I became a cadet and spent some time studying how to kill people. What is that? You think I had better have gone on studying medicine? That witticism is too old! I have heard it before. - Well I became a lieutenant and have finally advanced so that now I am a captain...... Oh, yes, I admit that peace time jobs are more pleasant.-What is that! - Why of course the danger of bodily harm is less in peace time, but I hope you are not implying that I became a singer because I was Afraid that gun shots might become too noisy? - For that matter I can assure you that I have seen people lose their heads on the concert stage, too. And that is no fun, I can tell you!--Did I lose my head? - Well, what do you think! Look at my collar, I use number 17. With that type of a neck, the head is quite well fastened. - But to go on, I went to Germany and stayed in Berlin about a year trying to learn to control my Adam's apple, it was in the habit of bucking me. Later - in 1894 - I received a fellowship, and off I went, south to Italy. Have you been in Italy? No. A glorious country! Steeples and temples and sunshine and singing! and Spaghetti! You ought to - But I forget, you do not like Spaghetti! Why yes, of course, the banana peddlers are mostly Italians. Somebody has to do that, too, I should think. But we are getting away from our topic. Well, I went on, sang the scales and did other of those tiresome performances invented for the purpose of harassing the singers, until at length I decided that I had had enough of it for a while, and so I loaded the music, light and heavy, and all its ghosts into my trunks, and off I went again, this time home, to the land in the North.</p>
   <p>There at home. then. I started put on concert tours. to every bay and fjord matter. And many hours of pleasure and fun have I had on these trips, and many hours that were neither pleasant nor funny. I remember especially an experience in Hammerfest.-It was in the middle of winter, and if ever you have traveled in the North in the middle of winter, then you know what that means. The concert was scheduled at 8:00 o'clock, and just at that hour we did anchor out in the harbor. There is no lining up at the pier, there, you know. Well, we anchored at 8:00 o'clock, and at 10:00 o'clock the steamer was to leave, that rule was as unbreakable as North Cape itself. At least half an hour would be required to row ashore, such sea there was, and it was straight arithmetic that someone would be left behind when the steamer set out to sea, and that someone would be Rolf Hammer. But I thought I had found a way out. Using all my powers of persuasion, including certain liquids, I finally succeeded in making the captain and first mate go ashore with me to the concert, and then, of course, I could smile at the sailing rule and the sailing hour. But they tell me that Adam did not stay long in his Paradise! I had about finished the first part of the program and just sang Griegs "Var hilset I damer!" ("Greetings to you, ladies") when to my despair the captain of the steamer comes puffing up to the stage, telling me in a manner which he undoubtedly considered that of a friend and a pal, but which to me came with all the authority of the steamer's bridge: "You just go on greeting these females the whole night if you choose, but the mate and I are going on board. The rule is that the steamer leaves at 10:00 o'clock, and now it is almost 10:00, and the rule must be followed." And the captain and his mate waddled away. You may be sure the rest of the program was sped up.</p>
   <p>Another time I was to give a concert in a little town, such a little place that I prefer not to tell you the name. The editor of the local paper had undertaken to arrange for the concert, and one winter evening I arrived after a trip of several hours in a row-boat through stormy seas. Getting ashore, I asked for the editor and was informed that he had left three weeks ago. Had he arranged for the concert? Well, nobody knew. I had to set to work, myself, and at about 10:00 o'clock some fifty people had gathered for the concert. And then, just as I was going to start, the editor arrives with a profusion of excuses. He had completely forgotten the whole matter!</p>
   <p>And now what about your activities the past few years?</p>
   
   <p>-Why, I have sung the tenor parts in nearly all operas which have been presented home in Norway. In addition, besides my own concerts, I have many times sung at church concerts in Christiania. I have also sung in the great oratorios. Then, in 1905 I came over here with the Norwegian students, and the degree of appreciation shown my art here has cheered me immensely. Now I intend to appear in the West at church concerts for a while together with Renning. I expect that ought to be a success; it seems to me that people over here must be interested in hearing some of the grand church music which we have gotten in Norway during the last few years."</p>
