   <p>The first meeting to organize the Norwegian women for the First Liberty Loan campaign was held at the Norwegian Club last week. About one hundred women were present and subscriptions amounted to $10,050.</p>
   <p>A patriotic mass meeting to further the Liberty Loan drive was held at Logan Square Auditorium a few days ago, at which $20,250 was subscribed. The chairman wishes to express her personal appreciation to Mrs. Jacob Bauer for her very able assistance, to the young ladies who acted as secretaries, and to the very efficient corps of saleswomen. It was the very sincere co-operation of these workers with the Daughters of Norway, and with the many other patriotic Norwegian women who subscribed through this section, that made it possible for us to raise $42,300.</p>
