   <p>Captain John Anderson was born in 1836, near Fredriksstad, Norway. At the age of fourteen he went to sea, and in the following years he visited every corner of the globe. He became first mate in 1852, and in 1856 he quit sailing the high seas.</p>
   <p>In 1854, he was wrecked in the North Sea, on the bark "Orakel". Two years later, he was shipwrecked in the Indian Ocean, two hundred miles west of Madagascar. He was saved by a passing bark from Bremen, and four weeks later was put ashore on the Island of St. Helena.</p>
   <p>At this time (1856) there was quite an influx of immigrants to America. Early in 1857, John Anderson left for America with a large group of friends. He arrived in Chicago three months later (June 1857).</p>
   <p>John Anderson then started to sail the Great Lakes. In 1865, he became owner <span class="page-break">2</span>of the ship "Hercules". Up to 1885, he owned several ships plying the Great Lakes.</p>
   <p>In 1885, he was appointed Harbor Master in Chicago; he held this position for two years in the administration of Mayor Roach. He then went into the real-estate business and soon became one of the largest realtors in Chicago.</p>
   <p>He has, for many years, been active in the largest Norwegian organizations in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Common Council has selected John Anderson as aldermanic candidate in the Fifteenth Ward. He has many years to live and we are sure he will climb higher and higher on the ladder of success. We consider John Anderson one of our most successful men in the Norwegian colony.</p>
