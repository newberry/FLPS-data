   <p>Hans Oftedahl, president of the Nordmendenes male chorus, felt ill at the meeting last Saturday evening, and when he became steadily worse he was taken to Tobitha Hospital. On Monday evening, Drs. Fowler and Doe operated on him for appendicitis. When the news got around, there was a veritable landslide of visitors clamoring for admittance, but the Doctor's orders were for perfect quiet, and none was allowed to see him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Oftedahl will in all probability be out of circulation for several weeks, but we predict that the first time he appears at the chorus club rooms there will be an impromptu celebration that will be heard both far and near. It required only the report that "Hans" was sick to start the entire colony talking, and a book could easily be written covering new phases and incidents, hitherto unknown, in the life of this much-loved Norseman.</p>
