   <p>Did the Scandinavians colonize the New World from the eighth to the eleventh century? This question is still being discussed, and the proof is piling up. It has been proved that the Scandinavians discovered the Shetland Islands, The Faeroes, and Iceland in the eighth century. Grim Kamban's voyage to The Faeroes in the year 725, the colonization of Iceland by Ingolf and Heriulf in 855, the immigration of Scandinavians to these islands, the language spoken there--all this is fact.</p>
   <p>Iceland soon became an important colony to the Scandinavians. It is a fact that historians who wished to study old Norse customs do so in Iceland and The Faeroes. But what proof have we that the Scandinavians knew of Greenland, settled there, and later voyaged on the North American rivers? First of all, there are the sagas that tell in fine detail of the voyages of Eric the Red, Bjorn, Leif, Thorvald, and Gudride.</p>

   <p>Many readers will no doubt say: "But these sagas are fiction--Homeric legends." This has long been believed, but it is not true. The sagas are history. The sagas of Hilluland, Markland, and Vineland all describe very accurately New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Massachusetts. The descriptions of the places where Leif landed characterize exactly Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Cape Cod Bay. Thorfin's activities are described through runes under the name of "Dington Righting Rock".</p>
   <p>There is yet another proof. According to the sagas, Leif, who was an excellent observer, noticed that the shortest day began at 7:30 and ended at 4:30, and the cosmographers of today have proved that the latitude where this is a fact is 41 degrees, 21 minutes, 10 seconds, exactly where the sagas place Leifsbudir, the present site of Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
   <p>Leif's voyages took place about 1001, Thorfin's between 1007 and 1011. And when were the sagas written? By Seemund in 1131. They were written <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>by the same generation, by the skalds, bards, and troubadours who still remembered. Now, it is a sure thing that Seemund received his information from the skalds, who in some cases remembered and in some cases had it from their fathers. This word-to-mouth history was always correct; the skalds never changed a word of it.</p>
   <p>The wonderful adventures are also recorded in the Flatteyar Bok. What is the Flatteyar Bok? It is an inscription on an old Icelandic monument--the oldest monument in medieval history. The discovery of Vineland is recorded in the Flatteyar Bok as an undisputed fact.</p>
   <p>The old church documents also speak of the discovery as a fact. The missionaries went to Iceland immediately after its discovery. History tells us that Bishop Jonus traveled from Iceland to Vineland in 1059, and became a martyr. Later, the prelate Rekuri went to Vineland, and the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>proof of his visit is the baptismal monument in Newport, Rhode Island. It is also proved that Bishop Olaf preached Christianity in the trans-Atlantic colonies in 1261.</p>
   <p>The Pope received taxes from America in 1309. These taxes were paid from 1121 to 1537 through his bishops in Greenland. It is also proved that Christopher Columbus visited Iceland. Why? To verify the rumor current in France, Spain, and Portugal of the discovery of America. It was after his return that he conceived the idea that a continent existed in the west. In 1389, the Danish Queen Margrethe assessed a head tax of three crowns on each resident of these American colonies.</p>
   <p>There is still more proof available--such proof that doubts will forever be stilled. But we feel that the proofs given above are sufficient.</p>
