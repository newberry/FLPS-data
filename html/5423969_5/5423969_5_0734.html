   <p>A festival was given by the Lutheran Church in honor of the Norwegian soldiers who had just arrived from the front.</p>
   <p>This "Home Coming Festival" was well attended. Many speeches were made, but the outstanding address was delivered by Dr. L. M. Gimmestad. He spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"Fellow Lutherans:</p>
   <p>"Every man who is well informed and has ordinary intelligence knows that if our enemies had won the war, the principles of the constitution of our government would have been subverted, that our social life would have suffered serious changes, and that our economic conditions, which are now good, would have become deplorable. Our great national interests would have been trampled under foot, American ideals would have ceased to give hope to the oppressed toilers of the world, and our flag, now known and honored throughout the world, would have been dragged in the dust. The principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, dear to the heart of humanity and productive of <span class="page-break">\2</span>countless blessings wherever known, would have been buried under a mountain of tyranny and oppression.</p>
   <p>"But this occasion does not require of me a thorough examination of these matters, nor any detailed account of them. Some other occasion, more suitable than the present one for the discussion of questions relative to the motives, purposes, and reasons that have influenced the conduct of our government and our nation during the critical period of the last four years, will probably present itself when the treaty of peace shall have been signed.</p>
   <p>"Today we are assembled as a Lutheran congregation to welcome our sons who have returned from the battlefields of Europe, from the training camps of our own country, or from schools where they have been fitting themselves for military service. The question, then, is pertinent: Was the outcome of the war of any importance to the Lutheran Church in this country, and did the Lutherans of America, during the war, feel that, as members of that church, they had anything at stake in the gigantic struggle?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"In leading up to an answer to this question, let me first discharge the pleasant duty of extending to you, my young friends, stalwart sons of this congregation, a formal and cordial welcome on your return to your home church. Our joy at having you once more among us is too great to find adequate expression in words. Your valor, your intelligence, your endurance, and your willingness to make every sacrifice necessary for the successful prosecution of the war, are known and appreciated in every home, and it shall be the object of our constant endeavor to show that the principles for which you have been willing to lay down your lives are dear to our hearts. Fortunate, fortunate men! In an incredibly short time you and your companions in arms, together with the forces of the Allied nations, have succeeded in securing for us the continued enjoyment of our rights and privileges as Lutherans and as citizens--rights and privileges threatened but a few months ago by a daring, powerful, and relentless foe.</p>
   <p>"But, my friends, when you left your homes a year ago you were accompanied, as it were, by the prayers of your parents and the blessings and good wishes <span class="page-break">\4</span>of the members of your congregation. Such prayers and such blessings are good company and serve as guardian angels to young men exposed to the temptations and allurements of the military camp. Your mothers reluctantly bade you farewell; and no doubt their hearts were filled with anxiety not only in the hour of parting but during the whole time of your absence, yearning continually for your safe return. And yet I feel that I should do them an injustice if I did not realize that, in the last analysis, they would be found to be true sisters of the Spartan mother who, at parting, told her son to return with his shield or upon it. Their highest wish was that you might acquit yourselves like men, fighting valiantly and successfully for the sacred cause of justice, liberty, and humanity. And this noble sentiment was shared by the members of our church throughout the country. But sentiment, no matter how fine and sweet in itself, is in danger of degenerating into mere sentimentality unless it tends to produce action suitable to the occasion.</p>
   <p>"What did the Lutheran Church do when thousands of her sons left home for the <span class="page-break">\5</span>training camps in different parts of the country? Immediately the Lutheran Brotherhood was organized for the purpose of caring for the spiritual needs of the Norwegian Lutheran soldiers. Within a few weeks scores of camp pastors were engaged. Buildings suitable to the religious needs of our soldiers were erected. In order to secure results at once, one of our pastors, though a man of modest means, offered the Lutheran Brotherhood a loan of thousands of dollars. The commission for Lutheran Soldiers' and Seamans' Welfare was organized by men of liberal views and a practical turn of mind; and a drive was started without delay. What was the result? The Commission asked for $750,000. Our people contributed about $1,500,000. The question of financing extensive undertakings for the welfare of our Lutheran soldiers was thus answered in a manner that left no doubt as to the attitude of our church with reference to her caring for her sons during the war. Touched with the wand of abundant means, our organization for religious and charitable work among our brethren in the army leaped forth with new life.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"Knowing that the American Red Cross would do its work well, the members of our church entered into the work of that society with enthusiasm and contributed liberally to its support. It is very gratifying, accordingly, to note that the soldiers, at the close of the war, uniformly speak well of the Red Cross. For various reasons our people have assisted the Salvation Army only in an individual capacity; but even as a church we rejoice in the spirit of self-sacrifice and undaunted valor displayed on the field of battle by these angels of mercy.</p>
   <p>"But, my friends, no matter how interesting and agreeable a more complete survey of our benevolent activities might be, I must proceed at once to the consideration of matters more grave and important. One of the leading questions connected with our main topic today is the following: What was the attitude of the government of Germany and the leading political parties of that country toward the principles of the Lutheran Church before and during the war? That attitude--unless Heaven itself mercifully should have decreed otherwise--would have determined our destiny as a church, in case the Central Powers <span class="page-break">\7</span>had been victorious. For political and other purposes the Catholics of Germany, more than fifty years ago, organized themselves into a compact political party, known as the Center Party. Guided by the hand of Rome, the old enemy of popular liberty and religious freedom and ever hostile to the Lutheran Church, that party, in case of victory, would probably have exercised all its cunning and all its power to crush out the life of the most powerful denomination of Protestantism.</p>
   <p>"But what about the Socialist party of Germany? Although the principles maintained by the Socialists of Germany are by no means identical in their entirety to those advocated by the different groups of the party, it is, in general, safe to say that socialism is dominated by a spirit of materialism and infidelity, and would interpose no hand of protection in case destruction of the Lutheran Church were imminent.</p>
   <p>"But what of Prussian militarism? History furnishes an irrefutable argument to this question. In 1817, the tercentenary of the Protestant Reformation, <span class="page-break">\8</span>the king proposed the union of the Lutheran and the Calvinistic Churches of Germany. The measures necessary for putting this decree into effect met with much opposition on the part of our brethren in Germany, but in 1832 the government had firmly established its policy of infringement on the rights of the people; and since that time the Lutheran pastors and congregations in Germany have labored under great difficulties. As the Pilgrim Fathers left England on account of religious persecution and intolerance, so many of our brethern in Germany, after 1817--notably the original stock of the Missouri Synod--left their fatherland in order to enjoy the freedom of conscience guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. The government of Berlin went so far in its measures of restraint of religious liberty as to exact from the clergy of the state church a promise to preach, not in accordance with the dictates of their conscience, nor according to the established creed of the church, but according to the dictates of His Majesty the Kaiser. Would our church in this country have fared better in case our armies had been vanquished on the field of battle?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>"Who of your ministers would have resigned his office if his doctrine required the sanction of politicians and the approval of the principalities and the powers of darkness of this world? And what would have been the value to our congregation of the guidance in spiritual matters furnished by the pliant tools of royalty, by men who would preach as they were told to preach by their political superiors? You have read samples of such 'sermons' in the war books distributed during the last four years. Do you suppose any considerable number of ministers in any country would preach such 'sermons' as those without receiving their cue and inspiration from 'men higher up'? Would it be a small matter to you if your pastor was to be guided and controlled in the performance of his work by influences so base and sordid?</p>
   <p>"Those of us, accordingly, who knew what was at stake in this great war, not only watched the movements of our armies with the most intense interest, but, though not literally on our knees, perhaps, we still wrestled continually in prayer with the God of Hosts for the preservation of the priceless treasures <span class="page-break">\10</span>of civil and religious liberty. Our anxiety increased from day to day as the great German offensive, launched March 21, 1918, developed. The surging tide swept westward at the rate of from four to six miles a day; our allies were pushed back toward Paris and the English Channel; and there seemed to be no army able to cope successfully with the enemy. All the engines and horrors of war that could tear the flesh or break the spirit of our soldiers were employed. Poison gas crept like marsh damp on the ground. Shot and shell whistled and shrieked on their errand of death. Ranks of flashing steel leaped from the trenches and rushed forward, wave following wave, like breakers driven by an angry tempest. The deadly hail of bullets and bombs was dropped from the cloud by aeroplanes, and the concussion of heavy artillery, including cannon of the largest caliber and miracle guns, shook the very foundations of the earth.</p>
   <p>"While the rising tide of German invasion was sweeping westward, our army was getting ready to stem it with a wall of human flesh. While the destiny of nations still hung in the balance, a message of hope came from Cantigny.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>Our men held their line, and the Germans could not pass. Then followed the eighteenth day of July, the day of the turning of the tide, the retaking of Chateau Thierry, the beginning of the second battle of the Marne, the grand offensive which gradually spread from the plains of Chalons to the mountain fastness on the south, and to the coast of Belgium on the north. In this grand offensive our soldiers played an important and a leading part. And when, in the closing days of October, they were approaching Metz and Verdun, Prussian militarism had suffered a crushing defeat and was asking for an armistice and suing for peace. Well might the bells of our churches ring out the glad tidings of the signing of the armistice on November 11; for the great principles of religious and civil liberty had once more been successfully defended against aggression of tyranny and autocracy by the sons of freedom. Once more fair prospects of peace and prosperity lay spread out before us and our children. As the rains of spring shall remove the stains of blood from the hillsides of France, and the gentle breezes from the south shall cause flowers and herbs to grow on its battle-scarred soil, filling its valleys with prosperity and happiness, so we trust that the trials and sacrifices <span class="page-break">\12</span>of our people during this war will result in a firmer belief in the fundamental principles of the Lutheran Church, in a more lively appreciation of the blessings it is so well calculated to bestow, and in renewed activity for the establishment of its doctrines in all parts of the earth. Jesus Christ, the great Captain of our Salvation, shall lead us on from victory to victory.</p>
   <p>"And now my friends, the place and the occasion urge me to speak a word of the most solemn import to you. You have returned victorious from the battle-fields of Europe. You have delivered your arms to your government, and will soon lay aside your uniforms. The commands of your captains no longer direct your movements. You are looking forward to a period of peace. May God bless you and grant you a full measure of prosperity!</p>
   <p>"As Christians, however, and as soldiers of the cross you are engaged in a war which knows no armistice. You are always on the battlefield, always under arms, always wearing your uniform, always obedient to the command of Him who, <span class="page-break">\13</span>riding on a white horse, goes forth conquering and to conquer. You are now in the prime of life; robust health and rugged strength make you radiant with the beauty of your manhood. The time will come when the strong men shall bow themselves and the keepers of the house shall tremble. The flood of healthy blood which now rushes tumultuously through your veins, will some day fall slack, and the glory of your eye will wane. While your house of clay shows that it is subject to the law of decay, your spiritual life is to be renewed from day to day, yea, ever increasing in faith and hope and charity until the last enemy is vanquished. God grant that you may be as successful in the field of spiritual warfare as you have been in that from which you have returned! And as the good fight of faith is one in which all of us can take part, with the Lord of Hosts sending us forth fully equipped for the battle, let us acquit ourselves like men until sword and shield shall have served their purpose, and the battle-scarred heroes shall pass from the church militant to the church triumphant."</p>
