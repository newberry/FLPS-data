   <p>Nearly 1,500 people celebrated in memory of the defeat of St. Olaf at Stiklestad, under the auspices of the Knights of the White Cross.</p>
   <p>The Knights of the Cross do not have the worries which other organizations have; they always have a well-filled treasury, and the support given by the churches assures the organization of a certain security.</p>
   <p>The organization was started in 1860 under the name of "The Norwegian Nora Society". Later "Nora" built its own building, at the corner of Green and Erie Streets. Some of the city's most prominent men were members: Of these we may mention a few, such as the labor leader, Marcus Thrane, the banker, Paul O. Stensland, Consul Svano, Dr. Paoli, Mr. Asche, Jens Olsen Kaasa, Captain Halvor Michelson, H. Sporland, and old John Anderson [of Skandinaven].</p>
   <p>At the St. Olaf's Day affair the president, Mr. S. E. Smery, introduced the following prominent speakers: Dr. Anders Doe, Judge Oscar Torrison, and Olaf Bernts.</p>
