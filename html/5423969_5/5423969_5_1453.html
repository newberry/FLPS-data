   <p>K. Langeland, chief editor of the Skandinaven, has sent in his resignation. He hopes that during his six years as chief editor he has done some good and satisfied them somewhat through his different articles. He would like to continue his work, but circumstances alter everything; hence the resignation. Mr. Langeland wishes to thank all the readers for their kindness and consideration during his six years of work at Skandinaven. He also wishes to thank his co-workers for their loyalty and good work. First and foremost he sends a kind farewell to all readers of Skandinaven.</p>
