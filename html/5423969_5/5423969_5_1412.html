Here he found time to begin his preparation for college and later entered the academy at East Greenwich, R.I., from which he graduated in 1879. The following year he entered Yale College where he graduated in 1884. He then entered the Theological Seminary in New-Haven to study for the ministry. About this time the Chicago Theological Seminary opened its foreign departments and Mr. Jernberg was invited to come to Chicago to give instructions in this department while he completed his own theological studies in the American course of the same institution. This offer he accepted and graduated from Chicago Theological Seminary in 1887.</p>
