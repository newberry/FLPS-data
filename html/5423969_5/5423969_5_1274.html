   <p>Mr. P. A. Sjolie and his good wife celebrated their silver wedding on May 17th. Bjorgvins Hall was well filled with guests for the ocassion. Had the celebration been held on any other day but May 17th the hall would not have begun to hold the host of friends who would have been there.</p>
   <p>We who are acquainted with the history of our Norwegian colony know P. A. Sjolie as one who was always found in the front ranks in any effort for the welfare or betterment of our people. He was one of our most ardent workers for the Lief Eriksen monument, Sleipner Athletic Club's Hall and many other buildings and organizations among our people. An objection reached, he retired letting others enjoy the glory; when something was going wrong that needed a new lease of life it was P. A. who stepped in and "repaired" the damage and again dropped out of sight till the next need of service made its claim. P. A. never held back when there was preparatory work to be done, in fact we often wondered how he could keep going, but he did.</p>

   <p>Mr. and Mrs. Sjorlie were given many presents in honor of the day, and telegrams came from a great many friends and relatives. Mr. Kent Hogland presented the gifts and Dr. Holmboe delivered the main speech. That all enjoyed themselves well, the fact that they were in the home of Peter Albert is evidence enough.</p>
