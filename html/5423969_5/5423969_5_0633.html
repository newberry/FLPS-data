   <p>Trinity Church:- Elling Eilsen preached first Lutheran sermon on American soil in Chicago in 1839. In the '40s a congregation was formed and in 1857 Trinity church was formally organized at Indiana and Peoria Streets, a location then out on "the prairie."</p>
   <p>Bethlehem and Bethany churches were split from this church by dissenting groups.</p>
   <p>As late as 1905 the services in Trinity Church were carried on half in Norwegian and half in English.</p>
