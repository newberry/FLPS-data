   <p>p.8............Ingolf Erdahl, known as Bjorgvin's "powerful basso," reached his 60th milestone on Saturday March 25th. In honor of the occasion the Bjorgvin Chorus gathered to help Mr. Erdahl celebrate and in recognition of his twenty-five years of faithful service he was presented with an expensive smoking set. It is characteristic of our Norwegian people to carry on with any task they undertake, especially is this true of our music loving group.</p>
