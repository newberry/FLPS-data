   <p>Dr. Sandberg, who was chairman of the Seventeenth of May committee, called the meeting to order. Elections were held and Dr. Carl Sandberg was elected chairman, and B. Osland was chosen as secretary. The chairman asked the delegates to give a report on whether or not their respective organizations would cooperate with the Central Association. The majority reported that their organizations were in accord with this important step. A resolutions committee was set up and began its functions at once. Another committee was appointed to work on drawing up a constitution and bylaws.</p>
   <p>One of the delegates made a motion that any Norwegian organization that had a few Danes or Swedes in their membership could become part of the Association.</p>

Dr. Sandberg appointed the following: C. C. Christensen, chairman, Carl Drolsum, Louis Hawlins, Lars Johansen, John T. Johnson, Julius Jaeger, F. Kean, Mrs. Lindberg, Anton Mehlum, and Fred Nielsen. It now looks as though a strong Association has been formed.</p>
