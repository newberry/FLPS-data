   <p>While fair play is the rule among Americans, and most Americans are always ready to give the underdog a show, there are exceptions to every rule, one of them being the worthy editor of the American Review of Reviews. This gentleman evidently thinks that it pays better to give the underdog a kick.</p>
   <p>It is not the first time that he has found an opportunity to show his unfairness in reviewing Scandinavian politics. A year ago he reprinted from a Swedish magazine an article by a Finn, Axel Lille, which was a tissue of falsehoods and misstatements.</p>
   <p>The editor of Scandia asked for a little space in which to refute these gross misrepresentations, but the editor of the Review of Reviews, regretting that the article had been published and admitting that it was wrong in many particulars, refused to make any corrections because the errors were the fault of the author or translator.</p>

   <p>Now the Review of Reviews is at it again. Editorially it speaks of Norway as "a new nation" and says that "it is confidently predicted in Stockholm that with Sweden objecting, no foreign power is likely to extend recognition to Norway".</p>
   <p>We beg to state that well-known Swedish writers here in Chicago advise the [Swedish] Riksdag to recognize Norway at once because it is only a question of time when the foreign powers will recognize Norway with or without the consent of Sweden, and [they urge] that Sweden shall not risk the humiliation of seeing Norway recognized in spite of Swedish protests.</p>
   <p>And the editor of the Review of Review goes on to make a few more silly remarks not worth quoting. Then he publishes a review of the whole Norwegian-Swedish troubles written by a Dane who is afraid to let his name appear, and this article is commented upon by "Dr." Rasmus B. Anderson--according to the Review of Reviews "a well-known Norwegian scholar and historical authority and editor of Amerika, perhaps the best-known Norwegian journal published <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>outside Norway,"--and by Dr. Enander,--according to the editor an authority on Swedish history and general Scandinavian politics, and so forth.</p>
   <p>We do not begrudge these two worthies whatever free advertising they can obtain, but we do protest when an American magazine publishes statements that are radically wrong. "Dr." Anderson shows what kind of authority he is by writing that according to her constitution of May 14, 1814, "Norway is a free, independent, indivisible, and inseparable kingdom, united with Sweden under one king".</p>
