   <p>One week from today we again celebrate Norway's May 17, and, as usual, there are one or two groups which are too independent to co-operate in the observance of this day. The Norwegian National League is again sponsoring the parade and the folk festival to be held in Brand's Park during the afternoon and evening. The Independent Order of Good Templars and other probition units are planning an opposition celebration, since liquor and beer will be served in the park.</p>
   <p>The May 17 celebrations have as a rule taken on the appearance of narrowness and isolation, because the speakers of the day have confined themselves to our past history and the glory of the ancient Norsemen. Scandia agrees with some of the critics who advocate enlightenment on present conditions, on progress made and prospects for the future.</p>
