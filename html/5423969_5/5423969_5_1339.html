   <p>p.3.... When one attends a meeting of public interest or a literary lecture one may, if really observing, see a little man, smooth shaven, with thin graying hair and a quiet, almost timid manner enter the hall. He hesitates a moment, as if confused, then quietly makes his way to a seat next to the wall in a last row where he seems to disappear totally. That is Dr. Remmen.</p>
   <p>You attend a big banquet. But glass and silver glitters like diamonds in the bright light; medals and brightly colored ribbon decorations of various orders are liberally sprinkled thru the assembly, words of praise for this one and that flow in steady streams and toasts are responded to with unstinted enthusiasm. At the lower end of a table, in the most inconspicuous seat sits a quiet insignifican looking man quietly conversing with his nearest neighbors, neither proposing nor being "toasted" with the celebrities, yet, withal, he is a man loved by all who know him. That is Dr. Remmen.</p>
   
   <p>There are two ways of getting acquainted with Dr. Remmen; by casual visits in his own home or as a patient. One working man describes him thus, "In our home, he has looked after us and our children for many years. But it was never a doctor, with his little black medicine case, that walked into our home, it was one of our own, our truest friend." That is Dr. Remmen.</p>
   <p>When he speaks of his profession and it's accomplishments and advancement he becomes fluent, almost oratorical, but he never mentions severe cases and victorious battles he has won nor difficult operations he has performed. This information can only be obtained from patients and colleagues. He is stirred and stirs his listeners when he points out the advancement medical science and surgery have made, but not a word of himself and his own marvelous work. That is Dr. Remmen.</p>
   <p>Our subject was not born in high estate, as the world may judge, but in the humbl sod palace of his thrifty, hard working pioneer parents and one is touched by the respect, bordering on piety, that he shows for his humble parents.The privati of his early life combined with an inborn patient sincerity were the prevailing influences in the development of a character of such sterling worth that the man is an exception among exceptions, outwardly unpretentious but at heart and mentally, a veritable giant. That is Dr. Remmen.</p>
   <p>When he first hung out his shingle on Center Ave. in 1887 he felt what prospecta a poor farmer boy, whose only recommendation was high grades in his examinations, might be. His skill brought him a constantly growing practice until he could no longer handle the volume of cases to which he was called. He finally closed his office and his desire to specialize in ills of the eyes drew him to Vienna, Copenhagen and other prominent European medical, science-centers. Upon his return he began practice as an Eye Specialist.</p>
   <p>During recent years he has been awarded many high honors in medical circles. He has served as President of the Scandinavian Medical Association; is an honored member of the Chicago Medical Society and the Opthalmological Society; has contributed to the country's leading medical publications and has been offered Professorships in several of our leading Universities and medical schools. He is a member of the medical staff of several of Chicago's hospitals.</p>
   <p>In spite of his busy professional life he finds time to study and sponsor activities in literature, music, sculpture and art,having been especially helpful to many young artists of Norwegian descent. A man in a million. This is Dr. Remmen.</p>
