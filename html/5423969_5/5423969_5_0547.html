   <p>At the evening service last Sunday while the Reverend C. W. Finwall was bidding farewell to the Logan Square Baptist congregation, he was presented with the gift of $99.67. This sum was the proceeds of a special collection taken up for the purpose among those present. Several more money gifts have come to the Pastor by mail, from people who either were prevented from being present at the meeting or who did not have money at hand when the collection was taken.</p>
