   <p>p.8. Professor and Mrs. Alfred Paulsen, 3826 North Lawndale Avenue, celebrated their silver anniversary yesterday and this much respected and loved couple were deluged with presents and congratulatory messages from far and near. Groups honoring the couple were led by the Glee Club, of which Mr. Paulsen has been the director for many years. "Nordmendenes Sang Forening" (the Norsemen's Male Chorus) assembled at Elston Avenue and Irving Park Boulevard, and marched to the Paulsen home where they serenaded the celebrants with the true Nordic music lovers enthusiasm. That no member of this chorus was missing speaks well for the esteem in which Professor and Mrs. Paulsen are held wherever Norse song is known. Professor Paulsen's "Naar Fjordene Blaaner" is known throughout the world of Nordic music and this composition alone was enough to exalt him as the greatest of all Norwegian-American composers. This composition with its deep feeling, wonderful melody and touching solo part is easily the most popular number presented at all Norwegian concerts whether it be sung by a male chorus, mixed choir or as a solo.</p>
   <p>Long live Alfred and his good wife; may their host of friends ever increase and their popularity never dim.</p>
