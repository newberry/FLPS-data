   <p>The Norwegian independence day seems to be celebrated with more and more interest every year. All groups of Norwegians seem to be filled with an ever-increasing love for this day of days--the day that brings back memories of "Old Norway". The immigrants and their children cannot forget their fatherland, and when the Seventeenth of May comes they do their celebrating here just as the Norwegians back home have done since the great event in 1814.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian National Committee has arranged an extensive program. The celebration will begin with an open-air concert at the Leif Ericson Monument in Humboldt Park. M. Pedersen's well-known and outstanding orchestra will play Norwegian music. Later, the ceremonies will be continued in Brand's Park, beginning with a sports program and continuing with speeches and singing. Professor George T. Flom, of the University of Chicago, will speak for Norway.</p>

   <p>A youth parade, larger than ever, will start at 2 P. M. and march from Humboldt Park to Logan Square, North and Western Avenues, then back to Humboldt Boulevard and Palmer Square. At Palmer Square a reviewing platform will be built, where Louis C. Larsen, secretary of the Board of Education, and Reverend J. C. Roseland will speak to the youngsters. Mounted police will lead the parade. The second division will consist of automobiles, followed by a band; then a division of children dressed in the national costume will follow; the temperance societies and church groups will bring up the rear. Another division will be marshalled at the Leif Ericson Monument. This group will include a band and the church groups not represented in the first division.</p>
   <p>Other groups will celebrate in their own quarters. The Scandinavian Young Men's Christian Association will celebrate in their hall, 1350-52 Erie Street. This program will include a speech by Professor William Petersen; songs by John H. Rasmussen, the Deaconess Sister's Chorus, and group singing by the visitors. A string orchestra will furnish the instrumental music.</p>
