   <p>The Zion Norwegian Lutheran Church celebrated its tenth anniversary last night. John Jersin, chairman of the board of trustees, told the visitors about the most interesting parts of the church's history....</p>
   <p>"Several years ago the Norwegians lived on the near West Side. In those days the business streets in that section were busy, yes, much more busy than they are today, and on the side streets the residences were found. The language was Norwegian everywhere in this part of Chicago--a city within a city. Churches? Yes, there was at that time, Vor Frelsers Kirke [Our Savior's Church], Trefoldigheds Kirke [Trinity Church], Bethania, etc.; large, beautiful churches for Lutheran Christians.</p>
   <p>"The district east of Humboldt was, less than twenty years ago, open prairies, where farms and sawmills eventually appeared. Still later these same prairies were divided into lots and purchased by thrifty Germans and <span class="page-break">\2</span>Scandinavians. A store opened here and there, and this section became what we see today. For a long time there was little or no transportation; the streets were knee-deep in mud; street lights were few and far between.</p>
   <p>"About eleven years ago, Reverend V. J. Ellestad was superintendent for the Lutheran mission established the year before. His dream was to open missions in the small towns and villages surrounding Chicago."</p>
   <p>Reverend Ellestad preached the first sermon in the basement of an unfinished house on Maplewood Avenue. Just a few people were present. The congregation asked permission of the owner to hold services again the following Sunday, but he refused....So they arranged to have services in a saloon on the corner of Verder [now Crystal] and Rockwell Streets. The owner had to close the place because no one in the neighborhood seemed to be thirsty, so it was an easy matter to rent the place permanently. The bar was hidden by calico drapes, and advertisements inserted in the <span class="page-break">\3</span>columns of this paper. Collections were made, at first small amounts, but later enough to make a down payment on a small brick building on Dania [now Artesian] Avenue, and an adjoining lot on Potomac Avenue. Services were held in the brick building until a chapel was built in 1891. In February, 1892, the chapel was dedicated by chairman Hoyme.</p>
   <p>A new mission was opened on Milwaukee Avenue and Robey Street, in a vacant store.</p>
   <p>Here the Salem congregation was started. It later combined with the Bethel congregation organized by Reverend Bruun, on Humboldt Street [later Humboldt Boulevard].</p>
   <p>On February 15, 1892, Reverend Arvesen organized the Zion Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of Chicago with the assistance of Ovald Rosler, Jacob Conrads and Karl Sommerschild. In 1893 $300 in wages <span class="page-break">\4</span>was paid to Reverend Arveson.</p>
   <p>Zion Church, as we see, started as plain as could be; today it is big and prosperous.....</p>
   <p>In 1898, the present pastor, Reverend J. H. Meyer, was called from a small congregation in Wisconsin, and through his untiring efforts the congregation is safe as the "Rock of Gibraltar".</p>
   <p>The following pastors have, since Reverend Ellestad's time, worked untiringly to build the church: Professor J. N. Kildahl, Reverend Bruun, Dr. Weidner, Reverend H. Arvesen, Reverend [H. B.] Kildahl, Reverend Siljan, Reverend Olaf Guldseth, Reverend Eckmann, and Reverend J. H. Meyer.</p>
