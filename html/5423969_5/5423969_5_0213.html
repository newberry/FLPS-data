   <p>A united celebration of the anniversary of the Reformation by all the Chicago congregations of the Norwegian United Church was held on Thursday evening at the Bethlehem Church, corner of Central Avenue and Huron Street. The attendance was very large. The services opened with prayer by Reverend J. H. Meyer, who also had charge of the altar service. A choir consisting of members of all the congregations sang Luther's hymn "A Mighty Fortress is Our God", and "The Church's One Foundation". Reverend N. G. Petersen of Libson, Illinois, spoke in Norwegian in honor of the day, and Reverend G. T. Rygh spoke in English on the topic "The Reformation". A collection was made for the benefit of the Church Extension Fund of the United Lutheran Church.</p>
   <p>As our readers know, the day was the Reformation Day. It was on October 31 that Dr. Martin Luther nailed his famous ninety-five theses to the church door in Wittenberg, Germany.</p>
