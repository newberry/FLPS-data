   <p>The first Norwegian to build a house in Chicago was Halstein Torrison, who arrived in Chicago on October 16, 1836. He built a two-story frame house of no mean size and appearance on Wells Street where the Chicago &amp; North Western depot now stands. Among the most widely known Norwegian in Chicago was Reverend Paul Anderson, the first Norwegian minister in Chicago. Reverend Anderson's long and valuable services in promoting the cause of the Lutheran Church deserve to be kept in kind remembrance also among the coming generations of that faith.</p>
   <p>The Episcopalians, led by their Swedish minister, Gustavus Undnious, made some rather strong efforts to establish their church among the first Norwegians in Chicago. They induced Jenny Lind, when that Swedish nightingale visited Chicago, to donate one thousand dollars toward the erection of an Episcopalian church, which later was built on Franklin Street near Michigan Street [sic], on the North Side. But the little frame church, which Reverend Paul Anderson built on Superior Street, and in which he now commenced to hold services, attracted the larger part of the Norwegians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It took the Scandinavians a long time to begin to enter public life. The first Norwegian to do so was Iver Lawson (father of Victor F. Lawson, publisher of the Daily News). Among the Danes there was George P. Hansen,and among the Swedes, John Nelson. Martin Paulsen, father of William A. Paulsen, the banker, was justice of the peace for many years.</p>
