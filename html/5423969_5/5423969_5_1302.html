   <p>Six years ago George Jensen, a young Norwegian immigrant, arrived in Chicago, poor as a church mouse and without friend or relative in the country. To most men the future would have seemed absolutely hopeless, but pluck and energy were Jensen's stock in trade and he accepted any work that came along, determined to get an education and make a name for himself in spite of all handicaps. Night and day he applied himself to his task of building himself, and his progress in technical study was astounding. His intense application developed his mind to such an extent that he would solve the most difficult technical problem with an ease that left his instructors gasping. Turbines were his first and greatest love and--to be brief--two months ago he sold a patent on a turbine mechanism and as a result was able to make an extended visit to Bakke in Hardanger, Norway, where the poor, friendless immigrant boy of six years ago, has purchased a beautiful villa for his aged mother.</p>
   <p>George Jensen is a shining example of a true Norseman; courageous, adventurous, able and intelligent, and with a lovable friendly nature that does not permit <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>prosperity to develop a false pride. A true Norseman is proud that he is Norse but does not hire a brass band to publicize himself. He sets himself a task and knows no rest until that task is fully and properly finished. Give us more George Jensens, for they are the salt of the earth.</p>
