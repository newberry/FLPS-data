   <p>p.8...............Mrs. Pastor Grefthen (nee Bothne) visited Chicago during the last week. The occasion calling for her presence in Chicago at this time was the unveiling of the monument erected in honor of her father Prof. Gisle Bothne. As a former resident of Chicago she has literally thousands of friends here and she enjoyed meeting many of them during her visit. Our Norwegian colony would be pleased to have her again make her home in Chicago.</p>
