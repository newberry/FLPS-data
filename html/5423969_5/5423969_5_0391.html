   <p>The new building of the Zion Norwegian Lutheran Church, Lawndale and Belden Avenues, was dedicated today. The Church is at least a mile from the nearest Lutheran church, and it is therefore expected that the new venture will be successful. The dedication ceremonies also commemorated the twenty-second anniversary of the Zion congregation.</p>
   <p>The new building cost $32,000, and is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful churches on the Northwest Side. The pews, costing $1,150, were donated by the Women's Society of the Church. The Ladies' Guild donated carpets and runners, costing $600; the Sunday school donated the hymnbooks; the Lutheran League furnished the altar and its equipment; and the Busy Bees [a girls' club] donated the altar cross.</p>
