   <p>The Maplewood Avenue M. E. Church yesterday held a very successful welcome social for their minister, the Rev. Paul Hangan, who is now starting his second year of service to this congregation.</p>
   <p>During the past year, Mr. Hangan has gained unusual popularity, both within and outside the congregation, and this popularity was strikingly evident in the cordial reception given. A number of other ministers were present, and they joined with the church members in making the pastor feel that his work in the past had been worthwhile and appreciated.</p>
