   <p>Showered with flowers and greeted with welcoming songs from their countrymen and women, sixty members of the Norwegian Student Singers, the famous male chorus of the University of Christiania, arrived in the city yesterday afternoon. The Michigan Central train, on which they came, was nearly an hour late, but their tardy arrival did not dampen the enthusiasm of the 500 persons who crowded the Park Row station to meet them.</p>
   <p>As the members of the chorus entered the door into the waiting-room, the local Norwegian Singers' Union began Grig's "song of Welcome". which, next to the national anthem, is the great song of the sturdy Norse people.</p>

   <p>Leaving the station, the crowd surged toward the Auditorium, where the chorus will remain today and tomorrow. There was a call for a song, and visitors and local singers lined up on the broad stairway leading from the lobby of the hotel and sang the Norwegian national anthem, "Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet" ("Yes, We Love our Native Country"). As the clear voices of the tenors lingered on the last strain there was tumultous applause, and in response to the encore the visiting singers rendered "The Star Spangled Banner" in English.</p>
   <p>The rest of yesterday was spent in sightseeing, and today most of the chorus will be guests at the homes of various Norwegian residents.</p>
   <p>Give Concert To-night</p>
   <p>Arrangments have been completed for the concert by the chorus, which will be given at the Auditorium this evening. Elaborate preparations for the event, into which the Swedes and Danes of Chicago have entered in complete harmony, have been in the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>hands of a committee composed of the following: Dr. Thomas Warice, H. A. Hangan, John Anderson, Paul O. Stensland, Nicolay Grevstad, N. Arnesan, Karl Landberg, Thomas Kolderup and Ben Blessum.</p>
   <p>The musical organization was founded sixty years ago by John Behrens, the "father of Norwegian song." It is composed of students and alumni of the University of Christiania, and is a semi-national institution, the director O. A. Grondahl, one of the foremost leaders and composers in Scandinavia, being paid partly out of the national treasury.</p>
   <p>Since its inception the chorus has been a leader in Norwegian choral music, having had the nation for its patron and numbering among its most prominent supporters the foremost Norwegian composers, such as Greig, Ressinger, Selmer and Kjewlf. Many of the latter have written compositions expressly for the chorus.</p>

   <p>The singers are headed by Ralf Hammer, tenor, and Johan Berg-Hansen, bass, as soloists both of whom are members of the National Opera. The president of the student singing society, Dr. Henrick Thomsen, is with the organization.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow night there will be a banquet at the Sherman House. at which many persons of prominence will speak.</p>
   <p>After leaving Chicago the chorus will give concerts in some twenty cities of the Northwest, returning to the East via Chicago on June 14, at which time another concert may be given here.</p>
   <p>Extensive preparations have been made for the reception of the chorus at New Haven, where the singers will be guests of Yale University. They will sail for Norway after their last concert in New York.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>A large advance sale of seats for the Auditorium concert insures an attendance of gratifying proportions. The reception tendered the Swedish University chorus in Chicago a year ago strenghthens the belief of the managers of the concert that the Norwegian chorus will be as well received.</p>
