   <p>The total Scandinavian immigration has reached a peak that will surprise many. The totals in the thirty-seven states are as follows: 64,196 Danes, 194,337 Swedes and 181,729 Norwegians. In Wisconsin we find the largest number of Danes, in Minnesota, the most Swedes, and in Illinois, the most Norwegians.</p>
   <p>The totals in the nine territories are: Danes--10,697, Norwegians--5,644, and Swedes--8,623. In Utah the majority are Danes and Swedes, in Dakota, Norwegians.</p>
   <p>These figures indicate that the hardiest pioneer spirit is found among the Danes and Norwegians since they are the two most populous in the territories. These figures also show that there are nearly five hundred thousand Scandinavians in America.</p>
   <p>Just. think what this would mean if this total were doubled in the next twenty years, [a possibility which is not too remote].</p>
