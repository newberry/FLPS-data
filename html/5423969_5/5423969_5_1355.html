   <p>Dr. Doe finds a Norwegian in whom some vital organs are misplaced!</p>
   <p>The Northwestern Branch of the Chicago Medical Society last night held its first meeting of the season in the hall at Augusta and Milwaukee Avenues. Dr. Fischin presided.</p>
   <p>Dr. Doe presented a Norwegian in whom the heart was not located as ordinarily; it was on the wrong side, the right side. Similarly, most of the other internal organs are on the side of the body opposite from the usual position.</p>
   <p>The rare phenomenon caused a lively discussion in which several of the medical men took part. The man came from Stavanger,Norway, and aside from the unusual position of his organs, is in perfect health.</p>
