   <p>The members of, "Our Saviour's Congregation;" have agreed to invite the Rev. Ylvisaker from Minnesota to succeed the Rev. Krohn as their pastor; and so the idea of uniting the two larger congregations of the Norwegian Synod and make the Rev. Mikkelsen their pastor, has been abandoned. According to our information the main reason for abandoning the idea were; that both congregations' financial affairs would become too complicated; that donors might lost interest in a united church; and that the location of the churches and the residences of the members made unification undesirable.</p>
