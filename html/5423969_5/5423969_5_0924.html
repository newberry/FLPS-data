   <p>Several contributors, speaking of conditions in Norway, present their version of these in a manner completely misleading as far as concerns the people who are unacquainted with the country. Among these may be included a large number of the Norwegian youths who have been educated here in America. Many of these youths are too "elegant" or too nearsighted or too foolish to learn Norwegian and to read Norwegian papers, an so they get their knowledge concerning foreign countries and their affairs from the English-language press.</p>
   <p>Now it is commonly known that the knowledge of the Americans in regard to other people and countries is about as poor as it possibly could be. The Americans and the French are the only great civilized people who are living in the belief that anything which is outside the borders of their countries is of no importance. The American press is bringing a small amount of facts from abroad and a lot of nonsense; but it is the nonsense which the people are reading and believing. The average American speaks as if he were a child when questions arise about the life and conditions in other countries.</p>
   <p>The over-Americanized Norwegian youth is going in this school and so is trained in ignorance concerning the land of his fathers as well as about other countries. When some older Norwegian speaks about Norway, describing it as he knew it fifty years ago, it is clear that our young people will be strengthened in the belief that in the old country stagnation and misery has put its mark on everything.</p>
   <p>On several occasions Skandinaven has called attention to these conditions, and it seems well to take up the matter for discussion once again.</p>
   <p>Some of our contributors have been writing as if Norway were the only country from which people are emigrating. But, as everybody knows,for a long period there has been emigration to a greater or less extent from practically all the older countries, the large and rich ones as well as the little and poor ones. Emigration, by the way, is not an expression of social misery, as some seem to think; on the contrary, to go to a foreign country and settle there requires a considerable amount of personal energy and a certain amount of economic capacity. People who are really low in the scale neither will nor can emigrate. A Norwegian who has had the chance to see and compare the various groups of people passing through Castle Garden on Ellis Island, has not found any cause there to feel ashamed of his people. The Norwegian immigrants look well, better than most of the others who are coming over from Europe; they are stronger, healthier, cleaner, and better clothed.</p>
   <p>People who leave the lands of their fathers are usually emigrating because they believe that they may be able to do better elsewhere than they were able to do at home. Most of those who came to America were not disappointed in this; but, on the other hand, many have found that they could have progressed as well, or better, if they had remained in Norway. This is especially true of many who left a good position in Norway to come to America.</p>
   <p>In this country we have also had a constant stream of people traveling from the East to the West and this is true even back to the very first years of the building of the country. Of late we have also seen a considerable amount of emigration from the United States to Canada, but nobody will assert that this fact indicates that Uncle Sam is about to go broke. Yet the reason for the emigration from the United States is the same as that for the emigration from Norway--the hope to advance in the new country, and the better opportunity for acquiring land.</p>
   <p>The people who left Norway for America were among the best workers in Norway. Similarly, the people leaving the United States for Canada are not of the poorer class.</p>
   <p>Emigration may be beneficial to a nation, or it may be harmful. This is true in regard to Norway as well as in regard to other countries. There were undoubtedly people in Norway who could not find suitable work to do. Their migration to America where they, with others, have been building a new Norway, has undoubtedly been of benefit to these people as well as to America. On the other hand, if workers emigrate from Norway while their work is needed there, their emigration is harmful to Norway. In recent years a great deal of the emigration from Norway has been unnecessary and consequently harmful to the land the emigrants left. For this reason a systematic movement has been recently started in Norway and Sweden to limit emigration. It is quite interesting to note that here in America a similar movement has been started in the eastern states. Thus a society has been organized in New York, the purpose of which is to counteract the westward movement of the eastern workers.</p>
   <p>New England has probably suffered more from emigration than either Norway or Sweden. A large number of farms in New England have been abandoned; whole districts have been practically laid waste because the people have gone west to acquire the richer land in that part of our country.</p>
   
   <p>As this paper has stated before, in Norway the general opinion is that the best way to stop or limit emigration is to aid the young people who have no land of their own to become landowners. Much has already been accomplished in this direction. The Housing Bank which was organized for this purpose has, during the five years since it was founded, lent thirteen million kroner on an easy repayment plan to such young people who prefer to live and build in their own country, but who have been lacking in financial ability. The demands on this bank have been so great that it has been decided to expand it. It appears that Norway could use very large sums profitably in aiding young people to own their farms.</p>
   <p>In this connection it may be mentioned that lately much has been done to improve the position of the sharecroppers in Norway.... Recently this work has been directed especially toward the goal of making the sharecroppers the owners of the land they were farming. This activity has brought about a steady rise in the number of farmers owning their land. About a generation ago there were nearly fifty thousand sharecroppers in Norway; at present there are less then twenty-five thousand.</p>
   <p>In regard to labor legislation Norway ranks among the most advanced countries. There are good laws concerning inspection of factories, and accidents among the Norwegian industrial population are comparatively rare. Accident insurance has been inaugurated among fishermen and industrial workers; the insurance guarantees the families of those who have fallen victims to accident, immediate aid. This insurance has been expanded so as to include sailors, and it is planned to arrange for accident insurance to apply to the whole Norwegian population.</p>
   <p>....There is a proposal before the Norwegian parliament to arrange for sick insurance, the benefits of which are to extend to all Norwegians.</p>
   <p>The poor relief work is well managed. Norway is taking good care of its poor people, and nobody is dying over there from lack of food. This is more than can be said about conditions in several of the larger and richer countries.</p>
   
   <p>....It will not be long, however, before poor relief will be for practical purposes, a thing of the past in Norway. Both of the leading parties have agreed to introduce old age insurance for the entire populace so that every person will have a certain annual income when he has reached a designated age. This proposal will be adopted as soon as it has been thoroughly studied in all its details. Many people in America will doubt whether it is advisable to adopt such an extensive measure; that, however is a matter by itself. Norway will adopt the measure in question this year despite its wisdom or folly.</p>
   <p>At times there is more or less unemployment in some of the larger cities in Norway, as is the case in other countries. On the whole employment conditions are steadier in Norway than here. The large groups of transients so much in evidence in America present a condition unknown in Norway.</p>
   <p>Many people speak about the lower classes in Norway and take it for granted that people in that group do not take interest in the honor of the country or in the general welfare of the people. This opinion represents a deep misunderstanding of a large part of the very best people in Norway. There is no "lower class" in Norway. There is no country where the cleft between rich and poor is less, or where the whole people is more uniform as to race, more fully democratic throughout the layers of the population. In ancient days there were a few "stuck-up" officials of the government, but that age is past. The governmental offices nowadays are more and more being held by sons of farmers and laborers.</p>
   <p>The general education rates very high and the national sentiment is alive among the working youths whether in city or in country... There is universal suffrage in Norway and poor as well as rich understand how to use the ballot....</p>
   <p>We Norwegians in America need to note these facts. When we speak about the land of our fathers it is important that we describe it as it is. We are doing injustice to Norway if we judge it on the basis of conditions of an age-long past. We have reason to be proud at the progress made by our fathers' country in the various fields. And when we discuss questions concerning the needs of Norway we need to remember that neither the Norwegian people nor, for that matter, any other people, have attained to power or wealth or happiness by just complaining.</p>
