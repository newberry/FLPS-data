   <p>Last Friday Canute R. Matson, superintendent of Post Office Station A, and his wife celebrated their twenty-fifty wedding anniversary at their residence, 609 Cleveland Avenue. Early in the day people began ringing the door-bell, bringing a mass of presents to the "silver-bridal" couple. The presents included articles of silver of every description, flowers, and palms. In addition, a large number of telegrams and greetings were received by the couple. Among these was one from the president of the Norwegian Old Settlers' Society, Mr. Peter M. Balken. He sent the invitation card to their wedding which he received twenty-five years ago. Mr. Balken's message and card came as a pleasant surprise and was admired both by Mr. and Mrs. Matson and the fifty guests who came in the evening to extend congratulations.</p>
