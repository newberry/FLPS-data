   <p>Mrs. Margrete Seehus is 75 years old. Last Thursday many visitors came to her home, 103 North Center Avenue, to congratulate Mrs. Seehus, on the occasion of her 75th birthday. Gifts and flowers were brought by many, and the house was filled with self-invited guests for the evening. But though self-invited, the guests were very welcome.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Seehus was born in Romsdal, Norway, September 19, 1832. Her father, at one time, was a member of the Norwegian parliament.</p>
   <p>In Norway she took the medical course required for midwives, and practiced for a number of years in Romsdal, in Nordmore, and in Christiansund. In 1872, she came to Chicago with her husband, Christopher <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Seehus, and she has practiced here for 35 years.</p>
   <p>For twelve years, she has conducted a school for midwives, and 32 of her pupils have passed the examination required by the Chicago Board of Health. During her practice, Mrs. Seehus has brought more than 5000 babies into this world.</p>

   <p>Mr. C. B. Seehus died 30 years ago, and since then Mrs. Seehus has been the provider both for herself, and for her two boys while they were growing up and attending schools. One of the boys is a minister in Iowa, and the other has followed medicine and is now practising in Hatton, N. D.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Seehus claims she has been ill only five days in all her life. Still practising, and is in good health, she is a self-made woman who has contributed much.</p>
