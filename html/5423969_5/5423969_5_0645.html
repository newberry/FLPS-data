   <p>Last night the Danish-Nowegian Methodist congregation held its annual conference in the church on Maplewood Avenue and Le Moyne Street. This was the twenty-second conference held in the twenty-one years that the church has existed. Bishop L. M. Merrill presided. Bishop Merrill is the oldest of the eighteen bishops now active. About eighty pastors were present at the conference. Every four years all churches are represented.</p>
   <p>Reverend F. Ring, who two years ago left the church, was succeeded by Reverend L. A. Larsen in the Chicago district. Each pastor serves four years, so Reverend Larsen still has two years to serve. The two oldest pastors present were Reverend A. Haagensen, pastor of the Bethania Church, in Chicago, and Reverend A. Jansen, of Ludington, Michigan.</p>
   <p>The Danish-Norwegian Methodist congregation was organized on December 29, 1872, with sixteen members, in a building located at Division and Holt Streets. In 1882 the church moved into its present quarters.</p>
