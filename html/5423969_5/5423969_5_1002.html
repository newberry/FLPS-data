   <p>The Chicago Norwegian Colony has, during the past few days, enjoyed a visit by a distinguished Norwegian, Capt. Sam Hjortdahl, who will be in command of one of the new ships acquired by the Norwegian-American Line. Capt. Hjortdahl is an impressive figure, tall and husky with the true military appearance of a man who has had years of training, piercing steel-grey eyes set in weather beaten, sun browned face, a perfect specimen of the world's greatest seaman.</p>
   <p>Capt. Sam, as he is affectionately called, has served for many years as an officer under the Japanese Government. He has followed the sea since he was seventeen years of age, and for eighteen years he has been an officer with Japan's greatest shipping concern. During the Russo-Japanese war the boat commanded by Capt. Hjortdahl was converted into a transport and the captain recalls one trip, especially, when he carried 3,000 wounded and captive Russians and many high Japanese officers.</p>

   <p>The captain has visited the shipyards where the N. A. liner is being built and reports the work proceeding rapidly. He expects to dock in New York, on the maiden trip of his ship on or about April 1st, next year. The captain is not a stranger to the Atlantic as he has sailed that ocean for nine years in command of both sailing and steam vessels. He states that on several occasions he carried silk valued at over 1 1/2 million kroner.</p>
   <p>Capt. Hjortland likes Chicago and is enjoying himself very much as it is a pleasure call with strictly no business connections. The captain will also visit St. Paul, Minneapolis, Fargo and other western centers and we do not doubt that when the N. A. liner starts he will have the pleasure of seeing many Norsemen on his boat, friends he is making on this, his first inland visit to America.</p>
