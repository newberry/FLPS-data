   <p>Chicago's Ben Blessum is at present touring Norway on an extended lecture tour under the auspices of the "Folkeakademier," Peoples Academies. At Skien, where he recently lectured he was asked if he intended to work for the spread of the "Peoples Academies," of America upon his return. Blessum answered that this phase of educational effort was not looked upon in the Norwegian sense in America and that the outlook was rather doubtful, only twenty-eight such institutions in the entire United States having applied for federal aid.</p>
   <p>In Christiania Mr. Blessum has delivered several lectures on the American Indian under the auspices of the Anglo-American Club.</p>
