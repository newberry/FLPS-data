   <p>At the opening of the second session of the Norwegian Lutheran Church convention, Reverend J. A. O. Stub, the field secretary discussed several important points. Following is his address in part:</p>
   <p>"Shame on those who say that this is the rich man's war. There is no difference between the millionaire's son and the wash woman's son in these camps. They are simply citizens of the United States, and consider this the greatest honor that can be bestowed on any person."</p>
   <p>The speaker gave a short outline of the part played by the Lutheran people in the development of the United States, especially Norwegian Lutherans. Referring to the parts taken by the Norwegians in the war for independence from England, the Mexican war, and the rebellion, he said:</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"We were doing our part manfully then; we are now. The place where old Trinity Church now stands on that little crooked thoroughfare known as Wall Street in New York City, was once a Norwegian farm. The records now show that seventy-five percent of the Norwegians in this country are tillers of the soil and constitute the backbone of the bread producing section of this land. They are loyal to their church and their country, and are doing their full share toward sustaining their adopted country in the present crisis."</p>
   <p>In opening his address Dr. Stub issued a challenge to a certain element in this country that has, either through ignorance or malice, attempted to convey the impression that the Lutheran Reformation was a German movement.</p>
   <p>"There is no foundation in history for such an assertion that the Reformation was a German movement. The Reformation promoted the fundamental principles <span class="page-break">3</span>of all religious and political liberty and it is on these that the principles of American government and political institutions are founded. The thesis and declaration of principles upon which the Reformation is founded were not written in German, but in Latin, the international language. The fundamental principles of the Reformation is the foundmental principle for the world movement, the liberation of humanity.</p>
   <p>Again touching upon the Norwegian and Lutheran influence in shaping the destinies of the public, Dr. Stub said that it was the vote of the Scandinavian people which made the election of Lincoln possible, especially was the Norwegian vote from the cities of Chicago and Minneapolis a deciding factor. He touched briefly upon the situation of the nation politically during the Civil War and described how the Martyred President was maligned and abused by the press of that day. He showed how divided the people of that time were concerning the support of the Northern cause and recited how in 1865 peace councils were called in Washington by people opposed to the prosecution <span class="page-break">4</span>of the war.</p>
   <p>"It is marvelous to me how united this nation stands today behind the war", said the speaker. "There is no comparison between the present situation and conditions and those of President Lincoln's administration. The American people are united as never before."</p>
   <p>In commenting on the fact that about two million American young men have been called to the colors to date, J. A. Stub declared that "this is being done under the most just and right conscription laws ever enacted by any nation". He gave a short resume of the work done by the Lutheran Commission, of which he is the executive secretary. He described the duties of the army chaplains and expressed his satisfaction about the new law enacted by Congress which allows a chaplain for every five hundred enlisted men. He paid high tribute to the work done by the Y.M.C.A., Knights of Columbus, the <span class="page-break">5</span>Salvation Army, and other organizations, both at the camps and in the war zone.</p>
   <p>"Many of these men," he said, "are coming back. We know that most of them will come back; and it is our wish that they shall come back sound in body and clean in soul. The closer the folks at home keep in touch with the men in the service, and the more wholehearted the backing accorded them by the citizens, the sooner will they come back." Dr. Stub also commented on the excellent work done by the Illinois district, and especially the work of the Chicago group.</p>
   <p>An appropriation of $628,039.69 was made to carry on the work in all branches. It was resolved to strike out the word Norwegian in the official name of Luther College.</p>
