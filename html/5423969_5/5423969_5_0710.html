   <p>Mrs. Anna Olson, known as "Nickel Anna," passed away a few days ago at the Old People's Home, 3850 Indiana Avenue.</p>
   <p>Anna Olson came to Chicago in 1835. She was very active in the early days of the Norwegian group here in Chicago. Her activity was mainly centered in church and settlement work. Mrs. Olson was one of the organizers of the Paul Anderson Church, and for many years most of her time was dedicated to the activities of this church.</p>
   <p>Her home was always open to Norwegian immigrants, who could live there until they got work or, in many cases, until they continued west to take up a land claim or homestead on the vast prairies. Often she would furnish the money to send some young immigrant to school, and later finance him in business.</p>
