   <p>An article appeared in Monday's issue of Skandinaven in which a "Son of Norway" takes upon himself the duty of grand advisor to the Norwegian National League of Chicago, regarding its choice of speakers at the celebration to be held in Brand's Park on May 17. Disregarding the wonderful display of "wooden" English, which was the ultimate limit in that direction, the "Son of Norway", himself will undoubtedly admit that he was barking up the wrong tree. There is no possible excuse for bringing the Irish question into this case, and it is the plainest sort of foolishness to criticize the speaker in question. If there is a fault, it must be charged to those who selected the man. To bring up the matter now is simply to cause embarrassment where it does not belong. The judge certainly did not ask the committee for a chance to speak at the affair, and, in a matter of this kind, where there is a pardonable difference of opinion among people of Norwegian blood, other races, other creeds, and politics should be kept out of the discussion.</p>

   <p>The judge is an American; he is also a brilliant orator; and the fact that he "recognizes" the Irish Republic, or any other progressive political movement, has nothing to do with the fact that the "Son of Norway" is of the opinion that the committee made a mistake in asking him to fill the place in question.</p>
   <p>When I was president of the League, I always demanded that Norwegians, or men of Norwegian blood should speak at the celebrations in Brand's Park. That, however, was not because I felt less friendly toward men of other nationalities. The reason was simply my view of the right kind of patriotic speeches, if I may be allowed to use the term, which Norwegians and all other adopted citizens should prefer regarding the land of their birth. There should be more admonition than admiration in a speech of this kind--a rule which only a speaker of the blood can be expected to follow.</p>

   <p>In this respect we Norwegian-Americans are master sinners but a product like that evolved by the "Son of Norway" will neither lessen nor eradicate the perverted opinion of the proven standard for such celebrations.</p>
