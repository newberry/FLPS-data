   <p>The Young Peoples' Society of the Norwegian Lutheran Church in Moreland has bought a pipe organ which the Society will present to the church on July 1. The Society does not have many members, but the ones it has are eager workers for the good cause. On the evening of presentation a concert will be given in the church, which is located at the corner of Sims Avenue and Indiana Street, and Mr. A. O. T. Artenius, organist of the Swedish Immanuel Church, will play. Mr. Artenius is a well-known musician, and is also famous in musical circles outside of Chicago. In addition, the program offers a variety of interesting numbers, and the audience is certain to find the evening enjoyable.</p>
   <p>The Reverend O. K. Espeset is the president of the Society. Mr. John Rumberg is vice-president, Miss Margaret Olsen is secretary, and Mr. J. Sandheim is treasurer.</p>
