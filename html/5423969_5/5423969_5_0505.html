   <p>p.5..........Ulrik V. Koren, president of the Norwegian Lutheran Synod, passed away last week at the advanced age of eighty years. The Synod suffers a great loss in the passing of this venerable leader who will be hard to replace. The vice president, Dr. Theol. Stub, will act as president until an election can be held during the coming summer. Rumor has it that there are two parties within the Synod, one favoring Dr. Stub, the other being strong for Prof. Perus, principal of Lutheran College. Both are capable and highly esteemed and either one will be a credit to the Synod if elected to the Presidency.</p>
   <p>We note, in reading accounts of the funeral of Dr. Koren, that Pastors from the other Norwegian church bodies were not in attendance, nor had they sent one floral offering.</p>
   <p>One cannot but recall the words of the Apostle,"Behold- how they love one another." Still the three church bodies are planning a union of the three groups.</p>
