   <p>The Norwegian Pioneers' Association held its biennial meeting last Wednesday at the Hotel La Salle. The meeting was called for 9 A.M., but just a couple of members appeared. Later in the day a party was given, and a great many of the white-haired oldsters attended. Many of the pioneers came to America by sailing ship and without much delay set out on their journey westward, often through a country teeming with Indians, who resented the intrusion of the paleface. Many of these old-timers were compelled to carry rifles when they stepped out of doors.</p>
   <p>Small groups of cabins grew into great cities, teeming with a populace that knew nothing of the hardships of the early Norwegian pioneer. Quite a number of the old Norwegians fought in the Civil War, with the same spirit with which they had fought for the freedom of Norway. They helped to build churches, [they founded] a Norwegian press, and last but not least, they acquainted other pioneers from many countries with the beautiful Norse songs that today live on in American culture.</p>
   
   <p>When the old-timers meet, there is a continual swapping of yarns; tales are told of "how in the fifties and sixties we fought Indians on the Dakota prairie--how we struggled in Chicago in the early days and then the great fire," and so forth.</p>
   <p>Yes, these old Norwegian pioneers tell stories which to us seem fairy-tales. May they all live for many years and tell us of their adventures and their struggles!</p>
