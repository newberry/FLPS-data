   <p>Intense activity is being manifested by all groups or teams working to raise the funds for the memorial gift to Norway in 1914. The Illinois Women's Branch has arranged a mass-meeting to be held on the afternoon of May 1st, at St. Paul's Church, Leavitt Street and North Avenue. This meeting will be the opening gun of the Chicago women's battle for funds, and should draw a capacity audience, as the program includes speakers of national renown and vocal and instrumental soloists who always please our Chicago public. Miss Ora Johnson will be at the big organ, and Professor <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Paulsen, musician, vocalist, and composer will also take part.</p>
   <p>Scandia urges our countrymen to attend and to start the fund-raising off with a repercussion that will be hard throughout the land. Success to our energetic women!</p>
