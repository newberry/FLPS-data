   <p>p.4............Would it be advisable to limit immigration? This is a question which has great variance of opinion. One side argues that "The country must protect itself against the invasion of such European people as are of a lower grade physicially and mentally than the Germanic or Anglo-Saxon races." Opposed to these are leading men among the Latin and Semetic groups who vigorously protest against such discrimination, arguing that such an "invasion" would be beneficial to the country at large. Although these people occupy a lower rung on the ladder of culture, their intentions are good are their desire to better their conditions economically and culturally and to help the country should entitle them to the privelege of entering and becoming good American citizens.</p>
   <p>One fact in the matter is self-evident. The question is one of economy from top to bottom and the problem can only be solved on an economic basis. The main problem confronting our statesmen is to obtain the proper data having a bearing on the entire <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>question. Were it not for the obstructing tatics of reactionary forces and "Fire-Cracker Patriots" it would be a comparatively simple matter to establish facts that would enable our law-making bodies to enact the necessary laws for the beneficial controls of immigration and naturalization.</p>
   <p>A motion to limit immigration has been presented in Congress and with the approval of the "Immigration Committee" is now being disussed in the House of Representatives. The motion in its present form has drawn a strong protest from liberal, thinking men in all walks of life. The illiteracy clause would scarcely exclude a single Norwegian But requiring immigrants to pass an examination regarding the constitution, status of individual states etc together with a comprehensive knowledge of United States history is certainly far fetched. Nor will the examinations required be the same in all groups. They will also be changed from time to time. The examinations are primarily intended to exclude the entry of anarchists, criminals and undesirable illiterates. This idea is the purest idiocy as it is universally known that anarchists and many criminals are possessed of a greater education that the average, and could pass the tests with little or no trouble. On the other hand thousands (of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the so-called undesirable illiterates) who would be unable to pass the constitutional and historical examinations, would if given a real opportunity, develop into citizens of which the country could justly be proud. Lack of opportunity because of economic difficulties is the only reason these people find themselves classed as "undesirable illiterates" and when given an opportunity often put to shame those who have been born to these priveleges.</p>
   <p>The National Liberal Immigration League, organized for the protection of immigrants, has taken the matter up and is sponsoring a mass meeting at the Coopers Union Hall in New York City on February 6 in a protest against the motion. Mass protest meetings will also be called in Chicago in the near future and we predict an early killing of a measure so unjust and lacking in common sense as this one.</p>
