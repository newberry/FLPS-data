   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Mission Home Society held its biannual meeting yesterday at the Bethlehem Church. The president, Reverend Lars Harrisville, presided.</p>
   <p>A booklet that had been published by the Society was thoroughly discussed. The main points in the booklet are:</p>
   <p>1. A report on the dangers of the city.</p>
   <p>2. Seven thousand immigrant girls arrived in Chicago in 1913; of these two thousand disappeared.</p>
   <p>3. Chicago, headquarters of the white-slave traffic.</p>
   <p>4. Many Norwegian men and women immigrants, who could have been saved, resorted to immorality.</p>
   <p>5. We must build a defense for the homeless youth.</p>
   <p>6. Our home must become a refuge for homeless youth.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>7. We must advise them and care for them, body and soul.</p>
   <p>8. We must build a Norwegian center here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>9. A mission home is a necessity.</p>
   <p>10. We must build and continue to build.</p>
   <p>In accordance with a decision reached at a previous meeting, a restaurant was opened at 1627 North Kedzie Avenue. Mrs. Berg, who is in charge of the restaurant, proposed that the Society rent a flat [sic] and care for many of the homeless young Norwegian girls.</p>
