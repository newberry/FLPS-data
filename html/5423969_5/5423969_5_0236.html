   <p>We have certain statistics concerning the Norwegian Lutheran Church that will be of interest to the readers of Scandia.</p>
   <p>In 1926, 2,554 congregations had affiliated with the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America; in 1916, the number was 2,740. The total membership in 1923 was 496,707; in 1916, 318,650.</p>
   <p>We must remember that in 1916 the Church was divided into three factions: Hauges Synod, the United Norwegian Lutheran Church, and the Norwegian Evangelical Churches' Synod. The above groups united in 1917.</p>
   <p>The financial statement of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America was as follows: Total disbursements of 2,497 churches in 1926, was $5,786,977. In 1916, 2,579 churches paid out more than two-and-one-half million dollars.</p>
