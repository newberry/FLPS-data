   <p>At a conference held last week by the National Lutheran Council, it was reported that a consolidation had at last been made with the Norwegian Lutheran Church. The following resolution was passed:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, It is evident that the organization and operation of the National Lutheran Council has not met the approval and sanction of a large membership of Lutherans represented by it; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Our own church body (the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America), by affiliating with the National Lutheran Council, sanctions and approves the teachings and practices of its members; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Some of the pastors and leading members of the National Lutheran Council tolerate and subscribe to the teachings of Freemasonry; and</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"Whereas, Our own church body (the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America), through its affiliation with the National Lutheran Council has created a barrier to the harmonious co-operation of its members; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, "Unionism" is tolerated, and even now, according to press reports, pastors are petitioning for co-operation with the "inter-church movement"; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, By the Pastoral Conference of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, that co-operation with the National Lutheran Council, under present conditions and practices, be and is hereby disapproved, except for relief of temporal distress in overseas Lutheran communities."</p>
   <p>The above resolution speaks for itself. The affiliation is in part only, but it is a beginning.</p>
