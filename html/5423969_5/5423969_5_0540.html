   <p>On Saturday morning the delegates gathered for an hour of prayer under the leadership of Messrs. W. Johnson and H. M. Larsen.....President Edward Erickson declared the convention open for business. It was decided that the first five rows of pews were to be reserved for the delegates to the convention. The president was authorized to appoint the various committees.</p>
   <p>Mr. Louis Thorp of Emmaus Church, Chicago was designated to represent the Epworth League of that church at the convention, since that League had sent no delegate. While the committee on credentials did its work, reports from several branches of the Epworth League were received. [A list of churches in various cities is given.]</p>
   <p>The committee on credentials having completed its work, it was found that sixty-one properly credited delegates were present.</p>

   <p>In addition to the delegates, Reverend F. R. Wilhelmsen, of Evanston, editor of the Kristelige Talsmand (Christian Advocate), and Reverend A. Haagensen, of Evanston, secretary of the board of education, were present. The city missionary of Chicago, Reverend H. P. Berg, sent a message concerning the immigration bureau. A congratulatory telegram was received from Reverend F. Ring, of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Reports were received from the president, the first, second, third, and fourth vice-presidents, from the superintendent of the Junior League, and from the treasurer. The treasurer's report showed...a balance in the treasury of $21.66. Mr. Loberg read the report from the committee on immigration. Both he and Reverend Hall spoke regarding the report, and informed the assembly that the recent ministerial meeting for the district....had been interested in the matter and intended to have some man appointed to co-operate with the League. On a motion by Reverend Monsen, the committee, consisting of Messrs. Loberg, Erickson, and A. A. Skudstad, was re-elected....</p>
   <p>It was resolved that in the future the local Leagues should report the names of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>delegates to the district convention at least two weeks prior to the date set for the convention. This report is to go to the district secretary who in turn is to inform the secretary of the local League as to where the convention is to be held.</p>
   <p>Reverend Erickson informed the convention that the statutes for the local Leagues had been printed and were to be had at the bookstore for twenty cents per dozen.</p>
   <p>The morning session concluded with prayer, and the benediction was pronounced by Reverend Anderson.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session opened with singing and a prayer by Reverend Hauge. The report from the morning session was read and accepted.</p>
   <p>On a motion by Reverend Nielsen it was resolved that if any district officer <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>resign his office during the year, the board be empowered to designate a substitute for the remainder of the term. Mr. Loberg read a recommendation from the district board that the money collected for district missions be transferred to the board of education to be used to pay part of the salary of an additional instructor at the theological school in Evanston. It was also recommended that the local Leagues be requested to vote a regular annual contribution for this purpose...The motion was carried, three votes being registered in the negative.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the second vice-president be authorized to superintend the collection of money for the salary of an additional instructor. It was further resolved that all the money on hand for this purpose and all money later collected for the same purpose be paid to the district treasurer. Reverend Hall moved that the second vice-president, at an early date, correspond with the local Leagues in order to obtain assurance of some definite amount; that the board be convened as soon as such assurances have been obtained, and that the latter body inform the board of education. He also asked that no part of the collected money <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>be transferred to the board of education except on order from the district president and the district secretary. The motion was adopted.</p>
   <p>The district secretary was directed to reply to a communication received from the board of education concerning the question of contributions to the salary of an additional instructor, informing the board of education of the adopted motion. Mr. T. Loberg, who was delegate to the American Epworth League convention, gave an oral report. Reverend Hall spoke on behalf of the Desplaines camp meeting and suggested that the delegates, on arriving home, should show their interest by prevailing on their respective Leagues to have badges printed for the camp meeting.</p>
   <p>The convention voted to request District Superintendent Hall to designate the second Saturday at the camp meeting as "Epworth League day".....It was also voted that every delegate on arriving home should see to it that the local League subscribe for at least one copy of the Kristelige Talsmand [Chicago] which is <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>to be kept on display in the League meeting room, in order that every member of the League may be acquainted with our work as a whole. The convention decided that the minutes of the convention should be published in Skandinaven and in the Kristelige Talsmand.</p>
   <p>The secretary read his report showing that there are fifteen Leagues in the district,with a total membership of 638....There are also seven junior Leagues with 279 members. The total number of members in the district is 917.....</p>
   <p>At most of the sessions of this Epworth League convention the Bethany choir and string orchestra entertained, as did also the combined Trinity and Bethany Male choruses. On Monday, some of the delegates toured the city; others participated in a picnic given by the Trinity Methodist Episcopal church....</p>
