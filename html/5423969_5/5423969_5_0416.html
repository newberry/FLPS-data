   <p>On Sunday, September 29, Chicago's largest and most beautiful Norwegian church, the Christ Church in Logan Square, was dedicated in the old Norwegian ceremonial manner with a sermon by the bishop and Scripture readings by attending pastors. Morning, afternoon, and evening meetings drew capacity audiences, and in addition to the customary dedication ritual a musical program by Mr. Rode-Jacobsen, a master organist, gave the big new pipe organ a thorough workout. As the beautiful music of the grand old hymns rolled out in all their majesty a spirit of reverence, seldom felt on such otherwise festive occasions, enveloped those assembled, as though to give them a taste of blessings to come. The services throughout the day were the most impressive of any we have attended in the United States; only in Norway have we ever before found such a spirit of reverence in any church.</p>
