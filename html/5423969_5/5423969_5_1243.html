   <p>The other evening Ole Theobaldi, the Norwegian violinist gave a spiritualistic sceance at his home. Besides Theobaldi, the chemist Sven Seglem-Svensen and wife were present, as was also Dr. John Lindos. After the seance was over Mr. Theobaldi remarked that accidents or misfortune invariably succeeded the spiritualistic seances. His warning came true this once:</p>
   <p>A pickpocket relieved Mr. Theobaldi of $3.00 the following day; the new motorcycle of Mr. Seglem Svensen was wrecked and Dr. Lindos' middle finger was crushed, at exactly the time when Mr. Theobaldit lost his cash.</p>
   <p>"A solemn warning," said Dr. Lindos, "that Theobaldi had better stop having seances!"</p>
