   <p>Dr. Nils Remmen, prominent Norwegian-American eye specialist, who has been doing research work in Europe, sailed from Naples on March 1st, and will arrive in Chicago about Mar. 16th. From that date on, he will continue his practice, and he can look forward to a great number of calls both for professional services and friendly visits.</p>
   <p>Dr. Remmen has frequented the greatest eye clinics in London, Paris, Christiania, Copenhagen, Berlin, Prague, Vienna and Rome. Wherever he went he was shown the greatest courtesy, and in Christiania he was highly spoken of by Prof. Schotz and Dr. Holt, both of whom consider Dr. Remmen as a genius in the treatment of eye ailments. Scandia joins with a host of friends in welcoming the Doctor and his good wife back to Chicago and the colony.</p>
