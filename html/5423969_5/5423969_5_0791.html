   <p>This week Chicago has the honor of being host to the Grand Army of the Republic, which is holding its thirty-fourth national convention here. The city has decorated itself as well as possible to honor its guests, and all classes of the population will offer a hearty welcome to the old warriors.</p>
   <p>The ranks of the old veterans are thinning year after year. Once the Grand Army of the Republic could count 400,000 names in its lists. Now these lists do not hold more than 288,000 names. A large number of these will not attend the convention, many for the reason that they are unable to stand the rigors of travel. And among those who are coming, there are thousands bending toward the grave, and who will not answer to the next roll call.</p>
   <p>Among the old warriors there is a little group in which the Norwegians are <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>taking special interest. This group comprises the survivors of the Fifteenth Wisconsin Regiment and other Norwegian veterans. The Fifteenth Wisconsin has its reunion on this occasion. This gathering is of special significance since it probably will be the last to be held concurrently with a national convention of the veterans.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians are considering the old Norwegian warriors with thoughts of respect and love. These old men risked their lives for the unity of our country and for the cause of liberty; their heroism and courage shed glamour upon the Norwegian name, and they showed that the Norwegians in America do not take a back seat for anybody in the matter of attachment to their country.</p>
   <p>Let us honor our old warriors! Let us welcome them among us!</p>
