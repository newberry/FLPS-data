   <p>The new Young People's Home will contain seventy-five rooms, [to be rented] for two dollars a week. It has a library, a reading room, a gymnasium, and lounges. Good meals are offered at twenty cents. Room and board cost three dollars a week.</p>
   <p>It would be impossible to charge prices so low as these if the Home was operated for profit, but co-operation does the trick. Many people considered it a Utopia, a dream, but the dream has been realized. S. K. Lund has been appointed for the important task of interesting churches and organizations in [contributing to the] support of the new Home.</p>
