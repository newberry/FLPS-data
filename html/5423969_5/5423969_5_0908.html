   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Mission Hotel Society held its first annual meeting last Tuesday evening at St. Paul's Church, Washtenaw Avenue and Hirsch Boulevard.</p>
   <p>In the year 1912, a total of 8,675 Norwegian immigrants came to America. Many of these stopped over in Chicago on their way west; many remained here.</p>
   <p>The new hotel will serve a good purpose in that it may prevent many of our newly arrived young women from being caught in the nets of the white slaver which are always spread for these young girls. It has been found that the white slavers prey especially on young, innocent Scandinavian immigrant girls. It is high time that we open our Mission hotel.</p>
   
   <p>About one third of the cost of the hotel is on hand, and an additional thousand dollars has been promised.</p>
   <p>The following motions were made and passed:</p>
   <p>1. That the Society purchase a lot at Kedzie and North Avenues, fronting Humboldt Park, 50 by 177 feet; price, $4,700.</p>
   <p>2. That construction begin at once.</p>
   <p>3. That bonds be sold in the enterprise.</p>
   <p>4. That a treasurer be elected at once.</p>
   <p>5. That a constitution and bylaws be formulated for the Society.</p>
   <p>6. That the Society shall incorporate.</p>
