   <p>More than eighty thousand immigrants arrived at New York during the last few months.</p>
   <p>They were packed in the boats like cattle, sleeping on the decks or wherever they could find a place to lie down.</p>
   <p>Although few of the transatlantic boats have accommodations for more than one thousand people, between fourteen and fifteen hundred persons were usually packed in each of these ships.</p>
   <p>Many complain of the food and sanitation aboard. It is high time that legislation is passed to remedy these conditions.</p>
