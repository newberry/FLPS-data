   <p>This year more than four thousand Norwegian flags and banners were seen in the parade on North Avenue. It was a colorful affair, and the procession was perhaps longer this year then ever before. The crowd around the Leif Ericson statue was enormous; it was said to number fifteen thousand.</p>
   <p>The children's pageant was as colorful as usual, with every one of the little tots dressed in the Norwegian national costume.</p>
   <p>The speakers were, as usual, "patriotic," laying stress on the freedom of Norway and the greatness of the day. Why waste space on speeches which are the same year after year?</p>
