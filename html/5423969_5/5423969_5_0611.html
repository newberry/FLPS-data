   <p>The Sunday School of Ebenezer Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church held its annual picnic last Saturday at Desplaines River, near Madison St.</p>
   <p>Four young men left the place of festivities to go swimming. None of them were able to swim. One of the young men, Chr. Jensen, seventeen years old, ventured too far out. The strong current carried him off his feet, and before help could reach him, he drowned. The funeral will take place this afternoon from Ebenezer Church.</p>
