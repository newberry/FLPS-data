   <p>The Bjorgvin Male Chorus celebrated May 17th with a banquet in their hall, instead of taking part in the folk festival arranged by the National League in Brands Park. The deviation from the usual routine of the day was not due to lack of interest or co-operation but to the coming trip of Julius Jaeger to Norway. The banquet was attended by many friends of Mr. Jaeger, the press, and Danish choruses. Senator Juul, of Illinois, a Danish-American, spoke of his lifelong friendship with Julius Jaeger.</p>
   <p>All the speakers lauded Mr. Jaeger for his many years of faithful work, wishing him and Mrs. Jaeger God-speed and urging an early return to Chicago, or, as they put it, to their own home and people. Mr. and Mrs. Jaeger are so much a part of the life of our Norwegian colony that we predict an even earlier return than the good couple has planned.</p>
