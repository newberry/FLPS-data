   <p>A group of prominent Norwegians recently held several mass meetings, and agitated generally for the rather new idea of making Norway a republic. We wonder what our Norwegian-Americans think about this. The reason for this move is that in Norway there is an opportunity for Sweden and Norway to form a Union.</p>
   <p>To us, this plan seems an impossibility, and consequently, we do not agree with the radicals along this line. We would much rather see an independent republic formed in Norway. Well, it may just be a lot of talk.</p>
