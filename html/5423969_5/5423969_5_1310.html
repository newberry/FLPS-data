   <p>p.8.............Mr. and Mrs. A. Elsing, of 1830 Newport Avenue, had a very strenuous time last week when on April 21, they reached the 35th milestone of their married bliss, surrounded by family and friends. In Norway a wedding does not amount to anything if the celebration does not last at least three days and this seemingly held true in the case of this lovable couple.</p>
   <p>In addition to the family celebration on Friday, friends who had mistaken the date gathered to celebrate also and the house was filled on Saturday and Sunday evenings as well, but the well-known sociability of this home though heavily taxed, stood the storm and joy reigning freely throughout the three days.</p>
   <p>Mr. amd Mrs. Elsing came to Chicago from Hamar, Norway and have made their home here for over thirty years. Mr. Elsing is a veteran member and officer of "Nora Lodge" No. 1, "R.H.K." (Knights of the White Cross) having held every office possible in such a lodge. Scandia heartily joins their host of friends in congratulations and best wishes for many years to come.</p>
