   <p>Pastor Lars Harrisville and members of the congregation laid the cornerstone of the new church last Sunday afternoon. A large crowd was present at the ceremonies.</p>
   <p>John Johnson read a catalogue of the different objects included in the iron box which was placed beneath the cornerstone. Among these objects are the history of the church and its members, and copies of the church's weekly paper.</p>
   <p>The new church will cost $40,000.00; its steeple is going to be 215 feet high; and the seating capacity will be one thousand one hundred. Architect Charles F. Sorensen will superintend the erection of a three story house which is connected with the church; one floor for the minister and two floors and the basement for rental purposes.</p>
