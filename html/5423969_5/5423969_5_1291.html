   <p>The home of Professor Alfred Paulsen on North Lawndale Avenue, was the scene of a joyful evening on Saturday, September 23. The genial Professor invited the entire Norske Glee Klub (Norwegian Glee Club) to spend the evening in fellowship and song. Professor Paulsen is the director of the Glee Club, and has often been honored by its members, so on this occasion he turned the tables and entertained "his boys".</p>
   <p>Mr. N. Sorteberg, president of the Glee Club, responded to the director's hearty speech of welcome, and the Club followed with song after song. Among the songs was Professor Paulsen's own composition, "Naar Fjordene Blaaner" (When the Fjords Turn Blue), the most popular song in all America among male choruses, quartettes, and mixed choruses. This composition has made the genial Professor's name known in every country in the world, and has been translated into many foreign languages.</p>

   <p>After the singing, the guests partook of a tasty dinner served by Mrs. Paulsen, a dinner which demonstrated that Mrs. Paulsen ranks as high in the culinary art as her famous husband does in the realm of music.</p>
