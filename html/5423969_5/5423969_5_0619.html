   <p>The well-known "Synod Pope" of Chicago is trying hard to follow in the footsteps of the Apostles, and it appears that now he "speaks with many tongues". He raves against the theater and the new Norwegian "swine-literature". In this category everything in Norwegian literature is listed except such works as Jonas Dahl's Karbahor Zahl and V. Krag's Old People's Christmas Eve. Everything else is the work of Satan.</p>
   <p>He condemns the Reverend B. C. Bersesen because he has visited the theater; worst of all, this divine attends matinees.</p>
   <p>Why is it that our Synod clergy always tear down the culture built up by such great men as Ibsen, Bjornson, and others? We cannot call [this clergyman] a critic; he just closes his "holy" eyes and condemns everything.</p>
   <p>This self-appointed Pope of the Synod also has the self-assurance to interfere in politics; he wanted the church to appoint the Norwegian consul of Chicago. Why is the church permitted to interfere with everything,--politics, hospitals, societies,--yes, everything?</p>
