   <p>p. 1.- Last Wednesday we received word that 325,000 Greeks have been turned out of their homes in Greece and their cities burned. They are calling on their brothers in America for help. We have decided that there will be three classes of contributions, $10, $5, and $2. It is not compulsory for anyone to give and any of the three classes can be chosen. Every Greek should deem it his duty to contribute to the cause of our countrymen and should give as much as he can possibly spare.</p>
