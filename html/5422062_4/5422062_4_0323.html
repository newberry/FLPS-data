   <p>The New Generation, a society composed exclusively of Grecian Girls, gives its "Annual Dance Banquet" at the LaSalle Hotel. The Greeks of Chicago and environs are invited to participate. Such a participation, should not only be for merriment and sociability, but also to help in furthering the noble and humanitarian purposes of the organization.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the dance as everybody knows, will go directly to the widows and orphans, of those in need. The Society which in the past offered innumerable services and financial assistance to the needy and depressed mothers and orphans, is determined to canvass, from door to door, and find the meek and timid widows and orphans, and succor them. Therefore, it is the imperative duty of all the Greeks, who always show their generous philanthropic despositions, to participate in the forthcoming dance.</p>
