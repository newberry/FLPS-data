   <p>The Greeks of Cicero and their Chicago friends enjoyed themselves last Sunday at the annual picnic of the Greek-American Organization of Cicero. Aside from the many attending Greeks of Cicero and Chicago, there were present a few of Cicero's American citizens invited by the members of the club.</p>
   <p>All the Cicero Greeks look forward to this event every year with enthusiasm because it affords all men, women, and children a chance to amuse themselves thoroughly in the true Greek way. Every Greek in Cicero is a member of this organization. The officers are Spiros Kampas, president; G. Tzorntan, vice-president; J. Papadimitrios, treasurer; M. Mareska, secretary; A. Thermogianis, J. Malebitis, J. Bitinis, A. Stratigakis, P. Pampourias and E. Dikonomou, advisors.</p>
