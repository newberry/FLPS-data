   <p>The revived discussion about the reorganization of the famous Greek Volunteer Brigade, whose members served Greece so nobly during the victorious Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, is timely and welcomed by the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Organizations such as the Brigade, which are patriotic and military in character, have offered invaluable services to our fatherland. There have been many individuals who have sought to dissolve this unit without offering any sufficient or satisfactory reason for this desire of theirs.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is time to call all the veterans and former soldiers of the Balkan Wars who have returned or are returning from Greece to band together and form the nucleus of an organization, under the name of Greek Volunteer Brigade, which will naturally be composed of former soldiers and veterans of our glorious wars of recent years. There is a great possibility that this <span class="page-break">2</span>body of men will again have the honor to be summoned to arms in defense of our beloved fatherland.</p>
   <p>If we want peace, we must prepare for war. And it seems that the menace of a new war is drawing nearer and nearer.</p>
   <p>Here, then, the road to serve our country and make the noblest sacrifice in behalf of all that we hold dearest is open!</p>
   <p>Let us all march forward together!</p>
