   <p>The ball given by the Greek women of Chicago for the philanthropic purpose of offering material aid to our fellow countrymen in Asia Minor, who are suffering from the persecutions of the barbarous Turks and Germans and from the pangs of hunger, was crowned with complete success. The dance was held last Friday in the magnificent ballroom of the Sherman Hotel. A huge crowd of our fellow countrymen was present at this dance. The spacious ballroom was filled to overflowing, so much so that an adjoining room also was used.</p>
   <p>The dance was conducted with such order and dignity that both Greeks and Americans left greatly pleased and with the best of impressions. The entertainment was enriched by the presence of Mr. Kanelos, who for one whole hour danced Greek classical dances with the assistance of American girls. The dance receipts are estimated at about three thousand dollars. The able Greek women who organized and contributed to the success of such <span class="page-break">\2</span>a great philanthropic cause deserve sincere congratulations, honor and justified praise.</p>
