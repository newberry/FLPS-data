   <p>Inspired by the Holy Week church services to perform some service to our less fortunate fellow countrymen in various hospitals and institutions, we appealed to our community for financial aid.</p>
   <p>We wish to express sincere thanks to all those who so generously contributed to this philanthropic cause. Especial thanks are due the Ladies' Society of the St. Andrews' Church for its generous financial contributions, the Lake View Dairy Company for the case of eggs, and the well-known Halsted Street business houses: Atlas Grocery, Deligianno Brothers, Mouzakeotis Brothers, and Mallers &amp; Company.</p>
   <p>The food and money were divided among Greek patients in the Crawford Sanatarium, Oak Forest, Dunning and Hines Hospital.</p>
