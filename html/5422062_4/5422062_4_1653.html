   <p>P.1--American independence was celebrated by Chicago Greeks with magnificence and genuine devotion and enthusiasm, and they received by the unanimous voice of the city's press due credit for excelling all others with their parade, which passed through the principal streets of the city.</p>
   <p>The fact that only the Greek parade was mentioned the next day by the American press is an indication of its excellence. The French parade, which was next to the Greek, was not mentioned by the dailies. The Greek parade was the most picturesque. Thousands upon thousands afoot, on horseback, and in automobiles passed the cheering throngs. Thousands of men and women were in national costume, military and civil.</p>

   <p>At the head of the parade mounted heroes of 1821 led the thousands behind them. After this picturesque chivalry a magnificent float symbolic of the ancient and modern democracies rolled in state with Mrs. Victoria Salopoulos impersonating ancient Greece and Miss Ethel Martin impersonating Columbia.</p>
   <p>As soon as the vanguard of the procession reached Grant Park, which had been deserted, thousands of people rushed to the grounds to admire the Greeks celebrating the independence of America. Something went wrong with the authority of the hundreds of guards, and the surging crowd of cheering spectators mingled with the oncoming Greek legions, and instead of having a strictly Greek celebration we witnessed a pan-cosmic Fourth of July ceremony with the poor Greeks acting as the nucleus of the whole assemblage of enthusiastic people.</p>
   <p>When embracing, kissing, and other emotional demonstrations had subsided and order was restored, the grand master of ceremonies, Mr. Paul Demos, <span class="page-break">\3</span>ordered the raising of the flag. As the emblem of universal democracy with its stars and stripes unfurled and moved upward to its lofty point, the surging throng burst into sky-renting cheers. Pandemonium reigned for three or four minutes. Although the celebrating Greeks lost their individuality, nevertheless the air resounded with the clearly distinguished Greek word Zeto (hurrah). And whether by design, by imitation, or by effect of the law of attraction the whole crowd joined in the re-echoing "Zeto, America, Zeto"!</p>
   <p>Speakers of the day, American and Greek, eulogized the event which was being celebrated, and then Mr. Eutaxias, publisher of Loxias, closed the ceremony by reading a resolution to the President of the United States, which was accepted and adopted by the unanimous voice of the celebrants.</p>
   <p>At this moment two clever Greeks, T. Matsoukas and P. Alexopoulos, suggested a visit to the French Pavilion. The wise suggestion of the two Greeks was followed, and orders flew right and left: Mobilize to march to the French <span class="page-break">\4</span>Pavilion! The idea electrified the Greeks, and Zetos again filled the air. Pandemonium again broke loose, and the new parade along Michigan Boulevard was soon in full swing. Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, and the thousands of Greeks came to the French playing the Marseillaise. The French replied with the Greek anthem, and the two races united in the celebration of the Fourth of July. Led by three hundred French girls, the Greeks and the French reparaded through the principal streets of the city and again reached Hull House, the place where the procession had assembled.</p>
   <p>This celebration will remain in the memory of the people for a long time to come, and it owes its success to the three communities and the following societies: the Cretan, the Messenian, Kynourias (St. George), Tainias (St. Nicholas), Vervenioton, the Confectioners' Association, Manthyreas, Paleohoriton, Selasias, Venizelos Liberals, Epiroton, Phoenix, and others. The Messenian Society defrayed the expenses of the float. Many of these societies had their own bands.</p>

   <p>The communities and the above-mentioned organizations are to be congratulated for their splendid cooperation, which rendered the celebration of the Fourth of July a grand and magnificent success.</p>
