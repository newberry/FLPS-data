   <p>We often dealt, from these columns, with the tendencies shown by many of our fellow countrymen and priests to substitute the English language for Greek. One of the reasons of our struggle against the former ecclesiastical regime was because it encouraged tendencies that were against the perpetuation of the Greek language among Greeks. The Greek press as a whole and the majority of the Greeks in America, have, fortunately, declared their desire to preserve their nationality and tongue.</p>
   <p>The priests are duty bound to take the lead in this matter, because the Greek populace always considers their church as their national emblem, and they continue to believe that religion and the fatherland are inseparable. The conception of the former regime that "Christ speaks English", and that in order to preserve our orthodoxy for the new generation, we should introduce the English language in our liturgies and sacraments, is a conception contrary to our national traditions and is condemned by the Greeks in America as a body.</p>
   <p>Just the other day a priest in St. Constantine Church, before a Greek congregation, <span class="page-break">\2</span>spoke in English, not to mention other priests who have administered sacraments in English.</p>
   <p>The new regime has declared that the preservation of the Greek language will be one of its first concerns. If the priests do not take up the task with fanaticism instead of excusing themselves in the presence of a few Americans, in what way is the struggle to be carried on for the preservation of the Greek language? There are cases in which no retreats and compromises are permitted. And one of them is the perservation of our language.</p>
   <p>What do we want churches and priests for when they have not the power and will to preserve our traditions and language? The Greeks of America do not pay their priests to preach in English. If there are priests who have reasons to believe that they must preach in English, and so on, let them establish English churches, and let them find their followers among other nationalities. The Greeks have their own churches to administer their national religion in, and they pay their priests well to help preserve our national traditions.</p>

   <p>The Orthodox Christian religion is the Greek religion, par excellence, and the priests are duty bound on every occasion, especially in the churches, to use the Greek language. If they neglect this duty of theirs, why are they talking about our duty to remain Greeks and Orthodox Christians?</p>
   <p>These tendencies, were fostered by the former ecclesiastical regime, which was condemned by the Greeks of America. The present regime, however, has reestablished our bonds with the Greek Church and the Greek people's desire is to maintain these bonds of Greek character. Therefore, the priests as a matter of duty have to be the first to expound the preservation of religion and the Greek language in this country.</p>
