   <p>Mr. Editor.</p>
   <p>Would you be so kind as to accept our sincere appreciation for your generosity in sending to us your Saloniki. Every week when we receive the publication we feel that we are among our people, as we read the news of this and the old country.</p>
   <p>Also Mr. Editor, please convey our gratitude to the Greek ladies society St. Basil for, the frequent visits they pay us and the many good presents they bring along. They treat us just as if we were their own kind, and we feel a mental relief with their cheerful words and actions whenever they come to the hospital.</p>
   <p>With good wishes.</p>
   <p>We beg to remain.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Greek Patients</p>
   <p>Municipal Tuberculosis Hospital.</p>
