   <p>P. 1. The proceeds of the dance which is being planned by the Chicago and Oak Park United Chapters of Ahepa will be used to aid the earthquake victims of Corinth, for whose benefit Ahepa has already contributed $40,000.</p>
   <p>The Ahepans of Chicago in addition to their private contributions, desire to send a still larger sum. They are, giving a dance next Monday, June 18th, at the luxurious Trianon Ballroom for this purpose.</p>
   <p>This dance, which is to be the last one of the season, promises to attract the elite of our community as well as many Americans who wish to aid the victims of Corinth after its great disaster.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the collection of funds for this cause has been conducted unsystematically and the results are not satisfactory, considering the population of this great Greek community.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Ahepa's dance, therefore, is a brilliant opportunity for all good patriots to display their philanthropic sentiments, and we urge each and all not to miss the dance on Monday at the Trianon.</p>
