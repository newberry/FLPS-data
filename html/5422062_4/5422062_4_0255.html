   <p>p. 5 We recently received a letter of thanks from Oak Park where many of our countrymen are confired in the sanitarium for tubercular diseases. They sent a letter thanking us for publishing an article concerning their plight. In that article we asked the various philanthropical clubs of Chicago to help our needy countrymen.</p>
   <p>We are informed that aside from those suffering from tuberculosis there are many others there with other diseases.</p>
   <p>We think it is a good idea for the various clubs to get together and give an affair the proceeds to go entirely to our suffering countrymen.</p>
