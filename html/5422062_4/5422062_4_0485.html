   <p>Esteemed Editor of the Saloniki: We ask that you aid our cause by publishing the following petition in your newspaper. By doing so, you will be performing a great service to mankind, and to your brothers of Asia Minor. The danger, as you can see for yourself from the letters we have sent you, is very great. Our fellow patriots must unite in their efforts to alleviate these conditions.</p>
   <p>We trust that you will do everything in your power to help us.</p>
