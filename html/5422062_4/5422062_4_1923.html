   <p>Last winter there were churches in America, that did not have coal and others that could not meet their regular expenses. This means that churches go down, because people attend entertainments in winter and picnics in summer and do not attend church to pray and exercise their religious duties.</p>
   <p>There are men in the church councils who do not care about the holy money, despite the poverty of the churches, so long as the money does not come from their pockets. We say this with conviction, because there have been found sincere ministers and choir singers and teachers, who have their wages coming to them, and, who inform us about publishers and other exploiters of everything "sacred and holy," who looted the church treasury while the former did not get their pay. It is about time that such practices be stopped.</p>
