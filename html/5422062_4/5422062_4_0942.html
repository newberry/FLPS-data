   <p>P. 1 - We have often referred to the fact that Hellenism in America is a great power fall of vitality and enthusiasm which could accomplish much for itself and the whole nation. Unfortunately this power is decaying and vanishing because it lacks organization, on the whole, and specifically in the communities.</p>
   <p>We must not forget that we are in a country and live in an era, where organization and system alone bring results, while any unorganized and unsystematic action is doomed beforehand.</p>
   <p>The complete lack of general and social organization, therefore, is the reason why nothing of a serious nature is accomplished by the Greek population in general and the large Greek communities in particular.</p>
   <p>Just on account of lack of organization and systematic effort, all big purposes and plans fail and disappointment and demoralization follow. The fatal end of Hellenism in America as a national entity is being precipitated, in spite of the fact that Hellenism at the moment is at the highest point of national <span class="page-break">\2</span>activity by which so many great and significant accomplishments might be effected for its own benefit in America, and of Greece as well.</p>
   <p>Organization and systematic action do not come about as if by chance, without proper effort and the help of some paragons. Owing to their position, it is the duty of Ecclesiastical leaders and the official representatives of the Greek government to bring about the organization of the Greek in America.</p>
   <p>The most startling point of all, however, is that these two factors, whose mission it is to help organize Hellenism, are endeavoring to divide the flourishing Greek communities of America, and to alienate Hellenism from its traditions and make it reject its religion.</p>
   <p>How could we otherwise explain the attitude of the Eccleciastical leaders and that of the official representatives of Greece in playing the role of partisan leaders in the existing division of the Greeks of America; a division originating not there but in Greece? They, instead of being the religious and political leaders of the whole Greek populace remain indifferent, and by their attitude <span class="page-break">\3</span>perpetuate division, bringing about religious and national demoralization and are leading Hellenism of America to destruction.</p>
   <p>We might have justified their attitude if it were a matter of experimentation for the applying of a system. But, when the experiment goes on for six years, its failure is evident and the destruction caused is irreparable. What more do they expect and why do they insist on experimenting?</p>
   <p>We submit the simple and clear question to them: Didyou, for six years, by supporting the Ecclesiastical system of the independent church of North America (the Rodostolic Church) bring unity to the Greeks of America of did you perpetuate the existing division?</p>
   <p>The answer is known and affirmed by our six years of experience under you. "You perpetuate division and bring about dissolution and catastrophe".</p>
   <p>After all, the four Hierarchs, out of monkish caprice and self-interest, are indifferent to the daily Greek publics religious sentiment, remaining unaffected to the vanishing national sentiment and, like sinister spirits, rejoice in our <span class="page-break">\4</span>communal decline. For what reason do the official representatives of Greece, the ministers and consuls cooperate with them and become the cause of the collapse of Hellenism as a national entity in this country?</p>
   <p>Is that why the Greek government sent them to America - to contribute to the dissolution of Hellenism and to the alienation of the Greeks of America from the Mother country. Has such lack of vision, such stupidity, such indifference, such cruelty blinded clergymen and laymen so that they cannot see the great misfortune transpiring and their guilt in it?</p>
   <p>As we talk about the organization of Hellenism, in our communities, our churches and our schools, the clergymen, ministers and consuls have laid down, as their program, "perpetuation of the division, dissolution, and catastrophe, of Hellenism in America."</p>
