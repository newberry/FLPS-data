   <p>Mr. Editor:</p>
   <p>Will you please make an announcement of the dance to be given on December 4, by our society. It will be held in the Tiger's Room of the Sherman Hotel on Sunday night.</p>
   <p>Our purpose is to raise funds to aid the poor Greeks in the city during the Christmas season.</p>
   <p>This Society had been organized three years ago, for the purpose of cultural advancement of the members, and to aid every beneficial movement.</p>
   <p>The Society has aided the treasuries of the three Greek schools of Chicago by giving them $600. Six hundred dollars was also sent to the Greek Red Cross of Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>Due to economic conditions our offices have been flooded with petitions for help; and, so we appeal to the generous philanthropic sentiments of the people of the community. Help us both by attending our dance, and by sending checks to our office. Please make it possible for us to be helpful to our poor brothers. "He who helps the poor, gives to the Lord."</p>
   <p>President</p>
   <p>Nina Perdikis</p>
   <p>Secretary</p>
   <p>Martha Matzoukas</p>
   <p>Address: 2913 North Clark Street.</p>
