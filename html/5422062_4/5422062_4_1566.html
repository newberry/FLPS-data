   <p>Orthodox Greeks came from all parts of the city to St. Constantine Church last Sunday to celebrate our independence a century ago. Special mass was said by Rev. Petrakis in the newly established church. The choir was in excellent form, directed by G. Demopoulos and accompanied on the organ by A. Siabeli. Mr. Paul Javaras gave a fifteen minute address at the close of the church service.</p>
