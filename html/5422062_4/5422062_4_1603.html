   <p>p. 1- Chicago's North Side, through the Annunciation of the Virgin parish, will give its annual dance this coming Friday, March 25, at the Merry Garden Ballroom, located at the intersection of Sheffield and Belmont Avenues.</p>
   <p>Taking place as it does on the eve of our national holiday, this dance will be of especial significance, for it enables us to celebrate the anniversary of the greatest of Greek days.</p>
   <p>There will be no lack of national color. The consul general, Mr. George Depasta, and other dignitaries will be present to join in celebrating the eve of the holiday.</p>
   <p>The North Side is giving this dance to help the schools (the Greek schools in Chicago), and for this reason it behooves all Greeks to attend, for by so doing they will not only celebrate the national holiday but will also <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>contribute to our Greek schools, by which the Greek language is maintained, and without which it would be impossible for our churches or for the Greeks in America to exist in the future.</p>
   <p>The North Side parish's governing council is exercising all possible diligence to make this dance a success - a success which a dance taking place on our national holiday surely deserves - and thus an opportunity is afforded to the entire Greek community in Chicago to celebrate Greek independence in regal style.</p>
