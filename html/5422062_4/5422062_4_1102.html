   <p>Greeks in the United States and the world over must know the facts regarding America's obligation to Greece.</p>
   <p>The world knows and acknowledges its incalculable debt to Greece for things cultural, such as art, philosophy, literature and religion. America acknowledges her share of this debt and yields to none in due recognition. Payment of this is not asked and could not be made save in terms of appreciation and good-will toward the land from which our civilization has so largely come.</p>
   <p>There is another debt due Greece, a debt more recently contracted and of which only a few are informed namely, in going into the world war on the side of the Allies.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At a time when the cause of the Allies seemed most desperate, Greece went in, declaring war November 23, 1916, nearly five months before America; and after June, 1917, the entire Greek nation was wholeheartedly in the war. The Allies assigned certain tasks to the Greek army on the Macedonian front, at the same time allotting to the Greek navy an important part in the work of ending the submarine menace in the Mediterranean.</p>
   <p>That Greece, depleted in resources from previous struggles for independence, might be able to carry on the fight, Great Britain and France, with America, obligated themselves in a written contract to make certain loans to the Greek government, America's part of the obligation amounting to $48,000,000. of which promised amount only $15,000,000. was paid.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>With credit established through these promised loans, Greece carried out the task allotted her, doing on the Eastern front what the United States did on the Western, and as a deciding factor, hastening greatly the conclusion of the war. In achieving this, much more was spent than the amount of the promised loan, and Greece gave in addition a much larger blood treasure, relatively, than America. Later when Lloyd-George and Woodrow Wilson asked Greece to immediately occupy and hold a mandate over Smyrna territory, it was promptly done and carried out with efficiency and justice.</p>
   <p>Then came the betrayal of Greece which is known to all, resulting in the debacle that culminated in the holocaust of Smyrna by the Turks, and finally landed 1,500,000 refugees, stripped of every possession, in Greece. These refugees, were received and cared for by an all but impoverished nation in a manner that has commanded the admiration of the world and makes the noblest record of service in the annals of nations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>With all this, let it be remembered that Greece is the only one of the European Allies that did not receive compensation for her participation in the war.</p>
   <p>When, after the war, the Greek people changed their form of government as America, Great Britain and France changed, by displacing the war administration, payment of the promised loan was suspended, Great Britain having paid $41,000,000, America only $15,000,000 and France none. There the matter has been allowed to rest until now the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, after conversation with representatives of the Greek government, recommends the adjustment of the whole matter by the Greek government agreeing to the funding of the $15,000,000. already received, with interest added to January 1, 1928, over a period of 62 years; the United States to further advance to Greece the sum of $12,167,000. which equalizes American payment with that of Great Britain; this last of the loan to be retired in twenty years, and the Greek government to forego all further claims under the original agreement of 1918.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>While this is a compromise agreement and calls for little more than three-fifths of the original loan promised, it is at least honorable recognition of an agreement.</p>
   <p>America can never repay the cultural debt due to Greece. America can meet an obligation in making a promised loan, which will relieve measurably a distressed nation and enable that nation to carry forward a great humanitarian enterprise in which the whole world gladly shares.</p>
   <p>The matter is now before the U. S. Congress for ratification of the compromise agreement, and every Greek in America is asked to write to his senator to ratify that agreement.</p>
