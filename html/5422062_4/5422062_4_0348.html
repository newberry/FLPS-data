   <p>Some day soon, perhaps today, maybe tomorrow , a big blue coated fellow with a smiling face, is going to walk into your store or knock at the door of your house.</p>
   <p>In his hand he will hold a package of brown tickets. He is going to tell you in a few words what it's all about. And you are urged to buy two or more of these tickets. The proceeds will provide for the widows and orphans of policemen slain when on duty. Do not fail to buy plenty of these tickets. It is gratifying to be able to assist. Buy until it hurts!</p>
