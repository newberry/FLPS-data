   <p>Lately, in their attempt to rid the country of its numerous crooks, racketeers, and murderers, the legal bodies of the country have been strictly enforcing every letter of the law. This very fine procedure has long been desired by honest citizens who are endeavoring to earn a decent living. However, in these zealous efforts of the judiciary and the legal departments it is noticed that the death penalty is too often demanded and imposed. This is by no means commendable.</p>
   <p>A Greek lawyer gave me his opinion on the subject of the death penalty the other day, saying, "I believe in the infliction of the death sentence. Crime has reached an intolerable height in this country. Racketeers have made their own personal laws and because of their great power have flagrantly disobeyed the laws of the country. They no longer recognize any master. However, in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>matters pertaining to the taking of human life, I cannot be positive in my statements. Although I favor the death sentence, it does not fill me with enthusiasm to do so."</p>
   <p>The records of every nation which has imposed the death sentence show that often individuals who are found guilty and put to death are later discovered to have been innocent of crime. But of course such discoveries can do the poor devils no good if they are already dead. Once a man is branded as a criminal and executed as a result of his guilt there is no way and no power to retract that terrible sentence, to tell him that he is innocent and, therefore, free to live. That is why it is commonly said, "It is better to free ten guilty men than to condemn one innocent person."</p>
   <p>Much has been written concerning the imposition of the death sentence--by those who desire that it be retained as a judicial decision and those who seek its abolition; by those who call it barbarous and primitive and by those who believe in the "Eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" of the Moslems; and also by <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>those who believe it should be used as an example of the outcome of crime. It is obvious that we cannot decide which view is the correct one from a sociological standpoint; but we can and do ask: Since some nations believe firmly in the value of the death sentence as a method of prevention, why do they not administer it in a more humane manner? The purpose of such punishment is to point out the fatal consequence of a life of crime, and so to protect society. The former has been an all-round failure. Capital punishment has been tried for hundreds of years and as yet no one has been taught despite the countless numbers of examples it has afforded. And the latter contention--Good Lord--a government has every means of protecting its people, and can do so in a more civilized, humane manner.</p>
   <p>The process by which the death sentence is administered today is a brutal and barbarous one. Very seldom does a murderer subject his victim to such preliminary tortures. And yet the state knowingly and coolly uses them upon its victim before actually taking his life. Death alone is a great and terrifying punishment--it needs no further ordeals. In American prisons we have what is <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>commonly called "the last mile," and the "final meal." These things are entirely unnecessary. They only torture their victim. A nation which dares to call itself civilized and humane should not impose, even upon its worst criminals, the torture of seeing death approach them nearer and nearer, as the day for their execution draws nigh. Days--no--hours, minutes, seconds, drag by, tearing the soul of the victim to pieces. In this instance the state is not punishing but is getting revenge; and therefore the state is even more of a criminal than the actual murderer who at least killed his victim instantly, in a fit of insanity or fury.</p>
