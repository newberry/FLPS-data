   <p>The united chapters of the Ahepan are expecting 10,000 people to attend their ball, on Monday evening, given for the Greek Schools of Chicago. The governor of this district, S. Rekas, the officers of the Ahepa and its thousand members, all are trying to make the event one which will go down in the Greek history of Chicago.</p>
   <p>All Greeks know the great financial condition the Greek-American schools are in. Their need is imperative! The Ahepan dance will ease their burden if all the Greek people support it faithfully.</p>
   <p>Come to the Trianon on Monday the 18th, to see your friends and help a needy cause.</p>
