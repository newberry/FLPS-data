   <p>Hundreds of members and friends of the Greek-American organization, Gapa, gathered at the Masonic Temple to celebrate our holiday. The program started at 2:30 sharp, with James Melidonin, president of Alexander Ypsilantis chapter, as chairman. Before his welcome speech, the orchestra under S. Bekatorou played several selections. The chairman spoke a few words and then introduced the General Consul of Greece, G. Depastas, who spoke on the war of 1821. Then came our good American friend James Hamilton Lewis, who spoke well on the subject of our Greek Independence Day. He was followed by seven year old L. Nikoletsea, who recited two beautiful poems. Miss B. Vasilakis recited, and Mr. K. Papatheodore made a speech. Nick Manas recited, Archrev. E. Tsourounakos made a speech, and the students of St. Nicholas sang.
