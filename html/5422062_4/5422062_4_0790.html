   <p>p. 3 -The very well-known Greek real-estate operator, Mr. George Prassas, is now ready to erect a new set of buildings on the North West Side, which will be valued at more than one million dollars. The plans are complete in every detail, and work will begin very soon on corner lots in rapidly growing commercial centers. This new venture by Mr. Prassas increases the total of his building operations this year to four million dollars, since his property at the intersection of Crawford, Milwaukee and Belmont avenues and Sawyer street, where the buildings have recently been completed, is valued at three million dollars.</p>
