   <p>Last Tuesday, in the hall of St. Constantine Church, the Christmas Tree Festival, which had been planned by the ladies' club, took place. The tree was laden with gifts, which were distributed to the poor people of the community.</p>
   <p>We congratulate Rev. Petrakis and the teachers of the school for teaching their pupils those lovely Christmas carols.</p>
