   <p>Never before in the history of the Greek race have we seen Grecian women fall socially so low as we find the Greek Ladies' Society in Chicago in regard to their dance given (as they say) for the benefit of those suffering from the holocaust of Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>A dance given for our dead and suffering fellow-Greeks, instead of mourning for those hundreds of thousands of civilians, men, women, and children, who were slaughtered by the unspeakable, infidel, and barbarian Turk! Instead of a funeral with grief and tears our Greek ladies, who call themselves the Fifty-two, gave a dance for the victims of Turkish atrocities. What sacrilege! Instead of mourning, we gathered in a certain place chosen by these high-bred Fifty-two to dance and jump and laugh and display the outlines of our sensual bodies to suggestive music appropriate only to libidinous excitement.</p>
   
   <p>Shame on you, Greek ladies! You Fifty-two, for your own vanity, or I had better not express what I have in mind- you dragged innocent and good-hearted men and women to this dance under the guise of raising funds for our suffering fellow-Greeks on the other side of the water.</p>
   <p>Dear ladies of the Fifty-two, were you interested in our national suffering? Was it your aim to raise money for the victims of Asia Minor? Your answer is no. It cannot be yes because common sense forbids the yes. Greek societies all over the country, for two years at the time of the Balkan wars, gave up dancing and raised money by public appeals for the needs of our wounded soldiers and their families. Not a single dance was given for two years. And the success of these appeals for contributions is well known to us all. But to refresh your sweet memories, dear Fifty-two, I call your attention to but two instances, both of them on Randolph Street. In the first instance forty persons were invited, and $7,000 was collected within two hours. In the second instance not quite one hundred people were invited for the same purpose, and $32,000 was collected for our brother-Greeks who were fighting the Bulgars and the Turks.</p>
   
   <p>That serves to show that the Greek's inclination to help his brother-Greek is inherent, and addresses, not dances on such occasions as these are the best means for striking a sympathetic chord in men's hearts. And furthermore your answer cannot be yes because no one of you blue-blooded ladies of the Fifty-two participated in the dance which was unwisely sponsored by the short-witted Greek Consul of Chicago for the same purpose for which your dance was supposed to be given, that is, to raise funds for the victims in Asia Minor. Your blue-blood was not aroused that time because you could not be the leaders. You could not have titles such as Madam President, Madam Chairman Madam Secretary, etc., in that dance because it was given by the Greek undiplomatic who craved all the honors, and nothing was left for you dear ladies of the Fifty-two. You see the common sense of it. Your answer is still no. That is, you were not interested in our national suffering, and the dance was not given for the purpose of helping the sufferers. But it was given for your own personal pleasure and merriment, to display fancy clothes and to reveal the plastic flexibility of your blue-blooded bodies. And for the honor and publicity that go along with such a philanthropic dance.</p>
   
   <p>Many prominent Greeks, after the dance was announced, decided not to interfere with the wily Fifty-two, accepted the idea as beneficial in order to please the ladies, and suggested the Coliseum Annex instead of the Louis Quatorze Room so that everybody might come and thus contribute more money.</p>
   <p>Our high-bred Fifty-two true to their blue-blooded traditions, insisted that the dance must take place in the aristocratic Louis Quatorze Room and not in the cheap Coliseum Annex where the country girls of the West Side and the South Side could flock in and saturate the atmosphere with their suburban odor, and moreover it is not Comme ill Faut to have the ordinary Greek musical instruments to produce harmony. So the Louis Quatorze Room was chosen, accepted and imperiously decided upon by these blue-blooded Fifty-two.</p>
   
   <p>But I cannot quite understand where and how these Fifty-two got their blue blood. Greece has no blue-blooded people; the blood of Greeks is red, and very red. Blue, green, or yellow does not flow in the veins of the Greeks. One thing may be the answer to my ignorance of the blue-bloody ancestry of the dear ladies, for I remember one time when, I was a youngster that our cow had eaten some blueberries, and her milk was rather bluish instead of purely white. I presume that our blue-blooded Fifty-two must have eaten plenty of blueberries in order to have blue blood.</p>
   <p>In regard to the suburban odor of the ladies of the West Side and the South Side I must say that culture is not the privilege and property of the North Siders, but the property and privilege of all the Siders who wish to attain it. And of my own personal knowledge I assert that some ladies of the West Side and some of the South Side are far above the standard of culture set by any blue-blooded Fifty-two.</p>
   
   <p>All this serves to show, just as we have said in previous paragraphs, that the dance was not given for the specific purpose of raising money for the victims of Asia Minor but for publicity, honors, prestige, muscular dextirity, discrimination, displaying well-tailored clothes on aphrodisian bodies, and for all that how-do-you-do business.</p>
   <p>The mask of patriotism, philanthropy, and I-am-so-sorry stuff is taken off the blue-blooded faces of the dear Fifty-two, and the real faces are revealed. Shame on you, Greek ladies! In our next issue we shall find out who really is the cause of such sacrilege. For you by yourselves, in spite of your blue-blooded brains, would not stoop so low as to establish a record for social debasement. No. I think you are the willing victims of a Satonic conspiracy. The truth and the motive of this sacrilege eventually will come out. But still, my dear Fifty-two you cannot go unscathed. If you are not the real brains behind this, you are the accomplices. And you have established a. .... precedent which our future generations may look back upon, and instead of mourning for their departed loved ones, bey should give a dance. Bravo!</p>
