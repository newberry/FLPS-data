   <p>The Young Ladies of the South Side are giving a dance on February 24, at the Trianon Ballroom. The success of the North Side and the West Side dances has practically assured us a good time at this coming dance. The Young Ladies, under supervision of S. Floudas, president, have worked hard and promise a good time to all.</p>
