   <p>Recently the installation of the officers of eight chapters of Ahepa took place at the Trianon. No words can express or describe what a gala evening it was. Thousands attended.</p>
   <p>February 18th was the day on which the officers of the eight Chicago chapters of Ahepa were installed with great pomp and ceremony. The Trianon Ballroom owned by A. Karzas, B. Karzas and N. Nomikos was the scene of the great affair. At 8:30 exactly the ceremonies began. D. Alfange, Supreme President of the Order of Ahepa, was guest of honor.</p>
   <p>Chairman of the affair was D. Parry, lawyer, past-president of Chapter 46 and at present, president of the Falanthos society. As the Greek and American flags were brought in, the orchestra of the Varzos brothers played the Greek and American national anthem.</p>
   <p>A. Kollias was toastmaster of the evening and a very good one at that. P. Sikokis, Supreme Governor of the 8th District was the main speaker.</p>
