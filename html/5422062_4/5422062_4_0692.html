   <p>As if the many evils which have been visited upon the Greek community were not enough, we are now forced to witness numerous court actions and trials involving members of our own nationality who have been apprehended and are now being tried on charges of various major and minor infractions of the law.</p>
   <p>Things would not be so bad of course if only those who are directly involved were concerned. Unfortunately, however, the humiliation and the disgrace which are reflected on our entire community and our nationality as a result of such crime are inevitable. This is not the first time that the Greek name has been dragged into the courts and halls of justice, nor will it be the last if proper and immediate measures are not taken for the suppression and complete extermination of these despicable beasts.</p>
   <p>We regret that we cannot mention the names of the law-breakers, and their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>endless string of crimes. Nevertheless, we may be permitted to accuse all those, who are to a large extent, responsible for violating the law because they know about some crimes which are being committed by others. Are they guilty of being moral accomplices in these crimes? By being unconcerned and unmoved, passive onlookers at these illegal acts, we are neglecting one of our fundamental duties to our people and nationality; we are permitting our name, honor, and reputation to be dragged into the mire and trampled under the feet of a few robbers, thieves, swindlers, and criminals.</p>
   <p>All of us know the old Greek proverb which says, "the rats have torn the flour sack." In this proverb the flour is likened to the people, the sack, the protective covering; in other words, the good name, the good deeds, the honor and reputation of the people, and, finally the rats are used allegorically to signify the filthy and criminal social elements which always try to tear up or destroy the work of people and harm the safety and peace of society. It is clearly and generally understood that these "rats", those amongst us who have <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>warped minds and dangerous criminal habits and tendencies, must be wiped out, so that the innocent will not be blamed for something that they have not done. The people are not to be held responsible for the acts of a few individuals amongst them.</p>
   <p>Because of rampant crimes, neglect, and the indifference of our people, as a whole of their commission, The Greek Star forecasts the imminent danger which is threatening to discredit the Greek name in the City of Chicago. For this very reason, it appeals for the support of every loyal, patriotic, and law-abiding Greek for the purpose of taking active measures for the apprehension of all criminals and the elimination of all kinds of crimes. For it is preferable to eliminate them than disgrace and stigmatize our entire community.</p>
   <p>It is not altogether difficult to realize this hope and enforce our just demand, for we have both the means to discover and expose any crime as well as the inexorable and inevitable axe of justice for the exemplary punishment of every transgressor of the law.</p>
   <p>Forward, then, let us launch a general crusade against crime and its horrible <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>consequences; and, if we are unable to rectify this evil, we must even resort to treachery and become informers against some of our own people. We will thus protect and safeguard ourselves against a group of criminal pervents and useless degenerates.</p>
   <p>Also, let us not fail to warn against those smoothly working snakes, those shyster lawyers and criminal mouthpieces, who have the audacity to call themselves Greeks and who are defending and shielding some Greeks who are evidently guilty of serious crimes. Some of our petty and unscrupulous lawyers have the temerity to plead the case of a notorious character in the criminal underworld in spite of the fact that such service and such protection constitute an affront to our honor and reputation. The power of money can buy a shyster's honor and his conscience. It can make him forget about community, nationality, or racial interests and responsibilities. The social stigma is hidden by money; there is no consideration for justice, national pride, or honesty.</p>
   <p>By these observations of ours we do not intend to suggest that our fellow <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>countrymen, that is, those who have been embroiled in court action because of some non-criminal, civil case, should refrain from having good, conscientious, and honest lawyers or interpreters, because they are needed especially by those who are not familiar with the English language. Our hired interpreters and attorneys must be thoroughly honest and trustworthy. Some effort must be made to track down and rid our community of all those loafing shyster lawyers, lying interpreters, and dishonest troublemakers who use every infernal method to cheat the litigants in court and to exploit the trusting and ignorant masses. Most of these opportunists and cheats claim that they are legal experts, that they are able to use political influence and apply political pressure for the settlement of some case for the sum of $200 or $500.</p>
   <p>It is well known that there are very few men who can use such means to win cases and save others from being thrown in prison or executed. It is good to remember that justice will not allow anyone to do as he pleases. We certainly feel sorry for those unsuspecting and trusting souls who fall prey to starving <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>lawyers and blood suckers. Our people should know better or be warned in time to avoid those prowling parasites of the courts and the legal profession who are robbing them of their meager earnings and hard earned money.</p>
   <p>It is very fortunate that the Greek Community of Chicago has an honest, fearless, and able lawyer in the person of Mr. Nicholas Kyriacopoulos. This man has saved many Greeks from the clutches of shyster lawyers, phony interpreters, preying bondsmen, and crooked petty politicians. Our good lawyers have protected our people and prevented them from giving money to legalized swindlers. Nevertheless, there are or have been numerous Greeks who have unknowingly fallen prey to the fast talk and slick promises of speedy court settlements from those who are past artists in the technique of robbing the ignorant and helpless masses of our people.</p>
   <p>Everything that we have written in this article is supported by facts and that is why our warnings and our revelations must be taken seriously by those who <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>might need our advice in the future. Otherwise, we wash our hands and cannot be held responsible for any unfortunate experiences which many Greeks are almost surely to face.</p>
   <p>We can only call out and say-woe to those who will be cheated, defrauded, and harmed by the criminals, shyster lawyers, dishonest interpreters, and bondsmen who seek refuge within our community.</p>
