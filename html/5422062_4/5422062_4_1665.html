   <p>At a special meeting of the many members of the Messinia, Greek patriotic and philanthropic organization of Chicago, a sharp protest was issued against the manner in which the committee in charge of arrangements for the celebration of the first anniversary of Greece's entrance into the World War on the side of America and the Allies conducted itself.</p>
   <p>Our brotherhood, represented by all its members, followed the procession of the Greek column in a body to the Blackstone Theater. Unfortunately, Messinia, with two other organizations, the St. George Tania Society and Sellasia Society, was never given the deserved privilege of being admitted into the councils of the committee meetings and into the general assembly meetings that were held. May we remind the committee in question and the Greek organizations of Chicago that we went to great expense in contributing toward the success of the performances and the celebration in general?</p>
