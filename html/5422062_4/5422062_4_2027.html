   <p>Now that it is an accepted fact that we Greeks who came to this country intending to return shortly to Greece are too deeply rooted in America to do so, it is time that we take steps to sustain our racial ego and to keep our children loyal to our religion. To accomplish this retention of our ideologies, language, and customs, clubs and societies have been formed. These organizations tend to bind us more firmly together as a national group. But all of these clubs and various other organizations are only limbs growing out of the central and life-giving body all of the church parishes. No one can deny this to be true. All Greek people agree that the parishes are the only real and powerful influences that can keep alive the flame of our Greek life here in America.....</p>
   <p>The importance of the Greek parish is understood by everyone. The parish of the church is an organ which functions like another government as regards the actions and thought within its boundaries. A parish, just as a government, should have centralization of power in order that the carrying out of proposed programs can be more efficiently accomplished. An examination of any successful government or organization will reveal the truth of this statement. Whatever Greek community has outwardly survived and flourished has succeeded in doing so because of the existence within it of one central parish. None of the divided communitees have managed to remain in existence very long. In America, the Chicago Greeks are the only ones who divide themselves into separate parishes. In regard to Chicago, we aver that there is no reasonable justification for its division into eight church communites or parishes. Theoretically, the Greek in Chicago are called "The Greek community of Chicago". Actually, how-ever, this community is divided into eight, separate, independent units. It seems as though we have inherited the conceptions of our ancient forefathers, who made each city and town a separate nation, independent of all the others. So have we created a paradoxical structure of eight separate governments within one small area.</p>
   <p>This division was begun more than twenty-five years ago, when Evangelismos and St. Constanine were built simultaneously. If the spirit of unity had pervaded the community since that time, then we today would have no cause to fight for an undivided parish. Even at that time there were individuals who believed that if the Greek community needed more than one church to serve its needs, each new church should belong to the Greek community of Chicago, which at that time was represented by the Holy Trinity Church. However, the majority of people at that time had no experience in church matters, and because of jealousy and egoism they were not in a position to comprehend the importance and necessity of one, and only one, community. In a short time, because of arguments and scandals, more churches were established, and each one became the center of an independent community.</p>
   <p>However, the great mass of Greeks in Chicago has always been in favor of the assimilation of all the community parishes into one. This unified community would be able to maintain and govern all the Greek churches. The actual difference would be a centralization of power and authority in one governing body. In this way better order could be maintained and many long-talked-of projects could be made actualities. Only in this way can we retain and improve those things we still have left to us. Neither former parish boundaries, ecclesiastical sympathy, the clerical alliance, the good intentions of our Boards of Directors, nor their sincere endeavors will ever better the economic situation of our churches. The last available remedy with which we can surely accomplish a cure is the unification of all our parishes into the Greek Community of Chicago.</p>
