   <p>Ten fruit and vegetable merchants were arraigned yesterday for short weight. Six of the accused merchants are Greeks. This accusation of the Greek merchants does not reflect very lightly upon the business of other Greeks. They must by all means maintain the good will and faith of their customers. Therefore if deliberately or inadvertently the scales are not up to the standards of city regulation, it is wise for all the merchants to have their scales balanced and readjusted.</p>
