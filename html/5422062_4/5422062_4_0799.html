   <p>George Beys and William Kotsonis bought for $25,000. the corner lot at Kedzie and Lawrence Ave. A three story building, costing $35,000, will be built at once according to the architects plan.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Beys and Kotsonis are to be congratulated for investing money in real estate, for it is not only profitable, but also appropriate that the Greek settlers in Chicago should own real estate.</p>
