   <p>The Greek community of Chicago once again presented its due respects and appreciation to the heroes of '21. Over two thousand people attended the celebration, held in the Sherman Hotel last Sunday. Mr. Gretchis and his orchestra entertained the audience, which arrived rather early. The Greek and American national anthems formally opened the program. Following an opening musical number, rendered by Miss Broulis on the piano, Bishop Callistos gave a short speech. He then presented the lawyer, John Dritsas, who spoke instead of the Consul.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dritsas first recalled the heroic deeds of the war, but he soon began to emphasize the duty of the Greeks in America toward Greece. He said we must all become national "salesmen" and advertisers of all Greek products. He was followed by some choral singing by the Athenian Operetta group.</p>

   <p>Mr. James Parry, the district governor of Ahepa, spoke in English. Dr. C. Theodore, represented Gapa, and, as usual, was greatly applauded. His speech concluded the rhetorical part of the program. The Gapas then presented their artistic numbers. Various young ladies....gave readings of Greek epic poems. These were followed by Greek circle exhibition dances. The Dance of Zaloggou brought the evening's program to a dramatic close.</p>
