   <p>For the first time Greek American Ahepans, in a group, will make an excursion to Greece. It was decided by the Executive Committee of the Greek American Organization to sponsor and organize the forthcoming excursion to Greece, as a gesture of reciprocity and sociability. The Greeks of America will bring to Greece, American ideas, friendship, and gold; and Greece will extend them its hospitality and motherly embrace. But the significance of the excursion has a deeper object, that is the closer cooperation of the Greeks of the two continents in religious and national affairs. The Greek Americans will celebrate Easter Sunday in Greece.</p>
