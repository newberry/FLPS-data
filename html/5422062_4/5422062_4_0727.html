   <p>Last Saturday two Greeks in the presence of many patrons of a West Side saloon shot it out for supremacy- in love.</p>
   <p>The two Greeks, Nicholas Chrysikos and John Malaganis, after paying tribute to Olympian God Dionysus, known to non-Greeks as Bacchus, began to quarrel about a girl whom they both love. And since love is for the living and not for the dead, both drew their pistols for supremacy self-persuration, and eventually for the girl's hand. John Malaganis beat the other Greek to a draw, and after wounding Nicholas, he succeeded in getting away before the authorities arrived. Nice business-discussing love affairs in a saloon and resorting to pistols for the love of a girl! Of course wine and women do somewhat preoccupy the imagination of Greeks; Bacchus and Venus, as blood-relations, tolerate and encourage things of that kind, but resorting to pistols is not a comedy, and if the wounded Greek dies, then the foolishness becomes tragedy. It is bad business to mix love with wine and serve it with pistols.</p>
