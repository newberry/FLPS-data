   <p>A new Greek hall has been opened at the intersection of Polk and Blue Island Avenues, above the drug store of Mr. Constantine Salopoulos. This spacious hall is the first large gathering place available to the Greeks for all kinds of social, cultural, and political affairs. It has been beautifully decorated, and it has been furnished with a handsome speaker's rostrum and several hundred comfortable seats.</p>
   <p>In the future, this hall may very probably become the hub of our social gatherings and the meeting place for businessmen, clergy, and laymen....</p>
   <p>Adjoining this attractive hall, there is a new restaurant which will be operated by Greeks. This will provide the public with easy access to meals and refreshments.</p>
