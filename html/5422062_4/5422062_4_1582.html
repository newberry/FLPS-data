   <p>Last Sunday, in spite of the rainy weather, the Ashland Auditorium was crowded by Greeks celebrating the Anniversary of Greek Independence. American and Greek flags beautified the great hall, and pictures of our heroes were conspicuously displayed.</p>
   <p>The Greek bishop of Chicago began the observance with a prayer, and many orators paid tribute to our national heroes who shed their blood for the freedom Greece enjoys today. Hon. G. Depastas, Consul General of Greece, delivered a profound speech holding the crowd spellbound. Owing to the progressive and pacific utterances of the Greek Diplomat, urging the Greeks of Chicago to take the lead in the march forward to peace and progress thus becoming an example for the Greeks of America, we are obliged to print his speech in full.</p>
   
   <p>Beloved fellow-Greeks:</p>
   <p>As a rule, on such an occasion as this orators transport us mentally to the sacred ground of Greece, depicting the glorious achievements of Hellenism, of which Greek history is loaded, and reminding us of our duty toward Greece and our progenitors.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, if war clouds were hovering over the Greek horizon, I would have painted my speech with warlike color, tending to electrify you with patriotism, and enthuse the youth to shed their blood for our religion and country.</p>
   <p>However today we are in peace. In Greece and everywhere, peace reigns. Peace the most beautiful and blessed happiness, the delight of men and nations.</p>
   
   <p>If men and nations, in war, have duties to perform with gun and bayonet, men and nations, in peace, have loftier duties to perform, and one of these duties is progress.</p>
   <p>If men, in wartime, leave family and property and march on under the flag of their country, with one object in mind, to defend the motherland, men, much more in peace time, ought to march on for the progress of their country. If it is patriotism to sacrifice life and property for the grandeur of one's country, it is just as much patriotism, in peace time, to suffer deprivation and sacrifice for the welfare and progress of one's country.</p>
   <p>A great example of this, is the United States of America, which is envied by all nations on earth. America, is the center of civilization, progress, education, science, art and everything that is good in the world.</p>
   
   <p>America, the democratic, has shed her blood for the perpetuation of democracy. America the great has fed and clothed the bleeding and starving nations of the world. American patriotism, American concord and American progressiveness, have made America the most prosperous and most glorious country on earth. America marches on, in war and peace. The forty eight states of the Union are one, whole and integral. No division -no emmity-but one undivided country-peace in every state.</p>
   <p>Peace also reigns in our beautiful Greece today. Political factions and enmity are gone and the country is again united as one integral whole. Everybody puts his shoulders to the wheel of progress and strives to march on notwithstanding sacrifice and privation. The heroes of war are now heroes of peace. The brave warrior is now a courageous citizen, fighting for progress. Bravo, to brother-Greeks on the other side of the waters.</p>
   
   <p>And now our turn has come, Greeks of America. If we have had holy obligations to Greece, while she was fighting for existence, we have far more obligations today, when Greece is fighting for progress. And as official representative of Greece, I feel that it is my imperative duty, at the celebration of Greek Independence, to remind you of these obligations.</p>
   <p>I have had a burning desire to see, at our anniversary today, the flag of harmony and concord, bedecking the hall of celebration. I have had the hope that the Greek communities of Chicago with one voice would sing the hymn of union and peace, that our one national shrine would be one for all; I was hoping that our obligation and our love for Greece would not recognize any division and faction, but in unison that we would kneel down at the national temple and pay tribute to our heroes who shed their blood that Greece may be free.</p>
   
   <p>Where is that unity and peace? What seems to be the matter of division? What are we lacking? Concord-Harmony.- I am reminding you of our obligation to Greece. Where is our sacrifices in days of peace as I said before? Where is our patriotism in time of peace? It is an undisputable fact that the Greeks of America are industrious, honest, and law abiding citizens. Nobody can refute this. But we have not reached the height of social evolution, where one overlooks egotism and pseudo-sentimentality and extends the hand of amicability to his fellowman.</p>
   <p>Our obligation to Greece, calls for concord, harmony and friendship. Greece, in her struggle for progress, needs the undivided friendship and cooperation of all the Greeks of America. Our love of Greece cannot and would not recognize divisions and factions. This love, which is our obligation to Greece, calls everybody to arms, and the Chicago Greeks are requested to take the lead and restore unity and harmony among the Greeks of America.</p>
   
   <p>We can do it right now, and right here in this hall of celebration, by telling the Greeks of America that we are first to extend the hand of friendship amongst ourselves and ask our brother-Greeks in other cities to follow us. Our example will show that our celebration today is not only in euphimistic words but in actual deeds also.</p>
   <p>A call to arms- the memory of our ancestors and heroes is our guide-the love of Greece is our pass-word-concord and harmony is our victory.</p>
   <p>America, the glorious, saved Greece and the world in days gone by, America, loved and loves Greece today, and the Greeks of America are reminded of their obligation to Greece and America that love and peace are the fundamental principles of good citizenship. The Chicago Greeks in calling everybody to arms in unison must say Long Live America, Long Live Greece, Long Live Chicago's Greek Community.</p>
