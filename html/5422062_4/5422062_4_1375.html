   <p>Last Friday, at 75 Randolph St., there gathered a group of people to establish a Panhellenic Union in Chicago. There were seventeen men present including the Greek Consul, Mr. N. Salopoulos. There never was a more comical gathering in the city of Chicago. The leading actors were Athanasis Argyroff and James Manousopoulos. These two held a nice, long discussion before a bored audience.</p>
   <p>Half of the seventeen men present insisted that election of officers be held immediately while the other half insisted that new members should be first.</p>
   <p>In other words, this attempt at establishing a national organization will go the way of all other attempts. Petty bickering and quarreling is once again proving an obstacle to the Greeks.</p>
   
   <p>Because the Greek Consul suddenly remembered a business engagement elsewhere, the meeting was adjourned and a new one was arranged for Sunday, Dec. 11, at 2 o'clock. A Panhellenic Union would have been a very good thing if the Greeks had figured out the thing properly. We are afraid it will die a natural death as the others did before it. The Greeks really need a Pan Hellenic Union, so let us cooperate with one another.</p>
