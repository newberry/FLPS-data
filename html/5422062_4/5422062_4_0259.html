   <p>The Rev. Zografos, Pastor of St. Basil church, visited the tubercular institution of Oak Forest where twenty Christians of the Orthodox religion are patients, and administered communion. Fourteen women representing almost all the parishes in Chicago, accompanied the Pastor, These women distributed presents and gave financial aid to the stricken.</p>
   <p>Such acts are to be commended. The Rev. Zografus and the Greek women have done a divine service. The tubercular patients and all the Greeks of Chicago are very thankful for the Christian deed. It does not matter whether the majority of the patients are not Greeks. The act was a Christian one and we urge all the Greek societies to budget a certain sum of money for such purposes.</p>
