   <p>p. 1. Following with great interest the progressive activities in education, religion, and anything that pertains to our Greek population in Chicago, it is with chagrin, that we must say, this newspaper reveals the Greek language is not frequently spoken among the Greeks.</p>
   <p>Not only the new generation is disinclined to use the language, but old timers also have refrained from using their knowledge of the Greek tongue. We are not attempting to reprimand the abstainers because they do not use the Greek tongue, we only remind them of the beauty, versatility, richness, euphony, and philological greatness of the Greek language.</p>
   <p>Many of the most illustrious American educators say, "No man is really educated unless he studies Greek." All over the world men who have attained intellectual excellence, are equipped with a knowledge of the Greek language. Philosophy, science, religion, drama, poetry, and the fine arts, etc., cannot achieve the object of their being, without the Greek language.</p>
   
   <p>These are only a few reminders, of the grandeur, prominence, and potentialities of the Greek tongue.</p>
   <p>The inexplicable divine writing of John the Evangelist, "En Arheen o logos, kai o logos, een pros ton theon" (In the beginning was the Word, etc.), could not, and would not, have been written in any other language but the Greek language. The infinite and divine revelations could not have been uttered in any other language and maintained their greatness and profoundity of thought. Paul, the most cultured and educated Apostle, did not reveal the omnipotence of God in any language but the queen of all--the Greek language.</p>
   <p>Time and space would not permit me to go further and mention innumerable eulogies of the Greek tongue, so I must turn to our local topic which is, "The Greek Language in Chicago."</p>
   <p>Until recently, it might have been an excuse for our new generation, that, because of the scarcity of Greek schools, it was not using the Greek tongue, but now, thanks to the wisdom of our Church, wherever there is a church there is a Greek school also, to teach our youngsters, in addition to the language of our adopted country, the Greek language and its use.</p>
   
   <p>The Society of Greek Professional Men, the Greek students attending Colleges and Universities, and the initiative of our Ecclesiasts, are to be praised for their valuable services towards that end. They are the pillars upon which the whole structure of the perpetuation of our tongue rests. Not only in private life, but also in public, they use the Greek tongue.</p>
   <p>The Greek students, born and raised in this country, never failed to use the Greek tongue in meetings, forums, at dances, etc. They made it known that besides the English language they also spoke the language of their immortal ancestors.</p>
   <p>This good example must be followed by every Greek, the world over.</p>
