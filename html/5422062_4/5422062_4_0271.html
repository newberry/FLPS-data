   <p>The eight chapters of Ahepa are organizing a dance, for the benefit of the poor, to be given at Trianon Ballroom on Nov. 18th.</p>
   <p>Over 500 tickets have already been sold and from the feverish preparations of the eight Chicago Chapters, we assume that the affair will be a success. The Greeks of Chicago and suburbs are requested to attend the dance, because every penny of the proceeds goes to help needy Greeks of Chicago. Buy your tickets early. It is a philanthropic affair.</p>
