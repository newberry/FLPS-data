   <p>The first unit of the city-wide Carnival of Nations organization of Greek-Americans charged into action yesterday when the members of St. Andrew's Women's Club met at St. Andrew's Greek Orthodox Church, 5658 Winthrop Avenue, loaded their handbags and coat pockets with tickets for the Greek program, which will be held Nov. 30th; posed for a photograph, hurriedly partook of light refreshments, then dashed out into the rain and began selling them.</p>
   <p>Paul Demos, chairman of the Greek committee of the Carnival of Nations, viewed their enthusiasm with a graceful and approving eye. "Let's see", he said, "twenty women in this club, each of whom will sell 500 tickets - twenty times 500 is 10,000. Well, it looks as if the whole city will be on hand to see our show."</p>
   <p>"This is a fine beginning, and other organizations of Greek-Americans will start selling tickets this week. The program will be given at the Aragon ballroom, Broadway and Lawrence Avenue, just as it was last year, and in general it will follow along the lines of last year's show. But it will be bigger and better and more magnificent this year, and I look forward confidently to raising a huge sum for the relief of citizens of Greek origin who are in want."</p>
