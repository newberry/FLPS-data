   <p>After all, Father Golemis presented us with his plan for public discussion and to satisfy the ardent desire of "Antilogos" of the Chicago Greek Daily. The plan of Father Golemis is one by which the United Community should govern itself as if the fact were already accomplished. It is sad, indeed, to have a discussion carried on in such a way that it underestimates the intelligence of the readers, and, besides, shows lack of good faith.</p>
   <p>How are we to account for the replies of Father Golemis to our clear questions that left no room for a misunderstanding, and which we have placed before him since the beginning? Fortunately, we have these questions in written form, which he could read and answer accordingly, and which we have put up again, not only for him but also for the readers, to see if he did answer us.</p>
   <p>To assist Father Golemis in answering, we ask him: Which is the power that will compell the communites to unite into one?</p>
   
   <p>We are awaiting that great plan of Father Golemis. We are not expecting him to simply tell us that the United Community will be governed by a council of twenty-five members, and that all our nationals will be obligated to become members, and, in general, about the manner in which the United Community will govern itself.</p>
   <p>How will the plan be realized, and how will the existing communities be compelled to unite into one, and how will the execution of the plan start?</p>
   <p>He answers exhaustively that the word Union explains everything in itself, but does he seriously believe that all those who talk about union have the same conception of it?</p>
   <p>In the first place, the Community of the Annunciation wants the union with the aim in view of closing St. George, and they know well what they are talking about and looking for, because they are practical people and not sentimentalists. Does Father Golemis have the same conception in supporting the unification?</p>
   
   <p>The parishioners of St. Constantine want the union, having in mind the closing of St. Nickolas. Those of St. Andrews have in mind the closing of St. James, and all who are talking about the union are looking toward the limiting of the number of churches.</p>
   <p>"Where does your union stand, Father Golemis, with the idea of preserving all the churches?"</p>
   <p>As a matter of principle, we are not against the union, not of the unrealized union. We firmly believe in a union of parishes, namely, between Holy Trinity and St. Basil, which would have been an accomplished fact had Mr. Athenagoras been consistent in his original decisions, as well as in the suggestions of Mr. Kallistos, and others....</p>
   <p>We believe in the possibility of a union between St. George and Annunciation.</p>
   <p>The thing that we must support is the understanding and cooperation of all communities of Chicago upon our common matters, and Father Golemis knows from the past, the benefits of such cooperation. He knows how we worked and how we are still working for that cooperation, through the Central Committee of the Communities of Chicago, because if there is even a remote hope for the union, this will come about from within, i.e., from the initiative of the communities themselves, and not from without by thoughtless and groundless opinions, that amount to thin air, inasmuch, as the ones proposing them have not the power to put them into effect.</p>
   <p>I congratulate all Greeks who discuss and take an interest in our communal matters, but at the same time, I recommend that they take an active part by becoming members for then they will have an opportunity to suggest real things and not Utopian dreams.</p>
