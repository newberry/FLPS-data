   <p>The 25th of March was splendidly celebrated this year and with much greater zest than usual but individually by individual parishes. Each parish celebrated with religious ceremonies by the church and patriotic ceremonies by the school, with songs and recitations by the children. Gapa and Ahepa celebrated in the same building, the Capitol, in the same hall, and on the same day, but at different hours, and this was because we have not the right authority or power to call together the Greeks of the various societies in one hall where we could all celebrate together as in the past.</p>
   <p>In any case, even though separated, we celebrated splendidly, and we appreciated it better than at other times, thanks to the patriotic associations Ahepa and Gapa, which we hope will some day in the near future celebrate together.</p>
   <p>Gapa began at 3 P.M. with the national anthem and presented a program for the most part in Greek. The exception was pro-Greek James Hamilton Lewis, who spoke at <span class="page-break">\2</span>length and with much enthusiasm about Greece and the Greeks. Dr. Melidones was the speaker of the day, who dwelt upon the meaning of the feast and introduced the Consul........</p>
   <p>(The rest of the program follows in some detail and also the celebration later on by the Association Ahepa--Translater.)</p>
