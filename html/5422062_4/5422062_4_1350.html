   <p>Never before has the Greek community seen such an affair as was given by the Greek Women's Club last Sunday in the Louis XIV Room of the Sherman Hotel. Everything lovely and well chosen that the Greek community of Chicago had to offer, such as beauty, dignity, professional, scientific, artistic business, and, in general, all branches of learning and trade, were present at this dance. I honestly believe that it was the sacred purpose of this dance to attract such a fine group of people.</p>
   <p>I approached Consul [Constantine] Xanthopoulos and asked him for his opinion of the dance. He answered, "I am very happy because I see our people advancing rapidly in the sciences and professions, and I am proud to be able to represent the Greeks of Chicago."</p>

   <p>Again I spoke and said, "Your Excellency, Mr. Xanthopoulos, what shall I write in the Saloniki, about the work of the Women's Club?"</p>
   <p>He answered, "Write the naked truth, just as you see and understand it. I personally am enthusiastic about this affair, and am certain that the ladies will not cease their efforts to help their enslaved brothers in Greece."</p>
   <p>I want to close this garbled account of my impressions of the dance by saying that the Women's Club should become a permanent institution. I venture to say that it will be an uplifting and inspirational influence upon all other organizations, because of the zeal and earnestness of its members.</p>
   <p>If the Women's Club does not fulfill my prediction, I will wear humbly the robes of shame.</p>
