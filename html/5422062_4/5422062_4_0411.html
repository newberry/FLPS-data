   <p>Prompted by the agony caused by recent events in Asia Minor, the Greek people of Chicago, en masse, attended a huge massmeeting at Orchestra Hall last Friday, which was organized by the ways and means committee for the relief of the victims in the Near East. Many American officials were present representing the clergy and the people. A great number of Armenians were also present.</p>
   <p>All the speakers vehemently condemned the unspeakable atrocities of the Turks, as well as the inhuman French policy. The emotional reaction of the audience, which had early filled the hall, was spontaneous when Mr. Willis Beard, of the Near East Relief Commission, was speaking. He took an active part in transporting and hospitalizing those Greek refugees who had escaped the sword of the bloodthirsty Turks.</p>

   <p>A statement was immediately formulated having been accepted by all present. Its contents follow:</p>
   <p>"Because the tragedy at Smyrna has aroused the entire civilized world, regardless of religious affiliation, a unanimous vote of protest is lodged against the unbridled massacre of women and children, and the rape of girls by the Turks, as well as against the butchery of the innocent who were unable to bear arms [in self-defence]. We ask that proper and immediate measures be taken for the protection and provision of the suffering thousands, whose eyes are turned principally to America in supplication. We ask that the Near East Relief Foundation be authorized to devote all its efforts to help the distressed. We wish to express our heartfelt appreciation to the U. S. government for its humanitarian sentiments and efforts, and for the measures it has taken to protect the refugees. We urgently request that the government undertake to protect, especially, women and children in the Near East, and put an end, once and for all, <span class="page-break">\3</span>to the barbarous actions of Turkey."</p>
   <p>The Greek speakers were the Rev. Hadzi Dinlitriou and the attorney, Mr. G. Kypiacopoulos. They spoke of the effects of European diplomacy on Turkish atrocities.</p>
   <p>A collection was taken at the conclusion of the speeches amounting to a little over $10,000. A list of the contributors of large sums follows:</p>
