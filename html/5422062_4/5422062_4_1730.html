   <p>Last Wednesday, at the celebration of the Greek Orthodox holiday of the Assumption of Our Lady, a magnificent religious ceremony took place at the North Side Saint Andrew's Church.</p>
   <p>His Grace, the Metropolitan of Seleucia, officiated. The congregation of the North Side Greek parish was very happy to have this distinguished representative of the highest Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical hierarchy in their midst. The church was filled to capacity during High Mass, which His Grace chanted so melodiously. At the end of the service he sang the Greek and American national anthems; the congregation was profoundly impressed by the majesty, resonance, and beauty of his voice.</p>
