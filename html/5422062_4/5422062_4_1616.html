   <p>"Alexander Papanastasiou, Premier of Greece, Athens, Greece:</p>
   <p>"The Greek community of Chicago has held a great Greek-American demonstration to celebrate the restoration of democracy in Greece. The Honorable John H. Wigmore, dean of the Law School of Northwestern University, presided, and addresses were made by James Hamilton Lewis, former United States senator, by Rufus Dawes, distinguished financier, and by several Greek speakers.</p>
   <p>"The community expresses its deep gratitude to its Grecian brethren, who by their vote in favor of the Republic have increased the prestige of the Greek race and have socially and commercially strengthened Hellenism abroad, especially that of the United States of America, which is devoted to democracy.</p>
   <p>"The community sends assurance of its satisfaction and confidence in the Government of Premier Papanastasiou for its generous and conciliatory internal policies and professes its admiration for those patriots of the Royalist Party who by their courage, loyalty, and sane regard for the peace and tranquility of our country have acknowledged and submitted to the will of the people.</p>
