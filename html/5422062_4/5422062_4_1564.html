   <p>Last Sunday all churches held special mass for our national holiday. Although our programs were not quite as elaborate as those of New York, every church was crowded with enthusiastic, joyous people.</p>
   <p>The Pullman chapter of Ahepa held a grand entertainment to which all Greeks in Pullman were invited. There were many speakers and the children of the school recited songs and plays.</p>
   <p>John Zappas, the president of Saint Spiridon, the Pullman church began the program by introducing the chairman of the day, Mr. John Margarin. The first speaker was E. Pofantis, president of the Pullman Ahepa chapter. He spoke of the work Ahepa is doing to preserve our racial identity. He was heartily applauded. He was followed by the Supreme Governor, S. Rekas. Then came Mr. James Michalopoulos, lawyer, and George Papakolopoulos. The last speaker was the teacher of the Pullman school, Miss Nikta. The entire Pullman community is to be congratulated for this splendid holiday.</p>
