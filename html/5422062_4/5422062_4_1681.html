   <p>p. 1.- Our progressive Young Men's Club has decided to fully equip two regiments with weapons and uniforms for the Greek Independence Day, March 25. They have been asking for contributions for this cause. So far, they have gathered $602 from prominent Greeks. $55 has already been spent, so this leaves $547. The campaign is still on and everybody is urged to contribute as much as possible.</p>
