   <p>P.3--The progressive Pan-Hellenic Society, always ready to aid the cause of Hellenism, resolved at its last meeting to hold a frolic on July 29 at Petersen Park.</p>
   <p>Thirteen hundred tickets were bought immediately by those present at the meeting. From all indications four or five thousand people will attend the picnic.</p>
   <p>The Society's executive committee indirectly let it be understood that the affair will be given for the benefit of the newly-established church.</p>
   <p>Anyhow, the Pan-Hellenic always does things right and always attracts the community to its beneficent affairs, and undoubtedly the forthcoming event will be crowned with the usual splendid success.</p>
   <p>Members and non-members who intend to be present are requested to invite their American friends and their families to attend the frolic, which to judge by the activity of those who are preparing for it will be unique in the history of picnics.</p>
