   <p>Dear Comrade: Unknown, yet possibly one of our very own Brothers, on behalf of the Order of Ahepa we have the great honor of presenting to you and, through your cherished memory, to all you stood and fell for, this Bronze Memorial, token of our deep appreciation of your noble life and deeds.</p>
   <p>Representing as we do on this solemn occasion the American Hellenic Progressive Association, whose 30,000 members in 300 chapters are located in every state of the Union, we have brought this token to our final resting place and reverently lay it at your feet in the name,not alone of the Order of Ahepa, but also in the name of 65,000 men of Greek origin who served in the American Military and Naval forces during the World War, many of them sacrificing their lives, as you did, for the cause of Democracy and the perpetuation of those high ideals of Government and citizenship for which the United States of America long has stood before the world.</p>
   
   <p>In you, and in your noble sacrifice, Ahepa takes that same pride with each organization that has come here to you. We, of the American Hellenic Progressive Association, somehow wish to feel that as an American citizen of Greek origin you sprang to the defense of your adopted country because, like those of us who here honor you on this Memorial Day, you sought to be a living manifestation of loyalty to the United States, of allegiance to its flag, of support for its Constitution, of obedience to its laws, and of reverence for its history and traditions.</p>
   <p>Your noble thoughts and deeds instilled in us a due appreciation of the privilege of citizenship, and of the sacred duties attendant therewith. By precept and example you encouraged us to become profoundly interested, and to actively participate in the political, civic, social and commercial fields of human endeavor, always to strive for the betterment of society, always to respect the inalienable rights of mankind.</p>
   
   <p>You re-awakened in us an abhorence of all political corruption - that destroyer of free institutions - and the wish to do our utmost to stamp out from the country every trace and influence of that evil.</p>
   <p>By your noble sacrifice you pointed out to us that tyranny is truly a menace to the life, property, prosperity, honor and integrity of every nation. Your untimely passing warned us that certainly the preservation of our liberties could be assured only in this country because it is the champion of liberty for all oppressed and down-trodden peoples.</p>
   <p>Dear Brother - and why, for these reasons, should we not call you Brother? Feeling also, as it is our great privilege, that you may have been one of the 500,000 Hellenic peoples, as now, in the United States - you have helped immeasurably in advancing, as we of Ahepa seek to promote, especially in the United States, a better and more comprehensive understanding, not only of America and its nationals, but of the Hellenic peoples and their nation, and to revive, cultivate, enrich and marshal into active service for humanity the noblest attributes and highest ideals of true Hellenism.</p>
   <p>We salute you, comrade and brother! May we, and all Americans, never forget the great lesson you sought to teach, in your own unselfish sacrificing way !</p>
