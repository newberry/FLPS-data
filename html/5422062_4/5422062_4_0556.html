   <p>Honorable sir:</p>
   <p>In addition to my previous check for $185 mailed to you January 2, 1909, I enclose herewith another one for $215, which was collected through the contribution of the Greeks, and thus the total amount of the Greek Star so far has reached up to $400.</p>
   <p>The contribution is to be continued, and I hope there will be more money collected for the benefit of our suffering brothers, the Italians.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Kindly accept the enclosed check as a token of the sympathy of the Greeks of Chicago. I beg to remain</p>
   <p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros</p>
