   <p>Without doubt the Hellenism of America is finding itself in the third and most important stage of its development. We shall not discuss the first stage, but shall start with the second which begins with the molding of the raw materials of this migrated Hellenism. At that time foundations for the future were being laid because they [the Greek immigrants] no longer planned to return to Greece as soon as enough money had been amassed. Deeply imbedded roots had been planted in the welcoming soil of this marvelous country. Social and economic organizations began to flourish for the Greek was now a Greek-American. To summarize, we can say that the second period of Greek development and orientation was marked by the rapid growth of clubs and societies; the seeking of citizenship--for the Greeks wanted political voice; devotion to economic progress; Greek domination of certain types of enterprise; and the institution of an educational program for the <span class="page-break">2</span>young generation.</p>
   <p>Parallel with this however, and even more rapid, was the simultaneous development of America. The rapid progress of the nation quickly outdistanced that of the Greeks who were in no way prepared for such a race. As a result we saw them beginning many projects, only to leave them before their completion. We saw them making attempts at organization and becoming discouraged at the lack of results. We saw them drinking deeply of the cup of bitterness and disappointment. Then they began to realize that their suffering was due to their lack of knowledge, to their ignorance, to their backwardness. So, for the first time after they came to America, the Greeks seriously felt their shortcomings and deficiencies.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of organizations and societies and ill-considered disbursements tortured their efforts and made their struggle heartbreaking. As soon as the purpose and scope of an organization was decided upon and a constitution drawn up, the organization would either collapse through poor leadership or <span class="page-break">3</span>would attempt the impossible, and finally become bankrupt and neglected. There were few worth-while undertakings, and still fewer capable leaders who seemed able to direct the group. Those who did try were martyred through constant failures.</p>
   <p>At the time when their progress in the American world was beginning to fail because of their own failings, some other obstacles were actually created by the people of America, who had an antipathy for dark, uneducated foreigners. Greeks were boycotted and persecuted, called "Dirty Greeks," and run out of small towns. This deliberate persecution brought about the birth of a Greek organization called the Ahepa [American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association].</p>
   <p>This organization adopted Americanism and fought to break down and conquer the prejudice that so hindered the progress of the Greeks in America. It strove to clear the path for the successful progress of the Hellenism of this land. The Ahepa became a living symbol, both to the Greeks and the <span class="page-break">4</span>Americans. As time passed it became apparent that the objectives of the Ahepa were being realized. The last stubborn resistance was overcome by the honesty, kindness, and sincerity of the Greeks. The American people began to regard the owner of the Greek restaurant in his neighborhood and his Greek fruit peddler as respected friends. The Greeks won a place for themselves among the Americans, and their biggest aid toward this end was the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association. Released from their bonds, the Greeks of America took courage and faced the future with hope and determination to succeed.</p>
   <p>The inspired group which founded the Ahepa enjoyed at once a few special happy events which resulted from their victory; but before the Ahepa could reap many of its harvests a kindred organization was formed. The Gapa, as it is called, took advantage of the basic work done by the Ahepa, and so did not have to fight for Greek rights or recognition. It rapidly developed because of its rich inheritance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Anyone who considers the entire accomplishment of the Ahepa until today, and speaks sincerely is forced to praise its uncounted and uncountable benefits. Among these benefits are moral and cultural gains; elevation of the living standards of the Greek people to a level of harmony with their American surroundings; increased rate of assimilation; support of Greek churches and schools; giving of scholarships; aid to the motherland at critical times; starting educational excursions to Greece which benefit all concerned; and other things too numerous to mention. But, on the other hand, for the natural well-being of the organization and the Hellenism of America, we must not overlook the fact that our organization has tended to lose the initiative which sprang from the spiritual strength of its roots , and which is so necessary to its continued successful progress. For, without magnifying small difficulties, we notice a certain amount of perplexity at the moment Hellenism enters upon its most trying period.</p>
   <p>I write these things, hoping to offend none of the members of Ahepa. My only desire is to remove the veil which covers their eyes, permitting them <span class="page-break">6</span>to look only sideways and backwards, and thus enable them to look into the future. Therefore, this is what I think about the future of the Ahepa.</p>
   <p>I firmly believe that the Ahepa should become more strongly united with the Hellenism of all America.</p>
   <p>She should be in more brotherly accord, not only with the Gapa, but with all other Greek organizations in America. This would help to reduce the far-too-numerous and overlapping Greek clubs and societies.....</p>
   <p>For practical reasons this is very desirable. One great powerful Greek-American organization would be far better qualified to serve the needs and interests of the Greeks than hundreds of small, constantly quarreling clubs.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Such a coalition would result in many financial gains; for profits would increase and expenses greatly lessen. Valuable time would be saved that is today devoted to experiments and failures, due to the ignorance or inexperience of group leaders.....Present organizations do not even know what to do to serve the American Hellenic element.</p>
   <p>The Ahepa, in her fifteenth year of service and success, feels qualified to realize the needs of our people.</p>
   <p>At this moment Ahepa must not rest content with her success and should not overlook the influence she and other organizations such as the Gapa posses.</p>
   <p>She must raise another marker of her progress by doing something that shall, more than anything else, help our people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Let this large convention think seriously of extending a friendly hand towards its sister, the Gapa, and all the other Greek societies.....</p>
   <p>Let us press forward--even to the extent of personal sacrifice--toward a great and influential Greek-American organization.</p>
