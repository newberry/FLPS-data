   <p>Dr. Gavaris as Master of Ceremonies introduced the speakers of the event, Messrs. Triantafilakos, Sotiracopoulos and Dr. Asteriadis.</p>
   <p>The Greek magician, K. Economou, with great dexterity performed many tricks of his profession, to the amazement of the diners, who on one occassion, held their watches tight lest they disappear from their pockets.</p>
   <p>Miss Maria Shiountris, in a very sweet voice and in pure Greek, sang two songs which enchanted and enthused the diners. When she sang "To Paraponon Tis Poulias," the melody presented a portrayal of the magic shores of the Bosporus.</p>
