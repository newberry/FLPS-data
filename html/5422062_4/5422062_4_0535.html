   <p>The Greek Star is pleased to inform the public that thus far the sum of $5,637.30 has been collected in the Chicago area and throughout the state of Illinois by Mr. Spiros Matsoukas, the inspired apostle and patriotic missionary from our homeland. He has just arrived as a special emissary of the Greek government to arouse the interest of the Greek people of America in the regeneration and rehabilitation of our country.</p>
   <p>Comparatively, the Greeks of Chicago have not contributed as much as they ought to.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that they will do so. We are not accustomed to occupy the last place on the last of contributors.</p>
