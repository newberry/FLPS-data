   <p>The friend of the poor Greek ladies society St. Basil will hold its annual Picnic, on July 7th, at the romantic place, Frank Prosser Grove. A variety of eatables, two bands, and Greek and European dances, will make the event worthwhile for the fifty cent admission.</p>
   <p>The profits of the Picnic will be given to needy fellow Greeks who are ill in various hospitals. The Greek ladies society St. Basil does not require color and pencil to make its philanthropic activities known, for the deeds of the soceity speak for themselves. Buy your tickets early. Our needy Greeks who receive hospitalization need presents and assistance. Come and enjoy the day.</p>
