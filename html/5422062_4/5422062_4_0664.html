   <p>Morris Limpemas, a notorious counterfeiter and forger of bad checks, attempted to cash a forged bank check at the confectionery store of our prominent countryman, Stylianos Georgakakis, 1551 West 13th Street. He was arrested and sentenced to fourteen years in the penitentiary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Georgakakis was warmly congratulated by the chief of police for discovering this dangerous forger, who will now learn a good lesson. It is well for other Greek businessmen to be careful about cashing doubtful checks. Saloniki congratulates Mr. Georgakakis for reporting this criminal to the police in time.</p>
