   <p>In a recent article it was stated that there would be no public expose of all the factors active in keeping our community divided. It is, however, impossible to refrain from revealing--because of their great size--various stumbling blocks which have been purposely placed in the path of our progress and unity.</p>
   <p>The careful observer has, no doubt, noticed that a person is not allowed to take part in church board elections, or have any voice in the proceedings unless he has been a registered member of the church for sixty days before the election period.</p>
   <p>Here, therefore, is one of the stumbling blocks which keeps the majority of Greeks off of the register, far from their church, and which confines the benefits of the church to a limited circle. This makes the unification of our churches problematic, if not actually impossible. Any one who carefully analyzes this clause in the church constitution will be in a position to answer the complaints and questions of our clerical leaders. He will be able to say why the people do not attend church regularly, why they do not have sufficient respect for the priests, and why they carelessly drop their nickel into the plate without giving a thought to the progress and welfare of the church.</p>
   <p>We know that the people have been misled and fooled in the past and that they are, even now, being fooled. Though we do seek to sell him tickets for every conceivable type of benefit, though we pass trays for all sorts of "causes," the victim of all this "shaking down" is never asked about his membership and never reminded of that election clause. His money is welcome, but not his candidacy for a place on his church board.</p>
   <p>When election day comes around and the cards are ready to be shuffled among the same players, then the inspection committee starts weeding out everyone who does not belong in the charmed circle on one pretext or another.</p>
   <p>What a tragic situation! We unfortunate Greeks are, seemingly, intent upon remaining ignorant, gullible immigrants. We blindly contribute ninety per cent of all the funds in the church treasuries, while the few who contribute but ten per cent hold the reins. They hire and fire priests and teachers; they buy and sell the buildings of the very churches they run without consulting anyone except themselves.</p>
   <p>Under such conditions unification is, of course, undesirable because it would basically change and uproot the customary system. It would put all the cliques to flight and replace them with a central committee which would formulate a general constitution for all the Greek churches of Chicago. This constitution would completely and identically govern all church activities. Such a change will be rather difficult to effect, but will be by no means impossible if we remember a little of our patriotic and religious duty and quickly amend our lack of progress.</p>
   <p>The older Greeks of Chicago, who have watched the development of our community with great interest, and who desire to analyze the situation from a sensible point of view, will agree with me if I call our situation an "ecclesiastical Verdun" [site of famous battle].</p>
   <p>Thousands of dollars were thrown into the struggle only to be lost because the opposition was so well armed and so well supported by a paid group who did not fight for any other reason than to keep alive the source of their payments. That is what the contemporary history of the Chicago Greeks reveals, and our economic wrecks called "parishes" bear mute testimony to the truth of our statements.</p>
   <p>Only an honest appraisement of the disgraceful past and a brave effort on our part now, is necessary for the achievement of that long-sought unity which will enable the fulfillment of many great social religious dreams. To do all this the confidence of the mass of the people must be regained--for it was lost long ago. We must also overcome our ecclesiastical Verdun, which has as its motto "Ils ne passeront pas," or, "They shall not pass." We can render it harmless by amending the election clauses which confine the candidacies to a selected few, making it possible for every Greek Orthodox to cast his vote or run for office....Then, the people who attend any Greek church on the day of election will have an equal voice in choosing their leaders, along with the privilege of putting money into the collection plates. As a result, new leaders of ability and foresight will appear. Because they have been elected by all the people they will feel a great social obligation which they will repay through social accomplishments and progressive activities.</p>
   <p>It would be very desirable if all the Greeks would join the churches and thus destroy the setup of certain unworthy church leaders. It seems to be impossible, however. We should, nevertheless, know or learn it soon, that the Hellene is a peculiar being. He should be carefully studied by social and ecclesiastical leaders. No matter how odd or blunt a Greek may be he has very tender feelings for his race and his church. A good psychologist could cultivate these qualities and reap benefits from them for the church and the community.....</p>
   <p>If those persons who are mixed up in the affairs of our churches knew anything at all about ecclesiastical history, they would know that the Christian faith is founded upon democratic precepts--if not radical ones. At least, the books of the Apostles give that impression. And, if they had had a realization of their moral duties and their obligation toward their God, they would have tried to adapt the governing system of the churches to the spirit of co-operation and centralization which predominates in America.</p>
   <p>As long as we stubbornly retain our antiquated methods and trends and govern our parishes by such an anti-Christian oligarchic system nothing can save us. If Christ, himself, were to come to earth and present us with the Greek-American community of Chicago, put the four Patriarchs of our Church and St. Chrysostom at its head in the Archbishop's chair--without changing the attitude of the Greek people toward their church--then Christ could be certain that such a unification would never be achieved, and that the Arch-bishop's throne in America would be a Golgotha for its occupant.</p>
   <p>The community is awaiting the decision of its parish leaders. If they accept the suggestion that the Chicago parishes be unified into one community, we shall all give our help with all the love we have for our church and race. If, however, the matter is dropped, or postponed as unimportant, then we shall turn on our other sides and continue to slumber for another thirty-five years, with the hope that at the end of our sleep a Second Coming and the Resurrection of the Dead will take place. Perhaps, when all the other dead shall arise we may, too; because, no matter how much we may look alive, we shall be dead as far as parish matters are concerned. In fact, we shall be even more dead than the real corpses.</p>
