   <p>The Greeks of Chicago were represented at the Panhellenic Congress in Washington by one American and four Greeks. They were the philhellene, Henry Reilly; Paul Demos, who represented the American Association of the Greek Community of Chicago; Reverend Constantine Hadzidimitriou and Mr. E. Dantelis, in behalf of the "Forty Churches", and Mr. K. Valioulis, in behalf of the Thracian Society.</p>
   <p>All the representatives, both Greek and American, did their work so enthusiastically and so courageously that Greece might well be proud of her children; she may also be proud of her American friends. Chicago, also has a right to be proud because she was second to no other community in the success of her fine representatives.</p>
   <p>The Thracians, Mr. Dantelis and Mr. Valioulis, aided by Mr. Reilly, visited certain legislators of Illinois, and gave valuable information about Thrace to some Congressional Committees. Mr. Reilly left no stone unturned and brought the matter of Thrace before every group and individual that he could contact.</p>

   <p>In a conversation with a general of the American army, Mr. Demos was asked, "Have you a personal interest in Greece?"</p>
   <p>"I have no hope of personal gain," answered Mr. Demos, "I am merely a representative of the Greeks of Chicago. I am one of those who fought for the democracy and freedom of the smaller nations. Since Greece has not yet acquired her freedom, I have come here to add my efforts toward obtaining it."</p>
   <p>The day will come when Greece will express personal thanks to Mr. Demos for his patriotic services. He succeeded in obtaining sympathy for the Greek cause at a time when it was most needed....</p>
   <p>Father Hadzidimitriou, by his eloquent words and sincere pleadings, succeeded in swaying many influential people to the side of the Greek cause.</p>
