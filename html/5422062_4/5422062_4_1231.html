   <p>Hundreds of people who were present at the Gapa celebration stayed at the Masonic Temple to hear the Ahepa program which started a little after 8:00 P.M. George N. Spannon was chairman. Christ Tsoulus, a Sons of Pericles member, recited a long poem. He was followed by speakers A. Pantelis lawyer, and B. Belogiannis, of the Sons of Pericles. Mr. S. Beratoros' orchestra played a few selections and little L. Nikoletsea again recited. Mr. Jacobides of the National Greek Troupe emphasized the necessity of supporting our theater. Andrew Vlachos was the last speaker. Nick Varzos closed the program by playing the Greek and American national anthems.</p>
   <p>Many who were tired from the days' excitement left for home, as it was ten o'clock. The rest of the thousands present gathered in the ballroom where they danced to Nick Varzos' orchestra and enjoyed themselves immensely.</p>
