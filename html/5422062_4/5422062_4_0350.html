   <p>Fellow-Greeks! My brother, John G. Kyriakides, has been sent to prison for life in West Virginia. He was convicted a year ago for murder, though his act was really one of self-defense. His conviction was due to lack of proper defense by his lawyer in court.</p>
   <p>My brother's conviction is considered unjust, and prominent lawyers promise his liberation. But a sum of money is required, which we are unable to produce, and for this reason we are appealing to our fellow-Greeks of the various communities, who are willingly making financial contributions.</p>
   <p>I appeal herewith to the compassionate sentiments of the Greeks of Chicago. I have the certifications of many Greek communities, to verify my assertions, as well as that of Bishop Philaretos, in which they recommend me as the only one authorized to appeal for aid to the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Const. G. Kyriakides.</p>
