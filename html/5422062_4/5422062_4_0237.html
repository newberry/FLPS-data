   <p>A dinner was served in the hall of St. Constantine Church, South Chicago, to the Greek orphans of the Chicago Orphan Asylum, by the Society of the Greek Girls of the South Side.</p>
   <p>The charming young ladies did all they could to please the orphan children, and they were not disappointed by the result.</p>
   <p>We are proud to record acts of kindness like this performed by our noble Greek girls, and we heartily congratulate them.</p>
