   <p>We have been informed by a telegram of the American Red Cross that over eleven thousand refugees in Asia Minor are in dire need. Help must be sent immediately. The Relief Committee for Greeks of Asia Minor asks the Chicago community to contribute as much as possible in order to help alleviate the suffering of these refugees.</p>
   <p>We cannot turn a deaf ear to the cries of eleven thousand suffering human beings. Aid must be sent without delay.</p>
   <p>Every dollar sent in will be doubled by the Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>Do not fail to help our brethren, who have been suffering for so many years.</p>
