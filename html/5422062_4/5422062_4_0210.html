   <p>At the Logan Square Masonic Temple last week, the Philanthropic Society of St. Basil held a tea party with over three hundred Greek ladies participating.</p>
   <p>This society is well known in Chicago for its benevolent work which is extended to all parts of the city. Paupers, indigent families, ill people at home and in hospitals, all receive the gracious assistance of this Society.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, the executive council of the St. Basil Society laid down plans for a systematic search for needy families, who through pride have refrained from asking assistance of any kind. Dozens of such Greek families are to be found.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Katina Mouzakiotis, President; Mrs. Eugenia H. Kontos, Vice-President; Mrs. Sophia Klitsianos, Secretary; Mrs. A. Mexes, Treasurer;</p>
