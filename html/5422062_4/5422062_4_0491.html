   <p>All the Greeks in America who have decided to send money to Greece, in order to help the suffering women and children of the soldiers, are doing a very praiseworthy thing.</p>
   <p>The women and children in that part of Greece which has been liberated, are starving by the thousands, and so are those who have been conquered by the Turks. Anyone who does these people a kindness is worthy of being called a Christian.</p>
   <p>We agree that these conquered and suffering brothers must be helped, but we wish to give a word of advice to those who are in a position to aid them materially. If you heed this advice, you will have clear consciences, knowing that you have done your job well. If, however, this advice is <span class="page-break">\2</span>ignored, you will become the instrument by which the Greeks in America will be divided into "liberated" and "conquered" factions.</p>
   <p>It is bad enough that Greece [itself] is divided; here in America, division and factions should not exist. What is the difference between a conquered and a free Greek? Now can such a division, or classification be made? We are all Greeks and are, therefore, all brothers [figuratively speaking].</p>
   <p>What is the difference between a starving conquered Greek and a starving free Greek? Is these any division or favoritism [shown] in starvation?</p>
   <p>It is a disgrace that there should be any distinction made in the meting out of pity and aid. He who endeavors to create factions, in order to exploit hunger and human suffering, is not worthy of being called a human being.</p>
   <p>The men who, in the name of hunger, seek to create opposing parties or groups <span class="page-break">\3</span>so that they may be in the limelight, are inhuman beasts.</p>
   <p>We must not let ourselves become weapons in the hands of these men, to be used against our suffering, free and conquered brothers.</p>
   <p>At various times in the past, the Greek papers in America have started campaigns for philanthropic purposes. Or they have sponsored drives for funds to be used for patriotic activities. For these worthy and unselfish deed, they should receive the appreciation and applause of the American Greeks.</p>
   <p>Today, a different situation has arisen--a situation that this is not only different but is also difficult. Two Greek newspapers have started campaigns to raise funds for the relief of the starving Greeks. And we see, with regret and shame, that a bitter distinction is being made between the conquered and the liberated Greeks.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Two innocent and Christian pleas for charity are being used as instruments of division. One was written by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Germanes, and the other was a letter sent by the Metropolite Theoklitos.</p>
   <p>The newspapers are causing dissension by printing poisonous editorials, which cause the readers to become prejudiced against either the free or the conquered Greeks. This is the basis and foundation for the beginning of two philanthropic drives. The results are not difficult to foresee.</p>
   <p>In every district where there is a Greek church, the priest of the parish will be instructed by the church trustees to start a campaign for funds. If the president or the priest is in the liberated faction, the drive will be conducted for the relief of starving women and children in free Greece. If the powers in the church are on the opposite side, the fund will be sent to the starving women and children in conquered Greece.</p>
   <p>Such a course of events must naturally result in antagonism and factionalism <span class="page-break">\5</span>among the various church parishes. This will be followed by arguments and even fights, and will probably cause a scandal that will bring shame to the Greek name. The same will happen in little communities that have been harmonious and peaceful, previously.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is evident that we must exercise due caution in the conduct of our relief drive, and we recommend the following course of action. In each community of five thousand or even one thousand Greeks, committees should be formed to carry on a drive for funds. Each individual who makes a contribution should designate how much of it should be given to the Metropolite [free Greeks] or to the Patriarch [conquered Greeks].</p>
   <p>When the drive is completed the money should be divided into two parts; according to the desires of the contributors. The funds should then be sent directly to the Metropolite or the Patriarch by the Greek consulate.</p>
   <p>It should not be given into the hands of the greedy, dishonest newspapers, <span class="page-break">\6</span>who are doing their best to create dissension and argument among the Greek people. This evil must be stopped once and for all.</p>
   <p>The papers guilty of such treacherous conduct must be made to feel the lash of public scorn.</p>
   <p>If, however, some individuals want to make a contribution simply because they want to see their names in the newspapers, we can only quote from the Bible: "Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth."</p>
   <p>Such exhibitionists are not interested in philanthropy. They are merely seekers after false glory.....</p>
   <p>However, it is necessary that the names of the contributors and the amounts contributed be published, for the sake of informing the public as to the results of the drive. The newspapers can do their share by publishing the lists of every parish, free of charge.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Through such a procedure, the drive will be carried on without division or antagonism. The spiritual centers at Constantinople and Athens will also receive more money than they would receive from a campaign directed and collected by the newspapers.</p>
