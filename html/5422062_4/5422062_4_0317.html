   <p>Dear Mr. Editor:</p>
   <p>In the name of the Greek boys, who receive hospitalization here, we deem it our duty to publicly express, through your newspaper, our sincere appreciation to the Greek ladies society of the church St. Basil, to the Rev. A. Paschalakis, Rev. A. Arcadiou, Mrs. Constandodakis, Mrs. Dedakis, Mrs. Strategos, Mrs. Koleris, Mrs. Mexis and Miss Helen Komianou, Miss Vasiliki Flouda and Miss Tsamis, for their frequent visits to us and the grand gifts they bring along. Their visits give us joy and hope and make us forget our troubles.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Geo. Demakis</p>
   <p>Dem. Hasapis.</p>
