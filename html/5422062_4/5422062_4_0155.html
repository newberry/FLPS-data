   <p>The Philanthropic Society of Greek Women, the purpose of which is to give financial aid to needy, pregnant Greek women, has great need of funds. In order to acquire the necessary funds, this organization is again appealing to the generous Greek Community for aid. No one can justly refuse to contribute toward such a worthy cause. Show your generosity, and don't forget how much good will come from your contribution.</p>
   <p>A committee of Greek women has been formed, to contact all Greek merchants and organizations in an appeal for contributions.</p>
