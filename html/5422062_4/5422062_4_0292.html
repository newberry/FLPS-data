   <p>Besides the local contributions of Ahepa's chapters all over the country, the Chicago united chapters of Ahepa went over the top to raise money for our brother-Greeks, suffering as a result of the Corinthian earthquake. Their well-heralded dance for the Corinthian Relief took place last Monday at the Trianon ballroom.</p>
   <p>The success of the dance was tremendous. About 3,000 people attended the dance, and booths engaged for $25 each were sold to hundreds of Greek firms and individuals, including many Americans.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to Chicago chapters which always lead in national and local affairs of this kind.</p>
