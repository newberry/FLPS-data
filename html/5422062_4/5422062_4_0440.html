   <p>The great campaign for the collection of funds for our suffering fellow countrymen in Turkey and Bulgaria is going forward. We are publishing the amounts collected thus far, showing several generous contributions, and the sources of their origin.</p>
   <p>From the previous drive the amount of $1,088 was collected. A clear profit of $2,277 was made from the dance which was given on May 10, expressly for the alleviation of the sufferings of our brothers in Europe.</p>
   <p>A South Side committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Kokoris returned its subscription booklet with sixteen dollars. An anonymous dentist contributed two dollars.</p>
   <p>Thus far the total sum collected amounts to $3,383.</p>
