   <p>The much-heralded meeting which took place last week to settle the parish problems of the two long-suffering West Side churches, Holy Trinity and St. Basil, was unattended by the indifferent parishioners. After all, the interest in community affairs has long ago died in every Greek breast. Therefore the factions which have directed the parish affairs of both churches for the last nine years were left free to continue their program without interference.</p>
   <p>The program, which is religiously followed, is the continuance of the destruction of every social structure the community may possess. This plan of community destruction is balanced, however, by the program of benefiting various individual leaders and groups, at the expense of social progress.</p>
