   <p>Any individual who is aware of his obligations and duties, and fulfills them, is a valuable asset to the world.</p>
   <p>It is an obligation to try and repay the favors and kindnesses bestowed upon us by God, nature, and man-made laws. A full payment of these favors is the only way for a human being to live in happiness, security, and honor. Our duties to God and our country are higher than any others....</p>
   <p>We who came to this land of justice, equality, and democracy should consider it our country; we must be grateful for all the bounties we partake of.</p>
   <p>One of our duties to the United States is wholeheartedly to support the American Red Cross, which has the most sacred of purposes--the alleviation of human suffering.....Should we not offer a few of our dollars when our brothers are offering their living bodies upon the altar of freedom? Are we not to strengthen their weary hearts by letting them know that we, who are more fortunate than they, are doing our share?</p>
   <p>Let us make sacrifices so that we may be worthy to look upon the Holy Cross in our church without feeling ashamed.</p>
