   <p>The Association of the Greek Democratic Liberals of Chicago is giving its annual dance, November 4, 1923, at the Cameo Room of the well-known Morrison Hotel, which is located on the northeast corner of Madison and Clark Street.</p>
   <p>Everything has been taken care of, by the Executive Committee, so the dance should be very successful and carried out with the proper order and dignity.</p>
   <p>We hope, that the entire Greek Colony of our city of Chicago will honor our association, which has offered many national services in the past and is composed of the most eminent people from our colony. We can feel very proud of our association because it stands for cooperation and progress.</p>
