   <p>Either the Greeks have an abundance of rascality or some of the accusations against them are absolutely unfounded.</p>
   <p>The Greeks are to the forefront again.</p>
   <p>With vivid colors the Journal and the Tribune, in spicy articles for gossip and for hatred against the Greeks ring the bell of alarm in regards to a Greek slavery ring which brings into this country young Greek boys to work for the bosses, for only a few pennies.</p>
   <p>According to these colorful articles Chicago is the headquarters of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Greek ring.</p>
   <p>Of course, Greeks make news, hence the painted articles of the slavery ring. And in order to make a good picture of it all, Greeks in general are painted with brilliant colors of rascality, unlawfulness, trickery and what not.</p>
   <p>The Star, as a guardian of the Greeks in America and as a journalistic duty, has deemed it advisable to investigate these new charges against the Greeks. Our reporters have brought back authentic and official reports of the alleged slavery ring.</p>
   <p>From the Federal officials our reporters learned that the United States government has called a number of Greek business men to interrogate them in regards to the status of the young boys under their employ. The government wants to know who brought the youngsters here, and what their <span class="page-break">\3</span>compensation is for the work they do. After a detailed examination the government has made it known to them that god-father and father is not one and the same thing, and in the future they must state clearly when they receive young boys, whether, they are the fathers of the boys or the god-fathers, as the case may be.</p>
   <p>From this we deduct that some of the young arrivals were not received by their fathers as the papers show, but by their god-fathers.</p>
   <p>Suspicion was aroused when four boys of different names and appearances were received by an alleged father.</p>
   <p>The second report came from Hon. Dr. N. Salopoulos, Chicago Greek Consul-General, who has called hundreds of Greek business men to the Consulate and advised them to pay their employed boys by the week, or by the month, and not by the year as a few of them were accustomed to do.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In each of these two reports our reporters have not been successful in getting any names, from the government or from the Greek Consul.</p>
   <p>And here are the real facts of the gigantic Greek slavery ring, with its headquarters in Chicago, which the city press has blazoned in big letters.</p>
   <p>Well, for the time being, the Greeks will be left alone until some other reporters unearth a Greek conspiracy, to capture the White House, and declare dominion over the whole country.</p>
   <p>As Journalism is a complicated thing, no one can predict what those "devil Greeks" will be up to next time. But it will not be long before their rascality will be heralded again in the press. We have said before, "Greeks make news" therefore, the Star is awaiting the next necessity for refutation of accusations against the Greeks.</p>
