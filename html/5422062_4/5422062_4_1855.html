   <p>Last Monday, in the magnificent Aragon, installation of new officers of the Ahepa chapters was performed with great solemnity, and distinction.</p>
   <p>The great hall of the Aragon, crowded with 5,000 participants never before had displayed such an imposing scene as when the oath was administered to the incoming officers. As all the new officers of the many chapters knelt with their left hand on the Bible, and the right hand raised to take the oath administered by George Philis, Supreme Commander of the Ahepa, who had come from Washington for the purpose, the audience was awed by the imposing ritual.</p>
   <p>The Supreme Commander in a brief and signified speech outlined the imperative duty of the new Knights of the Order and, with a sign, terminated the ceremony which was followed by a delightful dance.</p>
