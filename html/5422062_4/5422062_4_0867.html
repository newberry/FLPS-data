   <p>While the children of Greek descent are rapidly growing into men and women, their parents and that part of the community which is interested in them are greatly disquieted. Our civic and social organizations, the few really fine scholars we have, the press, and the clergy are engaging in discussions and study, in an endeavor to find some way in which they, as a group, can help the young generation retain its Greek heritage. How can they influence the children to speak their mother's language, and to abide by those ideologies which, are uplifting and cultural?</p>
   <p>They all declare that the future of the Greeks in America will be based upon the actions of the present immigrant generation and the foundations which they prepare. Only the older immigrants can possibly create the basic structure upon which future Greeks can build. They say that the priests can exercise much influence upon the new generation by preaching sermons that are especially interesting to young people, and by which their interest in the church will be strengthened. Explanations of our religion, customs, and social mores will also help them to acquire a respect and love for things Greek. Many observers are of the conviction that the role played by the priests is secondary only to that of the parents.....The priests must organize a systematic program to accomplish any good effects. They must sacrifice their time and energy, just as do the clerics of all other nationalities. They should watch the development of the youngsters in their parishes with fatherly interest.</p>
   <p>The priest will be able to work in close co-operation with the parents in this matter. The Greek parents always have had a great reverence for their priests, in spite of what is often written in the columns of this paper. The Greek mother looks upon her priest as a representative of God, and has reared her children in the same attitude. But our church is not governed as is the Catholic Church, in which the members are pledged to go to church every Sunday, and anyone who is absent receives a visit from his priest, who asks the reason for the absence. There, also, if a mother is in difficulty with her child, she goes to the priest for counsel and aid.</p>
   <p>I recall an instance of a Greek boy in High School who was so bad that no teacher wanted him in a class. Finally the Greek priest was called upon for assistance and was requested to visit the home of this boy and give him lessons.</p>
   <p>However, our priests cannot do this for many cases, due to the great number of people in each parish. In Greece, a priest is just the priest, and the education--that is, the religious training and moral guidance of the children --is done by the school-teacher. Many of the Greek children in America have never attended their church regularly. Until that condition is remedied the hands of the priest are tied.</p>
   <p>As far as the press is concerned, at present it is read and enjoyed only by the older generations. Has any one of us seen young people reading Greek papers? No one can blame them for that. To them Greek is a dead language. They speak it at home through force of habit or fear of parental wrath, but with difficulty, for they are apt to think in English. Only after becoming mature, and if they have not drifted too far from their nationality, do they comprehend the value and beauty of their mother tongue....</p>
   <p>In spite of any efforts we might put forth as a group, it will never be possible for us to achieve this goal. We will not succeed in making a firm foundation for the future superstructure, because as soon as they grow up our children will cease to think of themselves as Greeks and will forget all we have tried so hard to teach them. Only those few, who may find themselves in positions where association with their own race is necessary, will remain at all true to their nationality. Neither the schools nor the church will be able to keep them in the Greek way of living, because no matter how much they are told to love and respect Greek ways they cannot help but find it easier to adjust themselves to the American scheme. Nor can we blame them for loving this country; they were born in it and speak its language and breath its air. Its rapid progress is enough to instill in them a tremendous feeling of awe and admiration.</p>
   <p>The Greeks will soon be assimilated to the point of obliteration, but no one can say just how soon it will come about. There is only one thing that can postpone such an evil and that is the influence of the home--the environment in the home and the mother's influence. Only the capable and interested mother is in a position to fight the outside environment, or at least to make a more equal balance. Do not be afraid that the young people are on the road to ruin. They live and appreciate life; it is their parents, unable to adjust themselves, who suffer and will suffer.</p>
