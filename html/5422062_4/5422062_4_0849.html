   <p>Our forefathers used to say "He who has no opinion and who does not partake of communal life and its problems, is without honor and worthless to his fellow men."....We shall not discuss the correctness of this statement; but it is interesting to note the many unworthy individuals in our community who do take active part in--in fact, assume leadership in--our community affairs. There-fore, in accordance with the precept of my learned ancestor, I, too, shall make known certain opinions regarding our major social problem. This problem has repeatedly been examined, discussed, analyzed, and X-rayed by practically every Greek in Chicago; and by many who live far away. The two strongest exponents of the unification of our community are the Greek Press and the Reverend D. Golemis.</p>
   <p>Father Golemis has ardently supported the idea of a united Greek community.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Far a period of time I supported it, but now I am beginning to doubt the wisdom of it; not because I am not in favor of such a progressive and beneficial move, but because I doubt that it can be accomplished. Father Golemis appeals to the Greek pride to make this dream a reality. His idea is first-class ideology, but it will always remain a dream if its realization depends solely upon the Greek filatimo. Practicality, good judgment, leadership, thought, and careful planning are the things which will unify Chicago Greeks. Certain organization and unification has occurred during the last few years among the Greek people. Our priests, teachers, cantors, and....have organized themselves for mutual protection and the common good. However, our many parishes are still fighting one another and retarding our group progress. Will we ever reach the end to this situation? Not as soon or as easily as some people believe.</p>
   <p>Although Mr. Spero Kotakis has declared that such a unification is practically <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>impossible, he has neglected to make any suggestions which might alleviate the situation. He has not pointed out the factors which might make such a step impossible. Can the blame be put upon the archbishop or the hierarchy? I shall speak my own opinion concerning that. Even if the entire Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Greece were to function in Chicago, there is no doubt in my mind but that the next day certain objectors would form their own church and pick their own priest. Therefore, the Church leaders are not responsible for our social ills.</p>
   <p>It is very doubtful if there is one Greek-American who is entirely satisfied with the condition of our parishes. Our public buildings and institutions are best described as "heaps of rocks, wood, steel, uprights, and little men, all thrown together in a haphazard manner."</p>
   <p>The problems confronting us at the present time are these:</p>
   <p>Can this conglomeration of material and people be rebuilt into a strong, safe <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>structure? And, what is of more importance: Can it be rebuilt by the same group of builders who have made such a mess of things in the past? To put this situation into a semblance of order requires much more than a sense of honor. Look at what this group has done for us in the past. Look and shudder!</p>
   <p>First of all, the older generation must fully realize that it has already given whatever it has had to give. During the forty years of struggling for existence in America, our people, as a racial group, have made notable progress. We have also made many serious mistakes; and it is for these mistakes that we are now paying. Egoism dominated each and every undertaking. Furthermore, we did not produce a capable leader to direct those egoistic impulses into creative streams. Instead of leaders, we were overrun by would-be orators who were titled public leaders or even saviors, and who, like true sorcerers, filled the heads of our people with "hot air". No one made the slightest effort to create something of real value. The few who realized the need for such creation were outnumbered and powerless to act, due to lack of community support. Finally, they tired and left our community to its chosen fate. The result was apparent and even <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>worse than could have been imagined. We are now suffering from communal anarchy.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we want no more of the older generation. Its accomplishments are unfortunately undesirable.....</p>
   <p>The natural thing to do is to turn to the younger generations and to benefit from the new blood, the new enthusiasm, and the new spirit which is the special prerogative of the youth of America. Again we are confronted with a question:</p>
   <p>Is the younger generation capable and well enough equipped to create organizations which will retain the Greek spirit and Greek ideology? For, after all, it is Greek institutions we are striving to build, so that our race can continue to have an active influence over the community. Are the younger Greeks capable of such creation? I ask each one of you: Would you be willing to hand over the control of our churches and parishes to our youth? No! I do not think <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>you would be; and I do not say this with intent to cast insinuations upon the abilities or motives of our children. They cannot be condemned because they do not think and believe exactly as we do. In fact, if they retain any trace of Greek heritage it is in spite of us, and not because of us. We cannot blame them even if they think the world would be better off if all of us died without leaving a trace of our existence. They have been taught that men and communities must justify their existence; and, so far, we Greeks of Chicago have not done so to any noticeable extent.</p>
   <p>Of course this does not mean that all of our young people have lost their Greek background; but those who retain it are but a small minority. Neither the Daughters of Penelope nor the Sons of Pericles [both Greek-American youth organizations] are capable of leading the development of our community. Therefore, if the older Greeks are unfit, and the younger ones ill-equipped for such a step, who, then, is to lead the Greek community in the future? The older ones, with their bias, hates, ignorance, antagonisms and egoism; or the younger ones, who are rather indifferent about the whole thing? Is it still to be wondered at that <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>I insist that the unification of our community is a serious and difficult-to-solve problem?</p>
   <p>The logical question I may now be asked is: "Under these circumstances what then shall we do?" My answer is that nothing can be done by us to unite our parishes into one community. The above statements should make that evident to all factions. What is needed is an external force capable of analyzing the matter objectively, without any personal bias or prejudice. Our only hope lies in the intervention of the Greek government. Why--yes! Why the surprise?</p>
   <p>The Hellenism of America has given, and is still giving, unmeasurable service to Greece. Now it is time that the kindness be repaid; if for no other reason than to keep alive the goose which has been laying the golden eggs. For if Hellenism dies in America there will be no more bridges, churches, and schools built with American dollars in Greek villages. The manner in which this intervention might be made will be fully outlined in a forthcoming article. Of course, we do not mean that the Chicago community alone merits such attention; <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>but, after all, it is one of the largest Greek groups in the world and its continued existence is well worth the effort.</p>
