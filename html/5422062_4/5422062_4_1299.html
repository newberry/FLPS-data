Although the weather was bad on that day, February 12th, over 3,000 members and friends attended the great affair which took place at the Gold Room of the Sherman Hotel.</p>
   <p>The ball room was well filled before the appointed time. Many people who could not dance or had no intention of dancing, came anyway, to see the ceremony.</p>
   <p>At exactly 8:30 P. M. the guests of honor came forward in an orderly procession and took their places. They were followed by the Supreme President of Ahepa, B. Chibithes, and the presidents of the three Chicago chapters, B. Roussis, P. Sikokis, and M. Lambros. After them filed the vice presidents, secretaries, treasurers, and the counselors.</p>
