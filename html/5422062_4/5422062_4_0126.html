   <p>p. 1.- The greatest work which our Greek Community plans to do is to build a hospital. It will give health and life to those of our countrymen who need medical care of any sort. A community which has over 20,000 Greeks should have already had two or three hospitals as other foreign nationalities have. The members of our community enthusiastically voted to build a hospital, but we must do it soon before the enthusiasm dies down. We have ten Greek doctors in our community and we are expecting them to help us very much in this matter. These doctors have much influence and we are placing all our confidance in them. Except for a priest, the doctor is the most important man in a community. We hope the good work will get under way very soon.</p>
