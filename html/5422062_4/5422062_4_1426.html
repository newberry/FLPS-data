   <p>p. 1.-We are told that the second meeting of the Panhellenic Union in Chicago will soon be held. Our guess is that either this meeting will not be held at all or, if it is, very few will attend. The people of Chicago are in favor of a Panhellenic Union such as Minister of Greece, Moromilas, has suggested, but they do not approve of the start that is being made. The officers of the club do not satisfy the requirements of the Greeks who want this organization to become a true, patriotic one which will be of benefit to all.</p>
   <p>We know the Greeks of Chicago well enough to state that they will not take part in something that does not interest them and, in this case, we mean the Panhellenic Union.</p>
