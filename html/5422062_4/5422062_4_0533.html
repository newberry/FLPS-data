   <p>p. 2.- Last night a very important meeting was to have taken place in Chicago. Only nineteen Greeks attended. It seems we are not interested in our mother country, which we so lately left behind. Why?</p>
   <p>Three years ago, it was proposed that all organizations in Chicago unite into one huge, central organization. For this purpose, Mr. Manousopoulos gathered together all the prominent Greeks of Chicago and the thing was done. Today it is different.</p>
   <p>The Greeks are more interested in trying to make money out of their churches instead of helping the mother country in distress.</p>
   <p>Greeks, we must help Greece. Let us forget business and social affairs and unite to save our country. Go to church on Sunday, light a candle, pray for your country and then go to Hull House and show some action.</p>

   <p>The churches have plenty of money. Make the North Side Church contribute $10,000. The same should be done by Matsoukas with $25,000, and the Atlantis with $40,000. We must help fight the Turks!!</p>
