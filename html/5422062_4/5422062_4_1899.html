   <p>Pg. 1- We have at various times discussed in these columns the well-known Greek-American educational progressive club best known by the initials of its name, Ahepa. We have paid particular attention to Ahepa whenever it has held its annual convention. To-day this convention meets again, in Miami, Florida, and we consider it opportune to deal with Ahepa, which possesses so numerous a membership among the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>Our readers probably recall that in the beginning our discussion was polemic in its nature; we did not hesitate, among other things, to characterize Ahepa as anti-Hellenic. We soon changed our hostile attitude, however, for we were assured that this club intended to organize America's Hellenism for the purpose of supporting each Greeks right to equality and justice in this country.</p>
   <p>Some things really were accomplished at the last meeting. Some alterations were made, and the organization did become more Hellenic. In fact, we have <span class="page-break">2</span>no doubt that this organization will become Greek and remain Greek, for we have seen many good Greeks registering in Ahepa whose patriotism cannot be questioned.</p>
   <p>However, it is true that up to this moment the Order of Ahepa has not succeeded in realizing any of its aims; it has not justified its ostentatious title. But this is no reason why we should oppose it. On the contrary, we should try, especially through the influence of our journals, to contribute as much as we can to its improvement, to arouse its lukewarm Hellenism, and to make it serve the interests of the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>We are therefore dealing with Ahepa to-day solely for the purpose of helping it, and we do this in spite of the fact that many will misinterpret what we write and will fail to discern the good intentions of the writer. Indeed, many members of Ahepa become uneasy when their club is discussed in the newspapers. They overlook the fact that it is the duty of Greek journalism in America to follow all Greek activities and to keep Greeks informed of everything which affects them. Ahepa is an important organization of Greek-Americans, and consequently it is the duty of the Greek press to follow its <span class="page-break">3</span>activities. We therefore return to this theme, and beginning to-day, we shall publish articles on Ahepa and tell what the Hellenism of America expects of it.</p>
