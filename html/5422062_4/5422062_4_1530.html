   <p>p. 2.- In the chronicles of the Greek Community of Chicago, never in the last twenty-five years have we celebrated our national holiday in the true Greek way. The entire program of this year's celebration, starting with the Greek Consul, G. Depastas, was very poorly prepared. This event should have been a gigantic and memorable celebration, not a "wash-out."</p>
   <p>The guest speaker of the day, S. Kotakis, wanted to show his power, but instead of making the audience enthusiastic, he put them to sleep. The Greek community of Chicago is very large. We must stop these silly pretenses at celebrating and do things the right way.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the celebrations to come will be full of patriotism, joy and national fun.</p>
   <p>G. A. Kyriakopoulos.</p>
