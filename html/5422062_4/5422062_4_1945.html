   <p>We are in the year of 1909, the year on which the building of the Church and the School began. The zeal and enthusiasm of the Greeks, on the South Side as well as of those in the center of the city, was such that the necessary amount of money was gathered, and within a year, the first service was performed in the newly built church, by the two priests of the Holy Trinity Church, Rev. Pegeas and Rev. Mandilaris; the latter remaining as a regular officiating priest of the church for many years.</p>
   <p>It would have been an omission, of sacred duty, if we were not praising the willingness of all, who contributed for the erection of the edifice. Most of them were manual laborers, and employers of small fruit stores. They were mostly natives of Arcadia, with whom the writer of these lines many times, discussed conditions of that time, and admired the grandeur of their soul. Indeed no one will fail to admire the self-denial and self-sacrifice of those contributors in order to leave a legacy to their children and to those who later arrived from Greece.</p>

   <p>The Church and school building cost $28,000, and was composed of two stories. On the first floor was the school with its different halls, on the second floor was the church; the offices of the council; the offices of priest's and the diocese.</p>
   <p>Year after year the Greek population increases, and St. Constantine Church becomes not only the House of God, but also the National House. In this church, the Greeks receive their religious services and exchange views and ideas. The everlasting desire to return to their native country and their beloved ones, begins to deminish, because they feel, they are in Greek Soil and having brought their relatives and friends here, enjoy the good and happiness of this country.</p>
