   <p>Last Sunday in the Holy Trinity Church, upon the announcement of the Patriarch's appeal for funds for the Thracian earthquake victims, three hundred dollars was raised through the collection plate, in less than thirty minutes.</p>
   <p>The money was remitted by wire to the Ecumenical Patriarch, Ioakeim, and further collections are going on. Bravo! Chicago Greek Community.</p>
