   <p>p. 4 - As usual the Pan-Hellenic Society of Chicago always comes to the fore when assistance is needed. It always leads.</p>
   <p>The Society in its last meeting without any objection or debate voted the sum of $150 for relief of the victims of the holocaust of San Francisco. It has resolved to appeal to all the Greek societies of Chicago to put up a united front to raise contributions among Greeks to be sent to the unfortunate city of San Francisco, where thousands are dead and hundreds of thousands are homeless and in need.</p>
   <p>Again the Star has an opportunity to commend the activities of the Pan-Hellenic Society and to congratulate it.</p>
