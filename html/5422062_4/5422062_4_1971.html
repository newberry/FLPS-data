   <p>Last Wednesday night the dance given by the Koimisis Tis Theotokou Church took place in Guyon's Paradise Ballroom. This large West Side parish chose this way of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the building of its church.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the dance are for the fund being raised to pay for the erection of a new and beautiful cathedral. This new church is being designed by a famous Greek architect and will doubtless, be one of the most beautiful Greek churches in this section of the country.</p>
   <p>A picture of the architect's conception of the proposed building was printed in the previous issue of this paper. The committee which fostered this dance certainly used many clever devices.</p>
