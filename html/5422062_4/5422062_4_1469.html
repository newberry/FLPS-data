   <p>p.6.-- Fifty prominent Greeks who are heads of families met last week and organized the Greek Family Men's Fraternity.</p>
   <p>All those who attended the meeting are residents of St. Nicholas's parich.</p>
   <p>Their main objects are to promote good will and fellowship among themselves and to raise funds to assist the church when it needs them.</p>
   <p>The Star commends them for their initiative and hopes that other similar societies will be founded to serve the needs of the ever-increasing Greek community.</p>
