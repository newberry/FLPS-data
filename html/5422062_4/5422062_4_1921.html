   <p>The Board of Directors of St. Andrews church in their endeavor to promote the association, not only of the members of the church but also of all the select compatriots of the Greek Colony in Chicago, at the start of the New Year, offer to all the opportunity of assembling together to exchange with one another, greetings for the New Year. Started two years ago, this plan includes a huge banquet to which approximately four hundred of our countrymen and their wives have been invited.</p>
   <p>The success of this wonderful purpose on the two preceeding years is our only encouragement and it pleases us to be able to repeat again the event this year of 1937. It is up to us now to announce our plans to the members of our church and their friends, and to prepare a sumptuous banquet, a varied program and means of recreation with great joy for our members and friends.</p>
   <p>The day of this enormous feast is set for Sunday, January 31, at eight o'clock and will take place in the hall of our church.</p>

   <p>ArchRev. E. Tsourounakis, the High Priest; B. Kotsonis, the President; K. Kakarakis, the Secretary.</p>
