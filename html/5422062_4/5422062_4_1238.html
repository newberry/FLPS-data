   <p>Next Wednesday, Feb. 12, in the luxurious Aragon ballroom the initiation of officers of Ahepa's (American-Hellenic Educational Progressive Association) eight chapters will take place, and a dance will follow for the members and guests of the organization.</p>
   <p>There is no room for any possibility that this great organized association of the Greeks will ever commit itself to any act contrary to the views and ideals of Hellenism.</p>
   <p>In greeting, therefore, the new Executive Councils of "Ahepa", we heartily wish them success in their aims and purposes, in full confidence that they are working for our national preservation in America.</p>
