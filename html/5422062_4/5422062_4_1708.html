   <p>p. 5.- Our churches are playing an important part in our social affairs. It seems that in the future they will be our most important means of enjoyment and amusement.</p>
   <p>A lovely evening was spent last Sunday at St. James Church, when the National holiday was celebrated with a program by the children of Solon and Evangelismos schools.</p>
   <p>Many hundreds of men, women, and children were there and all appeared very much pleased with the program. Mr. G. Gretsis directed his orchestra while our Greek girls in native costumes danced with much joy and grace. The plays and poems were recited perfectly by all the children. Everyone left after thanking the teachers and priest for this wonderful display of their children's talent.</p>
