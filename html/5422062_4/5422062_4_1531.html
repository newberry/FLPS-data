   <p>P. - 1-.........In our community of our Greek national holiday was celebrated in a very lively manner this year. This was largely due to the recent reconciliation and unification of the two factions of the Greek Church, which had been divided on the question of altering the old Greek Orthodox Church calendar to conform with that of the other nations of the modern world. Yesterday, at the Church of Annunciation, a large crowd which had assembled from all parts of our community attended the dual ceremony, - independence of Greece and the sermon in honor of the day of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin.</p>
   <p>Among those who attended were the consul general of Greece, Mr. G. Depasta, in official uniform, and the entire staff of the consulate of Greece.</p>
   <p>In the ceremony of the doxology the clergymen of all the Greek Orthodox churches of Chicago participated. An address was delivered by Mr. D. Michalopoulos, an attorney, in observance of the national Greek holiday. After the doxology Mr. Depasta spoke a few words appropriate to the occasion in honor of the Greek nation, to which the large congregation responded with hearty cheers.</p>

   <p>Pursuant to the program for the observance of Greek Independence Day a dance was given at the magnificent Aragon Ballroom, which was filled to capacity by a crowd of more than three thousand members of the Greek community of Chicago.</p>
