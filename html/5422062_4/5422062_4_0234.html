   <p>p. 1.- Although 8,000 people were at the Aragon dance to see Miss Diplarakou there are many more thousands who are waiting for a chance to do the same.</p>
   <p>For this purpose the Ahepa is going to give a dance at the Trianon on December 29, with Miss Europe as guest of honor. Proceeds will go to the United Greek Charities for distribution among the poor.</p>
   <p>Miss Diplarakou's appearance will be different at this dance. She will speak for at least half an hour to her enthralled audience.</p>
   <p>Aside from the great attraction that Miss Diplarakou's presence will lend to the occasion, every Greek should consider it a duty to help out the poor people who are in great need. The purchase of two tickets by each of the thousands of Greeks in Chicago will be a great boost to the funds the United Greek Charities are gathering to aid our destitute countrymen.</p>
