   <p>The fearful World War was brought to an inglorious end with the destruction of Christianity in the Near East and especially in Asia Minor; thousands of children were left without parents, without a home and without a country. These unfortunate creatures must have food and shelter. Their parents were either killed in battle, subjected to starvation, or murdered after bloody and horrible pursuit. The scene of our national tragedy in Asia Minor, with its many innocent victims, will never be eradicated from the memory of mankind.</p>
   <p>Sincere praise for their philanthropic activities is due the different associations, such as the American Red Cross and the Near East Relief. Their philanthropic work is great and causes all humanity to feel a heartfelt thankfulness.</p>

   <p>Twenty different associations from fourteen nations called a conference in Geneva, Switzerland, and consolidated into the International Association for the Near East, so as to relieve misfortune, take care of the orphans, and promote the social, economical, industrial and educational development of the Near East. This International Association has dedicated December 2, 1923, to the service of the Golden Rule; it asks that the people of America on that day eat less, and use the money saved to help support the orphans of the Near East. They are justified in calling this dedication "The Golden Rule", because its purpose is great, pure and golden.</p>
   <p>Approving this consecration of December 2, 1923, as practical and beneficial, we are sending out circulars to be read in all the churches that belong to the Archdiocese of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America.</p>
   <p>November 14, 1923. With the blessings of Christ,</p>
   <p>Alexandros,</p>
   <p>Archbishop of America.</p>
