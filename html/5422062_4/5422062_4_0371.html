   <p>The young Greek ladies society Nea Genea (New Generation) held their masquerade ball, last week, at the Trianon Ball Room.</p>
   <p>The young girls, who always draw a large crowd in their affairs, are up to the minute when it comes to entertainment. They know how to raise money for charitable and other purposes. Not only through their energetic efforts do they sell thousands of tickets but they also give the participants at their affairs their money's worth and they always spring unusual surprises in their program. That's why their affairs are always successful.</p>
   <p>This affair was given for the poor and needy Greek families in Chicago, at which over 4,000 people participated. Many outstanding tickets are not accounted for as yet.</p>
