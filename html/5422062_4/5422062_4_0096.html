   <p>P.2--Natives of St. John the Theologian, Lacedaemon, Greece, numbering about forty, met last week and founded a society to be known as the Theologitan Fraternity, with the object of rendering service and assistance to one another and to their fellow-townsmen in Greece. At their first meeting the sum of $785 was collected for the fraternity fund. They elected as officers: G. A. Maniatis, president; Demosthenes A. Giannacopoulos, treasurer; and Charalampos Marinakos, secretary. The offices of the new fraternity are at 1345 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Good luck to you, boys!</p>
