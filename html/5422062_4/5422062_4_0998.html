   <p>Every Greek's heart is exalted to heavenly heights with joy and happiness in the thought that while in the bonds of slavery and spread wide apart through the ages the Greek is struggling like a feeble sparrow to protect and save its young ones from the deadly claws of vultures and birds of prey.</p>
   <p>This great task is justly admired, because in spite of terrible persecutions on the part of the tyrannical Turks for fear that Greek faith and culture would prevail, our race has been preserved.</p>
   <p>Who are the young ones in the above simile? They are our children. What are their nests? The church and the schools. What are the protecting wings?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Religion and language, through which the Greek national conscience remained inseparably united and was given the right to arrange its own national destiny.</p>
   <p>The church, on the one hand, served as the Ark by which our nation was saved through the ages, in spite of the cataclysms caused by the barbarous conqueror of Greece. The Greek language was the medium through which the nation retained its culture and national conscience during the great and indescribable national disasters.</p>
   <p>We, the immigrant Greeks in this country, must realize that religion and school are objects of great national significance for us. Therefore, we must always reverence and be interested in these fundamental institutions, for a man without any religious, Christian faith, without the desire and willingness to acquire his own language, is not a worthy and civilized individual.</p>
   <p>Naturally, these institutions received a different treatment in those times in our homeland from what they receive in modern civilized countries such as the United States, where freedom to worship according to the dictates of one's <span class="page-break">\3</span>own conscience and the free use of foreign languages is an accepted dogma. The respectful attitude of this country toward all nationalities and toward their beautiful ideals and traditions leads the immigrant to hold America in the highest respect and to exhibit true filial devotion to her. That is why the American flag is found beside the national emblem of every nationality in America. That is why all Greeks and the men of all the other friendly nations are serving America with such enthusiasm in her struggle against the absolutist and savage empires of Central Europe. It is the aim and ambition of our enemy to dominate the entire world, regardless of the way it is done. By this terrible war, they seek to establish one tyrannical dynasty throughout the world.</p>
   <p>In view of this threat, the existence of our churches and the preservation of our schools become more necessary, not for the reasons for which they became necessary in Turkey, but because we have a sacred obligation toward this nation to which we belong and to which we owe great respect for so many blessings.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>By preserving and maintaining our own ideas, ideals, traditions, and institutions, we will be able to serve America better in this her critical moment. We may even obtain assistance for our homeland, where we find the glories of our ancestors, our national ideals, and the precious testimonials of our great and noble heritage.</p>
   <p>So, just as we are striving to preserve Greek civilization which had such an important influence on the course of human progress, America, too, is participating in a titanic struggle for the preservation of civilization, liberty, and the rights of humanity from the barbarous clutches of savage conquerors.</p>
   <p>Every civilized nation feels the obligation to defend civilization and freedom. Why shouldn't we do so? Are we not the ones who enriched civilization and first conceived the necessity of human liberty?</p>
   <p>What are the sources for the development of civilization? Are they not religion and the Greek language? Therefore, we are under sacred obligation to <span class="page-break">\5</span>preserve them by all means. But, besides this sacred, moral obligation there is an inescapable need for the suppression of the vulgar Greek language [Translator's note: There was a great controversy over the question of using the pure Greek language in writing and as a medium of expression or the common or vulgar (domestic) Greek language.], because the Greek language is an inexhaustible source from which all nations borrow words and terms for the enrichment of their own language.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Greek language must be considered the international linguistic source of the world and must be taught in the schools throughout the entire world. Those who know the Greek language must be proud and fortunate; it is a mark of honor and distinction.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why we should support and maintain our language through our Chicago Greek schools. We should strive to bequeath it to our descendants, even though they are to live here. If we are to preserve and maintain the Greek language, we need schools and teachers. In order to secure these, we need money; because without it, nothing that is to be done can be accomplished.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>So,all those who have children--and even those who do not--must offer their financial support with pleasure and willingness.</p>
   <p>Those who contribute for this cause deserve appreciation and congratulations, while those who show indifference and refuse to assist deserve contempt.</p>
   <p>Church and school should be the national symbols of every people and more so of the Greek people, who are considered the founders of world civilization.</p>
