   <p>That the division among Greeks in America has a bad effect upon the mind of the native born American is manifested by the following article. The Greeks of Chicago and the rest of the country will do a great service to the Greek race if they forget their political differences and animosities and heed the wise counsel of the distinguished American, Geo. Horton.</p>
   <p>"To my mind the chief object which the Greeks in America should strive after among themselves is unity and mutual friendliness. This has always been true, but is especially true at the present moment.</p>

   <p>"The great Smyrna disaster brought the Greek race into prominence, and there was a tendency among certain interested people to say and believe that the Christians of the Orient were no better than the Turks. This sort of insidious and harmful propaganda has had a widespread effect on the public mind and has been aided by the Greeks themselves. It is easily seen that if they are divided in each community in two hostile camps, each speaking ill of the other, they tend to make the native born American believe they are all bad.</p>
   <p>"Now, the fact is, that the Greeks are among our best citizens. They are all industrious and self-supporting. They very seldom appear in the criminal records. They are not Bolsheviks. They support and love the American government, they are intelligent, generous and kindly. They usually marry, establish homes and bring up their children to be good American citizens. I know this and you know it.</p>

   <p>"Their great weakness is that they are their own worst enemies. Often when I am talking with a Greek, he will tell me that some other Greek is a rascal. I believe the situation is improving. Two or three years ago the two factions were shouting so loudly about each other's villany that the whole country heard it. And people said: 'These Greeks think they still are living back in the old country. They have no interest whatever in American affairs save their own squabbles.'</p>
   <p>"I said to a Greek friend of mine once: 'If you want to bawl out anybody, cuss the President of the United States. Then we'll all think you are an American. If you keep downing Venizelos or the king everybody will think that you ought to go back to the old country'.</p>
   <p>"The Greeks of Chicago who always lead in national and racial movements will do well to begin right at home, unify themselves, and be an example for the rest of the country."</p>
