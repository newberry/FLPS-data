   <p>"Our organization has as its aim, the betterment of our homeland in the political and educational fields. As your president, it will be my sacred duty to help fulfill these hopes..... There are certain points that we must strive for in our campaign; they are the following:</p>
   <p>"The education of all of our people in national and political matters.</p>
   <p>"The eradication in our fatherland of all destructive forces and policies.</p>
   <p>"The liberation of Greece from foreign domination.</p>
   <p>"The direction of all resources toward making and securing peace and security, by stabilizing the fatherland from within.</p>
