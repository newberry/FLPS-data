   <p>p. 1.- The Graeco-Turkish problem has thrust the Pan-Hellenic Union in the background for a while, but we are bringing it forth so the Greeks of Chicago will not forget it.</p>
   <p>Many are of the erroneous opinion that the Panhellenic Union is a national organization of Greece.</p>
   <p>Of the 214 Greek societies in America, only 11 from Chicago succeeded in getting united. These now are to be torn apart by the Graeco-Turkish situation. When the Greeks of America learn that the Panhellenic Union has nothing to do directly with problems in the Far East, much progress will be made.</p>
   <p>As it became organized just before the outbreak of the Greeks and Turks, many were mistaken in its purpose. Of course the Panhellenic Union will help its countrymen, but only as an organization of Greek people in America, helping out a forsaken Motherland.</p>

   <p>The Panhellenic Union is undertaking a great work. It needs the help of all the Greeks in America. Do not stop to argue about trivialities. Do your duty now!</p>
