   <p>The 25th of March is approaching and there is no doubt that the Greek community of Chicago will celebrate magnificently.</p>
   <p>The initiative for the celebration in the past when the Greek government had consuls here conscious of their mission, was always assumed by them and for a long time the consul in conjunction with the Greek communities and societies organized the celebration of National Independence Day.</p>
   <p>Ever since the arrival of Mr. Depasta, however, things have changed in Chicago, for Mr. Depasta has different conceptions from those of his predecessors. He has cut off all relations with the Greek communities of our colony. The Greek people in Chicago, following blindly the dividers of Hellenism, have scandalously sided with them.</p>
   <p>Consequently, we did not expect any initiative from the consul for the celebration of our national holiday. Having been convinced that there is no representative of our country in Chicago, we expect arrangements for the holiday to be made by the Greek communities in cooperation with the various societies.</p>

   <p>Therefore, we received with pleasure the information that the society of Greek professional men is taking the initiative in the celebration, and in cooperation with the communities and the various societies will organize the observance of our national holiday in a most magnificent and imposing manner.</p>
