   <p>The American committee, for the burial of the Greek and Armenian dead in Asia Minor, was given a church by the Ecumenical Throne. Thousandsof refugees have their eyes turned to America for succor.</p>
   <p>The Patriarch sent a telegram to this government, after a conference with the members of the Relief Committee. The need is so great, that thousands of children are starving, and there is no way of helping them.</p>
   <p>The members of the Committee state that "they are depending upon the farmers in America, to send them five million bushels of wheat, in order that there may be food for the winter."</p>
   <p>The telegram says: "Peace has not come to this land yet. The war has caused thousands of residents to leave their homes and to wander helplessly. On all sides are supplicating hands, which we are unable to help. Only your great Christian country is in a position to help us. We, in the near East are thankful <span class="page-break">2</span>and grateful for the wonderful energy and kindness of the American Red Cross."</p>
