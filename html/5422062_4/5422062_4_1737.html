   <p>The governing boards of our three churches co-operated magnificently in organizing the annual picnics which are held on St. Mary's great religious holiday, August 15. Hundreds of Greeks were present, and they enjoyed a wonderful day of rest, a day of amusement and excitement.</p>
   <p>The governing board of the Saint Trinity Church, consisting of Bill Georgacopoulos, president; James Tsiambas, vice-president; Spero Ganas, secretary; Gust Kolovos, treasurer, and others, had made all the necessary preparations to insure that everyone would have plenty to eat and drink, and that there would be plenty singing and dancing amid the idyllic beauty of Schuffs' Park.</p>
   <p>The net receipts from the sale of tickets will be used for the benefit of the war casualties. Roasted lamb, plenty of wine, graceful Greek dances, and beautiful Greek songs made this summer outing a complete success.</p>
   <p>The governing board of the Greek Church of the Annunciation, consisting of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Paul Mazarakos, president; K. Politis, secretary; L. Gianakopoulos, treasurer, and others, did everything in its power to arrange and supervise the Annunciation community's picnic, which was held in Kolze Electric Park. Greek dancing and singing, wine, beer, and roasted lamb were the order of the day. Everyone had a good time. The parishioners of the Saint Constantine community also participated in this picnic. Peter Metos, president of the church community; Stan Spirakis, vice-president; John Dreranias, secretary, and others, worked hard for the success of the affair.</p>
   <p>Thus, the great Greek holiday of the Repose of our Virgin Mary, which is celebrated annually on the fifteenth of August with a picnic by all three of our church communities, gives all of us the opportunity to meet one another and rejoice together. On this occasion, friends, relatives, and families get together, forget their daily struggles and worries, and really go in for a good time. This is an excellent custom and tradition.</p>
   <p>There, on the picnic grounds, in a perfect natural setting, our people taste <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>our famous Greek delicacies, our roasted lamb and our retsina wine, while others dance to the accompaniment of our immortal Greek songs. It is such circumstances that all of us remember and long for our homeland, our small, picturesque village and our beloved ones. We imagine ourselves singing and dancing in our own village festival.</p>
   <p>Let us pray and hope that we will all celebrate in the same spirit next year.</p>
