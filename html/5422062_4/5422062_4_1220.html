   <p>p. 2.- The Misses of the Chapter, "Kypseli," offered an afternoon party, last Sunday, in honor of Commander Kapsopoulos, to whom the chapter is indebted for its existence. Commander Kapsopoulos carries somehow a special affection towards this chapter as it happens to be the first chapter of Gapa for Misses founded in America.</p>
   <p>The High Commander was overjoyed upon receiving the expressions of esteem and love of the members of this chapter. Many members of the Chapter "Estia", were present, which helped to make the party a success.</p>
   <p>Commander Kapsopoulos' speech was wonderful. Many of the Misses also spoke. Miss Passiali Arnou sang "La Boheme" with piano accompaniment by Miss Stamou. The party was a success and we congratulate the Misses for their most inspiring way of honoring Commander Kapsopoulos.</p>
