   <p>P. 1 - The following facts are submitted by the American Association of the Greek Community of Chicago in support of a resolution sent to the U. S. A. Congress regarding pending immigration legislation which, if passed, will practically result in the prevention of Greek immigration to this country.</p>
   <p>The number of foreign born Greeks in Chicago, in 1920 was 11,546, the total number in the United States 212, 338, of which nearly 100,000 immigrated to this country since 1910.</p>
   <p>In 1922 a total of 3,809 immigrant and non-immigrant Greeks arrived in this country, while 8,682 emigrant and non-emigrant departed, leaving a net decrease in the Greek population of the United States of 4,873.</p>
   <p>In 1923, 3,605 were admitted and 3,351 departed, leaving a net increase of 254. This tabulation is by country of last permenent residence. In 1923 the net increase of Greeks from all over the world arriving in the United States was 1,326.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Of the 4,177 Greeks arriving in the United States in 1923 from all countries, 1,474 were males and 2,703 females. Those under 16 years of age numbered 609 and those over 45 years of age numbered 440, thus showing that nearly 25% were under 16 years and over 45 years of age. Exactly 2,442 paid their own passage, 1,547 had theirs paid by relatives and 188 had their passage paid by other than friends or relatives. 3,394 came here to join their relatives, 579 came to join their friends, meaning in many instances that they were females coming here to marry. Only 204 were not going to join relatives or friends. 1,569 were single females from 16 to 29 years old and 140 were single females from 30 to 44 years old.</p>
   <p>As to occupation, 135 were professionals; 345 skilled laborers; 249 ordinary laborers and 198 merchants and dealers. The balance either had no occupation and included 1,653 servants which of course means women and children.</p>
   <p>It is a well known fact, and a matter that should be brought to the attention of the proper legislative and immigration authorities that the Greek girls that come into this country do not engage in any work or business except, perhaps, that of keeping house for their father, brothers or other relatives. They are being <span class="page-break">\3</span>supported by their relatives until they marry, for which purpose they come into this country, thus they do not take any employment away from the people residing in this country, but on the contrary they make it possible to provide work for the unemployed in the various industries, because when they marry, their husbands open up a home, buy furniture and other things, etc.</p>
   <p>It is also a matter of fact that the Greeks, more so than any other nationality, through family and religious ties are obligated to support their families, that is, their parents, their sisters and their minor brothers and in many instances, they sacrifice their own future welfare for their sake.</p>
   <p>Now is it not better for the American Greeks to spend their money in this country having their families join them here, than send the money over to the old country to support them?</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America are extremely law-abiding. They are all very religious, belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church. There is absolutely no socialism or bolshevism or communism among them, not a single society existing in the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>A great proportion of the Greeks in America joined the American Army, perhaps a larger proportion than any other racial group, by reason of the fact that the greater part of their population consisted of males. They made good soldiers and great numbers were made American soldiers by reason of their army service.</p>
   <p>One of the largest, and one of the first American Legion Posts to be organized in Chicago was the Hellenic Post, consisting of American citizens of Greek descent.</p>
   <p>Their occupation is generally that of a merchant. It is a well known fact in Chicago that the Greeks here have done a great deal towards the improvement of real estate. They have gone extensively into the business of buying and developing corners in which their business is conducted and have greatly enhanced surrounding real estate.</p>
   <p>Chicago is indebted to the genius, perseverance and financial offerings of its citizens of Greek descent for some of its finest ballrooms, theaters, buildings, factories, restaurants, confectioneries, residences and stores.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>In proportion to their numbers compared with other nationalities, no other racial group, it can safely be stated, has done more towards advancing not only the material but the idealistic interests of the city, the state and the nation, in the short time they have been in this country.</p>
