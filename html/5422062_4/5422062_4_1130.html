   <p>p. 1. -- It causes me great sorrow to be compelled to write anything against my fellow-Greeks. Whether Venizelists or Constantinites, we are all brother-Greeks. Our differences of opinion may come and go, but Mother-Greece must endure for ever and ever. Therefore it is only my duty to our native Greece which forces me to write the following exposure to guide and enlighten the minds of all Greeks, pros and cons alike.</p>
   <p>I want the Venizelists to see how our country is betrayed and to urge them here and elsewhere to stand firm behind Mother-Greece, who is passing through dark and critical days. Greece above all things! Venizelos, who for his great patriotism will be lifted to great heights of honor and esteem in the annals of history,and King Constantine, who for his erroneous ideas or his treachery will be stigmatized, may come and go, but the Greek nation must endure.</p>
   <p>I want the Royalists to see how Mother-Greece suffers, either by the king's incapacity to rule or through his deliberate scheme to serve the <span class="page-break">\2</span>interests of others, betraying the country which he governs, and how they (the Royalists) are in error when they believe that by being Royalists or Loyalists they are serving the nation. The Royalists may see for themselves that the royal propaganda is destructive to Greece, and by following Loxias's exposures of it, they will be brought to their senses and realize that they are brother-Greeks of ours and sons of Greece. The future will reveal to us all that Venizelos is for Greece, and that King Constantine is not.</p>
   <p>Loxias has unearthed the activities of the propaganda and herewith presents a photostatic copy of a letter which was sent with telegram inclosed to Chicago from New York.</p>
   <p>The letter:</p>
   <p>Loyalists' League</p>
   <p>"Greece for Greece"</p>
   <p>59-61 Pearl Street</p>
   <p>New York, May 2, 1917</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>To the Loyalists' League,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>Brothers:</p>
   <p>You are kindly advised to wire the enclosed telegram as soon as you receive same. On account of the very high importance attached to it, please report transmission by return mail. The word "stop" indicates the beginning of a new period. If the treasury of your League is short of funds, one of you must pay the expenses and send us the receipt for remittance.</p>
   <p>I wish to remind you especially not to send any telegram to the Allied Missions because it is against the dignity of this great country.</p>
   <p>With brotherly love,</p>
   <p>Georgios P. Panagiotopoulos,</p>
   <p>Vice-President.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>And the following is the telegram inclosed which the Chicago Loyalists' League was to send to Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Hon. Robert Lansing,</p>
   <p>Secretary of State,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>In the name of five hundred thousand Greeks, mostly American citizens, of whom over a hundred thousand, veterans of the Balkan Wars, are ready to serve their adopted country under President Wilson as they were ready to serve their mother-country under King Constantine, we protest against the persistent propaganda defaming the King of the Hellenes as an autocrat. Stop. We know that true democracy in Greece is possible only under a constitutional king and that the attempted revolution headed by Venizelos utterly failed and today is maintained solely by foreign bayonets against the will of the Hellenic people. Stop. If the so-called provisional government is recognized, dictatorship, not democracy, will result in Greece, and the country of our birth will be impoverished in order that politicians, <span class="page-break">\5</span>who are seeking power to exploit a helpless people, may profit. Stop. Endorsing heartily President Wilson's declaration that America fights for the liberties of small nations, we hold that Greece has the same right to remain neutral as Holland or Denmark, and we respectfully beg the President's intervention that the pressure of starvation, which our families have so long been made to suffer in order to force them to abandon neutrality and to accept a dictator as head of the Greek State, may forthwith cease.</p>
   <p>Loyalist League of_______</p>
   <p>It is an utter shame that we should dare to hoodwink our adopted country, which will sooner or later discover our roguery, with obvious consequences. This is a direct warning which I am sending out through Loxias to those fellow-Greeks of ours who are innocent victims of the German propaganda dealt out by the court-serving Greek Legation in Washington and distributed by Solon Vlastos, an imitation Greek who publishes the yellow daily Atlantis in New York City,and who, along with all others connected with this unpatriotic propaganda, will soon be indicted by the United States Government for conspiracy <span class="page-break">\6</span>or on some other charge.</p>
   <p>I know that many of these so-called Loyalists here in Chicago are honorable Greeks, but they are in error in permitting themselves to believe such outrageous fabrications as the above telegram divulges. Common sense should tell any one that these Loyalist Leaguers are either idiots or monstrous liars. The beginning of the telegram reads, "In the name of five hundred thousand Greeks," which is an absurd and utterly unfounded fabrication, a treacherous falsehood. And we read further that "a hundred thousand veterans of the Balkan Wars who responded to Constantine's call are ready to respond to the President's call to arms." These veterans, who according to reports are now body and soul for Venizelos's policies, that is, for Greece and not against Greece, responded to the call of Greece, not to that of Constantine, and if Constantine calls them now, no one will respond because the king is working against the interests of Greece. The two-faced tactics of those idiots who are the ringleaders of the propaganda! Now in the telegram they say that they are ready to serve under the Stars and Stripes. To fight whom? The Germans! Their propaganda is for peace at all costs; <span class="page-break">\7</span>they would even surrender their country if need were in order to serve the interests of the King, the tool of the Kaiser. And "we hold that Greece has the same right to remain neutral as Holland or Denmark." While they are ready to serve in the United States Army, which will fight for the cause of liberty, justice, and democracy, at the same time they want Greece to be neutral and not to stand beside the United States. What Iscariotism! God have mercy upon those of our fellow-Greeks who are led blindly by these traitors! The time is near at hand when the American Government will take drastic action against this propaganda. Our brother-Greeks in Chicago and elsewhere who call themselves Loyalists will be wise to heed my words, come to their senses, and see the light and the truth.</p>
