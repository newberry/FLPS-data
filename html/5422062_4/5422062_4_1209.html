   <p>p. 1.- The Walking Academy of the Greek Cafe, downtown branch of the West Side group, were talking the other day on different races within the Hellenic nation.</p>
   <p>A somewhat younger one of the group said, "The Hellenic nation is composed of three anthropological groups: a) Ahepans, b) Gapans, c) Greeks."</p>
   <p>Of course, Greeks are in the minority. Ahepans lead by ten thousand while the Gapans are giving them a run for their money, "lagging" behind by eight thousand or so.</p>
   <p>The proposed dance at the Trianon on the 29th of December will be a huge affair.</p>
   <p>To assist those that are suffering from Hoover prosperity, Aliki Diplarakou has consented to appear on that evening as guest of honor.</p>
