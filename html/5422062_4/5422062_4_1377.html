   <p>All the Greeks of our city are cordially invited to attend a meeting on Sunday, 8 o'clock, at the Randolph Street Hall in order to organize a Panhellenic Union. This idea originated with none other than the Greek Consul, N. Salopoulos. We are sure that all the Greeks of Chicago will hasten to support this idea and aid him in his great national work. Mr. Salopoulos finally started doing something good for the Greeks of Chicago. Let us cooperate before this little spark of enthusiasm also dies down.</p>
