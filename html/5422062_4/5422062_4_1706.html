   <p>p. 5.- Of all the important religious holidays of the Greek Orthodox Church, Easter is the most important. Many Greeks who do not go to church the year round will attend Easter mass.</p>
   <p>Easter to the Greeks does not mean Easter Sunday alone. It includes the entire week preceding Sunday, the Twelve Evangelia, the Epitafio on Good Friday, the Anastasi, etc.</p>
   <p>This year's Easter will be perfect if this summer weather continues. In all the following churches, Holy Trinity, Annunciation, St. Constantite, Koimisis tis Theotokou, St. James, St. Basil, St. Nicholas and St. Andrews, large crowds are expected during the Holy week.</p>
