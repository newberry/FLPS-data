   <p>The majority of the members of the organization were more than satisfied by the elections of Mr. Demos, the new president, and his advisory committee.</p>
   <p>The truth is that Mr. Demos and the rest of the candidates elected have shown themselves, by their manners and their other qualifications, to be very progressive individuals.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the victors, and we wish them the best of everything.</p>
