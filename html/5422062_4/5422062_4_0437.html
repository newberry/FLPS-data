   <p>Address of the Right Reverend Alexander, Bishop of Rodostolou, and delegate of the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece to all the Greek Clergy in America and to all Orthodox Greeks, in behalf of the Victory Liberty Loan:</p>
   <p>"I feel very proud because, by reason of chance and honorific opportunity, I am enabled to make a warm and cordial appeal to the reverend priests, and to all the Greek orthodox men and women, in behalf of the loan which this great and truly Christian country is about to raise and which really deserves its name of 'Liberty.'</p>
   <p>"The devastating and bloody war which has lasted four and one-half years has now ended in a glorious and triumphant manner: in a manner which secures the liberty and independence of the nations, in a manner which makes impossible the danger which the nations had faced of losing all that is most precious, namely, their national existence. It was inevitable that at the end of this terrible war--with all its destruction, with all its losses and sufferings--that this great and <span class="page-break">2</span>liberal country should contribute its share, contribute it with no motives other than pure sympathy, love for mankind and a sense of justice.</p>
   <p>"America did not hesitate for a moment when the fatal blow was to be struck against a nation obsessed with a desire and eagerness to enslave humanity and make it serve its desires for conquest and its rapacious instincts--a nation which had provoked bloodshed and destruction beyond the conception of the imagination and without precedent in history. America did not hesitate for one moment to enter the fray and to pour out for the cause all that she could in blood, money and many other things. She gave lavishly of her vitality and energy, and showed to the world what it means to fight for such high ideals as liberty and justice.</p>
   <p>"As a small contribution to this tremendous sacrifice, unique in history, it is easy to understand what are the obligations of every citizen. These obligations are to assist by all the means at our command in the success of the Liberty Loan which is about to be raised to meet the needs resulting from the war.</p>

   <p>"Greeks have always distinguished themselves by their gratitude to this country, where they enjoy so many benefits, and I feel sure that in this present opportunity they will also not fail to show their gratitude and their feelings in a way worthy of their well-known amour propre. Therefore, it is with pride that I address myself to the reverend Greek clergy, and to all other Greeks, urging them to do all in their power, and in every possible way, to the end that the Greeks of America may be second to no nationality in the fulfillment of their duty, and in the practical and grateful expression of their gratitude by subscribing to the loan to the utmost of their ability, so that they may make a glorious success of the loan which bears the name of the most precious thing that man may have in this world--Liberty."</p>
