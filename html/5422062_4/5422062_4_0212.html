   <p>Regardless of the prevailing bad weather, and to some, the long distance to Trianon, where the young ladies society, Nea Genea, was giving the annual masquerade dance last Monday night, the Greeks of Chicago by many thousands attended the dance and had a good time among themselves. The affair was honored by the presence of the Hon. George Depasta, Consul General of the Republic of Greece, Marika Kotopouli, Greek tragediene, and many prominent Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The young ladies did their utmost to accommodate and satisfy the people who attended their affair. Everybody danced with zeal and merriment until early morning. During the dance prizes were given. The first was awarded to the group dressed in Greek national costumes, and playing Greek village musical instruments.</p>

   <p>The young ladies annual masquerade is always a delightful community affair supported by all Greeks of Chicago because it is known that the profits go to charity.</p>
