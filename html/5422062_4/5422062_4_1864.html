   <p>Representatives from the Chicago chapters to the annual Ahepan convention began leaving yesterday for Boston. One of the first to go was Louis George.</p>
   <p>The rest of the representatives will leave next Saturday. Many representatives from other cities will stop at Chicago on their way to Boston. A welcoming reception is being prepared for them which includes a banquet at the Trianon and a sight-seeing tour thru Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>Without doubt, this convention will have more representative than any other in Ahepa's history. Many Greeks are using this occasion to visit friends and relatives in Boston.</p>
