   <p>Now that the beautiful Christmas holidays are approaching each one feels the spirit of goodness and love in his soul. This year let us encourage that spirit, and let it imbue us all with a love for our needy, sick, or troubled neighbor.</p>
   <p>We know that nearly all the Greek organizations of Chicago, and especially those composed of women, are planning various benefits for needy Greek families. These organizations should be helped in their charitable deeds by all the Greeks who are fortunate enough to have retained their economic security. Although money is raised for the poor by these affairs, each one of us who purchased a ticket or made a contribution did so more as a matter of duty than because of any pronounced philanthropic tendencies. The giving was too abstract. The human contact was missing.</p>
   <p>In order to achieve the personal satisfaction which is obtained from helping <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>your fellow man, your giving must be of a different nature. Instead of helping some unknown person, choose a particular needy family and do everything in your power to make that family happy during the Christmas season. It is well known that the greatest deeds of charity and kindness are done without noise or fanfare; and without the instigation of any club or charitable organization.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, many, many Greek families in Chicago are in dire need of financial help. I do not believe that there is one among us who does not know of such a family. Let us put aside the fact that these families are of our own race and that it is our patriotic duty to help them. From a purely humane standpoint we are obligated to relieve the distress of our suffering countrymen. Just a little economy in the lavish and frequently-wasteful expenditure for our holiday dinner tables will supply some poor family with a plentiful dinner, too.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we appeal to all the Greek shoppers to remember their needy neighbor <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>when they start shopping for the holidays. Tell your grocer and butcher to send all the necessities for a dinner for two or three days to the family whom you have chosen to give a brighter and happier Christmas.</p>
   <p>The finding of a needy Greek family is pathetically easy; for they are so very plentiful.</p>
