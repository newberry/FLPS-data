   <p>The Chicago division of the American Pan-Ipirotic Society held a meeting in Hull House last Sunday. This Society consists of four clubs, namely: the Omonia, the Ipantis, the St. Nicholas, and the St. Constantine.</p>
   <p>The presidents of the Ipirotic organizations, Mr. A. Papas, John Zafiris, P. Leopos, and P. Eleftheriou, aided by the councilors, greeted the assembled members.</p>
   <p>The president of the whole Society, Mr. Sophocles Hatzigiannis, was unable to preside over the meeting, and asked Mr. Paul Demos to do so in his place.</p>
   <p>The group was addressed by Dr. C. Theodore, N. Salopoulos, C. Paleologos, and lastly by the Reverend Hatzidimitrion.</p>

   <p>The orators spoke of the superiority of Ipiros from the historical, patriotic, and geographic aspects. They said, in stentorian tones that Ipiros was the brightest star in the Greek firmament.</p>
   <p>A message in English was then telegraphed to all the Illinois representatives in Washington.</p>
   <p>We wish to congratulate these Ipiriotes for their ardent patriotism, and we wish to assure them that there is no doubt in our minds concerning the freedom of Ipiros and its reunification with the mother country.</p>
