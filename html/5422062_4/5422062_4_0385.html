   <p>Mr. Charles Vernon Vickrey, the president of the Near East Relief Committee has introduced an appeal to the American people, through which he advises them to dedicate December 2, 1923 as a day of fasting, so that their savings from this day, may be donated to the relief of the orphans of the Near East.</p>
   <p>"Flour from rice and corn is the only food with which these orphans are fed through-out the year, quotes Mr. Vickrey. Is it not possible for the American people, continues Mr. Vickrey, to fast on December 2, 1923, so as to save something for the sake of those orphans?"</p>
   <p>Mr. Vickrey exalting the interest the American people have shown said, "America has saved millons of souls of the Near East, but we must keep up our good work and not abandon it in the middle. We have more than one hundred thousand orphans <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>The majority of which are below the age of twelve. We are not only supporting these children, but also teaching them to become useful within their own community. At the age of sixteen these orphans are left to support themselves and if they don't know a trade of some kind they will doubtlessly starve to death.</p>
   <p>We are teaching them the art of carpentry, tapestry and similar trades.</p>
   <p>Five Dollars per month is enough for the support of one orphan. ONe hundred dollars a year can teach one a trade of some kind."</p>
