   <p>We deemed it advisable and beneficial before we close the chapter, dealing with the history of the church, to add a few lines in regards to the architecture and the paintings of the church.</p>
   <p>This beuatiful edifice is situated at 61st St. and Michigan Blvd, it stands upon the same grounds as its predecessor, which was destroyed by fire. In this excellent and commodious building architectual skill created a harmonious whole.</p>
   <p>The edifice is 120 ft. long, 60 ft. wide and 70 ft. high. It is an excellent type of Basilika, and has a domelike porch on which are located the offices.</p>
   <p>The principal church is divided into three parts, the divisions being composed of double lines of pillars extending to the arc-like dome. The aisles are covered with heavy and expensive rugs. The seats are of the highest quality and very comfortable. The height of the church extending to a platform which is bounded by wooden battice and terminates in an arch.</p>
   <p>Above the shrine and on both sides of the arch, are the pipes of the church organ.</p>
   
   <p>The very expensive and decorative Ikons inspire wonder, awe and devotion, to all worshipers. The aspect of the whole is so imposing, that many visitors (other than Greeks) are astounded by the architectural, beauty and stately appearance of the whole.</p>
   <p>Six of the Ikons were painted by the Russian artist, Mr. Basil Ivanoff, and some by Ludwig, the rest of the Ikons were done by Rev. John Zografos, who for many years was a student of the Arcade of Holy Sepulchre, of Jerusalem, a School which for centuries, has taught Byzantine Art.</p>
   <p>Rev. Zografos painted the Ikon of the Virgin Mary which is a reproduction of the famous painting of El Greco now hanging in the Chicago Art Institute. Rev. Zografos also painted a picture of St. Paul, teaching in the Supreme Court of Athens, and also many other pictures.</p>
   <p>All the paintings which are Byzantine reproductions were donated by Mr. John Mantas, a good soul, who is ever ready to contribute to every religious and national purpose.</p>
   
   <p>The interior decoration of the church, the order, the seats, the extreme quiteness, the Byzantine Music, the accompaniment of the church organ, the choir, under the management of Mr. George Demopoulos, teacher of Byzantine Music, the harmonious chanting of Father Petrakis and Rev. Constantine Glynos, are all factors comprising the internal panorama of the church.</p>
   <p>Next to the church is the chapel, which is used for smaller celebrations also for the performance of Baptisms and Confessions.</p>
   <p>As a masterpiece stands the Greek School partitioned from the church with commodious arcades. Its architecture is based upon educational needs, including esthetics and hygiene. The school as a whole in education rivals the best American institutions.</p>
   <p>Besides its five halls for educational purposes, it has another hall for the meetings of various societies and conventions.</p>
   <p>In closing this chapter, we may say that the church of St. Constantine and St. Helen is one of the best contemporary prototypes of the Greek Orthodox Church, not only in Chicago and America, but also in our Mother Country.</p>
   
   <p>The Church of St. Constantine was visited, last spring, by Mr. Alexander Papanastasiou, former premier of Greece, who inspite of his characteristic stoical attitude, could not refrain from admiring the edifice, and his first words were, "I am astounded, I am moved by admiration, and going back to Greece, the picture of your church will remain in my memory as a phantasmogoria. Bravo! to the Greeks of America. Bravo! to your community and your systematic progress."</p>
