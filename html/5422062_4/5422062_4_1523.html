   <p>Fellow Countrymen:</p>
   <p>"Take a look at the environment of today; look around you, and you older ones close your eyes and remind yourselves of the past. Remind yourselves of the time, 25 to 30 years ago, when you were preparing yourselves to come to America. Your dreams then were to come to America, to work, to help your parents, to help your sisters, to marry, and finally, in a few years, to make some money and return to your country and household.</p>
   <p>"Those were your dreams when you were about to come to America, when crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and when you were facing the skyscrapers and the noise of New York. Close your eyes and remind yourselves for a moment of that time, then take a good look around you today.</p>
   <p>"Take a look at yourselves, your wives, your children, daughters, friends, your compatriots, in order to understand what will power, persistence, work and honesty accomplish.</p>
   
   <p>"Could your wildest dreams of that time ever have reached the present reality?</p>
   <p>"You have come here alone, destitute, unprotected, and were looking for a countryman of yours to meet and relax in his company from the incessant daily hard labor.</p>
   <p>"Sundays and holidays were passing by and caused you to feel more unhappy, more destitute and lonely. You could not find a priest to get his blessings, to remind you of your country and religion.</p>
   <p>"You were living in a State with a large population yet solitude was overwhelming your heart. With all its riches and good things this country could not satisfy you and give what you desired. You were always strangers and misunderstood. You were looking for life, but for Greek life. You were suffocated by the environment and you were in need of Greek air, air that reminded you of your country and religion. You were endeavoring with all your might to form a community, to organize societies, to have a church, even if confined to a small single room, to find a priest for holy services and if possible, to find a teacher for your little ones in order that they might not forget their language, their religion, and their country.</p>
   
   <p>"Now take a look around you; look at what your will has accomplished. You are celebrating your national feast in such a hall as this, and these young men and pretty young girls are your children. How I would desire your compatriots to have looked at you from some corner of Greece; to have your fathers and mothers and your relatives see you. How I desire that the whole of Greece to be right in here to see you; with what a joy she would have looked at her children celebrating her freedom. How ardently she would tender her blessing to all of you and with what affection she would embrace all of you, her children, abroad, and affectionately press you against her heart.</p>
   <p>"Greece--sweet country of ours--sweet Mother of ours--glorious be your name. It will always be in having such children as you; children who left, poor and unknown, and who, by their progress today, honor your name abroad.</p>
   <p>"Thirty years labor, thirty years of toil, patience and endeavor, thirty years of strife and struggle, with discords sometimes and dissentious at other times, it is true, but always towards the same direction, towards the same right and sacred cause, these have brought about the present result.</p>
   <p>"The solitude that was pressing on your heart has disappeared forever. The Sundays and Holidays are not dark and melancholy any longer. Your children, educated in Greek and American culture, have lost neither religion nor language.</p>
   <p>"Homes where Greek life and Greek happiness reigns, feasts, gatherings, dances, concerts, lectures, theatres, schools, churches, priests, bishops, archbishops, communities, associations, societies, all are your accomplish ents; all are results of your efforts and persistence; all are honest accomplishments, an outcome of your love for your country, your religion, these all have contributed to your present grandeur.</p>
   <p>"Today you have regular communities, churches, and schools, to keep the fire of Estiades (Vestal Virgins) burning. You have a worthy Greek press that keeps you in constant touch with our country and by which you learn what is going on there. You have societies of a local aspect which have greatly contributed to the benefit of their respective villages and provinces. You have two colossal organizations, Ahepa and Gapa, which, by their power, made you a considerable factor in this great Democracy.</p>
   <p>"Look around you and you will see the results. The unknown Hellenism of America has become, today, a solid power, solid and invincible. The unimagined dream has become a reality today. Look around at our present celebration.</p>
   <p>"Associations, societies and communities, workers and business men, clergy and laymen, merchants and intellectuals, young and old, thousands, all celebrating our National Feast today. That unimagined dream has become a reality.</p>
   <p>"Stone upon stone, day by day, working for so many years, you have built a gigantic palace, a steel construction, a Greek civilization in America, whose power and might will have inestimable value for yourselves, your families, your progeny, and your country. A Greek civilization united, compact and powerful that observes, today, its National Feast.</p>
   <p>"Greek patriots, I conjure you in our sacred feast, not to destroy this edifice, for our country's interests, for your interest, and for your children's future, do not destroy what you have built.</p>
   <p>"As true Greeks, as honest citizens, as glorious descendants of those who shed their blood to give you freedom, close the ranks and forgetting all egotism and animosity, keep this National Palace erect and unshakeable.</p>
   
   <p>"I conjure you on your honor and your happiness not to let discord undermine its foundation any longer. Look around you to admire that which unity and concord accomplished.</p>
   <p>"As representative of your mother Greece, I invited you to celebrate, all together, this day of her independence. As honest citizens, as true patriots, you have come in the mass, I thank and congratulate you from the bottom of my heart for this. I thank and congratulate, the communities, societies and associations, for their prompt and kind participation; the Committee in charge of the feast which helped me along; the Greek Press which has aided me in my efforts, and through which our Mother Country will learn that the deeds of our ancestors and liberators are glorified by us in this country. I thank the clergy, who united, are blessing the feast. Equally, I congratulate and thank all of you who are present at this celebration for your love to your country and religion. The Virgin of the Annunciation is dressed up, today, in festal clothes for her fete. Greece also is so dressed because she is celebrating today. They are both here. Put your hands on your heart and you will all realize their presence. With their wishes and their blessings keep solid and unshakeable the Greek Palace of Love, Concord and Unity of today.</p>
   
   <p>"Religion, language, habits, customs, traditions, they are the Country; with them only you will prosper, progress, and promote yourselves.</p>
   <p>"The Virgin of the Annunciation and Greece are proud of you and wish you like fellow nationals, Christians, and Greeks, to celebrate their feast. They surround you in music and songs. Pray for their benediction (charis).</p>
   <p>"Rejoice, Oh! Graceful Mary, but, you too, sweetest fatherland, Greece, rejoice and again rejoice!</p>
