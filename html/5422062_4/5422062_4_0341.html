   <p>The Greek American Restaurant Association of Chicago, in its last meeting, voted the sum of $100 for the sufferers of the Mississippi Floods. The money was turned over to the Chambers of Commerce to be forwarded to the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>We urge other Greek societies of Chicago and the surroundings to contribute freely to the above purpose, for it is not only an obligation but our imperative duty to help and assist the sufferers.</p>
