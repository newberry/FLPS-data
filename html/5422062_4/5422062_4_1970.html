   <p>The Greeks of Chicago are well acquainted with the Society of Byzantine Cantors which performs such valuable services to the community and the church..... This group has given a wider horizon to the Hellenic Orthodox Church music of America.</p>
   <p>Our Society has many orbits of activity, but we do not intend to discuss them here. In our discussion of the cantors, we shall put all other church matters aside. The members who compose the organization called John of Damascus are professional church cantors. Their methods are the outgrowth of the graceful and stirring Byzantine music. The interpretation of this group should be used as a standard for the rendition of ecclesiastical music all over America.</p>
