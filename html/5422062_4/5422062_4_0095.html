   <p>p. 3--Native sons of Vryne in Olympia, Greece, who are established here in Chicago, met last week and formed a new Greek society to be known as the Fraternity of Vryniotes. One object of the new organization is mutual assistance among its members. But the real motive for the foundation of this society is the founders wish to extend liberal and systematic financial and moral assistance to their native town. A new church and new schools and public works are on the program of the Chicago Vryniotes.</p>
   <p>The unquenchable fire of Greek patriotism is again manifested in the action of the newly-organized fraternity , one of the many Greek societies in Chicago which by their contributions to Mother-Greece have banished poverty and injected life and vitality into every part of the land of their origin.</p>
