   <p>In their desire to support the extensively organized drive for funds to relieve the unfortunate Greeks of Asia Minor, the Greek Women's Club of Chicago held a special meeting in which, after considering the appeal of the Greek Consul for the organization of social benefit affairs, they decided to organize a dance which will take place on the first Friday after Greek Easter, that is, on May 10 according to the American calendar, in the grand ballroom of Sherman Hotel.</p>
   <p>The entire amount of money collected from the sale of tickets and from other collections in the ballroom--all of which receipts are exempt from any tax--will be given exclusively for the relief of our suffering fellow countrymen who are still sighing under the yoke of the Turks in Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>The only expenses will be for the rent of the ballroom, the printing of tickets, and the orchestra. As usual, all other expenses were covered by <span class="page-break">2</span>donations of generous Greek individuals. As is customary, because of the benevolent purpose of this dance, and in honor of Mrs. S. Pezas, the charming wife of the Honorable Consul-General of His majesty the King of Greece, under whose auspices it is given, the occasion will take on added brilliance because official personalities of American society will be present. For the first time in the annals of our community, distinguished American guests are honoring us with their presence, to add prestige and dignity to the Greek name.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Greeks of Chicago and vicinity are requested to support this affair promptly and wholeheartedly, since at the same time they shall spend a most pleasant evening.</p>
