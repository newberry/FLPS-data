   <p>The following speech was delivered by the eminent attorney Andrew J. Vlachos, at the celebration of Greek independence. Due to the fact that the speech is so patriotic and profound that it affects Hellenism in general, we feel impelled to print it in full as a patriotic inspiration and as a masterpiece of Greek oration.</p>
   <p>"In the first place, oh Greek Gentlemen, I consider very great, the honor given to me by the eight chapters of the Order of Ahepa of Chicago and its suburbs (of which brotherhood I am a soldier), namely the privilege of delivering to you, in the immortal language of our fathers, the panegyric on the occasion of the solemn, national feast at this, the Centennial of Greek Independence, now celebrated throughout the world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Obedient to this command, I stand before you with fear and tremble because of my boldness in attempting through my humble speech, to praise that which is beyond praise, to glorify that which is beyond glorification, and to paint graphically, the grandeur of Greek civilization which is beyond power of reproduction.</p>
   <p>Who can present to you in mere words the grandeur of Greek civilization, the magnificence of which has dominated past ages, and constitutes, even now, the pride of mankind, and is still the object of wonder by the entire civilized world? Can any orator escape the guilt of oratorical negligence, who would undertake to celebrate the struggle regeneration if he did not make reference to the "golden ages" of Greece, of which this centenary is a reflection, and without which, its existence would be doubtful?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>And who, on the other hand, is worthy to pronounce the eulogy and sing an ode to the immortal heroes of the Greek race not only during its periods of wars but of peace as well; to the heroes who for the sake of liberty, the grandeur and the glory of the nation offered themselves as a sacrifice upon the altar of Greek supremecy? Their renown, founded upon achievements, upon triumphs, and upon sacrifices, is superior to any oratorical encomium, any recital of poetical ode.</p>
   <p>Pardon me, oh immortal spirits of our fathers, if I dare, at this moment, to exalt the fame of your triumphs that are beyond all exaltation.</p>
   <p>An absolute silence of our minute at the same hour by all the Greeks of the earth, and a taar of gratitude to you, oh, immortal heroes, would constitute a more fitting oration, a more melodious ode.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In this way your descendants, who during the entire year of 1930, are celebrating by dancing and music, would worthily offer their prayer of gratitude and honor due you. Although, Greek gentlemen of America, I believe that the new generation of Greeks ought to celebrate the centenary in this way, nevertheless, I can not refuse obedience to the sacred custom of all nations of celebrating by oration and the eulogy memory of their ancestors, and therefore, according to my humble ability, I call upon the divine muse to sing the grand ode to the glorious assemblage of the noble and sympathetic audience before me.</p>
   <p>But the speaker will be unable to deliver this address if he does not gain entrance into the spirit of the ancient temples and divine muses of Greece: He must receive the gift of words from such an inspiration to deliver successfully a national ode.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>There is no orator who, at any time has worthily stood upon the rostrum, there is no poet who has ascended Parnassus; no cantor who has touched the strings of the divine lyre, who has not first entered into the sacred Odeon of Apollo, set in the grotto of the divine Muses of Greece, and heard the Athenian orator deliver his orations from the Pnyx, that he might receive the light of the divine word.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in the Aeschylusi oh celestial Tragedian and divine Prophet, I now seek refuge, that I may find the revelation of the mystery of the national drama of the Greeks, so superbly written and prophetically proclaimed in the divine tragedy, Promethews Bound.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Yes, in thee, oh great and immortal ancestor of ours, oh celestial and divine Tragedian, Aeschylus, the Greek nation in celebrating its resurrection and Independence; in thee, she finds refuge, for in that tragedy of yours she beholds herself and learns her divine destiny on earth; interprets the secret of her four hundred years of bondage, and gazes with wonder and gratitude upon the giants that killed the carnivorous vulture of power and force, broke the chains of Turkish tyranny and liberated Greece, the giver of light and the benefactor of mankind.</p>
   <p>When Zeus, the father of the gods and of men, the shifter of the clouds, in the uprising of the Olympian gods in his favor and against his father, Cronus, who was sovereign of heaven and earth, was leading from the peaks of the unapproachable Olympus, the giant battle against the revolting Titans, the sons of Uranus and Terra, Promgtheus, himself one of the Titans, took the past of Zeus and assisted in his gigantic battle of thunder bolts, and through his wisdom secured for Zeus the victory over the Titans, and established his power as the sovereign of gods and men.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>When later Zeus was determined to destroy mankind, Prometheus, having compassion upon mankind on account of their ignorance and misery, ascended to the heavens and stole from the chariot of the sun the divine light, came to earth and gave it to humanity, showed them its power and uses, taught mankind every science and art and prevented their destruction through enlightening them. He was recognized as benefactor and savior of the world.</p>
   <p>For his disobedience to Zeus, Prometheus was condemned to be tortured for endless ages, bound upon a steep rock on the shore of the ocean and according to others, upon the mountain of Caucasus.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>A carnivorous vulture, commanded by irate Jove, each might devoured the liver of the bound Prometheus, who suffered but could not die being immortal. His liver grew again each day.</p>
   <p>This great benefactor of mankind, chained to a rock for centuries, sustained the torture with fortitude and faith, because he knew from a revelation by his mother, Themis, that the day would come that a great giant would kill the vulture and liberate Promethus. In his centuries of suffering he was befriended by the Oceanides, who conforted him, in enduring the heat of the sun and frost of the north wind while he patiently waited for the Messiah to come giving him his liberty.</p>
   <p>The ages of torture passed and the expected liberator came, killed the vulture, broke the bands and set Prometheus free.</p>
   <p>This giant was Hercules!</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Having this allegorical picture in mind, oh Greek worshippers of the national enythology behold Hellas, which, through her great poets and orators, her philosophers and historians, her statesmen and artists, endowed mankind with that unique civilization which has enlightened the human intellect with the eternal illumination of her spirit, adorned the earth with her masterpieces of beauty, and taught the world every science and art.</p>
   <p>The power and force of Asiatic despot, four hundred years ago, chained Greece upon the rock of tyranny, and during the cycle of four centuries, similar to the Promethean torture preyed upon the tyrant her vitality, continually desolating and torturing her, but incapable of bringing death, because of that immortal spirit within her.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>During those four hundred years, Greece lived in bonds, in the darkness of horrible night, destitute, unprotected, deserted by all her friends and scorned by her enemies. From the falling of Haptalophos (the seven hills of the Acropolis) until the rising of the dawn at the hillock of St. Lavra (a monastery) Greece was erased from the memory of man. For them Greece existed no more than as a dream during the darkness of that night of the four hundred years of tyranny. She existed only as a roving star in a cloudy sky, scattering during the cloudless moments, dim rays of light of a past glory, of a past granduer. Greece was excluded from world affairs. She was living with the ravens of night in a desert, impassable and dry. Her muses hid in their grottoes, and her nymphs, who formerly gladdened nature with their eternal life hid in unapproachable valleys and caves. Frost and darkness covered the land; the fearful darkness of a tyrannical night reigned during which only wild beasts roamed about devouring her inner life.</p>
   <span class="page-break">11</span>
   <p>In the midst of the catastrophy and these dreadful torments, Greece found comfort and encouragement in her faithful and vigilant maidens, Faith and Hope. She found life in the unceasing activity of the Church and the school, where the apark of patriotism and the love of freedom were being kept alive. She found relief from her pains in the acclaims of her sons and daughters, who in visions, as other Oceanides, were continually encouraging, conforting, and strengthening her, in the faith, that the day would come when a new giants, in full panoply would appear, and with the everlasting sentiments of patriotism and love of freedom would kill the eating monster of tyranny, break the chains and liberate her.</p>
   <p>The time arrived, and the expected liberators appeared in full panoply to cut the bonds of Greece. The 25th of March, 1821, arose beautiful, fiery and decisive.</p>
   <span class="page-break">12</span>
   <p>The bell of a lonely monastery in Moreas rang the alarm. The banner of liberty was raised, and the trumpet sounded the signal of uprising, calling the Greeks to arms. In a moment, tyranny was shackled set on fire by fearful fighters, who sprang from the Monastery of St. Lavre under the blessings of Germanos, Bishop of Patras, who lit the fire of revolution as a fire which, during the entire course of seven years, burned to ashes the forts of the tyrant, smashed the rock of slavery, defeated the barbarian hordes and restored the former glory and freedom of Greece, Queen of civilized mankind. Each Polemarch (exalted Warrior) who had shed his blood for the freedom of Greece was a hero. The whole land of Greece is a Pantheon of heroes and the blood shed by those immortals, saturates every part of Greece.</p>
   <p>Who can picture the majesty of patriotism and love of liberty of those warriors of 1821? Oh arise thou, Homer, to sing the galaxy of new heroes of thine Iliad! And thou, oh Pindar, arise that thou mayest sing the triumphs of the new Marathon and Salamis fighters! Only the tongue of the celestial ports of Greece, can worthily praise the achievements of Kolokotrones, the triumph of Karaiskakes, the struggle of Mavromichales, the victories of Kanares, Miaoules, Kountouriotes; the glory of Mavrogennes, of Bouboulina, Androutsos, and of Niketarks, <span class="page-break">13</span>Tzavellas, Botzares, Zaimes, and of Sachtoures, Mavrokordatos, Kapodistrias, and of the rest of the sea and land fighters of 1821. Only the tongue of the immortal masters of poetry can sing the martyrdom of Diakos, the heroism of Papflesias and the rope of Patriarch. And thou, god-conversing ethereal poet of Greece, who in the tragedy of Prometheus, foresaw and foretold the great tragedy of Greece, arise again thay you may write the tragedy of Zaloggon, and the dramas of Missloonghi, of Psara, of Chios and of Crete and the rest of the glories and triumphs achieved by thy descendants.</p>
   <p>Oh Greeks of America, oh Greeks of the world, bear in mind that it was the plethora of trophies of the seven years' strife, and the rivers of blood shed by our fathers, that attracted the sympathy of sleeping mankind in behalf of struggling Greece; that rekindled the spirit of Hellenism, and that brought the three great powers England, France and Russia to help Greece in the famous naval battle of Navarino, in which the Egyptian armada was destroyed, and</p>
   <p>forced the Sultan to sign the London protocol, by which a small part of struggling Greece was declared free and independent.</p>
   <span class="page-break">14</span>
   <p>During the war of 1912-1913, Greece acquired more territory, which was yet under Turkish rule. During the World War she recovered practically all of her territory.</p>
   <p>Today, Greeks, the world over, are celebrating the Centennial of Independence, and the orators of the day inspire the celebrants with their orations refreshing our memories of the events and sacrifices and triumphs of our fathers. We, the descendants of glorious Greece, must show the world, not only in words but also in deeds, that we are really true sons of mother Greece.</p>
   <p>The spirit of our ancestors, and the eyes of all Greeks the world over, are focused upon America, where the new generation of Greece is cultivated and blossoming in the American environment. This new generation of Greek-Americans is looked upon as the builder of the new Hellenism, which shall make the glory of Greece shine more brilliantly than ever before.</p>
