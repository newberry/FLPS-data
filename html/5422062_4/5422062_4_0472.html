   <p>Fellow citizens: Never before in the history of the world has such bloodshed, such suffering, such torture, occurred as now exists in the countries of Europe.</p>
   <p>Never before has humanity been subjected to such mental and physical anguish, to such destruction of its life and material wealth.</p>
   <p>Never before has the entire world organized to help some of its unfortunate inhabitants, regardless of race, color, or creed.</p>
   <p>Never before have the modern Greeks had the opportunity to show the rest of the world their humane and philanthropic feelings as they have now, by aiding <span class="page-break">\2</span>the efforts of the Greek Red Cross campaign committee.</p>
   <p>The Greeks in America, realizing the fact that America--the land of truth, justice, and democracy--defends our mother country, Greece; know that it is our duty to show some appreciation.</p>
   <p>It is our duty to show the world that the Greeks are good American citizens and are worthy of being called Americans.</p>
   <p>This is our only opportunity to repay the American Red Cross for the funds they collected for the refugees of Greece in 1881.</p>
   <p>Any worth-while effort we make will be remembered by the American people and will help us to establish ourselves more firmly in this, our adopted country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Let us raise more money than any other foreign group in America. We can if we try hard enough.</p>
   <p>Offerings to the American Red Cross are not only an obligation but actually a duty of the Greeks.</p>
   <p>The Greek Red Cross Campaign is guided by a central committee of eight well-known men, and by twenty regional committees of three. The Greek committee is not seeking small individual donations to the American Red Cross; it wants the sums which are given, to be credited to the Greek Fund.</p>
   <p>Show the American populace that the Greeks are an appreciative, humane race of people.</p>
   <p>(signed) Central Committee.</p>
