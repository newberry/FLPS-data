   <p>At the Chicago Orphanage Asylum there are thirty Greek orphans that are not forgotten. On Thanksgiving day, these thirty orphans were invited to a benquet given by the family of P. Koliakopoulos at St. Constantine Church hall. Rev. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>arous Petrakis sends a teacher twice a week to the asylum to teach these children Greek. We are proud to hear of these things!</p>
