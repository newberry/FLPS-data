   <p>p. 1.- In the beautiful and majestic Shoreland Hotel, our young girl's society, Nea Genea, gave a formal dinner and dance in honor of "Miss Europe" who is visiting in Chicago. In this never-to-be-forgotten formal reception to "Miss Europe", only those on a carefully selected list were invited.</p>
   <p>Every attribute that we possess in culture, the arts, science, or commerce, participated. Everything was prepared with attention to detail for this delightful festival. The graceful Miss Chariclia Mitsoula, Pres., in a smart speech thanked "Miss Europe" and all those participating in the gala gathering.</p>
   <p>Dancing followed until midnight.</p>
