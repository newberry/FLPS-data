   <p>Sunday,July 30th and Monday, July 31st, are the days set by our District Governor, Arthur H. Peponis, for our District Convention. Last year's convention selected Chicago Heights to be the place where the convention was to be held. The stage is being set, the actors, also known as delegates, have been selected by their respective chapters, the role that they are to play remains to be seen. It is a well known fact that no performance is a success, no matter how capable the actors, unless there is a good size of audience.</p>
   <p>At the San Francisco national convention of our Order, the Ahepa domain was divided into thirty-six districts. At that time the constitution provided that a District Governor was to be the head of the district, but the Baltimore convention added four more officers to that of the office of the District Governor. Each district from now on will be governed by five District Lodge officers. In order for the District Lodge to function as an organization, the last national convention decreed that a portion of the per capita tax and initiation fees were to go to the district treasury.</p>
   
   <p>Conventions have two objects for their existence. In smaller communities the various social functions that are sponsored by the committees are of great benefit to the Greek citizens in general. An opportunity is afforded, and perhaps the only time, for the Greek citizens of the community to extend invitations to the city, county and state officials to be present and meet them. In many instances such gatherings were the first of their kind. The American officials had never realized that such a Greek element had existed in this country. Many erroneous impressions of the Greek people were corrected and the seed of mutual appreciation was sown. That is in our estimation the greatest service rendered by the Order of Ahepa to our people throughout the country. That is, also, the reason for having thirty six conventions instead of one. It is only regrettable that we cannot estimate the value of this service in dollars and cents. If we could the figures would astound us. The other object is to elect the officers for the coming year and to deliberate on the program that is to be followed by those elected.</p>
