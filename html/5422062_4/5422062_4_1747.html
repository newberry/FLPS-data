   <p>Christmas Day was magnificently and joyously celebrated last December by all the Greeks of Chicago. Huge crowds attended Christmas Mass as well as the magnificent and impressive ceremonies on Christmas Eve. Both our church, the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, and the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin on North LaSalle Street, heeded the suggestion of The Greek Star and held two divine liturgies or masses on Christmas morning in order that all the members of the Greek community of Chicago might participate in the magnificent celebration of the birth of Christ.</p>
   <p>All those who are named Christ, celebrate the anniversary of their name day on Christmas, according to the custom and tradition of the Greek church. During the day, friends and relatives visit all those who are named Christ or Christina, and offer gifts and exchange presents near the beautifully decorated fireside.</p>
   <p>A spirit of grace and divine exaltation fills our hearts on Christmas, when, more than any other time of the year, we are conscious of a feeling of love and of the universal brotherhood of man in the spirit of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, who came into the world to redeem humanity from its sins and to inspire all the people of all the nations with the spirit of charity, kindness, hope, faith, and good will toward all men.</p>
   <p>The souls of all Christians are uplifted in contemplation of divine goodness and heavenly peace when they hear the beautiful and angelic hymns and chants of our church.</p>
