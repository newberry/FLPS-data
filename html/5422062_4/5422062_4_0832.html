   <p>Now that the graduation exercises of our Hellenic schools are over and we have been thrilled because a few of our young generation have managed to learn a few fundamentals of the Greek language, we enter upon the period of community inactivity. The multitudinous picnics are the only breaks in our social lull. Lacking a centrally organized community, which is imperative to a successful and fruitful social program, we allow matters to develop in a direction which holds no good for our future existence. Thousands of problems beset us--problems that belong to each one of us; yet there is no joint action being taken by the community to solve them.</p>
   <p>The surface seems to be calm, but this is not at all indicative of the condition of affairs beneath the surface; this is known by the priests and the boards of directors of our various churches.</p>
   
   <p>Many dollars are taken in, but they are lost in the chaos of expenses, which are far higher than is necessary. In another column there is printed a facsimile of the check written by the community of St. Basil as first payment on its debt.</p>
   <p>We who follow parish activities know and appreciate the labor, zeal, and interest which made the raising of that amount possible.....</p>
   <p>It should be possible, however, to amass such a comparatively small sum without so much sacrifice; and the committee should not have to cultivate the spirit of co-operation in the breasts of the parishioners....As matters stand now, we are proceeding without a compass and minus a goal or purpose. We merely solve our small daily problems. The large ones are put aside for tomorrow.</p>
   <p>The problem of a central united community, organized somewhat on the plan of the government of the United States, is becoming increasingly important.</p>
