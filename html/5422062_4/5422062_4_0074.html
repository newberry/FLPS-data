   <p>p. 2.- The Kosmitan Society, St. Anargyrus, is giving a dance tomorrow evening, March 6, 1910 at Sivorce's Hall, 4300 S. State Street. We don't need to describe Kosmitan dances. They always have Greek orchestras and the entire family is invited. Everybody is welcome.</p>
   <p>That is why the dances are always successful. Free refreshments will be served as well as beer, wine, lamb, chicken, fruits, pastries, etc. Kosmitans will be required to pay fifty cents for admission. Everyone else can enter free.</p>
