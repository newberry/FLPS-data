   <p>The board of directors of the Holy Trinity Greek Community of Chicago, of which Mr. Bill Georgacopoulos is president, sent $850 the day before yesterday to Her Majesty, Queen Sophia of Greece. The money represented the net proceeds of the annual community picnic which was given for the benefit of the orphans and the casualties of the war.</p>
   <p>The patriotic and loyal members of the board, as well as all those who supported the cause, must be highly commended for their initiative and humanitarian spirit.</p>
   <p>May more church and local benevolent organizations emulate this fine example!</p>
