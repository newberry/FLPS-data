   <p>On May 15, at eight o'clock a huge dance will be given at the Coliseum Annex, 15th Street and Wabash Avenue. Its purpose is to begin a fund for the erection of a Chicago Greek Hospital. Mrs. Maria Polizaki is in charge of the dance.</p>
   <p>It is true that this work should have been started a long time ago, but alas, our community did not unite soon enough for its own interests. The proceeds of the dance will go into a bank under the name of the hospital, which is The Holy Apostles. Members of the committees will be the leading citizens of our community.</p>
   <p>Attend this dance.</p>
