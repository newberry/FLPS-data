   <p>Last week a group of young men and women of the Methodist Episcopal Church were directed to "Greek Town" by their pastor, Reverend Ralph Mautone.....</p>
   <p>The Epworthians, after being taken by Mr. Peter Semadis to the St. Basil Church, the Holy Trinity Church, and many other places of interest, finally arrived at the International Restaurant of Mr. Andrew Spyropoulos, where a full-course Greek dinner was served to about seventy-five people.</p>
   <p>After-dinner speeches by Mr. Paul Javaras and others were given....As a final touch to this friendly visit, the group sipped coffee at the Liberty Cafe.</p>
   <p>All carried lasting impressions home with them.</p>
