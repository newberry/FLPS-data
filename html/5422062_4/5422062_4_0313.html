   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Many of the children in the Near East Relief orphanges are very eager for healthy reading matter, and their books are scarce.</p>
   <p>We especially appeal to Greek publishers and libraries for books on general cultural subjects, and novels, which they will contribute for use by the children in the institutions overseas.</p>
   <p>Many families probably have books they no longer use; we would be glad to accept them for our wards.</p>
   <p>Books in English would also be acceptable, as many of the children can read simple stories and text-books, and are grateful for the means and opportunity to do this.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>All books should be sent postpaid to Near East Relief, 151 Fifth Avenue, New York City.</p>
   <p>Will you kindly give the above appeal whatever publicity you may be able to? Thanking you for your cooperation, I am</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>John R. Voris,</p>
   <p>Associate General Secretary.</p>
