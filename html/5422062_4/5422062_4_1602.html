   <p>p. 1- We publish in an adjacent column an announcement by the four regular parishes in Chicago, in which the Greek community in Chicago is informed of the celebrations contemplated for the national holiday and of the lies which are being circulated on programs bearing the signatures of the North Side, West Side, and South Side parishes.</p>
   <p>These programs allege that the Consul general, Mr. Depasta, will officiate at some little-known West Side church on the day of the celebration, whereas the consul general himself has announced that he will be present to hear the doxology in the North Side's new church in the Masonic Temple.</p>
   <p>This matter will be further discussed tomorrow.</p>

   <p>Note:- This next translation from an adjacent column of the same newspaper is the "announcement by the four regular parishes in Chicago" mentioned in the comparatively short translation preceding. Both treat more or less of the same topic and have the same end in view - to reveal the falsehoods being circulated on programs of celebrations of the national holiday.</p>
