   <p>p. 1- The sympathy which the entire country has shown over the unhappy incident of the Lindbergh kidnapping bespeaks the noblest of human emotions, our inherent and inborn love for our kind.</p>
   <p>True, we are not so easily moved when the same fate befalls the sons of less prominent persons in the land, but that does not in any way minimize the measure of sympathy displayed in all similar cases. By the nature of things the kidnapping of the son of a noted man attracts the attention of the public more than if the father had been less famous. Every human being knows and understands that so far as paternal love is concerned, there are no distinctions of social class.</p>
   <p>Along with this wave of sympathy come wonder and amazement that such acts can be committed in a country that claims to be civilized. Press and pulpit demand that kidnapping be made a federal offense, and that punishment be swift and adequate. Few, if any, of our clergy have had anything to say about prohibitions being even indirectly responsible for numerous <span class="page-break">2</span>crimes that shame our civilization. If instead of offering prayers for the safe return of the child they had made a sociological study of the crime question, future generations might not speak of us as unenlightened, as we ourselves speak of the people of the Middle Ages.</p>
