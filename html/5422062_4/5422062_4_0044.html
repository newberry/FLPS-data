   <p>Who does not know the Tegeans, those patriotic, noble, and progressive fellow countrymen who hail from Tegea, Arcadia?</p>
   <p>Next to the Chicago Spartans, they are the first Greek immigrants of Chicago. They built a Greek church about twenty years ago, and from this busy church they founded the Greek community of Chicago. The Tegeans led in establishing the first local Greek organization in America. They contributed more than three-quarters of the cost for building the Holy Trinity Church of Chicago, our first Greek church. The well-known and energetic Mr. James Kogionis was one of the hardest-working Tegeans.</p>
   <p>We do not know why this first organization of theirs was dissolved. We will leave this matter with our forefathers who bequeathed to us the fatal and mortal germs of civil strife and hatred now existing among us. It is this curse that destroys all our plans for any fine and worthy institution. It is a wonder how, with all this internal strife, the Parthenon stands erect.</p>
   <p>But, we should let the heavy veil of forgetfulness cover up the tragedies of the past. We might as well turn to the present and the future, as they are the only things which should interest us now.</p>
   <p>So today the Tegeans--and there are more than two thousand of them in Chicago-- have decided to organize and reshuffle their ranks; they have forged that golden chain, which in our beautiful language is called "unity".</p>
   <p>Unity! who in the world has uttered a more beautiful, a more divine word? Unity is our country's protector. It is strength, power, progress, and democracy. Oh, Unity! when will you reign supreme in all your majesty among all the Greek people?</p>
   
   <p>Those who conceived of the idea of a union of the Tegean people were less in number than the founders of the Philike Etairia. [Translator's note: A famous secret revolutionary Greek society, translated: Society of Friends. It contributed greatly toward the gaining of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829.] They met, discussed, and made the necessary arrangements for the formation of the union with energy and determination.</p>
   <p>According to an understanding reached at a previous meeting, they assembled in the hall of Hull House one Sunday in order to ratify the bylaws and constitution. During this conference, the ablest, the wisest, and the most experienced Tegeans discussed all the questions which concern our status in America; our present situation in regard to matters of organization, church, education and general social improvement were also extensively dealt with.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nicholas Salopoulos, a Tegean and prominent physician, with twenty years' experience in the economic and professional field in Chicago, eloquently set forth the aims of the new Tegean Society. He advised those present of the indivisible and marvelous force of unity and concord. He enumerated the benefits that may be derived from such a force.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chris Malires, a prominent and highly respected Tegean, and a pioneer in the Tegean Society, spoke enthusiastically about the brilliant future of the present endeavor. It is no exaggeration when we say that Mr. Malires is a man of indomitable strength of will, and inexhaustible energy. He has set aside all personal ambition and desire for power and is satisfied to serve as a simple soldier. Mr. Malires proposed the establishment of a special fund to be formed by the profits of the annual picnics, and contributions by other Tegeans outside of Chicago. He also expressed the hope that one of the Greek people's fondest desires, the founding of a Greek high school in Chicago with the support and co-operation of the three Greek parishes and the various organizations of Chicago, will be fulfilled. This institution will attract many American children also, according to Mr. Malires. This indefatigable worker is willing to travel through all the states at his own expense, for the purpose of collecting subscriptions from all Greeks.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. James Kogionis proposed the erection and financing of a hospital in Tegea, Greece. This great patriot, with a fiery and dynamic personality, expressed the conviction that the Tegean Society will become one of the greatest Greek organizations in the United States. He said: "From experience I know that many great things are accomplished by the determination, energy, and unselfishness of even a few, and not by the wrangling and confusion of the many. Therefore, I prophesy that the Tegean Society will do great things. As a reporter, I wish to congratulate the enterprising and ambitious Tegeans, those who conceived of the benefits to be derived from their organization, and the generous supporters and donors for their help toward the building up of a strong treasury."</p>
   <p>Mr. Gregory Karkazis had the honor of making the greatest single donation.</p>
   <p>We congratulate you again, Tegeans, and offer you our sincere wishes for the realization of all your noble objectives.</p>
