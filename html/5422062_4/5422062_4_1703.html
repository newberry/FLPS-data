   <p>Last Sunday, thousands had gathered at the church named in honor of St. James to celebrate his holiday. Thousands of other Greeks visited friends and relatives who were named after St. James or had parties in their homes.</p>
   <p>On Sunday evening "Solon" school of St. James Church gave a dance. Many attended. An orchestra played both Greek and American selections. Both young and old alike had a good time.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the board of directors, the faculty of the school and many others who helped make the evening a grand success.</p>
