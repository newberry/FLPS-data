   <p>Our community is well aware of the blessed and philanthropic task that the ladies auxiliary of the Charitable Brotherhood of Chicago perform. This philanthropic work, which is acknowledged and appreciated by the whole Greek community of Chicago, has been undertaken for years. Because of that, whenever an appeal is made to this Greek Society for support, it is given in full measure.</p>
   <p>Among the best gatherings, that the Charitable Brotherhood by the ladies auxiliary, have organized, are the afternoon gatherings in which informal games and bunco are played. A small art program is presented and refreshments are served.</p>
