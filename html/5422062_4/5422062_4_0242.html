   <p>Work has started after several meetings of the many clubs in our city to help the needy Greek people this winter. At the last meeting there were over fifty representatives, most of them women. Ahepa led the way by contributing $800 to the cause. Gapa gave $300. Nine other united organizations gave $400. Many small clubs gave fifty dollars a piece.</p>
   <p>The $1,500 mark has already been passed and we are confident that soon we will reach $5000. We all know what a hard winter this is going to be so we are asking everybody to help with contributions, food and clothing. The offices are at 1 North La Salle St. Make all checks payable to the United Greek Charities of Chicago.</p>
