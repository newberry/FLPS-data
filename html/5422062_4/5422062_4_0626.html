   <p>A Greek named Haralampos Bratsolias, age 45 years, last Tuesday night entered George Bougioukos' grocer store, drew his gun and fired point blank at Bougioukos, whom he killed instantly. He then place the gun against his temples and committed suicide.</p>
   <p>The murder and the suicide were committed with such rapidity, that two eye-witnesses were unable to prevent the acts. One of the witnesses was Nick Bougioukos, nephew of the dead man, who said to the authorities the murderer was a former partner of his uncle, and that he had the delusion that he had been defrauded of large sums by Bougioukos. Both the slain were natives of Megaloupolis and men with families.</p>
