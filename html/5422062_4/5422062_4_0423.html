   <p>Miss Rena Kyriakopoulos is giving a recital at the Sheridan House on November 24. Following the recital there will be a dance.</p>
   <p>The Athenian Women's club, called the Panhellenic Greek Womans' Club, has been doing a great deal of worth-while work for the orphans of the war. Recently they decided to reorganize and work in the same manner as the American Y.W.C.A. Their aim is to educate, protect, and support the orphaned girls of Asia Minor. In order to raise money for this purpose they asked all the Greek people to aid them.</p>
   <p>The recital of Miss Rena is for this purpose. We hope that the community will support this affair, because of its worthy purpose.</p>
