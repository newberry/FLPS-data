   <p>The Greek Women's Charity Association was organized only recently by the Greek women of Chicago. The latter have undertaken to establish an organization of prime importance and inestimable usefulness to our community. It can produce much good and draw praise to Greek humanitarianism and Greek womanhood; these must work in Chicago just as they do in Greece where everyone, irrespective of class or age, from the queen to the humblest peasant girl, is working for a great social cause.</p>
   <p>Here, especially, we are in greater need of the Greek woman's services and charitable activity, because we have many poor Greek families in our community and because we are far from our homeland in a new, strange country; away from our loved ones; away from our relatives and friends from whom, in time of need or sickness, we received words of comfort and every possible assistance. How many times have we seen the sick take a turn for the better and improve at the very sight of beloved relatives and friends? How many times have we seen many, who were gravely ill, receive great comfort and be saved from death by the kind presence of the queen or some other kind woman? A touch of the hand, a small gift, a bouquet of flowers can have a great beneficial psychological effect on the sick or wounded. A kind word, a word of consolation, the news that money has been sent to the patient's family or that work has been found for the wife or husband or any other member of the family can gladden the soul of a distressed patient.</p>
   <p>So, is there any other more noble more human institution than a charitable one: a hospital, a dispensary, a first-aid center, or even an association of people whose purpose it is to alleviate suffering?</p>
   <p>There is no more divine sentiment than the one of charity. It was because of this ideal of human charity and kindness that our Lord Jesus Christ descended to the earth to save the lost generation of men who were victims of sin, moral and spiritual degradation, sickness, and misery.</p>
   <p>The same supreme and divine love that was in Jesus' soul and which He taught and imparted to humanity must become a part of us and must inspire us to teach it to our fellowmen and to those who are afflicted with spiritual, moral, and physical ills. Only then shall we be called humanitarians. The divine Plato, one of the greatest and most brilliant intellects of all time, said, "Charity is a habit of human conduct and character which expresses man's love for man. It is a most beneficial human habit." The psalmist says, "Blessed is he that shows mercy to the poor for in days of pain and misery the Lord shall give salavation." So, charity is the greatest virtue; it is the only virtue, which, if one really possesses, then he possesses all others. Such a man is righteous, merciful, good, magnanimous, and a benefactor; in short, he is a virtuous man; and virtue is the habit of doing good.</p>
   <p>Since ancient times the Greeks were the first humanitarians; they were the only race of men whose aim it was to civilize and spread the principles of equality and justice for the benefit of mankind. Because the Greeks saw that the principles of Christianity were identical with their own, they adopted the Christian religion and the entire moral and spiritual philosophy of Christ's church. Pagan and age-worn Greece gained new strength and new life in its efforts to serve humanity and enhance its happiness by teaching virtue, truth, justice, and beauty.</p>
   <p>So, Hellenism, Christianity, and charity have about the same meaning. They seek to attain the same objective: the elevation of man; that is, the highest possible perfection of man.</p>
   <p>Such an organization as the Greek Women's Charity Association cannot but win the confidence of all, and must receive the wholehearted support of the great Greek community of Chicago. Who will refuse to assist this excellent group of women, the fruits of whose efforts will be shown very soon?</p>
   <p>I have been informed that fortunately all have received with joy the good news of the establishment of a charitable institution amongst us; most of us have offered to support it and the fine women who direct it with every possible material and moral means. I am firmly convinced that it will progress and become firmly rooted in our community. There is no doubt that later we shall receive the full benefits and blessings.</p>
   <p>There are many hundreds of our people in the city's hospitals and other state institutions who, at the sight of one or more of the visiting ladies from the Charitable Association who speak words of comfort in our own native language to them, receive such psychological relief and encouragement that their sick condition is sometimes quickly improved.</p>
   <p>The Association, therefore, has a high and sacred aim. It is worthy of all encouragement. Now, it is up to the Greek women organizers, these kind and humanitarian pioneers of our society, to bring their noble task to a successful conclusion; first, because they are the logical persons to undertake such a task; and, second, because the Greek press and people are willing to contribute in every way to the progress of their charitable undertaking. Furthermore, the corps of Greek doctors in Chicago have said that they are always willing to render their services fully. We were all greatly enthused to hear that all classes of our people--our businessmen, our professional men, etc.--are only too glad to do their part.</p>
   <p>So, all the means which ensure the success and progress of such an undertaking are readily available. Two elements are, obviously, absolutely essential in the Greek women's efforts; they are, time, and a true spirit of unity and harmony. Unfortunately, these two essential and fundamental requirements are absent among our men who are so busy and so one-sidedly occupied with their daily work.</p>
   <p>Greek women everywhere are and have always been well known for their ambition, industry, and progressive spirit; they have raised human charity and kindness to the place of a religion, so the task which they have begun under such auspicious circumstances is bound to be what we have the right to expect it to be. May we see their noble task crowned with complete success in the very near future.</p>
