   <p>p.6--We continue to-day the speeches delivered by various ladies and gentlemen at the dinner given in Mother's honor.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of our community who attended the dinner showed great devotion to Mother and a desire to support her in her undertakings.</p>
   <p>The address delivered by Mrs. Kotakis follows.</p>
   <p>"Dear Mother! Mother came to America after first deliberating whether she should leave her native land to cross the ocean and visit a strange country, and she decided to do it, knowing that she was coming to five hundred thousand Greek patriots. Yes, patriots, because it is characteristic of Greeks to be patriotic, except a very small number who are not worth any one's attention, since they recognize no national ties, and to-day they may feel flattered to be called Americans, while to-morrow they may deem it more profitable to be known as Chinese, Turks, or Bulgarians.</p>
   
   <p>Their motto is, 'Your fatherland is where your interests are.' For them life is only a material affair and has no higher meaning.</p>
   <p>"Mother now finds herself among these Greek men and women of Chicago who because of their esteem and love for her have decided to give this farewell dinner in her honor. But this esteem and love for her is not limited to us; it emanates from all the Greek people in Chicago. Consequently Mother has experienced neither bitterness nor despair among us and has found no coolness or lack of interest wherever she has asked for vigorous support; she has not had to shed the tears which fall when one's hopes are dashed to pieces. Why? What are the reasons for such love, for such esteem?</p>
   <p>"Do not ask, Mother of ours! We would rather not answer. Do not ask! We would rather not raise the veil which covers our inner feelings. Let us merely strip roses of their petals, and strew them over the sources of our love.</p>
   
   <p>"To-day we have brought you here to tell you how much we love you, how much we admire you, how much we thank you for comforting those beloved boys who sacrificed for their fatherland the most precious things which they possessed,--their health and their life. How many adorable boys have closed their eyes forever! But they were comforted in their supreme agony because in that last cruel moment you whispered to them words of love, of tenderness, of sympathy, to accompany them on their fateful journey. And when the war was ended, and the boys were permitted to return to their parents and to the joys of life, on many of those boys the joys of life had closed their doors forever. With haggard faces, shriveled lips, and bowed shoulders they dragged weary limbs and despaired of recovery. Poor unfortunate creatures! There was no hope for them. The heart of Mother ached at such suffering. She decided to save them. But how? She would make one great house in which she could lodge all the sick boys and there nurse them back to health. An imposing, laborious, colossal undertaking indeed! But the need was imperative, and Mother decided that to satisfy that need would be her aim in life. Over three continents she traveled, and the idea, the aim, became substantial and took on flesh, and the sanatorium sprang up almost to its completion.</p>
   
   <p>"But to mention the building alone is not enough. I wish that I were able to present to your eyes a moving picture with proper dramatic emphasis, of the full scope of the enterprise in which our generous countrymen's dollars are being used. Here the money is leaving Mother's hallowed fingers. Behold it changing! See the bed of comfort on which a weary, aching body is laid! Hear the sigh of relief! See how doctors and white clad nurses attend him! See the medicine which they are giving him! How well he is getting! Now they are bringing him nourishing food. His eyes have become brighter, and he looks about with an air of contentment. He is feeling much better! Slowly, slowly his lips are regaining their color. His face is no longer cadaverous. He sits up! His back has straightened! Stronger and stronger--he arises! He is on his feet again! He is well! But before he leaves, he stops and stands before the portrait of Mother which adorns the sanatorium. He is whispering something! Let us stop a moment to listen.</p>
   <p>"'I thank you, Mother, and I thank all those who helped you. God bless you!'</p>
   <p>"How I wish that we could give, not in vision but in reality, all their health back to those poor boys!</p>
   
   <p>But what we cannot do with our own hands our money will do for us.</p>
   <p>"Mother, we will not forget you! You will not grow old, Mother! You will not die! You will finish your work!</p>
   <p>"And now, beloved Mother, we wish you bon voyage! On the road you will meet courteous and sympathetic people, and you will also meet some who are foolish, rude, and ungrateful. Forgive them, Mother, and continue on your journey! You will always have with you the blessings and the gratitude of the Greek nation."</p>
   <p>Mother's address follows.</p>
   <p>"My dear ladies, I am delighted and proud of my race to find that my humanitarian aim has brought me thus far!</p>
   
   <p>"To-day is a day which I shall always remember because to-day I have experienced your hospitality and your interest in my sacred enterprise. Perhaps I am the first Greek woman who has come to America to importune you. You have accorded to me such generosity and such love that I feel highly encouraged to continue my work, and her needs.</p>
   <p>"Above all, preserve your language and your faith for the good of your children! Never let them forget that they are Greeks! Permit me also to remind you that whatever you may do for your original mother-country, you have obligations on this side of the water as well. Do not depend on Americans for everything. First you must attend to the matter of Greek schools in America. Second, as long as you have no Greek hospital here nor any Greeks who are too poor to pay hospital fees, let your people continue to use the American facilities. But remember, dear ladies, that it is your duty to think of our sick, especially on those important days when every soul feels its national kinship the strongest.</p>
   
   <p>One small gift on those days will be remembered by those who are far away.</p>
   <p>"And now there is one favor which I ask of you. Do not forget my work when I have left America! Do not cease to help us both for your own sakes and for the sake of your kinsmen abroad! I suggest that the presidents of all your societies unite to form a committee which will also include their wives. Then once a year this committee might organize a philanthropic festival in the interest of the sanatorium, and all donations would go to help our poor invalids.</p>
   <p>"Now kindly permit me to thank individually the wife of your priest Mrs. Petrakis, who first suggested our meeting at this dinner here to-day. I thank her personally and Mrs. Latsis as well, who as president worked exceptionally hard to make the dance at the Trianon a success. I thank Mrs. Maleris because she first volunteered to sell tickets. I thank all the ladies for their interest in my work, and I hope to use your splendid support as an example to be followed by other Greek women in the cities which I intend to visit."</p>
