   <p>On the Northeast corner of Sheridan Road and North Shore Ave, Mr. John Venizelos, our enterprising young Greek, will soon build a four story apartment building of Athenian type, at a cost of $35,000.</p>
   <p>A roof garden will beautify the building according to plans of architects Bouchard and France. The lot is 50 x 150 sq. ft.</p>
