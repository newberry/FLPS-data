   <p>p. 4- We have read in the Greek newspaper Eleutheron-Vema an encomium of the mercifulness of the American people, written by Stephanos Harmidas, which is an echo of the sigh of relief which has gone up from the hearts of our brothers who have been suffering martyrdom. We take the privilege of publishing these words of praise.</p>
   <p>"The springs of American compassion are inexhaustible. America never fails to pour the balm of consolation whenever it hears the mournful cry of misfortune.</p>
   <p>"Whenever two hands are lifted in the prayer of desperation, comfort comes from the matchless Christian Country of America, accompanied by words of sympathy, inspired by the boundless and incomparable charity of the great American heart. They leave their happy and peaceful country, their warm houses and fire-sides to plunge into the adventure of the unknown and to see misfortune at close range, to heal wounds, and to wipe away the tears of misery. In the depths of America's great and tender heart are inexhaustible wells of love.</p>

   <p>"And these wells overflow in fresh. sweet streams of charity, setting to music the supreme hymn of love, which was first uttered by Jesus of Nazareth. The wholesome streams cleanse unhealed wounds and drive away the swarms of vultures like a boundless pool of Siloam. America's charity brings happiness to those who have lost it, gives hope to those in despair, and banishes misfortune.</p>
   <p>"And now when fate has piled up under the azure skies of Greece so many misfortunes, when exiles are being driven to the shores of the homeland in hunger and in rags, the American soul is touched again. Again these leaders in philanthropy have left their beloved country and with their hearts full of pity and tenderness have come to Greece, that the spirit of happiness may wipe the tears from the eyes of our long suffering brethren who have survived the catastrophe brought upon Asia Minor by the Turks."</p>
