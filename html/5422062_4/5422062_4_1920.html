   <p>p. 1.- Last Sunday evening's luxurious banquet was given in the St. Andrews parish hall, in which 150 eminent individuals of our community were seated, and had a wonderful time helping to swell the funds of the church.</p>
   <p>It was an excellent opportunity, indeed, of enjoying the supper, in the first place, and secondly, to hear the songs, ecclesiastical choirs, and masterly speeches, by the Right Rev. Kallistos, the Very Rev. Tsourounakis, the Doctors, N. Salopoulos and K. Papatheodorou, as well as Mr. G. Palaeologos. They all urged faith to our religion and devotion to the ideals of our glorious race.</p>
