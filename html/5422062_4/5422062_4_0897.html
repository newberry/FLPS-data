   <p>Word came from Bluff Lake, Ill., that unusual preparations had been made this year to accomodate the ever-increasing list of Greek families, who, during the scorching months of the summer, prefer to spend their usual vacations at this delightful place.</p>
   <p>Noted families among the old timers vacationing at Bluff Lake are those of Geo. Aliferis with his alluring daughter, Catherine; K. Paleologos and his family; G. Manos'; P. Grafus'; P. Retsinas; T. Fourlas'; C. Kumungis'; N. Parpas and others.</p>
   <p>The three month vacation, of these and other Greek families, of Chicago, in this well chosen spot, gives this summer resort a touch of reminiscence of the ancient Bacchanalia. Of course Bacchus is not the reigning sovereign here.</p>
