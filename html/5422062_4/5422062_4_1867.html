   <p>The work of the Gapan women was over as soon as they had completed the costumes to be used in the Greek dancing which took place at the Grand Ball. With only a few hours sleep, the representatives got down to business on Friday in order to clean up matters. They continued discussing various questions till late at night.</p>
   <p>All day Saturday, business was rushed through so that there would be ample time for the new elections. All business was finished by 8 o'clock and a huge banquet followed.</p>
   <p>This banquet was the climax of the week's events and was attended by practically every representative to the convention totaling over three hundred. The president of Chicago's Gapa, Dr. George Gavaris began the speech making. Lawyer John Gekas, representative of Ypsilantes chapter was next and served as chairman.
