   <p>To all who contributed materially and morally to the release of my brother Charalampos Palaeologos, convicted by a miscarriage of justice and condemned to prison for a term of twelve to twenty years, I express my boundless gratitude. In particular I consider it my duty to thank my fellow-countrymen who by cooperating with me in my endeavors have so helped to free my brother.</p>
