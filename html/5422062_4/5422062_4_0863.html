   <p>The schools all over America are once again opening their doors to the army of children ready to pass through their portals and receive invaluable educational benefits. Each child approaches his schoolroom with a dignified and respectful mien; for the children of America respect their teachers, and love the happy hours spent within the classrooms.....Some children have occasion to respect their schools even more than their homes. They find in their schools peace and quiet, and the atmosphere of culture--art and music,--through which they express their emotions.</p>
   <p>Many parents turn their children over to the school at an early age, and expect them to emerge properly educated, refined, intelligent, respectful, and well-mannered. This, of course, is not possible. The child receives most of its training along these lines from his home environment. Greek parents are very often disappointed at the way their children emerge from the American public schools. They are foolish. It is easily understandable that the American school, filled with children of all nationalities, cannot give the Greek child a special Greek cultural background. We want our children to speak our language and conform to Greek customs; but that cannot be accomplished as long as they are educated in American schools.</p>
   <p>The educational facilities of America are unparalled. However, any people which does not desire to become obliterated and seeks to preserve its ideals and language, must have schools of its own. Then the future generations will be familiar with them from early childhood and will therefore, cling to them tenaciously. One of those peoples who desire to avoid complete assimilation and obliteration is our own Greek people. We are a people having a proud and glorious past, made resplendent by our wise and undying forefathers. These men will shine forever like bright stars in the firmament, whose light illuminates the entire world. Since we are the children of such fathers, it is not fitting that we should let that light go out from lack of care. Otherwise, we shall be compared by historians with the prodigal son...</p>
   <p>Besides giving our children a Greek environment in the home, we have, also, built Greek schools. What a nice-sounding phrase! But what a hollow one! The blame does not lie with the teachers, parish trustees, or the priests, who endeavor to carry out successful school programs. The greater part of the fault lies with the parents themselves. The parents are the very ones who say that Greek training is nonessential for our children since they are going to live in America. The parents are the ones who refuse to send their children to the Greek schools. Many justify themselves by stating that children who attend Greek schools are handicapped when entering American public schools. The truth of the matter is, that those children are actually promoted when entering high school because their education has been so complete in the important formulative grammar school years spent in the Greek schools. Another point we wish to bring out is that most high school students are required to study a foreign language. Why should the Greek children study French or Latin when they can study their own language which is of unexcelled beauty? It can be accomplished if the parents and students demand it from the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>It will not overtax any child who is normal and healthy to attend an afternoon Greek school. So, if your children cannot attend a Greek-American school in the daytime, send them to the evening classes of a Greek school. Even if they do not learn very much, they cannot help but absorb the Greek spirit and ideology....</p>
   <p>The more we know, the better we can make our lives. Give your children a Greek education.</p>
