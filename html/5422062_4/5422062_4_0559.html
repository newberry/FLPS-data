   <p>We must commend the Greek Community of Chicago for the decision of the church governing board to contribute $150 to the victims of a destructive storm in Trikala, Thessaly, Greece.</p>
   <p>After this splendid gesture, we think that all the local organizations and clubs should follow the example of our generous community, which, though in difficult financial circumstances, thought that by all means the amount of $150 should be collected and sent to Greece to relieve the suffering and pain of the unfortunate inhabitants of Trikala in Thessaly.</p>
