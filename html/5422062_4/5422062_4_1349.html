   <p>Last night (Friday) a dance was given by the Omonia Club of Chicago at Turner Hall. It was attended by a large crowd which had a very pleasant evening. The dance was given for the purpose of raising money, with which to build a road from Palaiohorion to Leonidion [little towns in Greece].</p>
   <p>The dance was marked by orderliness and simplicity. It was brought to a close at 1:00 A.M.</p>
