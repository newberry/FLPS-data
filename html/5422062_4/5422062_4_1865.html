   <p>Next week the Sons of Pericles are holding their annual convention at Detroit, Michigan. This junior Ahepa organization is composed of young Greek boys in America. Although comparatively new, it has already fifty five chapters scattered throughout the United States.</p>
   <p>In this way the Ahepa intends to extend its aims and ideals to the younger generation so that the work if fostering our native tongue, ideals, and customs in America will be perpetuated.</p>
   <p>For this convention, two members of each chapter are to be chosen as representatives. Chicago's two chapters will send C. Tsoulus and N. Bouloukos from Lord Byron Chapter No. 11 and P. Simadis and J. Nicols from Ypsilantes chapter No. 22. They will leave next Sunday for Detroit and the Bank Cadillac Hotel, where the convention will take place.</p>
