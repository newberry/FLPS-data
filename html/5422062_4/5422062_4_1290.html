   <p>The Chicago Ahepa Chapter No. 46 holds its third annual picnic on Sunday, August 21, at Desplanes River Resort. The organization is offering an unusual opportunity to the Greek community in spending a day in the outdoor regions, as our ancients used to do, and we know that everybody is anxious for such an event, for it is a real tonic to the mind and body to get away from the struggle of business. There will be no admission fee, and no charge for the use of the dance hall. Fresh roasted lambs will be sold on the premises, as well as all kinds of relishes for those who haven't brought victuals with them. The dance will start early in the afternoon.</p>
