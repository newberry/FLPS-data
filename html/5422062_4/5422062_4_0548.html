   <p>In a previous issue of The Greek Star, we took the opportunity to address a brief appeal to the Greek people of Chicago on behalf of the unfortunate victims of the terrible earthquakes which occured in southern Italy and Sicily. It is now incumbent upon us to renew that appeal and urge our people to extend every possible material assistance to friendly and neighborly Italy.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune's correspondent in Naples gives a complete but horrifying account of the disaster. That is perhaps sufficient to make us realize the extent of the sudden catastrophe in Southern Italy as well as the suffering and tragic fate of the people of that region.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The terrible and widespread disaster which was visited upon the formerly rich and prosperous cities will undoubtedly touch the hearts of all peoples. Cities which only yesterday were great, populous, and thriving industrial centers have been reduced to heaps of smoldering ruins and crushed human bodies. Such was the fate that Vesuvius and Mount Etna held for these unfortunate cities. Who knows how many thousands are buried under the still burning debris?</p>
   <p>In less than thirty seconds almost the whole of Sicily and Southern Italy were rocked by the violent convulsions of the earth. Whatever remained standing after the devastating earthquake was swept away by the swelling tide of the ocean. In the city market places where smiling people greeted each other every morning, rowboats are searching for the bodies of victims.</p>
   <p>The drama of Pompeii and Herculaneum is being repeated in all its "glory" and horror by the complete destruction of the cities of Messina, Catania, and Rhegium. Indeed, the catastrophe which was wrought shocked the entire Italian nation.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The people of Italy remained speechless on receiving the dreadful news. The warm Italian heart however, started beating faster when Italians everywhere decided to rescue what was left from the earthquake.</p>
   <p>First, the commander of an Italian cruiser and its crew exemplified the spirit of heroism and self-sacrifice in the process of rescuing thousands of wounded at the scene of the disaster. He and a great part of his ship's crew were swept overboard and drowned while attempting to haul the bodies of wounded on board ship.</p>
   <p>It is virtually impossible for the human mind to imagine the extent of the disaster.</p>
   <p>In order to alleviate the indescribable pain and suffering in Southern Italy, money and medical supplies are arriving there from everywhere. All the peoples were deeply moved; tears of sorrow fell from the eyes of all kind-hearted Americans and Greeks. Among all the other peoples, the Greeks should prove <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>themselves the bravest, the most willing, and the most merciful. Bonds of most intimate friendship and common historical traditions bind the Greeks and the Italians since ancient times. There still are Roman monuments and temples in our Fatherland. The same Greek works of art are found in Italy, proving how close and interrelated our two peoples have been throughout their glorious history.</p>
   <p>Let us remember the red-coated Garibaldians who fought with us side by side during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 at Domokos and Epirus. Let us recall the glorious death of Santarosa at Sphacteria, of Fratti in Athens, and of so many Italian Philhellenes during our Wars of Liberation in 1821-29.</p>
   <p>How can we forget that Italy was one of the great European powers that championed the Greek cause for an autonomous Crete. In short, since we have so many obligations toward Italy, and since her gallant sons and eminent statesmen have supported some of our most sacred national causes, we should take this opportunity <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>to repay their kindness and magnanimity in kind.</p>
   <p>Naturally, we would like to show our gratitude to the Italian people under different circumstances, but since fate had it so, we must all go to their support now. No Greek in this community can fail to do his duty. The Greek name should be at the top of the list of those nationalities that are contributing. Onward, then, Grecians, let us show our gratitude to the Italian nation which has been mortally wounded. Organizations, societies, brotherhoods--forward all.</p>
   <p>The drive for funds which is being directed by The Greek Star and other private and philanthropic agencies has been proceeding satisfactory. Those who have not contributed yet are urged to do so at once so that we can send the Central Italian Earthquake Relief Committee a substantial and impressive sum of money.</p>
   <p>The Greek Star as well as the official representatives of the Greek Community <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of Chicago wrote letters to Mr. Sabetta, the Italian consul-general in Chicago, informing him of the extensive drive which the Greeks have organized for the benefit of the earthquake victims in Southern Italy and Sicily. In reply, Mr. Sabetta requested that The Greek Star thank the Greek people of Chicago for their kindness and sympathy, saying that the traditional friendship of the Greek and Italian peoples never allows them to forget each other in perilous and tragic times.</p>
   <p>Shortly after the receipt of the above reply, the Greek Community of Chicago through The Greek Star sent Mr. Sabetta two checks amounting to $400, which represent the money collected thus far. Judging from the results of the drive, to date, we find that the responsible Greek committee and our contributing fellow countrymen have done a marvelous job in supporting such a great humanitarian cause. Especially are the members of the Chrysaphiotes Society to be commended for their generous contribution.</p>
   <p>We can rest assured that such spontaneous sentiments of kindness, sympathy, and <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>benevolence followed by active financial support will do much to enhance the Greek name among the American people as well as among the good Italian people.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: A list of more than twenty names of organizations, newspapers, and individual contributors appears in this issue with the amounts of money contributed by each for the Italian Earthquake Relief Fund.]</p>
