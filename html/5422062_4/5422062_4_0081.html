   <p>p. 1.- This coming Thursday, two dances will take place in Chicago, given by two of our most prominent societies. One dance will be given by the Kosmitans and the other by the Brontamito-Kosmitans. In other words the dances will be given by mother and daughter. They should have given their dances together. We believe that a greater number of people would turn out and the proceeds, naturally, would be greater.</p>
   <p>The real truth is that the two societies are like David and Goliath. The small organization of Brontamito-Kosmitans wanted to join the large organization of Kosmitans. In this way both sides would be mutually benefited.</p>
   <p>But the stronger society would not see it that way so all friendly relations were severed. Each side is determined to ruin the other, so they will hold their important dance on the same day.</p>

   <p>Isn't it a great shame that on the most celebrated day of the year, these countrymen are bitter and jealous instead of joyful and happy?</p>
   <p>There are so few of them here, they should stick together instead of being rivals. It is a great shame!</p>
