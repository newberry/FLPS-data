   <p>p. 1. -- I humbly beg to be allowed to inquire why Greeks are so very frequently accused and criticized in Chicago. For instance, some newspapers recently reported that a young woman had been kidnaped either by a Greek or by an Italian. This was a fabrication. When the Washington Park Bank was robbed, two Chicago papers stated that the chief bandit was a Greek. Again the statement was proved to be untrue. These are two of many instances in which the press has thrown blame on the Greeks. It is not fair.</p>
   <p>Some of our most learned and loyal American citizens today are Greeks. It has been my lot to come into contact with a great many people of this nationality, and I can truthfully say that one could not find more ambitious, industrious, and law-abiding citizens anywhere in the United States, and I am ready to back up my statement.</p>
   <p>There is no need for me to discourse on Greek history, since almost everyone <span class="page-break">\2</span>is familiar with it, but I cannot find anything in that history that should make Greeks the abused persons which they are in Chicago. Is it because the son of Hellas is a greenhorn as far as the English language is concerned that the American thinks himself superior? I think that the thousands of business enterprises built up by Greeks in Chicago prove whether their greenness is detrimental to them or not.</p>
   <p>I have heard a great many Greeks ask these same questions.</p>
