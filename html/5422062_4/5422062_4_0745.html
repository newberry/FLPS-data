   <p>It is my imperative duty as a publisher and a fellow Greek-American to guide the public against frauds and other dangers of losing money in unsafe and unsound investments.</p>
   <p>Many Greeks all over the country became the victims of "flim-flammers" etc. There are sellers of shares of non-existing companies; there are sellers of shares of companies of dubious integrity, who prey upon the gullible and get rich quick Greeks.</p>
   <p>The Greek, intoxicated with the great progress of this rich country, falls easily a victim to such propositions, and without investigation turns over to the shark his hard earned dollars. Gold mines, oil wells, inventions, and other get rich quick enticements, are some of the share-selling beguiles.</p>
   <p>Greeks all over the Country, before you pay your money to those alluring sharks investigate from Alpha to Omega. Find out the financial standing of the company, the honesty, integrity and reputation of the administrators of the concern in whose hands the money of the shareholders depends on for gain or loss.</p>

   <p>Many apparently financially sound concerns go to the rocks, sooner or later, on account of mismanagement.</p>
   <p>Paradoxical as it may be, a court decision of Sacramento, California, denied the right and authority of the prosecuting attorney, to seize the books of a share-selling company, which was accused of fraud. If the hands of the prosecuting attorney were tied by some technical point, what protection can you have in such dubious enterprises? None! Therefore, it will pay you to be on your guard, if and when you invest any money.</p>
   <p>Some other sharks recently using a Greek as a fence, flim-flammed many hundreds of Greeks, on the pretext of having a valuable patent. This Greek mouthpiece of the sharks was selling shares of the patent to gullible Greeks, telling them that the inventor was a Greek, and that the majority of the share-holders of the company must be Greek in order that Greeks have control of the company.</p>
   <p>It is silly, absolutely silly, to permit yourself to fall a victim to such devices.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>I hope the above few words of counsel will be heeded, and I hope to not have the displeasure of hearing any more frauds perpetrated upon my beloved Greeks.</p>
