   <p>The celebration of Greece's declaration of war against the Central Powers took place last Thursday, June 27, and will remain ineffaceable in the memories of the people.</p>
   <p>As it was planned, at 6 P. M. all the Greek organizations, societies, and associations gathered at Hull House. Twenty thousand people, young and old, surrounded the gathering-place, but only 12,000 marched to the Blackstone Theater. Four hundred and twelve automobiles decked with American and Greek flags followed the 12,000 marchers.</p>
   <p>The 2,500 seats of the theater were quickly occupied, and the rest of the thousands jammed every foot of space outside the building. Seventh Street was closed to traffic and was occupied by celebrating Greeks.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Insull, chairman of the celebration, delivered a hearty speech, and he was followed by Chicago's Demosthenes, Mr. Clarence Darrow. Other speakers were Mr. Streychmans, Mr. Snow, and Mr. Pezas, Greek Consul in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The celebration was a big success for its magnificence, its enthusiasm, and its patriotism. And if the Greek Consul, who is a Constantinite and consequently pro-German, had known his diplomatic duty and had fully realized that the celebration was practically a demonstration against the Central Powers and had avoided mentioning the name of the dethroned King, the French Consul-General of Chicago would not have departed (unnoticed) from the celebration.</p>
   <p>The Greek Consul, whose recall is imminent, in his frigid address attempted to justify the King's pro-Germanism on the ground that Constantine was misguided by his ministers, while the whole world knows that the ex-King is the Kaiser's brother-in-law, and that time after time he dissolved the cabinet of Venizelos, whom the people of Greece time after time re-elected in order to declare war against the Central Powers. How could the King be misguided while the people and their government repeatedly demonstrated their will and determination to be on the side of the Allies and fight against the Teuton-Bulgaro-Turk barbarians?</p>
   <p>The Chicago Greeks have petitioned both the Greek Embassy in Washington and the Greek Government to recall the undiplomatic diplomat who in spite of thirty years of service does not know that he serves Greece alone and not the dethroned King.</p>
