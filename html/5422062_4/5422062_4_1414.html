   <p>p. 2.- We are asked, why does the Panhellenic Union advertise its deeds and not its expenses?</p>
   <p>It seems that some people ask for too much. They tell you one thing and they tell someone else another thing. Whether they are right or wrong. we do not know.</p>
   <p>If this Society has fifty thousand membersand 100 branches, as we are told, they would have great expenses. For a months at $95 a month, the secretary would earn $570. Paper, ink, stames, etc. at $55 a month should cost $330. The rent of the Masonic Temple for meetings $50. 'Miscellancnons is items to $200. This leave an outgo of over $1,000 while the income only amounts to $400.</p>

   <p>Because of this, people who might donate, don't, because they say, "It will all be spent, anyway, so what's the use of giving."</p>
   <p>If it is true, that $1,000 has been spent in the first six months, they will have to borrow money to send representatives to the convention which will be held in Boston in October.</p>
   <p>Watch your step, Panhellenics.</p>
