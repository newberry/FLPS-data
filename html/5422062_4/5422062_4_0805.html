   <p>Business of Race Is Million Daily--Typical Stores and Coffee-Houses Found in City's Delta <span class="page-break">\2</span>"Eviva!" Hail to the residents of "Little Greece," where we go to-day in the ninth of the Around-the-World Tours in Chicago conducted each week by the Herald and Examiner. "Is Ygeien!" Good luck!</p>
   <p>Chicagopolis! The bustling, thriving, happy colony of some 60,000 citizens of Greek extraction in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The residents of Chicagopolis are to be found mainly in that section which surrounds the Delta, where Halsted and Harrison streets and Blue Island avenue intersect.</p>
   <p>"Chicagopolites" are also to be found throughout the city; some Greeks are settled in the Lincoln Square section, some on the Near South Side, and others in the Grand Boulevard, Pullman, Hegewisch, and Ashburn districts.</p>
   <p>Typical Greek Life in Chicago's Delta</p>
   <p>But in the Delta are the typical Greek stores, with their imported articles, their foods and spices, the Kaffeneions or coffee-houses, where the tourist <span class="page-break">\3</span>can sip oriental coffee and smoke a nargileh or water-pipe, the restaurants which serve savory dishes of lamb or chicken as well as masticha or ouzo, strong white cordials flavored with anise, the bakery-shops where you can buy the famous Greek doughnut-bread covered with poppy-seeds, and the churches where the Greek Orthodox religion is preserved in all its ecclesiastical picturesqueness.</p>
   <p>When Greek meets Greek in Chicagopolis in the Easter season he does not say "Kali emera (Good day)!" or "Kali nychta (Good night)!" but cries instead "Christos anesti (Christ is risen)!"</p>
   <p>Easter Sunday fell on April 24 in Chicagopolis, but the observance of it continues for fifty days. And during those fifty days Greeks always greet one another with "Christos anesti!" and bid farewell in the same manner. Easter is more important in the Greek Orthodox Church than Christmas.</p>
   <p>Religion Linked with Their Liberty</p>
   <p>The citizen of Chicagopolis is devoutly religious. He is moreover grateful to his Church for preserving the Greek language and Greek traditions during <span class="page-break">\4</span>the four hundred years when Greece was under the yoke of Mohammedan Turkey.</p>
   <p>And it was a priest, Bishop Germanos, the Chicagopolite will tell you, who raised the Greek flag over a Greek monastery on March 25, 1821, and thereby gave the signal for the revolution which ten years later was to liberate the country from Turkish rule.</p>
   <p>While the influence of ancient Greek art and drama and philosophy, which flourished during the golden age of Pericles and Socrates, has been extended throughout the world, contemporary Greeks have also contributed to the great cultural, professional, and business growth of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Greeks have been known as businessmen ever since the first of them arrived in Chicago. Each has sought to establish himself in his own business.</p>
   <p>At first they sold fruit, hot dogs, and hot tamales. And to-day the Greeks are leaders among the restaurant-owners, manufacturers of ice-cream, florists, fruit-dealers, confectioners, and produce-merchants of Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>It has been estimated that the gross receipts of enterprises operated by Greeks in Chicago are more than $1,000,000 daily.</p>
   <p>The first Greeks came here in the early forties. These early immigrants remained only a short time; they returned to Greece with tales of the rapid growth of the Middle West. Many came back to Chicago and brought relatives and friends with them.</p>
   <p>One of these was Captain Nickolas Peppas, who lived on Kinzie Street eighty-one years ago. He died recently. Another was Constantine Mitchell, a chemist, who was taken prisoner by the Union army in the Civil War and brought north. After the war he remained in Chicago. Others were Uncle Thomas Combiths, whose late son Frank was associated with J. H. White and Company in Fulton Market, Constantine Masters, who was to become one of Chicago's foremost tailors, and Christ Chacona, known as the "Columbus of Sparta."</p>
   <p>Chacona brought a number of relatives here. Many of them became prominent fruit-merchants.</p>
   <p>In 1882 there were a thousand Greeks in Chicagopolis. The first Greek woman <span class="page-break">\6</span>to arrive, Mrs. Peter Pooley, came in 1885. She has endeared herself to her Chicago compatriots by her activity in the community. She organized the Greco-Slavonian Society, a benevolent association designed to keep alive religious ideals.</p>
   <p>Two names revered by the citizens of Chicagopolis are Jane Addams and Carter H. Harrison II. Miss Addams helped many Greeks to realize their ideals of becoming good citizens, and Mayor Harrison gave sympathetic help to struggling Greek merchants, a gesture which their descendants have not forgotten.</p>
   <p>The tourist will be interested in the Greek churches. There are ten of them here, with a membership of more than 20,000. The churches are built for the most part in the Byzantine style, and they are all oriented so that the congregation faces east. The Greeks explain this by saying that "the Lord came from the orient."</p>
   <p>The oldest of these churches is Holy Trinity at 1122 South Peoria Street. This church celebrated its fortieth anniversary last fall. The edifice most recently completed is the Church of the Blessed Virgin at 5567 West Harrison <span class="page-break">\7</span>Street, opposite Columbus Park. It was dedicated on Easter Sunday, a week ago.</p>
   <p>The first Greek bishop here was the Right Reverend Philaretos Johannides, who came to preserve the Greek religion, preach Americanism, and promote the general welfare of Greek residents.</p>
   <p>Later clergymen imbued with the same ideals are the Reverend Fathers Demetry, Petrakis, Panagopoulos, Mandilaris, Vainikos, Papanikolas, Kesses, Golemis, Mesarhakies, and Mathiopoulos.</p>
   <p>The Church of St. Constantine, at 6105 South Michigan Avenue, will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary and name-day on May 20 and 21. St. Basil's Church is the cathedral of the diocese.</p>
   <p>Easter is for Greeks a holiday both religious and national, for it symbolizes and commemorates the resurrection of Greece from Turkish bondage, as Peter S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, will tell you.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>"It is the sacred belief of all Greeks that the Church and the clergy are the emblems of their freedom and that they led the way to the liberation of Greece," says he.</p>
   <p>George S. Porikos, assistant attorney general of Illinois, in telling why the Greek Easter falls on a different date from the Easter of other Christian Churches, says that there was a time when practically every church celebrated its own Easter. He adds:</p>
   <p>"To end this confusion, Pope Gregory, in the year 1552, adopted the now almost universally used Gregorian calendar; the Pope followed the rule set down by the Council of Nicaea for the determination of Easter, but he used the Gregorian calendar as the basis for this determination, while the Eastern Churches continue to use the Julian calendar to set the date for Easter.</p>
   <p>"For this reason, although the Catholic, Protestant, and Greek Orthodox Churches all use March 21, the first day of spring, as the basis for computing the date of Easter Sunday, yet since March 21 in the Julian calendar, used by the Greek <span class="page-break">\9</span>Orthodox Church, is April 3 in the Gregorian calendar, Easter, which is the first Sunday after the first full moon after March 21, is celebrated by the Greek Orthodox Church on the first Sunday after the first full moon after April 3 by the Gregorian calendar and is therefore often a month later than the western Easter.</p>
   <p>There is one other rule, however, set down by the council of Nicaea which is followed by the Greek Church but disregarded by the Catholic and the Protestant Churches, and that is, that Easter must come neither before the day of the Jewish Passover nor on the same day. Because of this rule the Greek Easter this year fell on April 24 instead of April 17."</p>
   <p>There are many interesting things to be learned in Chicagopolis. Mr. Lambros will explain to you that the "-poulos" which lengthens many a Greek name merely means "son of" and is similar in this way to the "Mac" and the "O" before Irish names and the ending "-ski" in Polish names.</p>
   <p>Residents of Chicagopolis have their own clubs, newspapers, and professional organizations, like the colonies of other nationalities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>There are some 200 Greek societies, and while most of our Greeks are businessmen, they boast more then 200 professional men among them, of whom doctors and lawyers are most numerous.</p>
   <p>The Athenians, the Spartans, and the Arcadians all have their own societies. Prominent among these Greek organizations are Tanias, Manthireas, Candilioton, Messinias, Pericles, Cretan, Palaiohoriton, Cosmiton, Vervenioton, Eptanission, Phoenix, and National Epirotic Enossis.</p>
   <p>In addition there are the Greek Professional Men's Club, the Hellenic Post of the American Legion, the Ahepa (American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association), the Plato Students' Association, the Young Women's Philharmonic Society, the Illinois Federation of Restaurant Owners, the American Restaurant Men's Association, the Greek Retail Dealers' Association, the Hellenic Benevolent Society, the Nea Genea (New Generation), the Hellenic Youth, the Hellenic Woman's Club, and the Sons of Pericles.</p>
   <p>And so, conscious that we may have committed sins of omission because of lack of space in telling of Chicagopolis and its activities, we close with an "Eviva!"</p>
