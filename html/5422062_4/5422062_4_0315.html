   <p>Owing to the seismic catastrophe of historic Corinth and its suburbs, the Chicago Greek Consul-general deems it wise and advisable that the Greeks under its jurisdiction should not abstain from pity and sorrow for the stricken people of Corinth, whom the calamity has driven to the greatest depth of misery. Therefore it earnestly appeals to your patriotic and philanthropic sentiments to contribute what you can for the sufferers of the seismic area.</p>
   <p>To that effect the Consulate unfolds before you the honor list of contributors and requests communities, societies, clubs, organizations and all the Greeks in general to enroll their names in the honor list.</p>
   <p>Contributions should be sent by money-order to the Greek consulate, which each week will publish the amount and the names of the contributors.</p>
   <p>Chicago April 24, 1928.</p>
   <p>Consul General,</p>
   <p>G. Depastas.</p>
