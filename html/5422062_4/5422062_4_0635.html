   <p>p. 4.- To the Hon. Publisher of Saloniki. Chicago.</p>
   <p>Owing to a Ku Klux Klan publication in the South, stating that the Greek race is considered, according to 1918 statistics, among the first in crimes committed in Chicago, I deem it advisable to request you to publish the following statistics furnished me, at my request, by the Police commissioner of our city.</p>
   <p>The Police commissioner, without reserve, expressed his gratification over the good citizenship of the Greek race,- adding that our people are industrious, peaceful, law-abiding and the best among the foreign races in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Chicago is considered by uniformed people as the city of crime. The crimes for which the 35 Greeks were convicted are as follows:</p>

   <p>The above statistics represent the indisputable facts and explicitly show the percentage of crimes and convictions. Therefore the hue and cry of the K.K.K. publication that the Greeks of Chicago top the list in crimes committeed, is unfounded, absurd, and based upon prejudice or ignorance.</p>

   <p>(Editor's comment)</p>
   <p>The K.K.K. publication is excusable, for on any occasion when we do not understand and confess that we are puzzled, we blame it on the Greeks, saying, "It's Greek to me." So the publication, knowing from hearsay only (usually unfounded,) that Chicago is a city of crime and that many Greeks live here, naturally had to blame it on the Greeks. Poor K.K.K., you are not the only ones to accuse the Greeks for everything evil; even the ancient gods accused the Greeks when anything went wrong in their domain.</p>
