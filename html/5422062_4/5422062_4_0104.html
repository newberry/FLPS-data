   <p>On the tenth of March, 1937, the united chapters of the 13th district, are giving a Ball for the New Mexico Ahepan Sanitarium in the famous ballroom, Trianon.</p>
   <p>This exceptional philanthropic action of the Ahepa needs the support of every Greek in Chicago and we are asking all other clubs and organizations that are planning a dance or other such enterprises not to take into consideration the date of March 10, 1937.</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors wish to make known to the public within the Ahepan boundary that on that same evening there will be a performance of the most excellent and select talent that Organizations of Music have to offer as well as other artistic performances.</p>
   <p>We beg of you, therefore, if you have children of exceptional talent, to communicate at once by letter, phone, or personal interview with the Board for future details.</p>
   
   <p>The age limit set by the directors for those wishing to participate in this contest is seventeen years.</p>
