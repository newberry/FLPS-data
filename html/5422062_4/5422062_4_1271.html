   <p>P. 1.- The Greek Society of Chicago had a most wonderful inspiration in establishing here the "Greek Literature Day," following the examples of those in Greece, who observe, with much festivity, the holiday of the "Three Famous Prelates"</p>
   <p>The first "Greek Literature Day", in Chicago, took place in Saint Trinity Church in the presence of a large crowd. The children of the school, Socrates, whose Dean is Mr. Loumos, sang native songs and recited poems at that time.</p>
   <p>This coming Sunday the "Greek Literature Day" will take place in the Church of Saint Nickolas, 5957 South Peoria St., with an elaborate program in which children of the school, Omiros, a school founded and maintained by the Greek Society, will take part.</p>
