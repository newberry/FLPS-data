   <p>Excellent and brilliant services were extended to the career of St. Constantine Church, by the societies of Greek ladies who are composed of the best, noble, and most religious elements of our community ladies. Their cardinal stone and fundamental aim is philanthropy. They appear and function and do service, to everything that tends to the needs of the Chicago Greeks. For charitable, religious educational and national purposes, the societies of the Greek ladies were, and are, shining everywhere in the horizon.</p>
   <p>The Society of "New Generation"was formed at the beginning of 1922 and flourished like a flower in the spring. The zeal, enthusiasm and devotion of those noble ladies, became the by-word of the Greeks. Shining stars of this Society were Miss Evagelia Metou, Panagiota Roumpa, Stavroula Flouda, Helen Komninos, and later, Miss Hariklia Mitsoula and Polytimi Mazarakos.</p>
