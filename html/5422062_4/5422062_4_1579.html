   <p>p. 2.- With much sorrow we saw that the 25th of March was not celebrated as it should have been. We should have set aside our petty quarrels and all joined wholeheartedly in celebrating the most important day of the year. Wasn't it a shame to read in the American papers that the Greeks celebrated their national holiday. Each society celebrated it on a different day and with different flags and banners.</p>
   <p>Greeks of Chicago, Greece is one country and has one flag and one church. It is time for us to show our pride and our patriotism.</p>
