   <p>The convention held in Washington was extremely interesting for a number of reasons. In the first place, it showed that the Americans of Greek origin or descent, are an important body of prosperous citizens, with able representatives in all branches of commercial life and in all the professions. In the second place, the genuine and great applause brought out by every mention of the necessity to treat all questions from a purely American point of view, and the presence among the delegates of a number who had fought for the United States on European battlefields, including two with the Distinguished Service Cross, showed that the interest of the convention in the Grecian claim was not based on any selfish idea of Greece first, but was founded on the broad American principle of self-determination--the foundation stone of democracy so admirably expressed by Mr. Wilson when he emmerated his Fourteen Points.</p>

The idea of the majority, and the idea which governed the actions of the executive committee, was that the American <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>citizens in the convention, representing 500,000 American citizens of Greek descent, respectfully called the attention of the American Government to the fact that if it followed the principle of self-determination, it could not in justice do otherwise than give Thrace to Greece.</p>
