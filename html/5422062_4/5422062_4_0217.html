   <p>Every Greek in Chicago knows that the young ladies' society, Nea Genea, of the North Side is organizing the best masquerade dance of the season for next Monday at the Prianon. In their annual dance the young Greek ladies will show once more how popular their affairs are by the gathering of many thousands of Greeks.</p>
   <p>Our community should do as in past seasons, help the young ladies in their universally beneficial efforts as proceeds from the dance always go to charity.</p>
