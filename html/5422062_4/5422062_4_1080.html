   <p>p. 3- Last Sunday an unprecedented thing took place, proving once more that some of us are stupid, unfeeling, and inconsiderate.</p>
   <p>A group of Greeks organized a party and went to the outskirts of the city to amuse themselves. After they had indulged in various gymnastic contests, they turned to food, wine, and song. All had gone well up to this time. But the doings of this group thereafter show that they are devoid of the Greek instinct for what is decorous and becoming, for they manifested the traits of Turco-Gypsies. The most uncultivated among Greek mountaineers would not think of acting so shamelessly as did this group of Turco-Gypsies.</p>
   <p>They piled on a huge carnival truck and drove through the loop singing, shouting, and shooting, like a bunch of wild beasts from South Africa, advertising their unspeakably bad manners and staining the Greek name with undesirable color.</p>

   <p>Star's note:</p>
   <p>If these Greeks had realized that they were Greeks, I do not think that they would have behaved themselves as they did; for if they had been conscious of being Greeks, they would have known that they, as Greeks, are heirs to the noblest, the most glorious, the most highly civilized, the most honored, the most enlightened, and the most admired tradition in the world, and consequently they would not have dragged it in the mire. Can I find any extenuating circumstance in endeavoring to palliate and partially to justify their unbecoming behavior? Before a court of mental examination some excuse might be preferred; one might blame the heat of the day and the heat of the wine. But speaking fairly and impartially, I find not an iota of justification for their disgraceful conduct.</p>
