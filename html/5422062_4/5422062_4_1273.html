   <p>The society Homer, which was founded a year ago, last Sunday, at the Stevens Hotel, held its elections for new officers. The following officers were elected:</p>
   <p>George Kokinos, President; Constantine Pantaleon, Tresurer; L. Kylavos, Vice-President; Constantine G. Charalambidis, Secretary General; Michael Laskaris, Executive Secretary. The Board of Directors are: Athanasios Vaxevanis, George Ziras, Const. Seriadis, Alexander Polikardiotis.</p>
   <p>The Greek Refugees Society since its establishment played a role of paramount importance and it is the only society of its kind in Chicago. The newly elected officers who are known for their noble endeavors, undoubtedly will merit the office held by each.</p>
