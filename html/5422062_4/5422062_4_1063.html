   <p>A person who investigated the general condition of our community, and especially the recently published and distributed financial statement, would undoubtedly be terribly alarmed and disappointed at the discovery that our community treasury is as empty as Mother Hubbard's cupboard, and resembles a lonely, quiet, and dreary cemetery. It is no exaggeration to say that our finances are hopelessly depleted; our treasury is almost completely empty.</p>
   <p>In order to substantiate this fact, we have only to study the number "six sixty-nine," which, when properly interpreted and explained, represents the number of dollars left in our treasury--these are actually the cash resources of this great and "thriving" Greek community in the city of <span class="page-break">2</span>Chicago. This pitifully small sum clearly illustrates the gradual but sure disintegration which is taking place in our church, educational, and social affairs as a result of the incompetency, inefficiency, and general dishonesty of our elected and "trusted" administrators.</p>
   <p>This is the financial condition of the Greek community of Chicago--we have $6.69 in our treasury. This was proudly announced by a salaried loafer who has become a public charge on our community as secretary-treasurer, a man who goes by the name of Photios Parakostas. For services which were supposedly rendered to the community during the past fiscal year, he has received the sum of $240, in return for which his work hasn't been worth fifty cents. Of course, he has done some work by glorifying the social prestige of the president of the community, that is, by taking bows and holding the latter's overcoat on official occasions.</p>
   <p>In the face of this situation, we are indeed surprised that the present <span class="page-break">3</span>administration of our community has the audacity to remain in office. We wonder why the Greek consular authorities and the people of our community are not aroused against them; we wonder why they didn't dispose of such incompetents a long time ago. We cannot see any reason why our people should be so long-suffering, or why they should tolerate such crooks. We believe, however, that the time has come when these despoilers of our treasury funds will be brought before the bar of justice. All of them must be put in their proper place.</p>
   <p>To return to the crux of the problem, we deem it our duty to inform the Greek public that the administrators of our church affairs appeared before the community assembly last Sunday in order to give an account of their conduct in public office. They attempted to do so by means of a piece of printed paper which they called, "The Annual Balance Sheet for the Year 1907". We must mention the fact, however, that this high-sounding financial statement was not properly audited and checked by a specially <span class="page-break">4</span>appointed committee, as required by the constitution and bylaws of our community organization. It was presented to the people as a smoke screen to hide a number of scandalous and illegal expenditures.</p>
   <p>Almost all the budgetary items are mentioned in this patched-up balance sheet, but there is no specific description of the individual items of income and expense. All these are thrown together in a haphazard way, without rhyme or reason, in order to pull the wool over the eyes of the Greek public, which knows nothing about the addition or subtraction of vague figures. In view of the dilemma which is presented to our fellow countrymen today, The Greek Star has attempted to make some sense out of this mess of mishandled finances.</p>
   <p>Income and Obligations</p>
   <p>On close examination of the sources of income of our community, we find <span class="page-break">5</span>that there is no source [of income] other than the membership dues paid by twenty-three individuals; the only clear income which was realized was $46. No other effort worthy of mention was made to collect more money in other ways. At the beginning [of the term of the present administration], $2,152.35 was found in the treasury, but this was credited to the previous administration. The income amounting to $6,535.97, which was collected from church collection baskets, from the sale of candles, as well as from voluntary contributions of various organizations, from burial fees, rental of church property, and money collected from a fire insurance policy, and several other minor items, must not be considered to have been collected through the efforts of the present administration.</p>
   <p>While the Greeks of Chicago contributed and spent so much money in the church, the responsible officials of the community never felt the need to meet the obligations which they assumed toward the people. As a result, $6.69 represents the cash assets in the treasury. Second, there is a <span class="page-break">6</span>shortage of $80.28 in the fund for the needy; third, there is a liability of $622.25 in connection with the Greek National Defense Fund; fourth, we still have a $24,000 mortgage on the church lot; and last of all, the church owes $340 in back wages and salaries to priests, teachers, and employees. The grand total of our church debits amounts to the huge sum of $25,042.51.</p>
   <p>The deplorable financial condition of our community must come to the attention of the people, who should discover exactly who is to blame for our huge indebtedness, and why the community has not been able to reduce its debt and meet all its obligations promptly. Should the administration be allowed to sleep on the job and wait to collect money by means of collections on Sundays and holidays? Aren't they ashamed of themselves for not paying $340 to the priests and teachers, for leaving a balance of $6.69 in the coffers of the church, for withholding $622.23 belonging to the Greek National Defense Fund, for having only twenty-three regular <span class="page-break">7</span>dues-paying community members during 1907? How can our notorious spend-thrifts and foolish promoters account for spending $1,260.82 for the annual picnic and dance? They promised us many things in the beginning [of their term], but where is their new school? Why has the southern wing of the church been closed? Where is the impressive membership of our community?</p>
   <p>Expenditures</p>
   <p>As far as the expenditures are concerned, it is reported that they amounted to $17,305.95. The church board and the finance committee failed to make a detailed list of all the expenditures. It is evident that they wanted to deceive the public and avoid an investigation of their accounts so they tried to prevent any suspicion from being aroused by covering up certain items.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>For example, the money paid to Photius Papakostas, the secretary-treasurer, was not mentioned. This worthless loafer spent most of his time in the coffeehouses and the cigar store of the famous Bomsoulas. No one can tell us why this incompetent clerk received $240 from the community. Why could not Mr. Michael Petropoulos, an able public accountant, have kept the church's books?</p>
   <p>Another item of $251.25 for rental of meeting places, office and stationery expenses was not mentioned in the report because it was not a necessary expense and could have easily been avoided. Another item which was conveniently forgotten was the large coal bill, which amounted to $131.75. We have learned that during the winter the church furnace was kept going so that some groups of loafers could keep warm in the church office during the evenings. Perhaps they were under the impression that the church was a place which could be converted into a coffeehouse or a clubroom.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Extravagant and unjustified expenditures were made for the purchase of expensive furniture and equipment for the church. As a result, the church members will have to pay $363.27. No one in the community took the trouble to protest against the spending of enormous sums for repairs, carpenter work, and new plumbing installations, for which the church was overcharged without any effort on the part of the finance committee to get reasonable prices and hire labor on reasonable terms. The damage done to our church building as a result of the lire, had to be paid for from the church treasury, in spite of the fact that the insurance company should have been forced to pay for the full amount of the damage.</p>
   <p>In making a detailed analysis of the income and expenditure of the community, we hope that we are doing our people a service, and that those who are responsible for the financial downfall of our community will either be dismissed or punished. The proper management of our community affairs depends on a careful supervision by our people. We cannot afford to tolerate <span class="page-break">10</span>this waste, inefficiency, and dishonesty in our church and community affairs.</p>
