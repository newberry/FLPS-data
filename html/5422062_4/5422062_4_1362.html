   <p>In the city of Chicago there are many Greek organizations, clubs, associations, societies, and what not of the same species. With the exception of very, very few, these societies are bound to exist only in memory. Americanization of these Greek societies will be the only way to save them from going on the rocks. Bear in mind (you may not like it) that no Greek society will ever succeed in the proper way if it is not Americanized. Our clubs and societies come, flourish for a short time, and then fall into oblivion. Why? It is very simple to answer why. It is because where there are ten Greeks you will find eleven bosses; the unit added to the number ten is the spontaneously created entity of the megalomania of the ten. Please do not get cocky, and hold your horses. We know one another; that goes for all of us. We are all Greeks, and we all act that way; megalomania is not the property and right of one, two, or three Greeks. It belongs to all of us; it is a racial characteristic, but a very bad one.</p>
   
   <p>The truth and the admission of the truth will remedy the situation. Ignorance is the capital cause of megalomania, not a desire or ambition to become great by acquiring qualities of greatness but a mania to be big.</p>
   <p>No one with common sense will dispute the fact that the Greek cannot equal the American in civilization and logic. The Greek may be intelligent, but the American is a polymathist and a logician. There is a great difference between intelligence and logic.</p>
   <p>Now then, in order that our societies may succeed and function properly, the system of the American must be adopted. Logic will tell any one that not everybody can be boss. The Americans with their wonderful logic know that there are inferiors and superiors, and they act accordingly, whereas a Greek will not recognize a superior among his kind, and that is the reason why everybody wants to be the boss. Ignorance will not permit any one to see the pre-eminence of others. And because of lack of polymathy and logic, hatred and antipathy obtain control of their efforts, and the result is known to us all.</p>
   
   <p>Let us not live all our lives in illusion just because we are Greeks. Do we not need to acquire cosmopolitan knowledge? We are living in the best country of the world; let us take advantage of this and go along with the cosmopolitan and progressive American ideas. Then, and then only, utilizing our inherent Greek sagacity, coupled with the newly acquired American methods and ideas, we shall be able to excel and go forward to new heights.</p>
   <p>It is a necessary prerequisite for us then to join American clubs and societies and step by step acquire their wonderful system of logic, tolerance, politeness, culture, and civility and the rest of the good qualities that make one useful to another.</p>
   <p>Our Greek societies then, built upon Americanization, will last forever and serve the purpose of their founding.</p>
