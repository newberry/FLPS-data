   <p>In my report to the Boston Convention were set forth a brief history of the origin, adoption, government and history of the Sons of Pericles, and several recommendations intended to bring closer together the Junior Order with the Ahepa. In view of the importance of the "Sons" to the Ahepa, and the hope that the San Francisco convention will enact satisfactory legislation for the coordination of the two Orders, the same explanation is included in my present report.</p>
   <p>A. Origin and Adoption</p>
   <p>The Sons of Pericles was organized in Manchester, New Hampshire, through the efforts of certain members of the Manchester Chapter, a few months before the Fourth Annual Convention of the Ahepa held in Philadelphia, August 1926. Brother Sotirios Docos, delegate of the Manchester Chapter to that convention, proposed the adoption of the Sons of Pericles by the Ahepa as a Junior Order. Considerable enthusiasm was aroused by the proposition, and the delegates evinced a desire to accept the proposition, but our attention was called to the fact that the charter of the Ahepa unfortunately did not provide for the establishment of auxiliary <span class="page-break">2</span>organizations, and the adoption would have been beyond the corporate powers of the Order.</p>
   <p>It was resolved, however, that the charter should be amended so as to give the Ahepa power to organize auxiliary organizations, with the understanding that the Junior Order was to be officially recognized as soon as the charter was amended.</p>
   <p>At the following convention held in Miami, in August, 1927, the question of adoption was again submitted, and the Sons of Pericles was officially recognized as the Junior Order of the Ahepa.</p>
   <p>B. Government and History</p>
   <p>The government of the Junior Order was divided into two main parts, the Supreme Lodge and the chapters. An annual convention was contemplated to be held in the month of August. This convention would have power to legislate, said legislation <span class="page-break">3</span>to be subject to the approval of the Supreme Lodge of the Ahepa. The thought of granting this supervisory body to the Ahepa was to prevent the enactment of legislation inconsistent with its principles. The Sons were to be under the direction and complete jurisdiction of the Ahepa and what they would pass upon in their conventions would be in the nature of minor rules and regulations for the chapters or the Supreme Lodge. A Supreme Advisor was also to be appointed by the Supreme President of the Ahepa, subject to the approval of the Supreme Lodge of the Ahepa. He was to be the "connecting link" between the Sons of Pericles and the Senior Order. The Supreme Advisor was to have general supervision over the Sons of Pericles and was empowered by the Ahepa convention, subject to the approval of the Supreme Lodge, to make such rules and regulations from time to time as were deemed necessary to the well-being of the Junior Order. (See pages 103, 104 and 105: Miami minutes.).</p>
   <p>Acting in accordance with this tentative constitution of the Sons of Pericles, Brother Alfange (then Supreme President) appointed Dr. Theodore A. Stamas as the first Supreme Advisor of the Junior Order. Dr. Stamas took charge of the <span class="page-break">4</span>Sons at a time when the conditions in it were not very promising. Yet he did not lose courage. Hampered by lack of financial support and inadequate constitutional and ritualistic legislation to govern the affairs of the Junior Order, he nevertheless worked earnestly and untiringly and succeeded in presenting an organization of twenty-four chapters at the Detroit convention of the Ahepa.</p>
   <p>With a view to remedying the inadequacies in constitution and ritualistic legislation a committee of four, consisting of Brothers Stamas, Veras, Stylianos and Varkas met in New York about two months before the Detroit Convention and, after consulting with a few leaders of the Junior Order in that city, drafted a new form of government which provided for the establishment of an advisory board of five, appointed by the Supreme Lodge of the Ahepa, to govern the affairs of the Junior Order. Under this plan the domain of the Sons of Pericles was divided into five districts under the various members of the advisory board. A Supreme Board of five, under the chairmanship of Brother James Veras, was appointed by the Supreme <span class="page-break">5</span>Lodge of the Ahepa, at its meeting held in Detroit after the convention. Brother Veras, as chairman of that board, devoted a great deal of his time to the affairs of the Sons of Pericles and attended their Washington convention, assisting them in the conduct of their affairs and supervising their work generally. At this convention the action of the Ahepa in adopting them wasmade known to the Junior Order. The constitution and by-laws prepared by the four members above named was considered and adopted with various modifications which were subsequently approved by Supreme Advisor Veras, acting for the Supreme Advisory Board.</p>
   <p>At the February 1930 meeting of the Supreme Lodge, Supreme President Phillies appointed Brother P. S. Marthakis Supreme Advisor and each Supreme Governor was requested to exercise supervisory powers over the chapters that happened to be within his gubernatorial district. This, I believe, was meant as a temporary expedient, since the constitution of the Sons of Pericles, which has been duly approved by the Supreme Advisor, requires the appointment by the Supreme Lodge of an advisory board of five.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In order to enable the delegates to consider discussion on the Junior Order Intelligently, there is submitted below a summary of the most important provisions of their constitution. Their government is divided into five parts:</p>
   <p>1. Mother Lodge</p>
   <p>2. Supreme Advisory Board</p>
   <p>3. Local Advisory Boards</p>
   <p>4. Supreme Council</p>
   <p>5. Chapters</p>
   <p>The Mother Lodge consists of eleven members of the Manchester Chapter of the Sons who founded the Order. It is an honorary body.</p>
   <p>The Supreme Advisory Board consists of five members of the Ahepa, appointed by the Supreme Lodge of the Ahepa. This Board has power to make rules or regulations <span class="page-break">7</span>for the welfare of the Junior Order. The Supreme Archon Megistan and Supreme Scribe have the privilege of participating in deliberations of the Advisory Board but no vote. Each member of the Advisory Board has direct control of local advisory boards, that is to say, boards appointed by various chapters of the Ahepa to advise the Sons. The chairman of the Supreme Advisory Board represents the Board, supervises the activities of the Supreme Council of the Junior Order, and is supposed to render a quarterly report to the Supreme Lodge of the Ahepa.</p>
   <p>Local Advisory Boards are boards consisting of three Ahepans, appointed by a chapter of the Ahepa to supervise the affairs of the local chapter of the Junior Order.</p>
   <p>The Supreme Council consists of the Supreme Archon Megistan, the Supreme Megistan, the Supreme Scribe and the Supreme Treasurer. They are elected by the convention for a term of two years.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Chapters. At least ten young men of Hellenic descent are required to form a chapter. They must have passed their fifteenth year and have not yet completed their twenty-first. When they reach their twenty-first birthday they are automatically dropped from the Order, except that if they are Supreme Officers they may be allowed to finish their term of office. Inactive members are those who, having reached the age limit, by paying a dollar a year, may attend meetings without participating in the business. Their convention is held every two years. It has power to pass rules and regulations for the welfare of the Order; to determine the amount of initiation fees and per capita tax, and a few other minor matters. All of the powers of the convention, however, are subject to the approval of the Supreme Advisory Board.</p>
   <p>Fees. The minimum initiation fee is $3.50; the maximum $10.00. Two dollars of this goes to the Supreme Council. The per capita tax is fifty cents a year, payable on the 31st day of December.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Apparently there is nothing either in the constitution of the Junior Order or in that of the Ahepa to assure the Ahepa that a member of the Sons of Pericles will, as soon as he is automatically dropped upon reaching the age limit, become a member of the Ahepa. Neither is there anything to help a member of the Junior Order to find his way into the ranks of the Ahepa. It is our anxious desire that members of the Sons of Pericles will receive their preliminary training in the Junior Order and thus be adequately equipped to assume positions of leadership and responsibility in the Ahepa in the course of time. While there are mutual expressions of love, fidelity and common interest to be found in the constitution of the Junior Order, as well as in various legislative enactments of the Ahepa, it appears, nevertheless, that many of the Sons exhibit a filial urge toward the Ahepa while under its maternalistic surveillance but become apathetic to its beaconing soon after reaching maturity. The Ahepa should endeavor to check this tendency toward enstrangement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>Subsequent Amendments</p>
   <p>The above summary of the Junior Order's constitution was made before their Detroit Convention which was held shortly before our Boston Convention. At Detroit the boys amended their constitution, particularly with reference to finances, charging a chapter fee of $5.00, raising the minimum initiation fee to $5.00 instead of $3.50, and raising the per capita tax to $1.00 instead of 50c.</p>
   <p>Equalization Fund</p>
   <p>Perhaps the most important amendment to their constitution in respect to finances was the creation of an Equalization Fund, the nature and purpose of which is explained in Article 2, Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9, quoted below.</p>
   <span class="page-break">11</span>
   <p>Sec. 6. The necessary expenses for transporting chapter delegates to and from the Convention shall be met in part by an Equalization Fund to be maintained by the Supreme Council and Supreme Advisory Board by such ways and means as they may deem available.</p>
   <p>Sec. 7. Each chapter shall be credited in the Equalization Fund with a percentage of railroad and pullman fares of its delegate to and from the place of Convention by a direct and continuous route; said percentage to be estimated in accordance with a Radial Zoning Plan having the Convention city as a center.</p>
   <p>Sec. 8. Any balance of the Equalization Fund remaining from year to year shall be retained by the Fraternity as a separate fund for equalization of delegates' transportation expenses solely.</p>
   <p>Sec. 9. All Supreme Council officers shall be allowed railroad fare and Pullman to and from the place of Convention, or on any other official trip, and an allowance of Eight ($8.00) Dollars per diem.</p>
   <span class="page-break">12</span>
   <p>At the Boston Convention of the Ahepa, held only two weeks after the Detroit Convention of the Juniors, the following action was taken with reference to the Junior Order:</p>
   <p>The Advisory Board was abolished and the responsibility of supervising the Sons was delegated to the local chapter of the Ahepa acting through a committee of three. An attempt was made to abolish the Supreme Council of the Sons, but after considerable discussion the following was substituted:</p>
   <p>"That the Supreme Council of the Sons of Pericles cooperate with the Supreme Lodge of the Ahepa."</p>
   <p>"That for the immediate future no convention of the Sons shall be held", the words "immediate future" being interpreted to mean that there shall not be another convention of the Sons of Pericles before the next (present) convention of the Ahepa, and that the Supreme Lodge at its next meeting was to set a date for the convention of the Junior Order, which convention is to take place subsequent to this convention.</p>
   <span class="page-break">13</span>
   <p>An appropriation of $1,500 was made, $1000 of which was to constitute the Equalization Fund above referred to and the other $500 to meet incidental expenses of the headquarters of the Junior Order, if need appear. No part of this money was turned over to the Sons. An urgent request for the $1000 was made by the Supreme President of the Junior Order but the Supreme Lodge did not feel at liberty to draw a check in that amount to his order; neither did it appear necessary to make a physical separation of such funds from other deposits of the Ahepa. The fund can as well remain with the Supreme Treasurer of the Ahepa and authorized charges against it be paid by him. A request was also made to pay a substantial amount out of the $500, for the expenses of printing the "Periclean Magazine". This, too, was denied on the ground that the $500 was not appropriated for that purpose, the Ahepa Convention having expressly provided that four pages of the Ahepa Magazine be devoted to news of the Junior Order.</p>
   <p>Heretofore legislation affecting the Sons of Pericles was submitted to their convention for acceptance subject to reasonable modifications by the Juniors, which in turn were to be approved by the Supreme Lodge Advisor. Whatever <span class="page-break">14</span>recommendations touching the government of the Junior Order were made at our Detroit Convention, were presented to the Sons by Supreme Advisor Veras at their Washington Convention, which took place right after our Detroit Convention. However, the Juniors accelerated the date of the next convention and thus when they met in Boston, and while we were legislating for them, their convention had already terminated and, what's more, at that convention they amended their constitution so as to hold biennial conventions. This fact together with the abolishment of the Supreme Advisory Board, leaves open the question as to the validity of the legislation adopted by the Boston Ahepa Convention respecting the affairs of the Sons of Pericles which could not be brought officially to their attention.</p>
   <p>In the absence of an Advisory Board and a Supreme Advisor to okay the amendments made to the Junior constitution at the Detroit Convention, said amendments were okay'd by Brother Phillies as Supreme President of the Ahepa. Presumably, therefore, the amendments which the Juniors have made to their own constitution <span class="page-break">15</span>are in full force and effect but the amendments made by the Ahepa Convention at Boston have not followed their usual course for reasons above explained.</p>
   <p>Recommendations</p>
   <p>1. In view of the difficulties experienced in coordinating the results of the Ahepa Convention and those of the Sons of Pericles, and the resulting disagreements and misunderstandings on account of such a lack of coordination, it is recommended that provision be made for holding the convention of the Junior Order at the same time as that of the Ahepa. It is not necessary to devote an entire week to the Junior Convention. It is believed that one day of the convention week should be set aside as "Junior Day" during which the Junior Order will carry on their work. If properly organized, there is no reason why the business of the Junior Order should require more than a good full day for its completion. It Is submitted that this arrangement has many advantages:</p>
   <p>a. It will be conducive to more efficiency in doing the business of the Ahepa, for with knowledge that our convention must end by Saturday <span class="page-break">16</span>night, and that one day of the week is to be taken out for the Junior Convention, we will be inclined to utilize the time more advantageously.</p>
   <p>b. It will be a great moral "prop" to the Junior Order to conduct a convention in the midst of their senior Brethren and perhaps teach them a few things.</p>
   <p>c. The additional expense required in carrying on a separate convention of the Junior Order is eliminated.</p>
   <p>d. The greatest good which can come from such an arrangement is that the views may be exchanged between the representatives of the two conventions, resulting in a more harmonious basis of cooperation. Under the present arrangement we legislate for the Junior Order without being fully informed as to the needs of the boys and without having their side of the story. We cannot go wrong if we follow the time-honored and <span class="page-break">17</span>proven maxim that government should be acceptable to those who are governed.</p>
   <p>2. That the Supreme Advisory Board, which is theoretically the connecting link between the two Orders, should be abolished. This recommendation was made by the committee of the Sons of Pericles at the Boston Convention and was adopted. It is repeated here, and the convention is asked to go on record unequivocally and positively. It is still carried in the constitution of the Junior Order as a branch of the government.</p>
   <p>3. That the Supreme Council of the Sons of Pericles be abolished and that all their organization work be carried on under the direction of the Ahepa, headquarters.</p>
   <p>4. That the Ahepa Headquarters establish a department of auxiliaries to supervise the work of the Sons of Pericles, as well as that of any other auxiliary organization which may in the future be adopted by the Ahepa, and that this department be a part of and subject to the supervision of the Headquarters.</p>
   <span class="page-break">18</span>
   <p>5. That the Supreme Governors or District Governors, or whatever the title shall be of those who shall, after this Convention, supervise the work of a limited number of Ahepa chapters within a given jurisdiction, should also have the same powers and duties with reference to the supervision and establishment of chapters of the Junior Order.</p>
   <p>6. Space should be given in the publication of the Ahepa for Junior news, or, if they are to have a separate publication it should be under the supervision of the Ahepa Headquarters.</p>
