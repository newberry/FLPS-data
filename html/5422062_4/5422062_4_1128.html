   <p>An appeal for justice to Greece and to men of Grecian blood under Turkish rule was sent to-day by wireless to President Wilson in the form of a resolution adopted by a meeting of Chicago Greeks in the Garrick Theater Sunday night.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers at the meeting were former Governor Dunne, Peter S. Lambros, Greek publisher, and George L. Knapp of the Journal. The meeting cheered the Journal for its stand in favor of a just settlement for the nations of southern Europe. The resolution follows:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that no Turkish Government be allowed to rule the subject races, including the Greeks in the Ottoman Empire; that our native countries, Thrace, Greek Macedonia, Asia Minor, the Aegean Islands, and North Epirus, <span class="page-break">2</span>regions historically Greek, be united with the mother-country; that restoration and rehabilitation be provided for Greeks deported and despoiled by Turks and Bulgarians; and that President Wilson and the heads of the Allied Governments be requested to support in the coming peace conference our sacred national rights.</p>
