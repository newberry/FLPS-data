   <p>p. 2.- At a recent banquet which the Greek Professional Men of Chicago gave for the Greek graduates, a surprising thing took place. The question of the Greek language was raised among the professionals. C. Thomas, president of the organization maintained that the Greek language will disappear in twenty-five years and will have no significance at all in the future.</p>
   <p>It is bad enough that our professionals have changed their names so that no one knows they are Greek, but to hear them say that the Greek language isn't very important is treason!</p>
   <p>Then what purpose have the Greek schools in America? Why are the Greek communities trying to preserve the Greek schools? Since the Greek professionals say the Greek language isn't important, it must be true - for they are the most educated Greek group we have.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>To preserve the Greek language and religion, the bloody war of 1821 was fought. Have we forgotten that so soon? We should be proud of our language and everything it stands for. Rather than fear such slanderous remarks from the Professional Club, let it dissolve and be no more.</p>
