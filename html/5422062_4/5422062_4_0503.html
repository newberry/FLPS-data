   <p>We are pleased to announce that this year, for the first time in its long history, the Greek Women's Club had a balance of five hundred and five dollars in its treasury.</p>
   <p>The Club is well known among our people for its great charitable work. Many hundreds of destitute and sick Greek families have been helped, and much suffering has been alleviated, by this remarkable and praiseworthy philanthropic club.</p>
   <p>We hope that it will receive the support of every kind and magnanimous soul.</p>
