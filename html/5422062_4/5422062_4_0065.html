   <p>There are very few local organizations in Chicago whose progress can in any way be compared to that of the benevolent Tanaean Society of Chicago.</p>
   <p>This Society was organized fifteen years ago, and now has four hundred members. It has given many thousands of dollars to various patriotic and philanthropic causes.</p>
   <p>The President of this Society is Mr. E. Katorinis....the Clubs' physician is Mr. C. Haloulas.</p>
   <p>The Tanaeans of Chicago are well-deserving of the esteem and praise of the entire Greek community.</p>
