   <p>The Nea Genea of the South Side is giving a dance on February 24, at the Trianon Ballroom. Because the Apokdreas holiday is on that day, costumes are to be worn and prizes will be given to winners of the various contests which are going to be staged. Everybody is preparing a costume for the Trianon dances, are you?</p>
