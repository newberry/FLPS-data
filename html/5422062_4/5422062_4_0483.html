   <p>Chicago Liberals:</p>
   <p>With bitter anguish and sorrow I announce to you that the Athens Red Cross, whose supreme president is Queen Sophia, the Kaiser's sister, has categorically denied any help to our brothers in Salonica who are fighting against the Bulgars, the allies of Germany. Venizelos, in making the announcement, wires me as follows:</p>
   <p>"In need of funds, I urgently appeal to all Greek communities in the United States to form committees in order to raise money, hospital materials, linen, surgeons' instruments, etc. It is expedient to have 6,000 beds, and we have only 2,000."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>If the Kaiser's sister, as head of the Red Cross, acts inhumanely, the Greeks of America in the name of Greece and of humanity will respond to the needs of our wounded brother-Greeks who need medical attention.</p>
   <p>Your brothers in Salonica are fighting for Greece, expecting you to assist them with the above-mentioned articles. Immediate response is necessary.</p>
   <p>P. Aravantinos.</p>
   <p>Comments upon this are unnecessary. Your contributions must be sent to Mr. Nick Demopoulos, president of the organization committee of the Chicago Liberals, 651 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
