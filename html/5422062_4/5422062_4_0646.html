   <p>Doctor Volikos, Chicago Greek physician, was trapped by a reporter from the Examiner. This reporter presented himself at the doctor's office, and asked for an injection of morphine. He did this because [he had heard that] the police suspected Dr. John Volikos of selling narcotics illegally, and were trying to get proof of it.</p>
   <p>The death of a young girl who had been treated by this doctor threw suspicion upon him. The reporter went to another girl who was being treated by the doctor and got a letter of introduction from her. When he asked the doctor for an injection, the latter agreed to administer it and prepared instruments. Just as he was about to make the injection, the reporter blew a whistle, summoning two policemen who had been stationed outside.</p>
   <p>The enraged Volikos destroyed the hypodermic syringe, and tried to choke the reporter. The doctor even tried to bribe the three men, but the policemen hustled him off to jail. He was put under a two-thousand-dollar bond. The penalty for <span class="page-break">2</span>the illegal sale of narcotics is two years imprisonment.</p>
