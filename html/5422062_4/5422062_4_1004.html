   <p>There are two fundamental necessities for the continuation of the existence of any race; they are church and language. In order that our nationality does not undergo the same fate as some other nations--that of being de-characterized and completely assimilated--it is necessary that our church be a watchful and worthy shepherd of its flock; and should encourage and promote that which holds a group together more than anything else--language. Therefore we have a serious need for good Churches, and for a cultured, refined clergy. A clergy who are unselfish and true to their calling; a clergy who by their actions command the respect and admiration of their associates. That is not all that is necessary to us.</p>
   <p>We desperately are in need of good schools and teachers who are pedagogues of good character. If the proper teachers and clergy were provided, our young generation would simultaneously develop a love for Greek literature and the orthodox religion. Both are dependent upon one another for their existence; therefore our path of duty is clear before us.</p>

   <p>A school is being built, according to the latest designs, and it needs the support of everyone who is interested in the Greek education of our younger generations. For this reason a dance is being held at the Coliseum Annex on June the seventh. The board of directors of the West Side Church will soon visit all the Greek stores to ask for donations to this sacred cause.</p>
   <p>We recommend, in behalf of this holy cause, that you support this dance. To be absent from this dance will be a serious moral offence and will reflect social indifference.</p>
   <p>Support the Greek school if you wish to save and educate your children!</p>
   <p>Forward to your duty, your God and your country.</p>
