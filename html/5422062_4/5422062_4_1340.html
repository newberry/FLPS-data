   <p>The Board of Directors of the Chicago Liberal and Democratic League invited its members, as well as nonmembers, to a meeting held last Sunday at 2:00 P.M. in Bowen Hall of Hull House. Registration of new members took place at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
   <p>At 2:30 P.M., the meeting was called to order by the president of the League, Mr. Elias Kontaxopoulos. He spoke convincingly and with invincible arguments about the mission and the purpose of the League, which is the re-establishment of democracy in Greece. He said that only by the restoration of democracy will Greece be saved. He then introduced the beloved attorney, Mr. George Kyriacopoulos, who extolled the great benefits and results derived from a democratic form of government. He said that we are leading an enviable life here in this great republic. "Why," said he, "should our homeland be deprived of a republican form of government and the consequent benefits? Why should it insist on a pathetic and sinful political life that belongs <span class="page-break">\2</span>to the past? Is not Greece the cradle of democracy, the only true political system which guarantees happiness to its citizens?" He remarked that conditions in Greece would be much different, if, instead of an insane, vain, destructive, and irresponsible king, we had a responsible leader, a president, who was elected by the people, subject to their control and responsible to them for the consequences of his actions. The fortunes of Greece would be greatly improved, if, instead of the present king, she had Mr. Eleutherios Venizelos as president. The speech of Mr. Kyriacopoulos was received with great applause.</p>
   <p>Afterwards, Mr. Halepas, editor of New Life, a monthly periodical, spoke on the duties of citizens to their country, and the country's obligations to its citizens. He referred to ancient history, mentioning the time when Periander, the tyrant of Corinth, asked a philosopher What would be the best way to govern a country. The philosopher answered that the country will be best governed when the slightest injury to the most insignificant citizen is considered an injury against the State itself. The wise man <span class="page-break">\3</span>desired to inform the tyrant that the injustices wrought against individual citizens are injustices against the people in general, and, as long as this happens, wise statesmanship is nonexistent. That is why the people, and they alone, are in a position to decide and direct the affairs of the State. The speech of Mr. Halepas was applauded with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mr. Constantine Paleologos was then requested to speak. He spoke about his journey to Greece and his interviews with the former Greek viceroy, Kountouriotis, and members of the Council of Ministers. He said that he informed former political leaders of the attitude and activities of the Greek people of America. They were greatly interested in the life and affairs of the Greeks of America, he said. Mr. Paleologos then examined the causes of the results of the recent elections in Greece, attributing them to anti-Venizelist elements that were working subversively and treacherously, both while their master, King Constantine, was in exile in Lucerne, Switzerland, and also while employed in the various governmental services during the Venizelos regime. He said that hypocrisy, misrepresentation, and bribery <span class="page-break">\4</span>on the part of double-faced high and subordinate officials largely contributed to the defeat of the Liberal Republican party. He said that the election was not won by the popularity of, or with the adoration that the people entertain for, King Constantine. "The present leaders of Greece prevailed because they employed hateful, deceitful methods to mislead and misinform the Greek people," declared Mr. Paleologos. "It must be understood," he added, "that the result of the election was the verdict of only sixty per cent of a population of 4,500,000. What about the other forty per cent and the eighty per cent of the Greeks living outside Greece, who are predominantly liberals?"</p>
   <p>"It is imperative that the party resort to a thorough housecleaning of the homeland political affairs. The good seed will not grow on thorny or weedy soil. So, out with the assassins, traitors, and political criminals!" The end of the speech was drowned in lengthy applause. A resolution was adopted and sent to Venizelos. Then the reporters of the American press of Chicago were thanked for their interest in Greek political affairs.</p>

   <p>Finally, the eight hundred individuals participating in the Meeting dispersed to the various Greek centers, becoming the heralds of democracy and of the Greek Liberal party.</p>
