   <p>Because the recent agitation over our parish problems has not yet died down, and because the majority of our people justly demand that our declining churches be reorganized more efficiently, and because no one of our all-powerful or self-idolizing community leaders has given any heed to the articles written by the Reverend Daniel Golemis, I again take up this matter, the solution of which is imperative...</p>
   <p>I beg to inform my readers that I am not an atheist. Neither am I a denouncer of religion, or of the Church; on the contrary, I am seeking to help maintain their existence and insure their progress...</p>
   <p>There is a common opinion that professional men do not take an active part in <span class="page-break">2</span>community life because they are either unbelievers or too egotistical to listen to anyone's opinion except their own. This is not true. Greek men and women of the higher intellectual order have often tried to help their people, only to have their reputations and names besmirched and denounced. That is why they refrain from expressing publicly opinions on social problems.</p>
   <p>Now what is to be done? Must this social indifference and blindness be allowed to lead us further into chaos and ruin? How does our ecclesiastical situation here in Chicago compare with our pretensions of Christianity and patriotism? Perhaps this situation would be forgivable if this were the period when we were all ignorant immigrants. At that time we were blindly led by any priest, president, or bag of wind who came along--or by any church. Then our priest would stop in the middle of a sermon to shout "Shut up" at someone in the back of the church. At other times, all of us--the majority having no inkling of what it all was about--would run to the church or to Hull House, in the wake of some political jellyfish to make all kinds of decisions and to start all kinds of movements. But we should all realize by now that we are no longer <span class="page-break">3</span>living in that period, and that we, supposedly, have ceased to be ignorant immigrants. Now we are orientated, for most of us who came here as immigrants have grown old in this country. We have reared families, and now we have young Greek boys and girls to endow with the benefits of our experience and labor. It is our duty to rear them in accordance with our religious and cultural precepts.</p>
   <p>We parents, at least, realize the struggles which must be undergone in order that these precepts may be deeply rooted within our children by their home life and their education. At least, those who are parents understand the feeling of shame which comes over anyone who takes his child to the dark, dirty, stable-like place--nobly titled a "Greek school"--located in the basement of a church. The contrast between the lovely, clean, airy American school and his evening Greek school is enough to make a child hate his Greek school and refuse to retain anything that reminds him of it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>As individuals we have achieved remarkable success. We have maintained evidence of our strength in the American business and economic world. The Greek immigrant of yesterday is represented in American economic life by sound business firms; in American cultural life, he is represented by notable professors, artists, and students in the universities and cultural groups. Our social activities and philanthropic dances are so well attended and so well conducted that they are a source of envy to the American people.</p>
   <p>But we as a group are failures. After so many years, and after the expenditure of so many hundreds of thousands of dollars, we have nothing to point to with pride. Even those few unworthy institutions which we do have are not really ours, for they either are housed in heavily mortgaged buildings or in rented ones.</p>
   <p>Parallel with our social success is the success of our clubs and societies, large and small. Although they have often been governed by men of little ability and knowledge, they nevertheless have made many long-lasting, worth-while <span class="page-break">5</span>accomplishments. The majority of them have imposing bank accounts and thousands of active, interested members.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, in antithesis to our social strength is the weakness of our basic community institutions. Although they are headed by capable people who are nearly all graduates of universities or theological seminaries, they have nevertheless accomplished nothing. Our churches have huge debts, patheti-cally small congregations, and small bank accounts or none at all. None of this is secret. I do not desire to make any comparison between our churches and our large organizations; for unfortunately, a comparison between Gapa or Ahepa and our churches is not possible. If, however, we use as a criterion any one of our present societies in Chicago, we shall discover that it will have a larger active paying membership than all of the churches put together. And this, despite the fact that our churches represent more than seventy thousand Chicago Orthodox Greeks, and a Greek topical society but a small number of these. Does not, then, something ail our church and parish systems? Is not the mechanism rested and antiquated? Is it not our duty to take this rested <span class="page-break">6</span>mechanism, throw it out, and replace it with shiny, new, smooth-running parts?</p>
   <p>Of course it is; and in the next article I shall outline the steps to be taken for this accomplishment.</p>
