   <p>The Association of Aphisiotes will give its first annual dance this following Sunday, December 16, at the West Side Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The collections from this dance will be spent to build a church in the village Aphisiou, Sparta. The purpose is very sacred; the committee has worked, so those who shall be present will spend a very lovely evening.</p>
   <p>Speakers of the evening will be: John W. Gibson, State Representative of the 6th Senatorial District; Charles Reinhart, President of the National Bond and Mortgage Co.; and Thomas M. Devaney, Precinct Captain of the 47th Ward. Senator McCormick has been invited.</p>
