   <p>Difficulties are arising in our communities over the question of organizing one central united community for all the Greeks of Chicago. Of course we don't expect the thing to be completed in a "jiffy", out after all this time nothing at all seems to be concrete. This question is occupying the minds of many and they wish to know what is going on. The Greeks of Chicago are entirely within their rights in asking for this.</p>
   <p>We heard from Bishop Callistos that he had plans for saving the situation. With great respect and reverence to His Holiness we only say that we have seen naught of these plans. We know the question is not easy to answer, yet an attempt should be made at it.</p>

   <p>Maybe if our various church communities would stop fighting each other and start fighting together, we would get somewhere. The problem is too important for us to quibble over trifles.</p>
   <p>We are all striving to retain the Greek language, ideals and customs for years to come. With delay after delay coming up, precious time is being lost. The community of Chicago had better do something in a hurry and the only way to do this is by making a central community of all the Greek communities in Chicago.</p>
