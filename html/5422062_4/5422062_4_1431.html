   <p>It is very encouraging to receive news of the continued progress and expansion of the widely known and powerful Greek Patriotic Macedonian Society. At its last meeting, thirty-one new members from our community were initiated, representing our professional, business, and labor classes.</p>
   <p>It is very heartening to see that as an index and barometer of the abounding energy and progress of our community as a whole, the Macedonian Society is making rapid strides in the social, educational, and charitable fields.</p>
   <p>No obstacle, no opposition of any kind--and there has been plenty of it recently--can deter the Macedonians from working for the attainment of their praiseworthy and beneficial objectives.</p>
   <p>We hope that more Greeks will take advantage of the excellent opportunities and social benefits offered by this great and truly Greek organization.</p>
