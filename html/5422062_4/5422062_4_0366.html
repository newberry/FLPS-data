   <p>On May 10 five tons of quinine were shipped to Greece by order of the American Red Cross. This is the second shipment of quinine to Greece, and another will follow if it is needed to combat the malarial fever there.</p>
   <p>The epidemic of malaria was spreading in refugee centers; so the Minister of Public Safety, Mr. Pazis, thought it necessary to distribute medicines as soon as possible to persons infected. In this second shipment fourteen million pills of quinine were sent, valued at $86,000. All this was done at the expense of the American Red Cross, which helped greatly to relieve the suffering Greek refugees. They are deeply grateful for the assistance given by the Americans.</p>
