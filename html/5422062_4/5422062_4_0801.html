   <p>P. 4-- A forty-thousand-dollar real-estate purchase was negotiated last week by Mr. Angelos Yokaris, a member of the Chicago Greek firm of Yokaris and Stamatides, 51 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
   <p>The $40,000 lots are located at the corner of Kedzie Avenue and Madison Street.</p>
   <p>Very recently Mr. Yokaris purchased the northeast corner of Fifty-second Avenue and Madison Street for $7,000.</p>
   <p>This enterprising and progressive Greek has acted very wisely, for both his purchases in years to come will be worth untold fortunes.</p>
   <p>Those who are able to invest money in real estate are urged to do so, first for their own individual profit and second for the benefit of the Greek community in Chicago. It is now generally admitted that the great majority of the Greeks in America will remain here and establish themselves as part of this world, and for permanent establishment the possession of real property is indispensable not only to them but also to their children. The community <span class="page-break">2</span>will become known as prosperous or as indigent according to the foundations laid by its pioneers. Buy property now, derive the benefit from it, and pass it on to your descendants. The safest investment of all is real property. It is the best promoter of a boom for any city. It benefits the entire community and the entire city. Those who now buy plenty of undeveloped property will be proclaimed wise men hereafter. Towns and cities are expanded and multiplied by the purchase of property.</p>
