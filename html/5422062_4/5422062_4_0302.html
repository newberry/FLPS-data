   <p>p. 4.- To all the Greeks of Chicago:</p>
   <p>After the great seismic disturbance in Corinth, the General Consul feels it his duty to acquaint the Greeks of Chicago with conditions that have been brought about by this catastrophe. Greece needs our help very badly, as much help as we can give.</p>
   <p>I am appealing to your patriotic and philanthropical ideals. I am asking all clubs, societies, charities and individuals to do what they can.</p>
   <p>All donations should be made payable to the Greek consul and names and amounts will be published in the newspapers.</p>
   <p>Chicago, April 24, 1928.</p>
   <p>General Consul</p>
   <p>G. Depastas.</p>
