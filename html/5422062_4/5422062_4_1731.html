   <p>On February 15 the Koraes School of the South Side Church, Saint Constantine, gave an entertainment in honor of the Day of the Three Ierarchons (three saintly men whose Saint days are celebrated at one time). This holiday has always been one that is celebrated by the schools. The school hall had been decorated entirely with lovely fresh flowers, and Greek and American flags. The decorating had been done by the Reverend Prousianos, the Ladies Club, the teachers, and the students. These people also sold many tickets, in order to aid the finances of the school.</p>
   <p>To the great satisfaction of everyone, many prominent people of other nationalities were present; and, of course, a large number of Greeks attended. The program was divided into two parts; the first part was devoted to celebrating the holiday, and the second part was devoted to a program of dancing.</p>

   <p>The first part began with the playing of the Greek and American national anthems, followed by twenty-seven patriotic songs, poems, dialogues, and recitations by the boys and girls. These boys and girls were dressed in national Greek costumes, and when they performed the "Dance of Zallogou" they aroused emotion in every heart in the audience.</p>
   <p>The Panegyric of the day was made by the principal, Miss Maria Pallikari, who spoke of the sacredness of a school, and its influence on patriotism. The teaching of the American songs must be credited to Miss Sofia Gerembakaki, a graduate of the American College of Smyrna; who also teaches English.</p>
   <p>The second part of the program included various dances. Mr. B. Kanellos, well-known classic dancer, graciously volunteered to dance for the audience.</p>
   <p>Everything that could be thought of to insure the success of the program was done by a committee which consisted of Mr. L. Malakates, J. Drapanias, <span class="page-break">3</span>P. Economou, G. Lambesis, and A. Karagiannis.</p>
   <p>Congratulations are due to all who participated in this affair.</p>
