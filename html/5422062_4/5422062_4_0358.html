   <p>p.3.-- Dear friends,</p>
   <p>I wish to assure all the Greeks in America that the funds which they contribute are all spent exclusively for the support of the Greek orphans in the orphanages of the Near East Relief and in the refugee settlements in Greek villages.</p>
   <p>The Near East Relief and the other committees also cooperating with it also accept money-orders to be sent to aged refugees.</p>
   <p>The needs of the refugees to-day are urgent, especially those of the orphans in the refugee settlements.</p>
   <p>Hoping that you will come to the rescue and assist us in meeting this critical and urgent condition, I remain,</p>
   
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>E. C. Miller, auditor.</p>
