   <p>The 25th of March, 1908, was celebrated with all the pomp and magnificence which are proper on such a great occasion. The eighty-seventh anniversary of our national independence is a time when the Greeks throughout the world, together with our brothers in the distant homeland, should remember the historic achievements of our forefathers, who fought against the powerful Ottoman Empire. For nine long and difficult years, they fought that we, the later generations of Greeks, may enjoy and inherit the blessings of freedom, political independence, a promising and regenerated national Greek state, and the inalienable right to shape our own destiny as a free people. This year's anniversary challenged our sense of obligation. It prompted us to burn incense in memory of those heroic figures of 1821, who adorn every niche of our national Pantheon. At this time our thoughts and our most grateful hearts dwell on the <span class="page-break">\2</span>past.</p>
   <p>We acknowledge the miraculous deeds which our forefathers of three generations accomplished under the most trying circumstances. There sacred struggle guides and directs us as a brilliant star. By such feats we shall be moved and inspired to admire and emulate the inexhaustible spirit and the patriotism with which they won the highest prize--the freedom of the Greek people.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of Chicago are particularly appreciative of the blessings and privileges which they have received. Among the latter may be counted the night to be called citizens of a free homeland, a free Greece. At this time the Greeks of Chicago should recall our glorious history of the epic of 1821, but they should also think of their future by reviewing and evaluating the present.</p>
   <p>It would profit the Greek Community of Chicago to be reminded of only a few <span class="page-break">\3</span>historical incidents and facts which contributed to our freedom and which formed the background of present-day Greece.</p>
   <p>The Greek instigators of the war of liberation recovered the torch of liberty whose light was obscured by the endless darkness of four dreadful centuries of slavery. The iron chains of slavery were broken. The agelong injustices and the oppression of the tyrant were finally avenged. The sun rose bright again over a land which was reduced to ruins a thousand times. The Greek flag which is adorned with the cross was again hoisted over a free land. The blood of martyrs and the spirit of self-sacrifice were sanctified by the preservence and heroism of our forefathers. The imperishable glory of Greece is being revived-thanks to the struggle of brave Greeks of the recent past who believed in Christ and in the just cause of freedom. There is no doubt that the spirit of Greece which has influenced the course of world civilization will rise again and affect profoundly the destinies of the world through philosophy, culture, literature, and Christianity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In praising whatever our ancestors have created, for a moment we imagine that perhaps the merciful and all powerful hand of God made such perfect and marvelous fighters for the cause of freedom in 1821. But, our imagination halts and the historian's pen stops when we consider that Miaoulis and Kanaris did not educate themselves in any naval academy; that Androutsos, Kolokotronis, Mauromichalis, and Karaiskakis were not trained in any military school (Trans. note-All the aforementioned were some of the principal leaders and heroes of the Greek Revolutionary War of 1821). The feat which these men achieved, the naval and military victories which they won, the miracle of Greece's liberation were all the result of the strong religious sentiment, the unquestioned patriotism, the pure characters, the unshaken convictions, and the stout heart of these demi-gods of 1821, in whose breast the sacred fire of liberty was burning strong.</p>
   <p>But, is it perhaps our task to praise and eulogize the genius of our fore-fathers? Are praises and admiration needed by such men, who have adorned the 
<span class="page-break">\5</span>pages of world history with immortal deeds wrought with the blood of heroes?</p>
   <p>Do the serene and holy spirits of our glorious ancestors have any rest when their descendants content themselves with typical and routine festivities and celebrations? Nay, they need no one to sing their praises, for their glory is imperishable. No doubt, they never intended to demand that we remain faithful to their name and spirit with mere commemorative or patriotic celebrations.</p>
   <p>Were it possible for them to come down to us from the Pantheon of Immortality in which they dwell and were they to see the evils and faults which surround us, undoubtedly, they would say that though we are sons of heroes, we are unworthy to speak of it, and unworthy of our ancient and recent glorious history and past fame. If they were to visit us again they would notice that we have not completed the work which they began. They would see that some of us are celebrating while a great many Greeks are sighing under a foreign and oppressive yoke.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Since we cannot enjoy such a visit, however, it is our duty to remember our forefathers by kneeling humbly before the sacred altar of their memory contemplating the undeniable fact that the Greek nation has subjugated the invaders and masters of Greece; it has not vanished in the engulfing destruction of the Roman and Ottoman Empires. Let us use this truth as a guiding light for the future which shall unite us and give our race courage and strength to recapture "the glory that was Greece".</p>
   <p>But, if we are to follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and be called their deserving descendants and heirs, we must not perform some sort of routine ceremony in their honor once a year. We must not be satisfied with this only. Day and night the Greek people must be conscious of the significance and deep meaning of the resurrection of our race which took place eighty-seven years ago. As they, we must always remember that what we have gained we must preserve; as they, we must remember the ancient saying of Themistocles who used to say that the victories of Miltiades, that is, his ancestor will not suffer <span class="page-break">\7</span>him to sleep. The great historic past of Greece should not let us sleep. We should even strive to imitate our foregathers and contribute to the greatness and power of our people.</p>
   <p>Let us honor the memory of the heroes of 1821, but let us also direct our attention to the lands which are still occupied by a barbarous despotism. Let us not forget that beyond the limits of liberated Greece there are subject and oppressed brothers of ours who are longing to shake off their heavy yoke and unite with the mother country. Let us not forget that we all belong to a large and proud Greek family which must be kept free and united.</p>
   <p>We have had enough of fighting and strife among ourselves; let us put an end to fruitless petty feuds. Let us get rid of the horrible nightmare of hatred, spite, and disunity and let us reach up to the ideals for which we have been striving for ages. Prudence, intelligent direction of our community and national affairs, and sincere co-operation in all our endeavors will help us <span class="page-break">\8</span>pursue our common interests.</p>
   <p>Let us, the Greeks of Chicago, remember that we are called upon to contribute morally and materially for the liberation of the Greeks of Macedonia. The Greeks of Chicago and the Greeks of America can offer inestimable support to the Greek nation in its feverish efforts to strengthen the naval and military power of our homeland. Just like our ancestors, we must be even prepared to shed our blood, to sacrifice even our very lives for the territorial independence of Greece, for the emancipation of those nationals of ours who are subjected to a foreign rule on a cultural and ethnological Greek territory.</p>
   <p>May the sacred anniversary which we have just celebrated make us conscious of our sacred duty to our country, to our heritage, to our past, to our people, wherever they may be. The sacred memory of the heroes of the Greek Revolution of 1821 should give us added strength to forget our quarrels and forgive all those who have done us wrong. In this way, we shall be able to promote the <span class="page-break">\9</span>true interests of our community; in this way, the 25th of March will symbolize the dawn of a regenerated Greek people. Certainly, the Greeks of Chicago will be regenerated and will occupy a high station in American life, provided they accept numerous reforms, and decide to reorganize and recitalize their numerous activities and community life. Then, the 25th of March will have some meaning for us, as it certainly has for all true Greeks.</p>
