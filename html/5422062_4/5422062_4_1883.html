   <p>p. 5.- The eight chapters of the Order of Ahepa, a national organization, in a very imposing ceremony, installed the newly elected officers.</p>
   <p>The installation took place in the spacious Aragon Ball Room. Throngs of people began to arrive very early and by eight o'clock the great hall was crowded.</p>
   <p>When the installation ceremony began the hilarity of the crowds subsided and all the attention was turned toward the ceremonies. The officers and councils of each chapter, in groups, took the oath of the Order alternately. The various chapters are:</p>
   <p>Chicago chapter 46, North Shore chapter 94, Hellenic chapter 202, Evanston chapter 204, Woodlawn chapter 93, Oak Park chapter 104, Garfield chapter 203, Pullman chapter 205.</p>

   <p>Though there were many speeches delivered, all were brief, but full of eloquence. Each vied with the other in extolling the merits of this great Greek-American organization. Dancing followed the ceremony, which lasted until early hours of the morning. Over 6,000 people were present at the installation.</p>
