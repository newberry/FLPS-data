   <p>A merry gift-laden Santa Claus will make his way over the house tops of America tomorrow night. In his pack he will bring peace and joy to all hearts. The hearts of little children are especially gladdened at this time of the year. They rejoice at the anniversary of the birth of the baby Jesus, in whose name songs of rejoicing are voiced.</p>
   <p>For us Greeks and the other orthodox Christians it is the Saint Day of Saint Spiridonas, but this does not prevent us from partaking of the merry-making that is prevalent at the Christmas season. There is no one who has purchased Christmas gifts for the children, but feels that the gifts of Santa Claus are part of the religious and traditional celebrations of the season.</p>
   <p>The American Christmas is,as we said before, primarily for the children.</p>

   <p>Santa Claus, to them, is a symbol of hope and of reward for a year's good behaviour. The decorated tree is a symbol of light in an otherwise dark future.</p>
   <p>But the bright Santa Claus of America will don the long black robe of mourning when passing over the countries of Europe. There the devil has triumphed, and all in vain do the angels sing, "Peace on Earth, Goodwill to Men," and "Praise ye the Lord! Peoples of the Earth".</p>
   <p>There is no peace!</p>
   <p>There are no doxologies!</p>
   <p>There is no hope for goodwill!</p>
   <p>In Europe there is murder, hunger and misery. Human suffering beyond belief is reigning. Pity and brotherly love have been forgotten.</p>

   <p>The beautiful Christmas season we see celebrated in the churches and schools by gay laughing people is a dreary, forgotten holiday in the countries of Europe. Dead fathers are rotting upon the battle fields while the starving orphans cry from cold and hunger.</p>
   <p>Despite these happenings, we are overwhelmed by the American joyful Christmas; and so we of Saloniki say, "Merry Christmas".</p>
