   <p>In moving and fatherly terms Theocletos, the Metropolitan of Athens, Greece, thanks the Pan-Hellenic Society of Chicago, in a letter sent to the president of the society, for its contribution of one hundred pounds sterling for the sufferers of Adrianople.</p>
   <p>The Metropolitan, as president of the committee for the sufferers of Adrianople, takes the opportunity to express the sentiments of the Church toward the Chicago society and toward the Greeks of America in general in these words:</p>
   <p>"You and your fellow-Greeks of America are a tower of strength to Mother-Greece. Blessed be the Greek community of Chicago for being a mighty bulwark against our Bulgarian enemies!"</p>
   
   <p>The Star has thus another opportunity to congratulate the Pan-Hellenic Society for its philanthropic activities, which are a credit to us Greeks in America.</p>
