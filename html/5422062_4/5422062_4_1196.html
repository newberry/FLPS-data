   <p>Gapa has made great progress in the last few years and still continues to advance.</p>
   <p>Conscious of its mission and of the purpose for which it was organized, namely, to support Greek schools and enhance their efforts for the preservation of the Greek language and religion it has arranged for a grand ball at the Aragon next Monday night.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of this entertainment will be for the benefit of the Socrates Greek School of the West Side, which on account of community difficulties cannot meet its obligations.</p>
   <p>The efforts of Gapa in Chicago for the support of this school, particularly of Navarinon chapter and of Estia, the women's chapter, are worthy of all praise,and the Greek community of Chicago, we have no doubt, will endorse them wholeheartedly.</p>

   <p>But Gapa is also undertaking another enterprise which will render great service to the Greek people of America and especially to the new generation. We mean the founding of Gapa chapters for young men similar to those founded for young women.</p>
   <p>In these chapters for boys Greek children will be inspired by the national and religious spirit. And so from childhood on they will possess a national conscience and by becoming good Greeks will become good American citizens as well.</p>
   <p>The inauguration of these young people's chapters by Gapa is indeed an endeavor which merits the support and approval of the whole Greek population of America. Parents who desire to contribute toward the training of their children, training which will impart to them Greek ideals and at the same time make them good American citizens, should enroll their sons in these chapters. By so doing, they will assist the organizations enterprise, which is also a national enterprise.</p>
   <p>We consider it our duty to promote the efforts of Gapa and to congratulate its officials on this action of theirs.</p>
