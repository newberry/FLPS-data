   <p>A committee has been organized to inaugurate a drive for the purpose of raising money to build a high-school building in Greece. It is in Messinia and all Messinians and people from the surrounding towns and villages, should support this movement, which shall be one of enlightenment and benefit to their home town.</p>
   <p>Last year two hundred and eighty students were enrolled; they had come from all the section around Messinia. Because the high school has no building of its own, it uses the same building as the elementary school for one-half of the day.</p>
   <p>....The school board of this neglected Gymnasium made a plea to the Greeks in America that they take pity upon the students and help them build a suitable building. The name of the school is "Meligala"; and all money sent for this purpose should be addressed to the Chicago Committee for the Meligala Fund.</p>
