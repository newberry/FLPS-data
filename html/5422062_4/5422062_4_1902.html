   <p>To the associations of the Union:</p>
   <p>p. 7- We hereby notify those who are interested that during the week which had been appointed for our convention the Shriners' convention will meet in Washington, D. C., and the presence of thousands of guests in Washington will make it difficult to obtain hotel accommodations. We have therefore postponed our convention, which was to meet on June 6, and the date will be announced later.</p>
   <p>From the office of the executive committee.</p>
