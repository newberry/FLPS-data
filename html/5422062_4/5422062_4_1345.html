   <p>The Management of the Saloniki Press.</p>
   <p>Dear Mr. N. Salopoulos: You are kindly requested to publish the enclosed announcement in your distinguished newspaper, Saloniki, the genuine organ of Venizelism and democracy.</p>
   <p>Angelo Gallios</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Greek Republican Liberal League.</p>
   <p>Invitation</p>
   <p>All Greek Republican liberals of Chicago and its environs, whether or not members of the aforementioned League, are invited to attend its meeting at 2 P.M. Sunday, January 16, at Bowen Hall in Hull House. During this meeting, many speakers will discuss the pitiful and wicked situation created after the <span class="page-break">2</span>recent general elections in Greece.</p>
   <p>It is about time that those who are living in this great liberal republic should heed the divine principles of democracy and impart them to their relatives and friends in Greece. We should transmit these principles to them by suitable means and assist them morally, in order that they may throw off the overhanging, perilous nightmare of monarchy, which has heaped so many calamities on our unfortunate nation. May they thus accept the divine government of democracy, which sprang and flourished in Greece and which has benefited humanity.</p>
