   <p>I was recently requested by the executive committee of the Greek Young Women's Philharmonic Society to audit the receipts of their various social affairs from the time of the establishment of the society. I complied with this request with great pleasure because I wished to help these wonderful Greek girls. They have denied themselves leisure and comfort, and must travel from one end of our city to the other to dispose of tickets to assist indigent Greeks whose very lives depended on the mercy of God as extended to them through the benevolence of our prosperous countrymen.</p>
   <p>Going over their well-kept records, I found that the Society was established and began its benevolent operations in December, 1919. The president at that time was Miss Despena Perdiki, and the treasurer was Miss Constantina Tsamales, who is now Mrs. Nicholson.</p>

   <p>In this period two dances were given, which brought in $4,363.39, and membership subscriptions were $91.50, a total of $4,454.89. Expenses were $867.31, leaving a balance of $3,587.58, which was dispensed among the poor and the sick and to Greek schools.</p>
   <p>In 1921, when the president was Miss Nina Perdiki and the treasurer was Miss Victoria Spanogiannopoulos, two dances were given. The proceeds of these dances plus $78.75 in subscriptions, amounted to $3,974.03. Expenses were $1,288.90, leaving a balance of $2,686.13. All this money except a very small residue was distributed among the poor and the sick and for other benevolent purposes.</p>
   <p>In the third year, when Miss Martha Matsoukas was president, and Miss Metaxia Bola was treasurer, the proceeds of their two dances, their Christmas tree, and membership subscriptions were $4,388.18, of which $1,451.58 was spent</p>

   <p>for the rental of halls and for other expenses; of $2,936.60 remaining, $1,000 was contributed to the fund for the Greek refugees of Asia Minor, and the balance was distributed among the poor and the sick; $230.93 remained in the bank, which was transferred to the new treasurer, Miss Despena Giannakopoulos, who with the new president, Miss Dionysia Bratte, has worked earnestly and industriously for the relief of needy Greeks.</p>
   <p>I heartily approve of the activities of these Greek girls, and I congratulate them on their good work. I wish to urge my beloved countrymen to support them and encourage them in this Christian and social enterprise, for with gentleness and native Greek modesty they are offering their services to their unfortunate compatriots.</p>
