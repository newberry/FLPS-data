   <p>p. 4.- Last week, Christ Sarlas, Misses H. Mitchell, and S. Mouzakiotis, Plaza Cleaners (who donated trucks and drivers) and many Greeks connected with the South Water Market delivered more than 60 bushels of various kinds of food to needy Greek families on Thanksgiving Day. This deed was suggested and put into operation by the United Greek Charities of Chicago. The cause is a most worthy one and the organization promises to give much help to deserving Greek families this winter.</p>
