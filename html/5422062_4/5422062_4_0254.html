   <p>The Baltetsian Club of Chicago, is planning a picnic this year that will surpass all others. The Board of Directors, whose president is N. Palivos, assures us that it will be a true Pan-hellenic affair in every way.</p>
   <p>The program will follow the pattern set by our countrymen in Greece by celebrating the event of '21.</p>
   <p>Baltetsi in Greece held a great panegyric on May 13, the day of the famous battle. They are planning another such event on September 23, the day of the conquest of Tripolitsa. Prime minister Eleutherios Venizelos will be present.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Baltetsians are giving this picnic in order to raise funds to send to their native country. Their need is imperative, so every one should support this affair by going to it. It will take place on August 3.</p>
