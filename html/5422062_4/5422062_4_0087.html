   <p>With delight we hear that Koliniates, established in Chicago, have come together and founded a society to be known as "Holy Virgin Mary."</p>
   <p>Officers of the society are: Mr. K. N. Shiones, president; Mr. Elias K. Koulouris, vice president; Mr. S. Stanthas, secretary; Mr. George Remendjoulas, treasurer, and Mr. H. Layandreas, collector.</p>
   <p>The goal of the newly organized fraternity is mutual assistance and its scope of operation is not only local but national as well.</p>
   <p>As usual The Star wishes the Koliniates society, success and harmony.</p>
