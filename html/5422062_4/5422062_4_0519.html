   <p>Many Greeks of Chicago left to participate in the war against Turkey and many more will leave as soon as transportation accomodations are secured. The boys left their families here and hastened to the call of their Mother Country, Greece.</p>
   <p>In virtue of the need that may confront the families our departing volunteers and reserves, the Philanthropic Society of the Chicago Greek Ladies which for the last four years has functioned very admirably, will hold a lottery. Tickets will be fifty cents each. Beautiful prizes will be given to the lucky ones, and every penny of the whole affair will be utilized for anticipated needs of those families.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Every Greek in Chicago must buy one or more tickets, in order to make the fund for the families of our fighters worthwhile.</p>
   <p>Authorized committees of the Ladies Society will visit every house and store in the city to sell the lottery tickets. Ladies in charge of the affair are:</p>
   <p>Mrs. P. Athanasopoulos, Mrs. A. Vlachos, Mrs. G. Vlachochristou, Mrs. B. Glezos, Mrs. M. Davrandjes, Mrs. D. Constantinou, Mrs. D. Manousopoulos, Mrs. G. Papeliou, Mrs. J. Papagiannopoulos, Mrs. G. Remendjula, Mrs. G. Stamatiadou, Mrs. D. Floros.</p>
