   <p>p. 5.- Thousands and thousands of Greek Orthodox Christians, men, women, and children went to our churches during Holy Week. This year's church-going movement was much greater than any other year. On Good Friday all churches were packed. Many worshippers couldn't get in the doors. Great throngs followed the Epitafia of St. Triados and Koimisis churches.</p>
   <p>On Saturday evening a rush was on at the Halsted Street stores for Mageritsa (a type of Greek soup), lambs and Kouloures (doughnut shaped bread). The Greek ideals and customs were upheld more than ever this Easter. The rain did not dampen a single persons spirits.</p>
