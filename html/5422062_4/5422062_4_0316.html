   <p>The much heralded dance of the Greek ladies society St. Basil will take place on April 29, at the Hotel Sherman.</p>
   <p>Profits of the dance will be added to the fund of the society to continue its work. The society is known as Philanthropic Greek Ladies Society of the church St. Basil and its specific work is to aid poor and needy widows and orphans and those who are in hospitals afflicted with incurable diseases.</p>
   <p>Members of this society go everywhere to perform their noble duty in spite of rain or snow and many, many times neglect their household obligations in order to be prompt and precise in executing their philanthropic duty.</p>
   <p>Do not miss the dance; if you cannot attend, buy a ticket or two anyway.</p>
