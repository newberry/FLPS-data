   <p>p. 4.- Aside from the philanthropic actions of various Greeks, the United Greek charities of Chicago, headed by Arthur Peponis and A. George N. Spannon, cooperating with the many Greek women's clubs, donated 220 baskets to needy countrymen last Wednesday.</p>
   <p>It would have been a great shame if any of our countrymen had gone hungry on Christmas, the most holy day of the year. It is difficult to make the Greeks realize the plight, the unfortunate predicament these people are in. Over $1,000 has been spent in the last two weeks, but much more is needed. One way of helping is to attend the benefit dance to be given by the Ahepa next Monday. Miss Europe will be present.</p>
