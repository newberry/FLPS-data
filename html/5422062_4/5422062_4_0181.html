   <p>p. 3.- The priestly head of the church of Saint James, venerable Dionysios Sakellariou, is one of those who believe that the poverty stricken always have need of food, in other words that they must be helped.</p>
   <p>With this idea in mind he went around to the different centers of the city, and gathered all kinds of provisions which he kept in one of the chambers of the church. Then by a systematic method of his own, he notified all the different needy families that they should go to the church and receive the surplus food.</p>
   <p>All of those notified, at the date set for them, got enough food to suffice for several days to come.</p>
   <p>This splendid and meritorious work of the venerable Sakellariou must be adopted by all the priestly heads, who by cooperating with Greek newspapers and well-known organizations, will succeed in feeding the needy.</p>
