   <p>The well known Chicago attorney, Mr. Paul Demos, secretary-general of the recently founded Greek Relief Committee informed us as follows:</p>
   <p>Saloniki,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>The Greek Relief Committee in its last meeting held elections and the following prominent men of our community were chosen as officers:</p>
   <p>George Prassas, president; John Raklios, vice-president; Paul Demos, secretary general, and Nick Nomikos, treasurer. Counsellors: The Right Rev. Philaretos, bishop of Chicago; Rev. C. Hadzidemitriou, Rev. Mark Petrakis, Andrew Karzas, Tom Chiamalis, Thomas Valos, John Gallanis, D. Stamos, John Papas and K. Alex.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The members of the Committee publicly express their appreciation for the cooperation and great services extended to them by the various Greek societies and organizations, the churches councils etc. which, as one body, worked for soliciting of contributions for the suffering refugees in Greece.</p>
   <p>Mr. Andrew Karzas, the retiring president of the Committee, whose efforts contributed much to the Greek Relief Committee's collection of contributions, reports that the last remittance to Greece was $23,500.</p>
   <p>Upon the fatherly suggestions of Bishop Philaretos, churches within his periphery sent in their contributions to the cause as additional to those collected from the Greek people of his community.</p>
