   <p>The Greek confectioners of Chicago, doubtless because they deal in sweets, know how to attract people, and this is revealed by the crowd which attended their dance last Sunday, given for the benefit of the national defense fund of Greece.</p>
   <p>The dance attracted not only Greeks but also hundreds of Americans with their families. Wholesalers and other merchants who do business with the Greek candymen came to the ball with relatives and friends to enjoy an evening with the Greeks.</p>
   <p>Black-eyed beauties distributed costly flowers to all comers, and especial attention was given to the American ladies, who were charmed by Greek hospitality. The proceeds of the dance were six thousand dollars or more.</p>
