   <p>The Greek Womens' Club of Chicago has been reorganized upon a better basis and with more serious aims. Their chief interest will be the improvement of the community through education and material benefits. They hope to be able to found an orphanage in Chicago, and to do much philanthropic work. That is why the name has been changed to Philanthropic Womens' Club.</p>
   <p>Their enthusiasm is so great that plans for a fund-raising dance are already completed. It will be given on Sunday, February 15, in the Ballroom (19th floor) of the La Salle Hotel. This dance should be supported wholeheartedly by the community because the efforts of these women are directed to such a worthy purpose. It is our patriotic duty to make this affair a tremendous success.</p>
