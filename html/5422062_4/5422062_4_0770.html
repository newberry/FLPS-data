   <p>The Greeks of Chicago, stimulated by the suggestion of Mr. Salopoulos, editor of Saloniki, have begun to invest their money in Real Estate more than ever. The Greeks, having implicit faith in Mr. Salopoulos whose integrity is beyond reproach, bought heavily from one of the leading sub-dividers and developers, named Thomas K. Valos Realty Co. Mr. Thomas Valos, "and Company," are the sole owners of the Olympia Highlands, where they intend to build a new city. Other Greek Realtors, such as Geo. K. Gatsis Realty Co., Geo. P. Ciagouris and Co., Melidonis and Co., and Peter J. Eliopoulos, have sold thousands of lots to the Greeks of Chicago. Many other Realtors are doing good business wth the Greeks.</p>
