   <p>Yesterday afternoon the church of Saint Constantine gave a tea at which many women and misses were present. The benefits of the ten will go towards helping with gifts and food, the poor Greek families of the community. We congratulate, especially the Presvitera for her participation in such philanthropic deeds.</p>
