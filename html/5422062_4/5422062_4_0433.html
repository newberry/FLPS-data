   <p>My Dear Editor of the Saloniki:</p>
   <p>For sometime now, you have had the kindness to aid us in our drive to raise money for the orphans and widows in Constantinople.</p>
   <p>We do not doubt, that you will get satisfaction from publishing the results of this worth-while drive.</p>
   <p>I heartily thank you for your aid and remain,</p>
   <p>With respect,</p>
   <p>Reverend C. Hatzidimitriou</p>
   <p>The dramatic group, The Star, raised $150. The dramatic group Sophocles, <span class="page-break">2</span>raised $959.65. Church collections, certain individual, and a few miscellaneous receipts reached a total of $1,486.36.</p>
   <p>The expenses for rental of halls, music, costumes, and printing of programs amounted to $402.75, leaving a net balance of $1,083.61.</p>
   <p>This money has been sent to the Greek Red Cross in Asia Minor, to be used for the relief of our orphans in Constantinople.</p>
   <p>The committee wishes to thank all those who helped make this drive a success. The newspapers and dramatic groups deserve special acknowledgement.</p>
   <p>This report is submitted on behalf of the committee by Reverend C. Hatzidimitriou.</p>
