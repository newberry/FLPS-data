   <p>p. 1-After seven months' absence in Europe Mr. Morgenthau came back last Monday and was welcomed with great honor and enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>When the steamer Lapland docked in New York many friends were at the pier to greet and welcome him, as well as representatives of the near East Relief, of the city of New York, and of the Greek Embassy, and more than five hundred Greeks besides.</p>
   <p>Mr. Morgenthau had this to say about the problem of the Greek refugees: "We had exhausted all our money; so I was obliged to go to London to secure additional funds through a loan of one million pounds made by the Bank of England.</p>
   <p>"In Geneva also arrangements were made to have a general meeting in September to negotiate a loan of eight or ten million pounds to meet the needs of the refugees in Greece.</p>
   
   <p>"We had to exhaust the international credit of Greece, and since at the establishment of the Republic Greek bonds went up from 47 to 56, so if the Greeks of America learn what a splendid investment these bonds are and invest some of their money in them, they might go up to 70, for they were up to 74 in 1919.</p>
   <p>"I am sure that if the Greeks of America understood conditions there, they would send their money. In 1919 and 1920 over twenty-two million English pounds were sent to Greece from America, but remittances in the last year fell to three and a half million.</p>
   <p>"I am as confident of Greece's ability to recover as I was of Austria's about two years ago when I stated that Austria with a little help could get on her feet. Greece is in much better condition than Austria was then.</p>
   <p>"About half a million refugees have already been absorbed, and these refugees are the main factor of the situation in Greece now.</p>
   
   <p>"The future of Greece depends upon what these refugees become,a burden or an asset needing little assistance. Greece now imports thirty per cent of the wheat which she consumes. The refugees will cultivate the land and produce this wheat; they will also raise tobacco and other products and will thus increase the national wealth of Greece. Instead of being parasites they will become producers, I have no doubt."</p>
   <p>Morgenthau said that the refugees settle on the land according to the plan for the placement of groups. For the most part these lands are those evacuated by the Turks who are leaving the country. But the Greeks left four times as much land in the place from which they were expelled. Since the expulsion of the Greeks from Asia Minor transferred the rug industry from Turkey to Greece, it will take some time to build up factories, and meanwhile we help the industry to increase production by selling land to it without profit.</p>
   
   <p>Manufacturers of rugs now receive so many orders from America that they have had to double their productive capacity.</p>
   <p>"It struck me," said Morgenthau, "that Moses took forty years to settle six hundred thousand Jewish slaves in other lands, while in Greece they are trying to settle more than a million people in three years. We hope to do this with the help of about thirty volunteers from America to do the work.</p>
   <p>"A five dollar shoe-shiner's kit would help a Greek boy of twelve to fourteen years of age to support his family. For ten dollars a stand might be equipped to sell candies for the support of a family. "The Greeks," said he, " have purposely inflated their currency by about one tenth of its value in order to compete with their neighbors."</p>
