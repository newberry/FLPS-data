   <p>p. 1 -- For the benefit of the Serbian Red Cross a concert will take place at the Auditorium Hotel, August 29, 3 P. M. Judging from your friendliness to us, there is no doubt in our minds that a great majority of your people will honor our concert with your presence. Tickets are sold for fifty cents each at the entrance of the hall or at the Greek consulate of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Serbian Red Cross Society.</p>
   <p>Notice:</p>
   <p>It is needless to say too much about our obligation to our Serbian friends who fought side by side with the Greek armies against the Bulgarians. The concert must be a great success, and it is our imperative duty to make it so. Every Greek merchant must buy a handful of tickets, whether he goes to the concert or not. The Serbians are our friends; let us reveal our sentiments.</p>
