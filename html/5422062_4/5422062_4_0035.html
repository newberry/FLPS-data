   <p>p. 3.. On last Sunday, October 19th, St. George's Society, an association of Kastrites, and one of the oldest and strongest Greek organizations in Chicago, gave its annual dance in the aristocratic Tyrian Hall, where thousands of our countrymen had a merry time. Admission was free to all, and all expenses were paid by the Society.</p>
   <p>There were Greek folk-dances as well as American dances; so everybody was happy. All were enthusiastically appreciative of the courtesies extended by the committee and by the administrative council. We congratulate the Kastrites.</p>
