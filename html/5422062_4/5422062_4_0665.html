   <p>The Greek community of Chicago has been the victim of several bold, systematic robberies. Whether these crimes have been committed by one thief or by a gang is not yet known. In a single night the following three establishments were broken into and looted: the pharmacy belonging to Mr. C. Salopoulos, located at the corner of Polk Street and Blue Island Avenue, where the window was broken and valuable drugs were stolen; the Hermes Shoe Polish Company at 620 Blue Island Avenue, which was robbed of materials amounting to one hundred dollars; and the theater owned by Mr. Voumvaki and Mr. Sias, where--strange as it may seem--the robbers took a projection machine.</p>
   <p>The Greeks are taking precautions against these marauders. The next time a thief attempts to rob a Greek store he will not escape alive.</p>
