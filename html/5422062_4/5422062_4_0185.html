   <p>Most of the readers of the Greek Press have received, sometime ago, an envelope containing two hundred Christmas Seals. And everyone of the recipients of these Seals has placed the return envelope within sight, so that at the first opportunity it may be sent back to the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute, with a two dollar check.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of this 25th annual Seal, as it is well-known to everyone, are used to help fight tuberculosis throughout the entire Union.</p>
   <p>Of all the ingenuities conceived by man to fight the rampages of disease, this annual sale of Christmas Seals is the most commendable and effective.</p>
   <p>The money which has been collected from the sale of the Seals, during the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>past twenty five years, has relieved the sufferings of thousands upon thousands of unfortunate sufferers from this scourge of humanity.</p>
   <p>The results of this campaign are evident. Tuberculosis cases have been reduced by thirty per cent, in the last ten years. That is the best proof of the soundness of the Christmas Seals idea.</p>
   <p>Graeco-Americanus is not in the habit of suggesting anything to his readers. But here is a case that touches him very deeply and he ventures to remind all that may happen to read these lines, to send in their mite for this worthy cause.</p>
