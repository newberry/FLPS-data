   <p>p. 4--Last Sunday night at 11 p. m. a bloody engagement between two police officers and a group of Greeks took place. One Greek was killed, three others will die, and the two officers were dangerously wounded.</p>
   <p>The cause of this bloodshed, according to the statements of some women of ill repute who were participants in the struggle before the arrival of the two officers, was the barbarity of the Greeks, who were dead drunk and attempted to ravish them on the street. When the officers heard the women's cries, they ran in the direction of Hull House and found two Greeks scuffling with the women. The officers fired a volley of shots, and one of the Greeks fell dead. This infuriated the other Greeks, who drew guns and knives and fell upon the officers of the law. When police reen-forcements arrived, all the combatants were on the ground bleeding profusely. They were taken to the County Hospital.</p>

   <p>This is really an outrage. In spite of mitigating circumstances unearthed by our reporter which tend to justify the action of the Greeks involved in the bloody affray, the Star condemns the unbecoming conduct of the Greeks, who not only involved themselves with women of prostitution--which very clearly shows that they are birds of the same feather--but dared to disgrace themselves and the Greek community by resisting the law of the land. This is anarchy. The law of the land, whether right or wrong, must be obeyed and respected. No one who shoots it out with the law is to be pitied. Friends and relatives of those who defy the law must not feel sorry for the culprits.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of this bloody drama are K. Kalambakas, who died in the ambulance and N. Argytakis and G. Livas who were mortally wounded. Four other Greeks are under arrest as accomplices. Officer Considine is in critical condition in the hospital. The other officer, although suffering with many wounds, will recover.</p>

   <p>The Greek community of Chicago would do well to raise money to take care of the families of the two officers. It is our duty to do so, and it should be done on a lavish scale.</p>
   <p>Although we feel bitterly against the perpetrators of this act of bloodshed, nevertheless the Star wants to be fair to its fellow-Greeks and prints the facts which our reporter unearthed in an exhaustive investigation, and which reveal some mitigating circumstances.</p>
   <p>The Greek actors in this drama after visiting these women of ill fame were not themselves, and their condition was not due to one or two glasses of liquor which they drank but to some kind of drug with which they were dosed. When they came to their senses, all their money was gone. They accused the women of robbing them and demanded their money. The women refused, and the scuffle began. The women ran out of the house screaming for help with the Greeks at their heels cursing and attempting to dig down the women's stockings to recover their money.</p>

   <p>At this point the officers came on the scene and not knowing the cause of the fracas drew out their guns and began to shoot.</p>
   <p>The investigation further reveals that others have been victimized by women of this sort, and that a regular business of robbery has been carried on. This method of emptying the pockets of fools has succeeded many times without serious trouble. It eventually resulted in the loss of one life and possibly of more.</p>
   <p>Let this be a warning to others who may be birds of the same feather, either victimizers or potential victims.</p>
