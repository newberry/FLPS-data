   <p>The dance sponsored by the Greek war veterans of the "George Dillboy Chapter," which took place in the West End Women's Club last Sunday night, was a tremendous success. This was no small achievement, since there were three other large affairs and two dramatic performances were also being held the same evening.</p>
   <p>Besides the ballroom dancing, the guests were entertained by an artistic program. Everyone was eager to help in every way the brave war veterans in the hospitals.</p>
