   <p>The Creator of the Universe according to the Bible worked and created the Cosmos in six days, and designated the seventh day as a day of rest and repose. Therefore, we see that one day was sufficient for rest, according to the Creator, but why have we so many holidays devoted to so many little and great Saints? Did the Saints order all these holidays for us to stay idle and commemorate their Graces? I do not believe that this latter order of holidays was a blessing of God. But on the other hand, if we assume that it was the will of Saints for commemoration, it would have been appropriate and proper for all concerned (the Saints and us both) to spend such days in churches, instead of the taverns, coffee houses, theatres, brothels, etc. The Saints, I'm certain, would have preferred that the glorification of their names, whould take place in other places than those I mentioned.</p>
   <p>The example of the parents goes to the children, and sooner or later the children will believe that in order to honor the Saints and martyrs of religion we must stay idle, and they might infer that to work on those days is a sin. Let us not stay idle on those days, work is a necessity, a blessing, and the only means to success.</p>
