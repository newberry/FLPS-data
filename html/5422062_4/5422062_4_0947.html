   <p>History tells us that the abnormal conditions of society, poverty, misery, and practically the disintegration of Nationalism, are the results of war. Right after the World War such phenomena manifested themselves in the Greek Race, which, to a certain extent, was immune from such National cataclysms. The Greek, the world over, was distinguished for his devotion to Greek National Affairs, religion, language, family ties, obedience to the prevalent laws of the Country he lives in. The Greek, the world over, was distinguished for his munificence and generosity; for his naturally charitable inclined attitude; for his pride, and above all, for his self denial and self-sacrifice for the mother country whose name he worshiped next to that of his Divine Creator. But, today, the Greek of this Nation as well as the Greek of other countries cannot parade with pride before the Family of Nations, nor can he display as medals the above mentioned virtues, qualities and characteristics.</p>
   <p>Greek Nationalism which was standing out as a Labarum, and as an example for others to follow, today is on the decline, not only amongst the Greeks of the World, but also amongst Greeks in the Native Country, the country, in which <span class="page-break">\2</span>our progenitors were the founders and forerunners of present civilization. An attempt was made in Greece by a narrow-minded group to alter our national tongue under the guise of the saying, "facility for the laity." Such an attempt is absolutely dangerous and destructive. It will efface the universal character of the language; minimize the grandeur of it and diminish the esteem of that Greek students have for it. Let us hope that the misguided, misinformed, and narrow-minded groups which has an inclination to Gallicism, will depart from such a destructive attempt. We are not in need of a foreign language to supplant the Greek language.</p>
   <p>With a shagrin I witnessed that some of the sons of Greece, imported Gallicism, and I also noticed that their living and acting was influenced by French ways of life. Such manners, morals, habits, airs and customs are prevalent today in Greek life everywhere.</p>
   <p>Has the Greek lost his individuality? Has he lost his Nationalism? Is he going to contribute to the destruction of Nationalism and Religion? Are we to tend towards Internationalism? Are we to fulfill Plato's prophecy in the Republic. Oh! by Jupiter, is Greece going to be absorbed and assimilated in the International Caldron?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Religion, language and national egotism, is what distinguishes one race of people from another. Oh God Almighty! the Father of the Son of Salvation and Clustendom, whose teachings of your divine will were blazoned all over the world through the Greek Tongue, the tongue that tamed the Barbarians, the tongue that spread your Divine revelations, are we to be absorbed in the forthcoming cataclysm of national existance? No! No! Greece and the sons of Greece, your history is written in golden letters, as in every national catastrophy we will come out scot free.</p>
   <p>Our religion, language and national egotism has remained pure, sacred and integral, regardless of calamities. Oh! Sons of Greece, do not permit your-selves to become remnants of a shipwreck, and be picked up and devoured by the omnivorous waves of internationalism. Advocate and maintain your religion, language, national egotism and all your above mentioned attributes, in every part of the world at the same time respecting the laws of the Country in which you are now living.</p>
