   <p>Macaulay once said, "The hearts of men are their books; events are their tutors; great actions are their eloquence." We want every single Greek to read this and think about it. Could this philosophy apply to us or to our societies?</p>
   <p>We all know the answer. Take, for example, the recent attempt to establish a Panhellenic Union in Chicago. There is plenty of eloquence but where came find action? Amongst themselves the leaders are making a very bad mess of things. This is not as it should be.</p>
   <p>Let us try to remember Macaulauy's saying and profit by its meaning.</p>
