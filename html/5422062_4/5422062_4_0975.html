   <p>That wise and great patriot, Abraham Lincoln, while he was wearing the purple of virtue and loyalty, the spear of justice and human equality, and the shield of character and truth, said, "One can fool all the people some of the time; some of the people, all of the time; but not all the people, all the time." This was the man that changed the complexion of the United States.</p>
   <p>Thus was born the United States, this colossus of the world, after the Civil War and the firm establishment of the Union. We are proud to be living in these United States today, to be called citizens, and to enjoy all the natural and technical advantages.</p>
   <p>The Greek and Roman lawgivers declared, "The cities should not be adorned with sacrificial offerings, but with the virtue and education of those who inhabit <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>them." They further said, "Law has no eyes, but sees; is deprived of ears, but hears; it lacks hands but grasps; it is without legs, but runs faster than lightning; is is without a body and brain, but it executes and ponders everything."</p>
   <p>If this [axiom] had been kept faithfully and believed by those political criminals who have been found to be traitors and condemned to death for a series of perpetrated and proven crimes, then they would not be paying the death penalty. [Translator's note. On November 28, 1922, five [state] ministers and one general were executed in Greece following their criminal and inefficient administration of the government and poor leadership of the Greek armies in Asia Minor, which fought against the Turks for three years. The policies of those that were executed led to the expatriation of 1,500,000 Greeks of Asia Minor, to the horrible massacre of many thousands of Greeks, and the complete defeat of the Greek armies.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago and the United States were greatly concerned with this <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>great catastrophe. Their material response was immediate.]</p>
   <p>The Greek Government and Nation, which executed these men, did not wish this act to be written in the pages of its history. If felt, however, that justice demanded the execution of the political criminals for the sake of the nation's common and higher interests.</p>
   <p>It is absolutely necessary, then, that every citizen should be conscious of his own personal rights and political duties. He must do whatever is in the country's interest. He should be sincere and truthful, and, above all, should have the common welfare in mind, sparing no one. He must comprehend the inviolable and infallible principle by which the common interest supersedes any personal interest. He must know that the interest of one is included in the common interest, and that by serving the common interest, the personal interest is automatically served.</p>
   <p>Every citizen, then, should obey the gospel-like saying, "The country is more <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>precious, holier and more sacred than one's father, mother, and all one's ancestors; it is even loftier than the gods and men." He must know that the country in which he lives and prospers is the most precious object in the world. While it is happy and prospersus, he too will be happy, and will lead the life of an honest and virtuous man. Thus do we American citizens feel toward this great and glorious country--America.</p>
   <p>By striving to obey and conform to the Constitution, laws, and interests of this country, we will never be exposed to danger. Justice will never disappoint us. This country, its flag and all its greatness will not only continuously command the respect of other countries, as is now the case, but, if necessary, it will impose itself and become the model of freedom, generosity, patriotism, charity and civilization to other nations. So, when the people of our homeland, which we will ever cherish follow faithfully and consistently the [principles of the] life of their brothers in their adopted country, then, without doubt they will surely become great and prosperous, in accordance with our wishes.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>We have disregarded in every thought our personal interests, being always occupied with and interested in the national interests of both our adopted country and our homeland. We agree with the advice of wise President Harding, who told Americanized aliens, "No one of course can prevent you from loving your homeland, but you must love and respect this land which is honoring you with the citizen's title, and protecting you and offering you prosperity. This is your duty and [to your] interest, if you desire to be accepted citizens, to live peacefully and happily. We, too, shall observe this advice constantly, [and] at all cost.</p>
   <p>To us, our country is the most sacred object. Everyone should appreciate [our attitude], and follow us in this. We should not only be honest, sincere, and loyal citizens, but [we should] show this by our actions. Our forefathers said, "It is not enough to be good, but [it] must be affirmed and proved by deeds." When we do thus, then the laws will guard us, God will favor us, and the citizens will respect us.</p>
