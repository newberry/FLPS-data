   <p>The Valtetsiotaes Society, composed of natives of the historic Valtetsi held last Sunday their national celebration, at the country estate of Mr. Andrews.</p>
   <p>Not only Valtetsiotaes, but also many other Greeks took part in the celebration of the historic battle of Valtetsi. The battle of Valtetsi remains immortal to the Greeks the world over. Gretsis band played various marches and songs, stirring the patriotic sentiments of the crowd, while the smell of barbecue lamb (in the making) affected the olfactory organs. The dancing nymphs attired in graphic national costumes, aroused in all a spirit of hilarious joy and abandon. Indeed the Greeks know how to celebrate. They forget their business and worries, and in their celebrations stimulate the mind and body with appropriate nourishments. Music, speeches, dances, merriment, good eats, Bacchical respects, and pleasing things for the eye, beauty, constitute a Greek celebration. They know and practice, "variation is the soul of nature."</p>
