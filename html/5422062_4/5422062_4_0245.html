   <p>Last Sunday afternoon, representatives of all the Greek organizations, clubs, and institutions were gathered at lawyer George Spannon's office to make plans for helping the poor Greek people of our city.</p>
   <p>Mr. Spannon acted as chairman and A. Peponis as secretary. The chairman explained the needy condition in which he found many Greek families and asked the co-operation of these present in helping these destitute people.</p>
   <p>For once, Hellenism in Chicago has united together to meet a very present need. They immediately began to lay plans to raise funds. Another meeting has been called on Oct. 5 at Mr. Spannon's office, 1 North La Salle Street for the same purpose.</p>
   <p>We are asking all Greeks to unite and help one another in this crisis. Remember the words of Jesus Christ. "The poor are always with us."</p>
