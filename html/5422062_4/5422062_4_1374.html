   <p>It isn't the first time or the last time that we have written about Chicago's need of a "National Greek Club," which will be patriotic toward our native land and our adopted land.</p>
   <p>Although the Greek Community of Chicago has many clubs and organizations, not one is of national character. If one visited the Greeks of Chicago he would find that they represent the least progressive of the various races in our city. Look at the Greek people! They are illiterate, poorly dressed, insignificant; they are losing many opportunities because they let them go by without knowing about them. That is way we need a national club. A national club will show us how to become citizens, it will show us how to unite in business, it will show us how to recognize the good and bad of life, and it will show us how to obtain the good. Help us form a national club!</p>
