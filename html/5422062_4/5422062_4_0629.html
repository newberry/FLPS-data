   <p>Dear Mr. Editor of Saloniki.</p>
   <p>Three weeks ago a man from Chicago named Rangos came to Waukegan, soliciting subscriptions for a weekly Greek newspaper Acropolis.</p>
   <p>Many fellow-Greeks enriched his pocket-book with subscriptions. Up to this date we have received no further information or the newspaper. Kindly investigate the matter, and if your investigation proves that this man Rangos is a rogue, for the benefit of other Greeks, please publicize the incident.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Em. Anl Papoutsakis.</p>

   <p>NOTE OF SALONIKI.</p>
   <p>Saloniki deems it unnecessary to comment upon the above printed letter. The letter itself explains the purpose of its publications, and it is up to brother-Greeks to be on their guard.</p>
