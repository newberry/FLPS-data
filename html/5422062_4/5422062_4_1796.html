   <p>The twenty-first District of our Order reconvened in hospitable Chicago Heights for its second annual District Convention. With the hundreds of incoming delegates, alternates, families and friends the Convention opened under the most favorable of auspices.</p>
   <p>Sunday was full of activity. In the morning church services were held at the Holy Trinity Church with many of the church dignitaries taking part in the services. The church was packed to capacity, and hundreds were compelled to remain out-of-doors. During the afternoon two base-ball games were played by the members of the Sons of Pericles. The Lord Byron Chapter which is ably coached by Brother John Brown won the coveted cup which was donated by our esteemed Brother Arthur H. Peponis. Ypsilanti Chapter of the Sons of Pericles won the other game from the Pindaros Chapter but the winner of this game lost to Lord Byron.</p>
