   <p>A new church has been added to those of the Greek Orthodox religion in Chicago. It was bought for $21,000. Five thousand ($5,100) and one hundred dollars has been paid in cash and the rest will be paid in installments till 1917. The key to the church is in charge of 12 able bodied men - the officers of the church. The only trouble will be to find a priest. Rev. Pigeas declines to accept the honor because he has high hopes of soon becoming a bishop in America.</p>

   <p>Since last week, peddlers have had to stop selling their wares, subject to arrest by the police. The Irishmen seem to mean business. No longer will we hear the melodious Greek voices advertising potatoes, apples, celery, and so forth. Whoever tries it will be led by the ear into a cell where he can yodel to his heart's content. The peddlers insist that they will buy trucks and continue their chosen profession. It remains to be seen what will be the outcome of this situation.</p>

   <p>The unique career of a certain Greek came hastily to an end the other day. This Greek had a mania for stealing clothes. He was a very particular Greek and would only steal clothes belonging to his countrymen. The quality of the clothes he stole did not impress him. He preferred to take those that were hard to get.</p>
   <p>He was a very proud Greek, and refused to wear the clothing of others, so he decided to sell these second-hand garments and buy himself new ones. He never quibbled about prices. He would obligingly sell a $50 suit for $1.50 to the first Jew that came along. Easy come - easy go!</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>During a period of two years, he took over eighty suits. If he found plenty of suits in one place he would take them all. If he found a few in another place, he would take them, too. This is an example of how he worked.</p>
   <p>He rang a bell oneday and said to the lady, "Your husband sent me for his best suit of clothes. He is going to Milwaukee tonight and he wants to have them pressed."</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The lady gave him the clothes which he promptly sold for forty-two cents to a Jew he met farther down the street. Imagine her feelings when her husband came home and denied all knowledge of the "gentleman."</p>
   <p>The next day our unknown friend tried the same trick on Mrs. Georga Kopoulos. She, being a gracious lady, invited him in for a cup of Turkish coffee, meanwhile phoning for the police. The Greek, whose name we cannot tell because he has fourteen of them and we don't know which is right, is cooling off in a cell at the County Jail. What perplexed him most was, "How did that woman find out?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The answer is simple, Mr. Georga Kopoulos was wearing his best suit of clothes at the time and he couldn't possibly have asked for them because he was out of town.</p>
   <p>The Greek is trying to think up ways of stealing out of jail, but we are afraid it won't work.</p>
