   <p>p. 1- Many natives in Greece, as well as the newly arrived in Chicago, wonder why Greeks in American change their names, so that he who was called <span class="gap">[gap]</span> is now called <span class="gap">[gap]</span>and Papatriantaphilakopoulos is now called Pappas, and so forth.</p>
   <p>The Star is asked about the propriety of this custom in a change of names. We leave this to the special liking of the individual.</p>
   <p>There are many names, with two or three syllables, that can be pronounced as easily in English as in Greek. For example, Vlachos, Markos, Lambros, etc. But there are names with many syllables and consisting of, say, twenty letters, as Papatheodoranopoulos, etc. Very often the children in schools find themselves in difficulties, and their school fellows pronounce their names as abbreviated, so that, sooner or later, they take new names with two syllables and easy to pronounce.</p>
   <p>It is difficult for him, whose name is a long one, to have his friends and acquaintances remember him by name. In such an instance, we do not blame <span class="page-break">\2</span>anybody for changing his name, as the law and circumstances justify his action. But it would be a great mistake on the part of one, who changes his name to Pappas, not that it is not a good name, but it is getting to be adopted so frequently there are thousands that bear it and the confusion is great.</p>
   <p>The change in a name, when necessary, does not mean much, so long as the heart, the nationality, and faith in the sacred traditions and ideals of the race do not change.</p>
   <p>The Star considers that the name of every individual is sacred, and that no one has a right to manipulate it. It recommends to both those who have changed their name, and those who have not, to keep in mind the fact, that names and hereditary having being preserved throughout the ages are sacred and linked closely with national traditions and ancestoral heritages, which no one has a right to interfere with or dispute.</p>
   <p>And let us not forget that it is not only the Greeks that have difficulty with their names, The Lithuanians and Polish have still greater difficulty.</p>

   <p>When Zcimtzak was a candidate for the position of Secretary of Cook County, his friends saying to him: "How do you expect the citizens to vote for you when none can even pronounce your name right?" And his answer was: "Let my name alone. It is as it was bequeathed by my father to me, and no one has a right to change it!" This answer was sufficient to make him popular and he was elected with a great majority.</p>
   <p>Men are not blamed for having difficult names, but rather for not being good people.</p>
