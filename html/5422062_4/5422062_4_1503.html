   <p>A splendid program is being prepared for us by the Greek American Progressive Association on Friday, March 25, at 8 o'clock, P.M., sharp, at the Masonic Temple, 32 W. Randolph St.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of the arrangements has outdone itself in presenting to the Greek people the most brilliant celebration of our national holidays.</p>
   <p>All honors go to the Supreme Governor of Gapa, Mr. K. Sotirakopoulos. He has invited as speakers the General Consul of Greece, Bishop Callistos, Lawyer John Gekas, Dr. C. Theodore and two Americans. The program includes a recitation by E. Tsinonis and two Greek dances by the members of the women's Kypselis chapter.</p>

   <p>The Greek community, due to this momentous occasion, is expected to turn out one hundred per cent. Everything and everybody will be overfilled with a patriotic enthusiasm equal to our countrymen living in Greece.</p>
   <p>The Gapans are proud of what they have done. Come and share this pride with them at 8 o'clock sharp, Friday.</p>
