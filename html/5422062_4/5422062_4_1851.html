   <p>p. 1.--The administrative officers were elected in final session of this year's convention of Gapa (Greek-American Progressive Association).</p>
   <p>In view of the facts that in conventions of nationalistic organizations no legislative acts are formulated, and that the benefits derived of them cannot immediately be felt, we cannot discuss the merits of this year's convention of the Order of Gapa. However, the convention of Gapa held in Montreal this year was ostensibly a huge success and thoroughly fulfilled its purpose. We shall not overlook the fact that no idea or purpose can be realized without confidence and enthusiasm, and at this year's convention Gapa created precisely these two qualities, for it instilled in all its members new strength and the enthusiastic determination to accomplish the Association's high purpose.</p>

   <p>The presence of the Greek ambassador to the United States, Mr. Simppoulos, and Archbishop Athenagoras contributed to the success of the convention and strengthened the spirit of nationality and religion among the members. The gathering inspired renewed courage for the attainment of Gapa's purpose, the preservation of Greek ideals, the Greek religion, and the Greek language among the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>Since we do not know the details of the convention's proceedings, we are unable to discuss the merits of its acts and decisions, but we feel confident in asserting that assemblies of this nature in which the Greeks in America deliberate together, and which are heralded throughout the entire Hellenism of this country, contribute largely to the strengthening of our nationalistic feeling and serve as an inspiration to those who are striving to preserve our nationality in the land where we now live.</p>

   <p>The Order of Gapa deserves much credit for undertaking so huge a task and for striving to realize so high a purpose, a task and a purpose difficult to achieve and in fact beyond its powers. But since the Hellenism of America has been abandoned and forsaken by the Greek Government and up to this time has received no aid in its struggle to preserve its racial integrity, and endeavor, regardless of its source and magnitude, should receive our whole-hearted support and encouragement. We feel that it is our duty to support any such movement.</p>
   <p>We certainly do not pretend that the Order of Gapa can save the Hellenism of America, but neither do we believe that the efforts made by this organization are anything but noble and worthy of all possible encouragement and support. With this idea is mind, we assert that beyond a doubt this year's convention of the Order of Gapa in Montreal has contributed immensely toward the strengthening of Greek national feeling not only among the members of Gapa but also throughout all American Hellenism.</p>
