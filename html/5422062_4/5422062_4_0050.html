   <p>Under the most auspicious circumstances the organization of the Tegean Society was completed last Sunday. The bylaws and the constitution of the Society were adopted by the members at the meeting held in spacious Hull House.</p>
   <p>The constitution includes, among other things, provisions for the proper treatment and hospitalization of its members in case of illness.</p>
   <p>Mr. James Kogionis proposed that the receipts from all picnics, and part of the contributions of the Tegeans in the United States should be kept in a special account, which would be used for the erection of a hospital in the town of Tegea, Greece. This institution would serve not only Tegea, but also the many other surrounding counties.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kogionis' proposal was enthusiastically and unanimously accepted. We firmly hope that this institution will be established. Mr. Kogionis who has been in Chicago for twenty years, is the founder of our first Greek church and community center of Chicago. He was responsible for the purchase of the first Greek church in the United States.</p>
   <p>The following members made substantial contributions for the afore-mentioned philanthropic institution: Gr. Karkazis, $25; A. G. Bitakis, $20; John Ganas, $20; Nicholas and Constantine Salopoulos, $10 each; B. Doukas, $10; James, Nicholas, and Emmanuel Kogionis, $30, etc.</p>
   <p>The number of the original members of the Society was forty-four. The sum of $306.00 was collected for dues and contributions for the hospital to be built at Tegea. The temporary governing committee of the Tegean Society is composed of the following members: Constantine Salopoulos, P. Bafes, G. Karkazis, Chris Maliris, James Pasialis, Elias Sountras, Chris Tzinieris, Par Koliopoulos, Spiro Notopoulos, Elias Bafes, G. Koliakos, A. Bitakis, G. Haritos, B. Doukas, and D. Karkazis [Translator's Note: Full names of these gentlemen are not given].</p>
