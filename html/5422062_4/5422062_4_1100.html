   <p>Hon. Charles S. Deneen,</p>
   <p>Senate Chambers,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Honorable Sir:</p>
   <p>I take great pleasure in forwarding to you a resolution which was adopted by the Hellenic Post No. 343, American Legion, of the Department of Illinois, of which I am commander. Said resolution was as follows:</p>
   <p>Resolved, that the Hellenic Post of the American Legion, Department of Illinois, heartily endorses the program of a "Big Navy."</p>
   <p>Be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to Hon. Charles S. Deneen, United States Senator from the State of Illinois, and to members of Congress from said State.</p>

   <p>The members present at the meeting all agreed that for the sake of peace this country should maintain a large navy because, when a nation is powerful, there is less likelihood of its neighbors attacking it. No one could be a greater advocate of peace than those who have gone through the hardships of war. We of the American Legion, appreciating the seriousness of war, believe in a large navy as the only guaranty of peace.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>H. Malapanis,</p>
   <p>Commander.</p>
