   <p>The occasion of installing new officers at the Aragon was a great occasion for the Ahepans last Wednesday. Thousands of friends of the Ahepans were there. Members of all Chicago Chapters and many higher officers came, among them Supreme President Filis.</p>
   <p>After the installation which lasted an hour and a half, the guests began dancing in Aragon's beautiful ballroom. We congratulate Ahepa on this wonderful event.</p>
