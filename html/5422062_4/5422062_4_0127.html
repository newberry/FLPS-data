   <p>The Greek Community of Chicago seriously lacks an indispensable institution, a hospital of our own. Some of us will say that most Greeks are prosperous enough to receive medical attention and hospitalization in the best American hospitals and private clinics. But if we consider the average Greek of Chicago, it will be found that because he is unable to speak and write English, or because he cannot readily become accustomed to the American way of doing things, he is not given proper attention and care in the American hospitals. One can imagine how much some Greeks are handicapped by not being able to express themselves in English and thus to receive comfort and good cheer in his American surroundings. It is particularly painful for a sick patient of ours, in a completely strange environment, to have no one to talk to in his native tongue. It is in time of illness, <span class="page-break">\2</span>of physical and mental pain and agony, that a patient needs a comforting word of encouragement, and the company and kindliness of friends and people whom he can understand and with whom he can talk.</p>
   <p>Many of us no doubt experience the dreadful pangs of loneliness in this strange land. These agonizing moments become even more painful when we lie on a sick bed. It is then that we yearn for home, for our loved ones, for the tender kindness of our mother. We then realize how painful it is to be separated from one's own people. Such loneliness, worry, and pain often prolong the illness and increase the patient's pain and anguish.</p>
   <p>It is natural for a Greek to seek a Greek environment; it is natural for him to want to die among his own people. He wants to be treated by a Greek doctor and cared for by a Greek nurse. This is what his heart desires, for he is greatly relieved and comforted by the thought that his brothers, his fellow countrymen, are sharing his pain and are doing all <span class="page-break">\3</span>they can to help.....</p>
   <p>There are many hundreds among our people who are poor, ill, and despairing. Unfortunate circumstances have undermined their health and have demoralized them to such an extent that they need immediate medical attention. But to whom will our poor and ailing people turn for hospitalization? Where will they find the money?</p>
   <p>We are asking, then, whether there is any extenuation for the failure of this great community of ours, reputed to be one of the most populous and prosperous, to provide and maintain a fully equipped hospital for the needs of our people. Individuals may be excused for being ignorant and for failing to realize that we need a humanitarian institution. The entire community, however, which is supposed to be the collective soul and mind of our people, the social and intellectual center of all our activities, cannot be excused for its blindness, for its failure to see that no community, nor organized group, can live happily--can even exist--without <span class="page-break">\4</span>having a few philanthropic institutions and public welfare agencies. It is not merely a philanthropic but a patriotic duty to provide medical care for our poor people free of charge.</p>
   <p>We are not so naive as to believe those who say that the humanitarian impulse is not sufficiently developed among our people. There must be some philanthropists among the twenty thousand Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We must act now! Regardless of the general attitude on the question of the immediate need of a hospital, and especially on the question of a free institution, we must co-operate and consult our numerous organizations; we must raise money, and make adequate plans for the construction or the purchase of a suitable hospital building. Why should so many thousands of dollars be paid annually to the American hospitals? Why should not we, too, have a large and magnificent hospital of our own, with reasonable rates, ready to serve all our people at any time? We can certainly raise the <span class="page-break">\5</span>money, and we certainly have educated, well-trained, and experienced Greek doctors in our community who would be very willing to offer their services to organize and to staff a purely Greek medical institution. Are there any among us who blame the doctors for not having already undertaken to equip and maintain a hospital of their own? Many would accuse the doctors of selfish, profit-seeking motives, unqualified to undertake such a task.</p>
   <p>Therefore, most of us expect the community to become the active and responsible leading force among us which will take the initiative in raising the necessary funds for the maintenance of a hospital, our indispensable need.</p>
   <p>We are sure that our people will contribute generously to such a great purpose.</p>

   <p>[Note by the editor of The Star: The Star agrees fully with the ideas and proposals of Mr. Georgiadis. We, too, have been proclaiming the need of a hospital for the Greeks of Chicago. Our repeated appeals proved to be a voice in the wilderness. When are we going to forget about the golden church lamps and other foolish expenditures, and start thinking about our more essential and fundamental needs, such as our schools and a hospital?]</p>
