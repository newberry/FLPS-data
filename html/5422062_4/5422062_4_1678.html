   <p>A brilliant and magnificent ceremony was performed at Hull House last Sunday in observance of the anniversary of Greek independence. The festival was organized and sponsored by the Greek physicians of Chicago. Four thousands people attended. The principal speaker, Dr. N. Papantonopoulos, delivered an oration beautifully phrased and was vigorously applauded. He urged the Greeks to remain united as the only way to be useful to the community, to the city where we are living and growing, to the flag that we are protected by, and also to our Mother-Greece.</p>
   <p>Tumultuous applause was given to our boys and girls, students of Greek schools, who sang patriotic songs under the leadership of their teacher, Mr. A. Demetracopoulos. A spirit of patriotism, friendliness, and cooperation marked the occasion.</p>
