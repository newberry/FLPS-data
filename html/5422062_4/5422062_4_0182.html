   <p>p. 2.- The Women's chapter of the Gapa organization, upon hearing of the needy plight of many Greek families through the United Greek charities, hastened to the rescue.</p>
   <p>They prepared baskets of foods under the supervision of Mrs. Katsules, president; Mrs. Karopoulos, secretary; and Mrs. Matsinis, treasurer. George Lambos directed the loading of the trucks and the delivering of the baskets.</p>
   <p>We heartily congratulate these charitable women for the work they are doing.</p>
