   <p>The Story of Saint Demetrios</p>
   <p>Arthur H. Peponis, supreme governor of the Order of Ahepa, today told the story of St. Demetrios.</p>
   <p>"There is an age-old tradition of the Greeks that during the time of the Byzantine Empire," he said, "St. Demetrios was always to be seen, transfigured in the sky, in advance of Grecian troops.</p>
   <p>"He is usually portrayed upon a fiery horse of red, with a gleaming gold spear, mounted with a cross.</p>
   <p>"For centuries he has been enshrined in the hearts of the devout Greeks as a symbol of their ancient greatness."</p>
