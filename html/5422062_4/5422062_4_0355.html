   <p>p. 6. The cathedral of St. Constantine, in spite of its architectual and in spite of the rare collection of masterpiece paintings lacks one thing- the sacred pulpit upon which the Holy Gospel is read.</p>
   <p>One of our prosperous Greeks, named Mr. Strategos, made the pious donation for the erection of the pulpit. Its octagon shape, including the stairs, is made entirely of walnut wood, and it is printed in onyx, marble fashion. The pulpit is beautified by the Ikons of the five Evangelists which border around it. A golden, two-headed eagle is used as a base stand for the open Holy Book.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to Mr. Strategos, from the whole Greek community, for his generous and thoughtful donation.</p>
