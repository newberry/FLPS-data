   <p>The Philanthropic Association of the Greek Women of Chicago gave an evening party for the benefit of the poor children Thursday before last. This party was given in the Cameo Room of the Morrison Hotel at which many men and especially women were present.</p>
   <p>Their program was very successful because, besides the women of the Executive Committee, Mr. Lambrinides, the vice-president of the Greek school, Socrates, many students from the above mentioned school, and the music-teacher, Mr. Yetimes, offered their assistance.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of the following: Mr. Yetimes played piano solos, Mr. Alexander recited "The Grace of the King" followed by music from the Greek Mandolinata, Spanish dances by Miss Stamatopoulos, the recitation of the poem "Unfaithful" by Miss Chrysosthenes, classical dances by Miss Lada, the poem "Resurrection" recited by Mr. Lambrinides and last but not least, the stage play, "On the Country's Altar," <span class="page-break">2</span>by the students of the Greek school, "Socrates," Alexander and Miss Kanella Kurkules. Miss E. Constantine also touched the audience with her role as the Queen's Daughter, as also G. Coloduros in his role.</p>
   <p>We offer our congratulations to all who supported this affair, as also to the devout and merciful women of this Association, who work for any philanthropic task.</p>
