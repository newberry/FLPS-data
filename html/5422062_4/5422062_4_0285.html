   <p>The above organization, composed of disabled veterans of the war, in which many Greek boys are included, will hold its usual tag day on September 22nd.</p>
   <p>Due to the fact that many ladies are needed for the occasion, we suggest that the Greek ladies' societies which in the past displayed did not take active part in tag day responsibilities, to assist in this humanitarian work. We urgently suggest to our young girls to enroll their names for service at the headquarters of the organization, located at Room 243 LaSalle Hotel.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly our invocations will be heeded by our Greek ladies and the desired objective will be accomplished.</p>
