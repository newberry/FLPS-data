   <p>p. 5.- Except the doxologies of the various churches and the Ahepa-Gapa celebration, Chicago had no other panegyric for the centennial anniversary of our independence. The Baltetsians are correcting this by giving a picnic on Sunday, August 3, at the Grand View Gardens so all the Greeks will have a chance to celebrate.</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors is organizing a very select program for the enjoyment of those present. This program will be published in a week so that everyone will know just what to expect.</p>
   <p>The park will be gayly decorated with flags and many people will be dressed in native costume.</p>
   <p>Many notable people have been invited. Among them are the president's of the various Greek clubs, the priests, the General Consul of Greece and many others. Admission is free to all. No one should miss this gathering.</p>
