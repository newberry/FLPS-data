   <p>To-morrow, holiday of Kimisis Tis Theotokou, all churches will hold masses, which thousands of our countrymen will attend. The Greeks are beginning to realize that the most influential gathering of our nationality can be found in the churches. This has caused a great increase in our church attendance on Sundays, and as this holiday is one of the most important in the year, we can safely predict a huge crowd at every church in our city.</p>
   <p>In Greece, following the church mass, many panegyrics take place. The Chicago Greeks are planning to do the same here with picnics and parties galore.</p>
