   <p>Two men lived in the same house. One of them said, "I have been here longer than you have. My parents lived in this house before me. So I have more rights over it than you."</p>
   <p>The other man said, "I help in the payment of taxes. I help clean the house. I pay rent. Therefore, I, too, have some rights over this house."</p>
   <p>They were arguing in this manner because each of them supposed that he was right. In the meanwhile neglect of the house reduced it to a deplorable state. One day a burglar attempted to break into the house. Then, these two men united in driving away the burglar, forgetting their differences. Afterwards, they discussed the matter calmly and in a friendly spirit. Their opinion was that they both had rights over this house.</p>

   <p>The first man was the native American. The second was the foreign-born American. The house in which they both live is the United States of America. The robber is racial prejudice. The alien as well as the native-born learned that they are doing the same thing, but racial prejudice is their common enemy; if they destroy it, they will be able to create a better America.</p>
