   <p>A brotherhood under the above name was recently launched in our city, in which all Greeks coming from Asia Minor and Thrace are eligible for membership.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this brotherhood of persons who had the misfortune to be expelled from their native land after the unprecedented catastrophe of 1922, is the development of personal acquaintance among all refugees; mutual assistance among members; and particularly the fostering of brotherly feelings between its members and our fellow-Greeks of this free state, in commercial as well as social activities.</p>
   <p>The league will also act in the philanthropic field in individual emergency cases and especially in great calamities which vitally affect the life and property of groups in this country, in Greece, and elsewhere.</p>
   <p>This organization fills a need long felt among the unfortunate victims of the world war.</p>
