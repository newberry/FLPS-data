   <p>"When a Greek meets a Greek they open a restaurant." Thus was transformed the proverb, "When a Greek meets a Greek they start a fight."</p>
   <p>All hail to the modern Greek toilers, who, with their many restaurants and their cooking, have succeeded in uprooting a proverb that was anything but flattering to the Greeks and substitute another for it. However, if the cooks and restaurant men have accomplished this, the "intellectuals" (the people, i.e., of logo-diarrhea) are not far off from creating another one: "When an educated Greek meets an educated Greek they start a grand fight about.....a donkey's shadow."</p>
   <p>For, how can you explain otherwise, the incident when a priest, having attended the same school with another, called the latter ignorant? How can it be explained, when a graduate of high school, publishing a paper of liberal tint, accuses the other publishers as exploiters, while he knows from experience that they live on "Black broth?"</p>

   <p>Whether they are talking about the modern Greek language, or about the translation of the New Testament, about the canons, military affairs, or the capital city of Tudostan, it is a fight; the thing is to fight, and the subject is of no importance. They even fight about x-ray waves, and they never mind if they are benighted. Why? Because they know Greek! The title is so great that when they learn "Dareou and Parisatidos gignontai paedes thio" they imagine themselves to be the orators of Pnyka. Or as if they personify Demosthenes when they say "De Dei chrimaton" (now we need money- Translator), that which you never have...(and so on further down-- translator). And do you dare to talk to them? They know everything. The Modern Greek philosophy has entered their head by means of a syringe...</p>
   <p>The moral that we get out of all this is, that the "intellectuals" instead of "pulling one another's hair", in order to show their great knowledge, had better open a kitchen and" peyenete na katharisete patches" (go and clean tripe).</p>
