   <p>To Reverend Priests and Honorable Presidents of Organizations:</p>
   <p>No doubt you are informed about the disastrous results of the earthquakes in the district of the peninsula of Chalcidice. The catastrophe is of such magnitude that the damage is inestimable, and hundreds of the victims were made homeless and are in need of everything to save their lives.</p>
   <p>It is difficult for us from such a distance to have a real conception of the disaster, the condition of the thousands of homeless, the sufferings of the hundreds of widows and orphans, and in general, the difficulties for the settlement of new refugees in the already overcrowded cities.</p>
   <p>The conditions created by this calamity are unbearable, and now is the time to show brotherly love and sacrifice, as it is proper on such occasions imposed by human sympathy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>No doubt the government of the Country in its paternal interest, does its best to relieve the suffering of the needy. The fleet of the foreign powers in the Aegean Sea helped greatly in giving first aid to the victims of this calamity, but it is hoped and expected that we, being far away, will show our sympathy and brotherly love in coming to their help and doing our duty, in answering the call of our conscience, being sure that Almighty God will repay us manyfold.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we ask you, as soon as you receive this letter, to arrange for an extra contribution to be collected in the churches, and that among the members of the various organizations,collections will be conducted for the benefit of the suffering victims in Chalcidice.</p>
   <p>The sums of all these collections should be sent to the Consul General of Greece, in Chicago, whose address is given below.</p>
   <p>We are confident that you will do your utmost to have a grand success for <span class="page-break">\3</span>this philanthropic endeavor to help the victims of the earthquake calamity in Chalcidice.</p>
   <p>With felicitations and brotherly love,</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>His Grace, Right Rev. Bishop Kallistos,</p>
   <p>of San Francisco.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Depastas, Consul General,</p>
   <p>General Consulate of Greece,</p>
   <p>201 North Wells Street,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
