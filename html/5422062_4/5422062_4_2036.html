   <p>The Greek people in America have often been heard to complain of the lack of education and culture of the Greek clergy in this country. By this is meant that most of the people feel that the aspirants to the priesthood are not qualified for such position of influence and leadership. The chief point of complaint seems to be their lack of education. However, during the recent convention of the Greek clergy here in Chicago, we had the opportunity of making certain investigations and comparisons. We finally came to the conclusion that the Greek clergy of America was far superior to that of Greece. At the time we were talking and writing about the deficiencies of our own priests we were not aware of the magnitude of the illiteracy among the priests in Greece.</p>
   <p>The latest decision of the Holy Synod of Greece was that any one with a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>grammar-school education might try for the priesthood. From any standpoint this decision is a terrible one. People with no education, no preparation, and no cultural or spiritual attributes are chosen to be the spiritual leaders of a nation. They are the ones who are supposed to provide food for the spiritual appetites of a people. It is evident that under such conditions the Greek Orthodox Church will not be able to survive in its birthplace for long. It would be a curious phenomenon to see a religion die in its homeland and thrive on the foreign soil of America.</p>
   <p>For the first time in our history has the church made such an announcement. In former years, in all the countries of the world, it was the clergy which was the educated and cultured group. Now, the opposite is going to happen. It is now very difficult to find an educated priest, or an educated man who is willing to enter the priesthood. This is a phenomenon that should be of interest to the students of theology and sociology.</p>
