   <p>p. 3-A new building has been begun by Rhegas Brothers and Panagiotes Danigeles at 1531-1535 North Crawford avenue. This building, which will cost more than $350,000 was designed by Jens Jensen, the architect usually employed by Greeks. It has already been named the Pioneer Arcade.</p>
   <p>The Arcade will be used entirely as a recreation center. It will have twenty bowling-alleys, many billiard tables, and recreation-halls of various kinds. When it is completed, many new devices for recreation will be available to the public, for it will be unique among institutions of its kind.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen may well be proud for their achievements, and they honor themselves and their race by displaying their national inheritance of aptitude for commercial enterprises.</p>
