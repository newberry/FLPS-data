   <p>A body of Ahepan representatives for the Kansas City Convention, from the Eastern cities, were given a reception in Chicago, Saturday, by the various chapters.</p>
   <p>At 10 o'clock in the morning, the representatives were met at the Union station by a committee. Many other members were there to welcome them. Everyone piled into cars and drove down Michigan Blvd. to Grant Park where the Ahepans placed a wreath on Lincoln's monument and were photographed.</p>
   <p>From there they went north through Lincoln Park till they came to Solon school of St. James Church, where the visitors expressed amazement at the building and congratulated the Greeks of Chicago for having such a wonderful school.</p>
