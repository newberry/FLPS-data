   <p>P.3--Native sons of Gerakion, Sparta, Greece, who for many years have been established in Chicago, came together last week and decided to form a fraternity of their own. The aim of the fraternity is to effect mutual cooperation and assistance among members and to render financial and moral assistance to their native Gerakion.</p>
   <p>At this very first meeting thirty-three became charter members, and from these thirty-three $850 was collected as a fund to build a church in their native town. The name of the Society is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Koimisis Tis Theotokou.</p>
   <p>All Gerakiotes in Chicago are invited to attend the next meeting of the Society, which will take place at 3103 South State Street tomorrow, Saturday, at 7 P. M.</p>
   <p>The temporary officers elected were Mr. Nicholas Protopapas, president, Mr. Geo. Lissaris, treasurer, and Mr. N. Kontaxis, secretary.</p>
