   <p>p. 1.- Last Sunday, March 30th, the Masonic Temple, 32 East Randolph St., was invaded and captured by the Greeks of Chicago. Over 10,000 Greeks twice during the same day held magnificent ceremonies commemorating Greek independence.</p>
   <p>The streets around the Masonic Temple were so jammed with Greeks and youths of Greek extraction, attired in colorful costumes, that additional traffic officers and mounted police were sent to direct the curious throngs of passers-by, who blocked traffic watching the Greeks entering the building. Thousands of Greek girls, attired in the classic costumes of ancient Greeks and looking like butterflies, flying hither and thither, urged the Greeks to enter the building and hasten the beginning of the celebration.</p>

   <p>At 2:00 P.M. Gapa's celebration began. The American and Greek anthems were played by all the bands. Dr. Melidonis, as master of ceremonies, presented the Hon. George Depastas, Consul General of Greece, who in a brief and fiery speech eulogized the event of the London protocol whereby the Powers of the world recognized the independence of Greece, and brought out the gigantic task of little Greece, in restoring herself as much as possible to the splendor of the past. The next speaker presented was the Hon. James Hamilton Lewis, who with his silver tongue brought out the debt of the civilized world to little Greece.</p>
   <p>Then the string ensemble composed of pupils of Prof. Kampas gave a musicale with technique and talent. The five year old Elias Nicolatseas, wearing the Greek kilt, recited two poems with great excellence. The official speaker of the day, Dr. Cleomenis Papatheodorou, with his versatile tongue, brought before the eyes of the crowds the holy battles and sacrifices and plentiful blood shed by our ancestors in the cause of liberty and civilization. Echoes of the cheers, shook the hall, and <span class="page-break">3</span>retarded for the time being the performance of boy and girl pupils of St. Nicholas school, who danced and sang patriotic songs.</p>
   <p>Other speakers were the Rev. Tsourounakis, Mr. Primas, Mrs. Kotakis, Mrs. Constantinou, Miss Agelopoulou, Miss Siepi, Miss Pelafas and Mr. Nick Manis. The great Order of Gapa closed this program to make room for the second celebration of the day held by the other Greek organization, Ahepa, and which began at 8:00 P. M.</p>
