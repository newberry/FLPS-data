   <p>Despite the efforts of the clean Greek press in the United States, especially in Chicago, to fight and crush the evil of white-slave traffic, no important result has been achieved. This disgraceful state of affairs has been going on, and will continue to go on, as long as there are such low Greek characters in our midst. But the hour has come when the powerful hand of Uncle Sam will undertake to exterminate them. Before long, we shall see the atmosphere cleared and society rid of those who dishonor the Greek name by engaging in white-slave traffic.</p>
   <p>If this despicable business merely involved Greek merchants of white slaves and their victims, with only the Greek people knowing about the traffic the thing would not be so bad. To the disgrace of our people here in Chicago, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>however, the situation has become known to the American newspapers, and through them to the public.</p>
   <p>Last week, The Chicago Journal published an entire article denouncing white slavery. On the day before yesterday The Inter-Ocean bitterly condemned this criminal tendency and at the same time announced that a member of our nationality George Antonopoulos, had been fined one hundred dollars. The same paper writes that Federal indictments have been issued against two Chicago Greeks, one of whom, the said Antonopoulos, has pleaded guilty and will be used as a witness in other cases. The other man is in the brokerage business, and is a labor agent for Greek immigrants who have been aided in securing illegal entry into the United States.</p>
   <p>The articles in these newspapers were a slap in the face and an affront to all the Greeks of Chicago. Many had been asking the name of the second man, which was not divulged by the police, apparently because they were not sure <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of his identity. But soon, when federal officers searched the Greek quarter for a cigar dealer and a labor-hiring agent named Soterios Bousoulas, who is a partner of an Athenian merchant named Eustathios Karavelis, there was no doubt as to who was the ring leader of many criminal activities in the Greek quarter.</p>
   <p>The indictments preferred against Bousoulas are two: 1) that he brought dependent aliens into the United States in violation of the immigration laws; and 2) that he attempted to exploit these aliens in the labor market.</p>
   <p>We obtained a copy of the indictment charge from the bulletin of the court, in which the name of one of Bousoulas' victims, Anastasios Nosopoulos, appears. We are wondering how Bousoulas could be so stupid as to think that he could elude and deceive the immigration authorities of the United States.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Bousoulas was not thrown into jail because some one offered to post a two-thousand-dollar bond for his freedom. However, he must appear in Federal court on the thirteenth of this month and give an account of his crime. We are sure that his defense will abound in forged certificates and perjured statements.</p>
   <p>Several witnesses have been examined thus far, among whom being Messrs Kokinis, Papakostas, and Koutoumanos.</p>
   <p>The defendant must now sit on the witness stand and face Uncle Sam with a trembling voice and a fearful heart. Regardless of whether he is convicted or not, the whole case is a blemish and a stigma on the Greek name. We cannot see why the Greek name should be disgraced because of one, two, or even five white-slave dealers.</p>
   <p>The greatest enemy of our people in America is this white-slave traffic.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Some miserable Greeks are earning their daily bread with the sweat of Greek labor, while at the same time our people are unjustly brought into disrepute. Our prayer would be answered if the heavy hand of justice fell on those criminals who have done so much harm to the Greek people.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alcibiades Sarafis, a Greek who represented the United States Government in this case, is to be congratulated for performing his duties so admirably, and for enforcing the laws of the Federal Government and the State in an impartial spirit.</p>
