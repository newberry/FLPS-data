   <p>There is a steadfast desire [for mutual support and dependency] which everyone of us has within himself--a desire, which, when thoroughly examined, will be found to be the most reasonable and the only force that will insure our economic and social existence and welfare.</p>
   <p>This desire is not the product of any strange or incomprehensible part of our nature; it is merely a simple, a natural phenomenon which is found in all nature, and upon the harmonious development and functioning of which depends nature's grandeur. That this desire of ours is most essential and reasonable is proved by the fact that it is a product of nature, which in all its grandeur and wisdom has created everything with harmony and perfection.</p>
   <p>In support of our statements, let us refer to the marvelous science of astronomy, and let us study the planetary system. We shall then notice that the motion and path of every planet are dependent upon mutual attraction and <span class="page-break">2</span>physical relationships and upon the marvelous laws of harmonious movement. Because of these forces, laws, and relationships, any collision or celestial disturbance is prevented; thus is insured the great and normal operation of our marvelous planetary system.</p>
   <p>But, if we do not wish to look for illustrations of mutual support and dependency in celestial phenomena, we may so order our thoughts that truth and illustrations may be found in our daily lives on this earth.</p>
   <p>If we examine the operation of any industrial system, we shall see that the entire mechanical and productive process consists of the co-ordination, the mutual and complicated connections and relationships among the wheels, levers, and machines. Through this mechanical interaction and interdependence, the great volume of work, products, profits, and goods are produced for the benefit of humanity.</p>
   <p>Without this mechanical co-ordination and organization, no motion would be <span class="page-break">3</span>produced, no power generated; nor would we be able to obtain so many goods. Therefore, every force of motion and production is the result of mutual co-operation among the component elements. Now, it is not required that these component parts be similar or alike, for very often they are dissimilar. Nonetheless, they work together, producing, generating power, and bringing results, as is the case with the co-operation of natural and electrical elements which act in accordance with the law of physics whereby two like objects or elements repel each other, while two unlike objects attract each other.</p>
   <p>In the light of this discussion, we are shown the way in which we should think, and we are invited to examine how much and how greatly we could benefit if we followed and obeyed this natural law of mutual support and general co-operation under which the forces of nature, which are superior to us, work and produce.</p>
   <p>All of us--young and old, educated and uneducated, gifted and ordinary--know that the great educational and constructive centers for intellectual, moral, religious, physical, and social well-being are the great institutions which <span class="page-break">4</span>bring so many benefits and blessings to society. In the small space of this editorial, we cannot enumerate all the institutions that function in every community. We can only say, categorically, that the entire economic, social, and political power of the world depends, to the extent of eighty per cent, upon mutual co-operation and support. Only twenty per cent of the people in society work as single, self-dependent units; but even they, when examined more closely, will be found to derive their existence and strength from the influence and support of unseen individuals or forces.</p>
   <p>The foregoing exposition and argument make abundantly clear what great and numerous benefits we, the Greek people of Chicago, as a minority and a nationality, can receive, provided we accept the recognized principle of co-operation, mutual recognition, support, and common action.</p>
   <p>Today, the Greek people, having immigrated to this great country, pre-eminently a land of institutions, organization, and common enterprise, are working individually, as units, in various occupations. They are working unsystematically, <span class="page-break">5</span>and with no definite, constructive, and progressive purpose to look forward to. Our businessmen are not objecting to the way in which business is done in this country, but they are putting forth no effort to adjust themselves to existing conditions. They are driven merely by an individualistic business impulse, and that is why they are doomed to suffer many failures.</p>
   <p>There are many wise and progressive businessmen and community leaders among our people here in Chicago who have adopted the American way. They have succeeded, therefore, in business and have established an excellent reputation among the American people. It is of no use to boast that we are good citizens and good businessmen; we must endeavor to become recognized as such. But in order to gain this recognition, we must act and show results.</p>
   <p>If we are to live happily and prosperously in any society, we must adapt ourselves to its ways, and to its mode of working and living. This is especially true when we are living in a foreign country. It is evident, then, that we must realize the situation we are in and get to know ourselves, for we Greeks <span class="page-break">6</span>are sorely lacking in more ways than one, because we have not heeded the wise and fundamental admonition of Socrates--"Know thyself".</p>
   <p>We must subdue many of our nationalistic and foolish passions; we must get rid of envy and jealousy; we must develop and progress by mutual support and cooperation. To be more specific; the educated should enlighten the others, the good and moral should assist those who have fallen into the path of vice and iniquity so that they may return to the right road and become virtuous men and good citizens. Those who are more experienced in business should help the inexperienced.</p>
   <p>Saloniki, July 27, 1918.</p>
   <p>When this is done, then we shall in time see the day when we will all be united and completely organized. From this will come our national strength, and success for our entire Greek community.</p>
   <p>There are from twenty-five to thirty thousand Greeks in Chicago, and if they <span class="page-break">7</span>supported one another, they could accomplish miracles. They could have the greatest business and social center, from which profits could be derived and through which they could obtain greater business credit. They could own the most magnificent churches, the best schools, and excellent clubhouses throughout the city. With the millions that the Greeks have deposited in the banks, they could place two or three Greek employees in each of the great banks. By becoming united and by exercising reason, the Greeks of Chicago could clean up and get rid of wicked exploiters and defrauders, who, by means of fraudulent stock, fictitious mines, and phoney inventions, are daily robbing our people. The money which is so foolishly and shamefully wasted could be used profitably by investing it in socially beneficial projects.</p>
   <p>So we are inclined to believe that if we are to be saved, if we are to develop in every way, we must support one another; we must forget about our own interest and our own pockets once in a while, and endeavor to think about the life and fate of our fellow countryman. Deserving and respectable individuals will thus be enabled to carry on their legitimate businesses, and the exploiters and defrauders will be exposed. Dishonorable and criminal individuals among <span class="page-break">8</span>us will be prosecuted and destroyed, so that our community may find peace and security.</p>
   <p>Saloniki, through its contributors and many friends, is ever ready to usher in a new era of co-operation, mutual support, and understanding. It offers its advice and support, to all of our nationals who ask for it. One of our contributors, Mr. Constantine Palaiologos, who occupies a prominent position in the great Central Trust Company of Illinois, 125 West Monroe Street, was the first to inform us that he is willing to offer any business advice or his moral support to anyone asking for it. He is willing to speak before any organization or society. Mr. Palaiologos is willing to instruct our businessmen in the best method of keeping their books, especially desirable instruction in these days when war taxes and business transactions demand perfect bookkeeping records.</p>
   <p>We hope that we will be understood by all our readers. We expect that our individual and community life will be changed for the better in the years to come. So we salute this new era with enthusiasm.</p>
