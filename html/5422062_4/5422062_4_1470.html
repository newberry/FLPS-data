   <p>P.2--In order to assist fellow-Greek in Macedonin, the Pan-Hellenic society of Chicago held a benefit dance last Friday which was attended by a crowd of 2,000. The proceeds of the dance exceeded $4,500. This sum will be added to the general fund for the Macedonians and will be sent to the central committee in Athens, Greece.</p>
   <p>Although the dance, which lasted till 4 A. M., was conducted in a very orderly manner, nevertheless at 3 A. M. the lights went out, and the word pell-mell describes the situation for a quarter of an hour.</p>
