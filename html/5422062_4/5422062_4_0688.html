   <p>In the November 18 issue of Loxias, a satirical weekly, we note with indignation an unjust and unwarranted attack on Mr. A. A. Seraphic, inspector in charge of ports in the State of Florida, and a special investigating officer of the Bureau of Immigration. A lie has been promulgated by a clique of Greeks who are seeking revenge because they were brought to justice by Mr. Seraphic and convicted by the federal courts here for violations of the immigration laws. The editor of Loxias was induced to seize upon this lie as a pretext for its attack on Mr. Seraphic. The falsehood referred to states that Mr. Seraphic was present at the meeting of Greeks in the Masonic Temple to influence votes in behalf of the party headed by the gentleman who is now president of the Greek community at Chicago, as well as president of the Panhellenic Union of all Greek communities throughout the United States.</p>
   <p>That while there Mr. Seraphic applauded the party referred to and that such action is in the mind of the editor or Loxias a crime of partisanship and as such is brought to the attention of his excellency, the president of the United States, with a rather conspicuous heading in English. For our part we are ashamed of the stupidity and ignorance displayed by the man who poses as an Editor of a Greek publication. The said meeting took place on November 13, at 9 P. M., for the purpose of designating a committee to supervise the election of officers at a later date.</p>
   <p>We are in position to know that although Mr. Seraphic happened to be present at this meeting, the insinuation is untrue, as Mr. Seraphic is in no way connected with the affairs of our community and does not interfere in our factional fights.</p>
   <p>We know from Mr. Georgepoulos, connected with the office of the chief of police of our city, that Mr. Seraphic called at the Masonic Temple by appointment to meet him, regarding some information desired.</p>
   <p>We also know that Mr. Georgepoulos was late, and Mr. Seraphic took a seat near the entrance to the hall on the side occupied by the constituency of the president now in office. We know that he did not applaud from reputable Greeks, that sat by his side.</p>
   
   <p>He left just after he saw Mr. Georgepoulos; these are facts and not fabrications.</p>
   <p>But were the fabrications appearing in Loxias facts, Mr. Seraphic would have been perfectly free and at liberty to exercise his rights, i.e.; rights inherent to American citizenship of which, evidently, the editor of Loxias is utterly ignorant.</p>
   <p>If the faction supported by Loxias was ignored in that meeting, it was for another reason and not because of the presence of Mr. Seraphic in the opposition. Mr. Seraphic is highly esteemed and respected by all law abiding Greeks here and throughout the United States. He does honor to his nationality and we are proud of him.</p>
   <p>None but the law-breakers fear him and the inference drawn from the statements of Loxias is an insult to the Greeks of Chicago, for we know and believe that all Greeks who attended that meeting and brought about the accomplished results, are law abiding, intelligent and successful business men and fear nobody.</p>
   
   <p>The "Greek Star" has known Mr. Seraphic for many years, and it has always followed his record in connection with the government and also in connection with the Greeks. We have found him to be a perfect gentleman in every respect, and a man faithfully performing his duties, therefore, we take pleasure in publishing this article in the English language, not only to contradict what was published in the said paper, but to say to the English speaking public that Mr. Seraphic does greatly honor the Greeks in the United States, and enjoys the love and respect of all respectable Greeks from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>
