   <p>"To the Reverend Pastors, Messrs. Chairmen of the boards of directors of the Hellenic Orthodox Churches, under the jurisdiction of the Consulate General, and to the editors of the local Greek press:</p>
   <p>"His Excellency the Greek Minister at Washington, D. C., has made an appeal to all Greek nationals in the United States, recounting the sufferings of our brothers in Turkey and Bulgaria. He urges them to measure up to the philanthropy of the American people and rally to the support of their suffering brothers by contributing to this sacred cause whatever they can, thus saving their brothers from the greatest peril. Indeed, this duty is imposed upon all Greeks not by sheer philanthropy, but by national sentiment of mutual support, and by the necessity of our national self-preservation.</p>
   <p>"Until now, the nation has shown unpardonable indifference in regard to the sufferings of our brothers in Turkey and Bulgaria, for many thought that the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>accounts and exaggerated rumors were put into circulation for political expediency. Unfortunately, this is not the case.</p>
   <p>"One-fourth of the Greek nation's population, that is, the entire Greek populations of Turkey and Bulgaria, are being systematically persecuted and annihilated day by day, by starvation and other hardships. Now then, it is not conceivable that the other three-fourths of the nation, after now being officially informed of the truth, will continue to be indifferent until the end, in the face of this great national disaster.</p>
   <p>"At present, the aid which the nation should offer to its suffering section must be financial assistance, until Divine Providence opens the way for our leaders and the earth's powerful to save those of our brothers who are being daily exterminated.</p>

   <p>"Being an eyewitness to the calamities that have befallen our brothers in Turkey, for I have served as Consul General of Greece in Constantinople for the last three years, I cannot but accept the appeal of His Excellency the Minister to the Greeks of America with all my soul. Following his suggestions, I request:</p>
   <p>1. The chairmen of the boards of directors of the Greek Orthodox Churches, under the jurisdiction of this Consulate General:</p>
   <p>(a) To appoint committees for the solicitation of funds, and submit to me the names of the members that compose these committees.</p>
   <p>(b) To order the passing of basket collections in the church at every holiday for the benefit of our suffering brothers.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>2. The Greek Orthodox clergy within the confines of the consular district to impress upon the members of the churches by means of appropriate sermons and speeches, the necessity of alleviating the pain and suffering of our unfortunate brothers in Turkey.</p>
   <p>3. The editors of the local press to kindly publish this invitation by interpreting and explaining to their readers that it is the sacred duty of every Greek to contribute in this particular case.</p>
   <p>"In a later notice the names of those who will be receiving contributions will be made known, as well as the place, date, and hour of the convening of a mass meeting here, to which Americans as well as our own people will be invited to hear of the sufferings of our own nationals, as I actually witnessed them at Constantinople.</p>
   <p>"The Consul General of Greece,</p>
   <p>"S. K. Pezas"</p>
