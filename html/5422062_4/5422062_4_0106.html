   <p>The united chapters of Ahepa of the 13th district will hold a grand ball at the famous Trianon, the proceeds of which will go for Ahepa's sanatorium in New Mexico.</p>
   <p>This exceptional philanthropic act of Ahepa's will be appreciated, we hope, by all, and we ardently appeal to all societies and organizations to keep in mind the date, March 10, 1937, and not to appoint any other affair for the same day.</p>
   <p>The managing committee wishes to announce that on that evening the best talent will appear in music and in the other arts which our compatriots have to display.</p>
   <p>All parents, therefore, who have children with exceptional ability are requested to apply to the committee at the address below for further details.</p>
   <p>The age of those desiring to take part in this artistic contest must not exceed seventeen years.</p>
