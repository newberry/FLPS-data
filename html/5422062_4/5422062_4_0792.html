   <p>For the past few years we have noted with interest that the Greeks of Chicago turned their business activities towards other channels than the usual ones.</p>
   <p>The perpetual advocacy of Saloniki that Chicago Greek capitalists must be united, and in a group turn their commercial eyes upon bigger business than they usually have done has begun to materialize.</p>
   <p>Today we are happy to announce the formation of the firm of S. J. Gregory and Company, theatre owners. Besides their Chicago theaters, these Greek capitalists have two large ones in Hammond, Ind., and are building one more in Berwyn, Ill., at a cost of $6000,000. The same company builds theaters now for other Greeks who became interested in this line of business. These new theaters are for Messrs. Sarros and Trevellas, Hammond, Ind., S. Bennis, Lincoln, Ill., and M. Kallis, Quincy Ill.</p>
