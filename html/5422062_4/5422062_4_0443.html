   <p>The total collected was $2,028; this money was turned over to the Chicago Chapter of the Red Cross by the Greek committee's treasurer, Mr. George Tsiagouris. Besides the wonderful work of the Central Committee and the auxiliary committees, invaluable services toward the success of the collection drive were rendered by the Pepas and Alex Importing and Exporting Company. The Alexopoulos brothers should be especially commended for putting their stenographers and office employees at the committees' disposal without accepting any financial compensation.</p>
