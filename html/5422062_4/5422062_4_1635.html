   <p>Mr. Peter S. Lambros</p>
   <p>130 N. Wells Street,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>I want to congratulate you again upon the manner in which you organized and managed the meeting last night. It was a real pleasure to be with you, and to observe the generous response of your people to the appeals that were made to them.</p>
   <p>I appreciate more than I can express the great compliment that you and your associates paid to me in asking me to take part, as a speaker, in the meeting to be held on April 9th to celebrate the recovery of the Grecian independence. Upon consideration I find that I shall be obliged to ask to be excused from this honorable duty. There are compelling reasons, of a personal nature (which I could explain to you privately) such as would make it impossible for me to accept your flattering invitation.</p>
   <p>With much gratitude and best wishes, I am,</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>(Sign) Rufus C. Dawes.</p>
