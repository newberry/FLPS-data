   <p>Up to this moment there has been no nove to celebrate our National Independence day in Chicago. Everybody seems to be waiting for everybody else to start something. The last week will find Chicago Greeks unprepared to celebrate, and our holiday will not be as joyous and free from care as we want it to be. There is no reason for this! Are we waiting for some sign to fall from the skies before we start making preparations?</p>
   <p>Of course, there are many social and educational affairs going on at the present time, but these should not interfere with the 100th anniversary of our Independence. We are not accusing anybody of lacking the true Greek spirit. Chicago has proved more than once that we are Greek and always will be be no matter how Americanized we become.</p>
   <p>Let us not be afraid to express the deep sentiment we feel for this patriotic and religious holiday. Let us start organizing means of celebrating it the true Greek way. Let us find a sign!</p>
