   <p>p. 2.- Yesterday's celebration of the Greek Independence Day is finally over. We shall not hear the ten-cent speeches for another year. Of the 22,000 Greeks in Chicago, not even ten understood what the whole celebration was about.</p>
   <p>How can we blame the common people when even the Press was ignorant as to the meaning of this great day? The Greek Star of Chicago bought a nickel book of the war of 1821, picked a few of the leading figures and copied their life history for the benefit of the public.</p>
   <p>Only Matsoukas knows the real meaning of Greek Independence Day. He opened the eyes of everyone so that they could see for themselves how cheap and common were the high-sounding speeches made on this day to impress certain people.</p>
   
   <p>The Greek Star thinks we are fooled into believing that it is a patriotic paper. We know what it is trying to do--impress the American businessmen. That is the Greek Star's duty for 365 days of the year. What is this "patriotic" newspaper doing about the situation in Greece? Nothing. While Matsoukas has raised over $23,235 to help us fight the Turks.</p>
   <p>A Greek readily believes what he reads instead of thinking things out for himself. Anyone can see that Matsoukas and the Star are two opposing factors, one right and one wrong. Which will you choose?</p>
