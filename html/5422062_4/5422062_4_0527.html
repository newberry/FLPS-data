   <p>Matsoukas has arrived, Matsoukas has come, Matsoukas, since last Wednesday, has been in Chicago among his beloved countrymen. The Greeks are clamoring to see Matsoukas and he is clamoring to see the sons of "Manna." The time has come for them to know one another.</p>
   <p>The Greeks will see with their eyes and hear with their ears all about Matsoukas, who he is, why he came to America, how he works for his country, what he thinks of Hellenism, how he lives, and what he does.</p>
   <p>Matsoukas is the Voice of Hellas. He is in Chicago and wants to meet every single Greek here. Here is his letter of introduction.</p>
   <p>Brothers:</p>
   <p>Come! Your country wants you. Your religion wants you. I, who have come a long way, want you. I have been waiting years for this chance to come. On Sunday I will make my first appearance before you. No one, not a one must be absent. Come, brothers, your country calls!</p>
   <p>Your brother,</p>
   <p>S. Matsoukas.</p>
