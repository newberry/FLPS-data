   <p>We don't want to express ourselves on the results of last Sunday's trip home on the train but we do admit that seventy-five out of every one hundred Greeks possess "pig-like" traits. We mean they are uneducated, uncultured, ignorant boors. A Greek, finding himself in a strange environment, will take longer to assimilate than a Chinaman will. The Greeks have not changed; as they lived for 400 years under Turkish dominance so they live now. They live in the "Glory That Was Greece" instead of trying to improve their present condition.</p>
   <p>If, in ten years, the world will learn to fly, the Greeks will still crawl around not even trying to find a new way of progressing themselves.</p>

   <p>Did you go to the Community Picnic last Sunday? You did? Good. When you were coming home on the train, what did you think of? That it sounded like a train full of squealing pigs? That's right, we felt the same way.</p>
   <p>This is the Twentieth Century, Greeks! Wake up, start becoming civilized, carry on the traditions of your forefathers!</p>
