   <p>The twenty-fifth of March, 1915, the anniversary of our national independence, was celebrated magnificently. A Te Deum was sung with great pomp and solemnity at the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox church. The huge throng was profoundly moved when the Reverend Leon Pygeas invoked the blessings of God and divine intervention for our glorious dead on land and sea during the recent victorious Balkan wars against the Turks and Bulgarians. Mr. Nicholas Salopoulos, the Greek Consul General, the veterans of our two wars, and the students of the Greek school graced the occasion by their presence. At the end of the Te Deum, Mr. Spero Kotakis delivered the principal address with great enthusiasm and power. The veterans wore their military uniforms and medals and brought their huge flag. The students of the school came en masse led by their teachers, Messrs. Demetracopoulos and Stephanakos.</p>
   <p>In the evening the customary annual dance was given by the church community at the Auditorium Hall on Taylor Street for the benefit of school and church.</p>

   <p>The entire Greek community of Chicago was present at this dance, where it had the opportunity to express its jubilation in the flag-bedecked hall on the occasion of our greatest national anniversary.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the untiring efforts of the church board, presided over by Mr. William Georgacopoulos, the program of beautiful ceremonies was ably presented, and everyone was thoroughly satisfied.</p>
   <p>The ladies' reception committee and all those officials who contributed most to the success of this celebration should be warmly commended.</p>
   <p>At the Greek Annunciation Cathedral, which is one of the most beautiful Greek churches in America from the point of view of its architectural splendor and interior decoration, many thousands among the faithful were attracted from all parts of the Chicago area.</p>
   <p>An impressive platform decorated with beautiful flowers, banners, and holy <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>images was set up in the center of the church. The picture of King Constantine of Greece was prominently displayed. A blending of Greek and American flags gave added brilliance to the historic and religious occasion. The eloquent Anthony Darlakos spoke brilliantly when describing the historical achievements of Greece in winning her independence. For the benefit of Saloniki's readers, we are presenting some of the highlights of his address.</p>
   <p>"Zion," he said, "is the Christian Church, and Jerusalem in my Biblical reference is Greece, whose walls, destroyed by the Turkish tyranny, were rebuilt on the sacred day of March 25, 1821. The cross on the Greek flag is the symbol of patience, the emblem of our uprising which freed, with the help of divine providence, most of the Greek provinces from a disgraceful slavery. Our task of liberation, however, has not been completed, for the Greeks are being summoned to a new test for our "supreme ideal."</p>
   <p>The excellent work of the church board was crowned with complete success, and the dance that was given at Turner Hall on the North Side left a never-to-be-forgotten <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>impression. The members of the board of directors whose president is the Apostolos Mazarakos extended to all the most cordial hospitality. [Translator's note: Names of members of the board have been omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Program for the Joint Celebration of Our National Holiday</p>
   <p>Thanks to the desire of Mr. Nicholas Salopoulos, the Consul General, and our professional men for united action, the national holiday will this year be celebrated by the united community of Chicago on Sunday, April 18 in Bowen Hall of Hull House, Halsted and Polk Streets. Messrs. N. Salopoulos, Anthony Darlakos, our church orator, and N. Papantonopoulos, a dentist, will be the principal speakers of the day.</p>
   <p>This joint celebration will afford all the sons and daughters of proud Hellas the opportunity to meet under our glorious flag to honor those who have fought and died for the glory of our mother country. Therefore, no one should fail to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>attend this magnificant joint celebration.</p>
