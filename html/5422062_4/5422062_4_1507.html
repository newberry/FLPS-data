   <p>p. 1.- In another column and page of this paper, our readers will read about the celebration of our national Greek holiday which the Gapans are planning. It is interesting to note that they have combined the Greek national Independence Day with the bicentenary of George Washington's birthday.</p>
   <p>In some way or other, Gapa has always managed to celebrate March 25th, which is fitting and proper because the Gapa organization was formed to preserve our national language, ideals, and customs in America. It is also fitting and proper for this patriotic organization to afford the Chicago Greeks a chance to celebrate the birthday of the Father of our Country. This year's plan to celebrate these two great days together is a very good one because more people are likely to come than if they were held on separate dates. It is a very noble gesture of the Gapans to celebrate Hellenism and Americanism on one great day and we are all glad to avail ourselves of this grand opportunity.</p>
