   <p>There will be a festival of local Greek societies at Ravinia park Wednesday in celebration of the battle of Missolonghi, which was one of the decisive struggles in the Greek war of independence. It was in this battle that the famous Marco Bozarris fell and the heroism displayed by the Greeks inspired Lord Byron to take up their cause. There will be several orations, the chief speaker being N. Salopoulos. Resolutions will be adopted in memory of the late M. Deligiannis, assassinated premier of Greece. It is the intention to forward a fund to increase the donation being raised for M. Deligiannis' widow at home.</p>
