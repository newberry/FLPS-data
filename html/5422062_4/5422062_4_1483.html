   <p>Greeks over the entire world are today celebrating the anniversary of the rebirth of their fatherland. All of them, just as all Americans in this country, have recalled the deeds of our heroes and their courageous fight for liberty. These heroes are loved and remembered because they gave their life and their blood, and their money, and their comfort and security, in order that we might inherit from them a free Greece. Fortunately, their sacrifices were not in vain. Their struggle was crowned with the wreath of success and glory.</p>
   <p>Are songs and poems of praise, hurrahs and applause ample recognition of the sacrifices and courage of our forefathers? Of course not! Patriotism is not acquired or cultivated through the use of flowery words. More than words was needed to free Greece. Sacrifices, unending tortures, and deprivations were the lot cheerfully accepted by the Greeks of 1821. Without such an acceptance there would have been no revolt, and Greece would still be in chains. Without <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>it, the patriotism of the soldiers of '21 would today be forgotten, and theirs would have been merely wasted courage.</p>
   <p>The job begun then is not yet completed. To free a nation is not enough. It is necessary that that freedom be maintained, that progress be made, and that power be acquired. For the accomplishment of all these, again, sacrifices must be made by each one of us. Fortunately, today, Greece is a country with many allies, and few or no enemies. She is strengthening herself, and raising all her living and political standards. Therefore, our sacrifices for our country need not be written in our blood. However, if she is to progress and become strong, she needs continued support and aid from us.</p>
   <p>The Greeks in America--the greatest body of emigrant Greeks in the world--are duty-bound to prove that their patriotism is not restricted to empty words and annual celebrations. They must prove that the acts of our progenitors are fully appreciated. They must show to the world that they are pure Greeks who have lost none of the old Greek spirit. That is the most logical and the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>supreme way in which to celebrate the Greek Independence Day.</p>
   <p>Greece, today, enjoying the blessings of peace for nearly twenty years, and desirous only of maintaining that peace, has devoted herself to the culture and education of her citizens and the improvement of her national economy.</p>
   <p>In these endeavors, Greece has need of our bones and sinews, of our spiritual and mental strength, and of our material assistance.</p>
   <p>What do we in America ask of, and what do we foresee for our organizations, schools and churches? Why do we strive so hard to give our children Greek backgrounds and education? For one reason--and one alone! That they may be useful, and help the land of our birth--the unforgettable Greece, the glorious Greece!</p>
   <p>To help the progress of Greece means nothing less than to help raise the standard of living of her inhabitants--who are our relatives and fellow patriots <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>who live there and form the Greek nation. They are not enslaved; therefore, we can help them with our money, or our funds. Today, they are free citizens, tillers of the soil, businessmen, or laborers; in other words--producers and consumers. All of them compose the well-organized Greek nation, which unceasingly labors to make improvements conducive to better and more productive living.</p>
   <p>The Greek Government tries to enable each citizen to have a productive job, so profitable that he can satisfy his own and his dependents' needs, without writing to a relative in America for money. When there are profitable jobs open, then no one is unwilling to work. Everyone works. When a farmer, a mechanic, or any worker knows that he is sufficiently reimbursed for his labor or produce, he works much harder and more ambitiously.....</p>
   <p>Therefore, Greece's economic condition is based upon the production and consumption of goods. The money gained will be the livelihood of her citizens.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>It represents the education of the future Greeks, and the building of roads, public buildings, and institutions of all kinds. In general, they are then in a position to show the world of what mettle the Greeks are made.</p>
   <p>Therefore, for the sake of that mettle which we Greeks are so proud of and are forever boasting about, we in America must also work. We who today are celebrating a Greek national holiday are able and duty-bound to help--with practical patriotism--the national economy of our country. It is very easy to do so, if willingness is present. They do not want our dollars, which are only good for temporary needs. More pressing than their need for money is their need for our experience, our knowledge, our devotion, and our activity in be half of all that is Greek.</p>
   <p>Greece has a lovely climate, beautiful scenery, and historic sites. She has enough laboring hands and productive minds. One thing only does she lack: some good salesmen! She desperately needs real salesmen--untiring, brave, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>brilliant, patriotic salesmen--like Riga and Xanthos, who sold the Greek revolution to the rest of the world. These men neither quailed nor gave up hope before succeeding in arousing sympathy and aid for their country.</p>
   <p>Heroes such as they can be made the examples of Ahepa and Gapa and all the other large organizations. These societies cam become Greek salesmen, and sell Greece and her products and culture to the American people.....It is our patriotic duty to instill into our children love and respect for Greece, and to earn the respect and trust of our fellow citizens in America, who are of varied nationalities.</p>
   <p>Such a selling campaign is fraught with no difficulties. The product to be sold is first-class and a nationally-recognized brand. First to our children--if even not to our own selves--we must show that "Greek" is an appellation worthy of world-wide respect and pride. We must arouse in them enthusiasm for our country, its people, our language, our arts, and our literature. Like good <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>salesmen, we should overlook no opportunity to laud our products.</p>
   <p>It is fortunate that we do already have in our community a few such Greek salesmen. Without thought of gain they advertise, either through their papers, or lectures or speeches, everything of value that is "Greek"--from the language itself to Greek olives, from our religion to our cheeses; and from our wines to our ancient glory. Few individuals understand or appreciate the patriotic services of these men. Only when they are no longer in the community will their value be completely understood. When our Greek papers cease to exist, and our Greek scholars and Greek professional men are gone--the cohesive factors in our community--then, only, will there be a realization of the gulf that separates us from our fatherland. Then, too, will the names of Kolokotronis and Kanaris become forgotten names, and the sacrifices and heroism of our forefathers be like fables to our future generations.</p>
   <p>Additional heroes and patriots are our Greek importers. To support them is to <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>support Greece. Nearly half of each dollar we spend in their stores is destined to return to Greece. It will leave the importers' cash register and end up in the peasants' money sack. This is the only money our country asks us to give in the way of helping her economically. Such funds, and not merely charitable donations from the Greeks in America, are sought.</p>
   <p>Let us, therefore, as good salesmen, advertise and push the sale of Greek products. We can easily make the American people aware of the productivity of Greece. After they acquire a better understanding of our race, and learn to love our beautiful land, then they will willingly respect and aid our campaign. If our clubs and organizations, and all of the individuals composing them, start a systematic program of advertisement, the sale of Greek exports will increase tremendously, and Greece will be forever grateful to us.</p>
   <p>Then, too, our friends and relatives in Greece will be given the chance to better their economic situation, so that they can live at a relatively higher standard than they do now. What could we do that would be of more <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>value and of greater patriotism than that?</p>
   <p>As soon as a few more details are arranged, I think that you will hear some very good news. An ambition of the Greek community of Chicago is soon to be realized. Our beloved country is to be represented in the 1934 Chicago World's Fair. This, alone, will offer us a wonderful opportunity to exhibit Greek art, products, customs, and exports.....</p>
   <p>We can rightly say that our raisins and grapes are among the best in the world because the manufacturers of them--the sun, air, water, earth, and climate of Greece--cannot be surpassed. We can say, for the same reason, that our oils and wines, figs and fruits, and all that is raised and exported from Greece, is of exceptional value. The waters of Loutraki [famous spas and health baths], and the other pure mineral springs are the best cure for most of man's ailments. A two month sojourn in Greece relieves one of nervous disorders and unhappiness......</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>It is a matter of record that no place in Greece is more than forty miles from the sea; no place more than ten miles from mountain tops and glades; that it has one of the finest climates in the world; that during March in Peloponnesus one can find summer in Messinia, spring in Laconia, and winter in Arcadia; that Athenian statistics show that the sun shines brightly seventy-nine days a year, is clouded for one half hour an hour one hundred and fifty-seven days, that are twenty-six days of cloudiness, with two or three hours of sunshine, and that three days a year the sun does not shine.</p>
   <p>All of the above statements are true and can be verified. They are available for the use of patriotic "salesmen," who, if only they are sincere, can sell bottled Greek air to sick Americans who do not care to travel [Joke]. Only when we do start and carry on such a campaign shall we be able to make claims of patriotism. When we continually seek to advertise her products and her travel attractions, then, only, can we Greeks of the exterior be bold enough to represent ourselves as lovers of the fatherland.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>Then, and then only, will our national celebrations be worthy of their name, and yield practical results. Otherwise, they will simply be panegyric speeches, exhibitions, and incense smoke--smoke that dissolves and disappears after a few minutes.</p>
