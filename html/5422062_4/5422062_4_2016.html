   <p>In rather inconspicuous places in American newspapers we see articles saying that His Holiness, the Pope of Rome, is greatly distressed over the murder of Chancellor Dolfuss. The article states that the Pope had great respect and admiration for the murdered dictator.</p>
   <p>Now, how can the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, who is supposed to be the representative of Christ on earth, have any respect or fondness for a man who deliberately killed hundreds of innocent people? How can that leader justify his act of pinning a cross over the chest of a man who had broken every human and christian commandment? To us, this is unexplainable.</p>
   <p>However, we seem to have forgotten that Roman Catholicism believes in spiritual bondage; so, now, it no longer seems so hard to explain. It was quite natural for His Holiness, who strives to bind men's souls, to approve <span class="page-break">2</span>of and encourage a leader who sought to enslave men's individuality and suppress their freedom.</p>
