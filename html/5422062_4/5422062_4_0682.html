   <p>Because of numerous complaints made by some of our nationals who are the victims of various fraudulent bankers and agents through whom money was to be sent to Greece, we are forced to dwell on this subject and advise the Greeks of Chicago as to how they should make their remittances to foreign lands.</p>
   <p>Before we enter upon the main points of this question we must call the public's attention to the various fake bankers, brokers, agents, and profiteers who, though penniless and even up to their necks in debt, and not knowing what to do or where to go, have the insolence and the audacity to appear before the public as financiers, bankers, etc., for the purpose of exploiting the common laborer and businessman in the crudest and most <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>disgraceful manner.</p>
   <p>In order to make ourselves better understood regarding the means which such characters use to defraud the simple folk we point to the notorious swindler, Agomemnon Panagakis, as an example. In order to advertise himself as a great patriot and a prominent banker, etc., he went so far as to publish a newspaper of his own. In this manner his infernal schemes were expected to succeed. He finally managed to see his efforts bear fruit by buying out the journalistic pen and conscience, of Thomas Argyros, another notorious character. By means of the latter's fraudulent news organ, and through fraudulent advertising, the public was deceived and fooled to such an extent that hundreds of hard-working and trusting laborers in our community, flocked into Panagakis' office and entrusted him with their money which was to be remitted to parents and relatives in the homeland.</p>
   <p>Finally, however, this "prominent Greek banker" managed to run away from Chicago, go to New York, and from there to some unknown state or foreign <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>country with thousands of the Greek remitters' and investors' dollars in his suitcase. All those thousands of struggling workers and family men who happened to send their remittances through this thief's office have been left with "crossed hands" and now they are bewailing their misfortune.</p>
   <p>Besides this case, there are many other similar ones. However, we will not go into them now. We wish only to warn our people that there are many other such prowling thieves and swindlers among us who, sooner or later, will be discovered and will meet Panagakis' fate.</p>
   <p>So, in order to save our fellow countrymen from the claws of these fakers and swindlers we take this opportunity to warn them, in God's name, never to entrust their money to unknown and untrustworthy individuals. All of us know that all that is given us is a false and meaningless receipt as well as numerous false promises, followed by swearing on their "sacred honor" <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and lives that their money will reach its destination in the safest way without any loss whatever.</p>
   <p>This game is played every day. Nonetheless, hundreds of checks bounce back to the senders who, on receiving them, rush over to the offices where they were issued only to discover the reason why the checks could not be honored. The only satisfaction which is given the victims is the assurance that the check was not properly signed, that the duplicate was not issued properly, that the name was not written legibly, or that the check was sent through London, etc., etc.</p>
   <p>With such excuses and pretenses the swindlers keep other people's money for their own use for eighty or more days. In the meantime, they give the impression that they are competent bankers and honorable men. Any intelligent man can see that the people's savings are being exploited and invested while most of us who know very little about banking, investments, etc., wonder how our remittances were lost.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Imagine some small brokerage office of questionable reputation sending ten thousand dollars per week to Greece. In one month's time it will have forty thousand dollars in its vaults. By withholding that money one month it can be invested as a short term loan bringing enormous profits to the shrewd broker. But think of the misfortune that will befall the investor or remitter if the agent or so-called banker fails or cannot recover his loan. In part, this is what happened in the Panagakis case. How many of us will curse the hour we decided to trust someone else with our hard-earned money? How many will be thrown into the streets and starve?</p>
   <p>So, in order to protect our fellow countrymen from such a misfortune, from want and poverty, we suggest that they avoid impostors, defrauding brokers, and self-appointed bankers. Instead they should always make remittances to the homeland either through the reliable and trustworthy American banks or through the United States Post Office Department by means of postal <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>money orders. Of course, we would not discourage our people from sending money to Greece through the American Express Company or through several of our well-known and thoroughly trustworthy merchants, wholesalers, or importers who own and operate extensive businesses and who have much experience in transferring money from place to place.</p>
   <p>In every instance and by all means keep away from hungry false agents, "bankers", and such imposters so that you won't lose your money and regret it most bitterly afterwards--when it is too late.</p>
