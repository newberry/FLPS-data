   <p>The long-awaited twelfth convention of Ahepa [American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association] finally began on August 19 in the Sherman Hotel, Chicago. The largest ballroom was completely filled with representatives of the two hundred and fifty chapters of the organization, located all over the United States. With them came many hundreds of friends, relatives, and others desirous of seeing the great city of Chicago. Many women were present, showing that Greek women are just as convention-minded as their husbands.</p>
   <p>Peponis, President of the Chicago Committee</p>
   <p>The hard-working and popular president of the convention committee, A. Peponis, opened the convention. His Holiness the Archbishop of America, Athenagoras, blessed the assemblage. Then the Byzantine choir composed of the members of the cantors' organization, John of Damascus, and directed by its president, James Papageorge, chanted a blessing. Aiding the Archbishop in the service were His Excellency Bishop Callistos, Reverends G. Daniel Gambrilis....and Mark Petrakis....At the close of this short service Mr. Peponis welcomed the audience in behalf of the organization.</p>
   <p>Then Judge Frank Paden spoke, in place of the Mayor who was ill, about the purpose, value, and future of the Ahepa. William Henessey, representing the Chicago Chamber of Commerce, also greeted the conventioners. The Greek consul, Mr. John Giannes, spoke in Greek, saying that Ahepa has done much to make the Greeks liked by the American people.</p>
   <p>Bishop Callistos greeted the group in behalf of the clergy and the people.....He urged four things upon the young people belonging to the auxiliaries of the Ahepa, the Sons of Pericles and the Daughter of Penelope: (1) that they should attend church regularly; (2) that they should attend the catechism classes; (3) that they use the Greek language whenever possible; and (4), that Greek lessons be given, available to all members of either auxiliary.</p>
   <p>Opinions of the Archbishop</p>
   <p>The Archbishop opened his talk by saying: "Blessed are ye by the Lord. Truly, this is the worthiest way to greet the great Ahepa organization." After speaking about the encouraging progress of the Ahepa he said:</p>
   <p>"You are the eternal idealists, who reglorify the beautiful ideals of our people, and who have helped all of us, in every instance and in every expression of our lives. The time has come when the Ahepa shall lead all of our people into realization of great and lasting accomplishments."</p>
   <p>He recommended that an effort be made to secure more co-operation between Greek youths and priests, teachers and family.</p>
   
   <p>The president of the convention....addressed the assemblage.</p>
   <p>Suggestion by Mr. Papanastasiov</p>
   <p>Mr. Alexander Papanastasiov former prime minister of Greece, was the last person to deliver an address. He thanked the president for inviting him to the convention as an honored guest, and he also expressed his amazement concerning the patriotic and progressive activity of the Ahepa. He emphasized the fact that only when they are united can the Greeks reach success.....He then made a suggestion which seems to have been in the minds of many other people--that the Gapa [Greek-American Progressive Association] and Ahepa unite since the two organizations have parallel interests and aims. He also promised to study the complaints of the Greeks in America so that he might influence the Greek government to do more in the way of helping the emigrated Greeks. This last statement was joyfully received by the large audience.</p>
   <p>Election of Convention President</p>
   <p>On Tuesday afternoon the 289 representatives met to elect new officers.....Constantine Tsagadas of Detroit was chosen president....and the New York lawyer, Andren Dritsas was elected vice-president.....</p>
   <p>The man elected to head the convention is one of the most cultured and well-established Greek men in America.</p>
   <p>The convention was then ready to transact business. A. Pantelis was appointed chairman of the committee to revise the constitution of the organization.</p>
   
   <p>The various committees retired to make decisions....</p>
   <p>The rest of the conventioners heard speeches from....The well-known orator, William Chibithes, spoke for three quarters of an hour about a "New Deal" for Ahepa. Mr. Chibithes was formerly supreme president of Ahepa</p>
   <p>On Wednesday, Mr. James Sicilianos, Greek ambassador, visited the Greek community of Chicago for the first time. His first speech will be made at the Ahepa symposium. Next week we shall write the details of that affair, which will begin with a dinner. Mr. George Porikos will be chairman and A. Pantelis, toastmaster. Governor Paul McNutt of Indiana will be one of the speakers.</p>
   <p>Grand Ball and Queen</p>
   
   <p>Wednesday night the Grand Ball of the Ahepa convention was given in the Aragon Ballroom. It was attended by more than four thousand people. By 10:00 P. M. the room was congested with Greeks from all over Chicago and America. About 11:00 P. M. Mr. James Pamy announced the selection of "Miss Ahepa of 1935". She turned out to be Miss Maria Getouka of Houston, Texas....</p>
   <p>The work of the convention is going along smoothly. Some of the points under discussion are: removal of the headquarters of the Sons of Pericles to Washington, where Ahepa's central office is located; coverage of the membership by life insurance; more extensive use of the Greek language in Ahepa gatherings. Next Saturday the supreme officers will be elected....</p>
   <p>No matter what our personal wishes are, we sincerely hope some fine, capable man will receive the honor of being chosen supreme president.</p>
