   <p>Greeks who have immigrated to America and their Greek-American descendants are once more celebrating the anniversary of the Greek war of Independence of 1821. The Greek war of liberation from the Turks has been rightfully and justly characterized as the first blow against absolutism in the continent and paved the way for the self-determination of the races of Europe.</p>
   <p>The formation of the free and independent States of America had, next to the promulgation of the rights of man by the French revolution, given to the Greek heroes of 1821 an encouragement to fight on to the finish. And it was such a terrific struggle that it moved the conscience of the entire civilized world, including America. The Greeks, who have made America their home, and Chicago in particular, in celebrating their great day all over this land, will render simultaneously the homage of gratitude to the American philhellenes who contributed so generously to the renaissance of the Greek nation.</p>
