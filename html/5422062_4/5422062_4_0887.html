   <p>p.1.--In a previous issue of Proodos we published the announcement that we would try to revive our national spirit.</p>
   <p>By this we did not mean that we shall organize demonstrations with flags and drums. Nothing like that; you know that we are opposed to noise-making.</p>
   <p>What we mean, and what we pray for is that all parents who have children in school will cooperate with us in persuading the children to learn to write Greek so that they will become more interested in the language and the religion of their race and be proud of their inheritance.</p>
   
   <p>It is our opinion, and the policy of Proodos is based on this belief, that a newspaper is a paper which reports the news which is of interest to its readers.</p>
   <p>We shall therefore try to publish as far as possible the news which is of interest to our readers and to our countrymen.</p>
   <p>To assist us in reporting the news, we beg all our friends and readers to write to us, or to telephone their news since we cannot cover all the sources of interesting events nor keep a large staff of reporters.</p>
   <p>For this reason we ask all parents to induce their children to write news for Proodos.</p>
   <p>And now what is the news that we want you to write? A simple thing! Whatever happens or is about to happen which is of interest to others, is news.</p>
   
   <p>For example, three young ladies, Misses Polyxene Karamiha, Lila Kylavou, and Christina Katre, recently were guests of Mrs. Vasilike Papaconstantinou.</p>
   <p>This is one example of news; but Diamantes, who is going to school, could report very nicely the news that his sister, little spiteful Helene, has had her tonsils removed.</p>
   <p>Another item of news which might have been written for us by graceful Miss Mary Costourou, who by the way is a wonderful painter for her age, is that her mother Kleanthe Kostourou recently travelled to Birmingham, Alabama, where she was the guest of her sister-in-law, Mrs. Evangeline Costourou, spending two delightful weeks in the city where she formerly resided.</p>
   
   <p>Another news-item interesting to many people is that on last Monday Mr. Stylianos Saridakis, president of the Cretan Brotherhood of Chicago, the Reverend Erenaeos Tsourounakis, and Mr. Anthony Latinakis went to Joliet to visit their friends George Videlakis and Const. Georgoulakis and their families, returning to Chicago on the same day.</p>
   <p>That lively young member of the Kylavos family, Theodore, could report to us how he and his friend Diamond enjoyed their vacation.</p>
   <p>These are a few news-items which, as we believe, might have been reported to us by members of the younger generation, and doing this would develop in them an interest in their national language and their national religion.</p>
   
   <p>News like this is what we beg all Greeks to write to us, and everything else that is of interest to Greeks in general. Proodos will publish the names and sometimes the pictures of those who report the most interesting news and of those who best express themselves in Greek.</p>
   <p>We have used the news-items above because they fell under our own observation. We beg all Greek families to send to us news like this for publication.</p>
   <p>For instance, the families Tsirigou-Markou some time ago had as their guests, Mrs. Euphrosyne P. Stamatopoulou and her daughter Mrs. Mary Theodore of Detroit and also that charming and talented musician, little Fofo I. Theodore.</p>
   <p>Some one in these families, preferably a child attending school, might have written this news-item and mailed it to us if it was inconvenient to telephone it.</p>
   
   <p>And this is the way in which it should have been written, in social-note form:</p>
   <p>"We are entertaining our Aunt So-and-so and our Cousin So-and-so of Detroit. They will stay for a week or so, etc.</p>
   <p>Sign it and mail it for publication.</p>
   <p>How do you like that? At least we can try this scheme to see how it works out. Now you will be able to write like the other Greek newspapermen (Kalamarades), who are all so rich that they sail on seas of gold.</p>
   <p>Here is one news-item which charming Miss Stella, daughter of our friend Angelos Manolis, might have written to us; namely, an account of the marriage of Mr. George Lykos, from Verzova, to Miss Erasmia Kanellopoulou, from Meligala Messinia. Stella would have added that the best man was Mr. John Giannakakis, also from Verzova, and that the bridesmaids were Misses Giannoula, Dina, and Panagiota Kaloyanne.</p>
   
   <p>Another news-item which might have been sent to us is the account of the outing on Mr. Vereme's farm sponsored by our friend Apostolos Panoutsieres, a Greek dealer in fruits and vegetables.</p>
   <p>On the morning of July 4 five or six families were loaded on the company's trucks and in passenger cars with plenty of provisions for the day and arrived early at Mr. Vereme's breezy, cool farm, where they enjoyed a perfect family outing, played various games, and came back late at night.</p>
   <p>This outing was to celebrate the name-day of the host, our friend Apostolos, and we take pleasure in reporting it and in printing the names of those who participated in this fine picnic.</p>
   
   <p>These were Angelos Papaconstantinou, who was best man at Apostolos's wedding, Angelos's wife, Mrs. Vasilikes Papaconstantinou, Mr. and Mrs. Demetrios Karamihas and their daughter Stamatine or Stella, Mr. and Mrs. P. Zavos, Mr. and Mrs. James Lalagos, Mrs. Lalagos's sister, Miss Anna Tramba, Mrs. Kylavou and her daughters Koula and Lila, Mr. and Mrs. Demetrios Karafotes of Rockford and their lively children, Mr. Const. Katres, Mr. Bill the Italian, and others of whose names we regret to say that we have no record.</p>
   <p>All these people enjoyed a wonderful time and did not fail to inspect Mr. Vereme's wine-cellar!</p>
