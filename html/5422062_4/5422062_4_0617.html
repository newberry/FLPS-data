   <p>As announced last Sunday, July 29, a general meeting of the members of Holy Trinity Church was held in the Socrates School of the parish.</p>
   <p>After many charges and much recrimination (characteristic of Greek meetings in Chicago), the new constitution of the parish, which affords the parishioners a number of benefits, including insurance, was adopted.</p>
   <p>In its report the auditing committee stated that the former president, Mr. Nick Palyvos, was withholding from the church treasury the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars in collections which were made some time ago, and which he had neglected to turn in. Mr. Palyvos publicly admitted this fact, and promised to pay the money to the treasury.</p>
   <p>The most interesting subject, and the one which caused the most dissension <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the meeting, was the appointment of Mr. George Drossos as principal of the Socrates School. This matter, which had split the board of trustees into two factions, was solved by the members, who ratified the appointment. Five of the members of the board of trustees who opposed this appointment tendered their resignations to the meeting, and Attorney Demetrios Geroules, Kyriakos Psalidas, and P. Koutsopanagos were elected to take their places.</p>
   <p>The secretary, Dr. George Karaflos, who presided over the meeting during the voting on the new constitution and the disputes about the appointment of Mr. Drossos, was questioned concerning the resignation of the members of the board of trustees. He declared that they were troublemakers and had always hindered the welfare and progress of the community, so that their withdrawal was a happy event for the church and would aid the progress of the parish.</p>
   <p>Dr. Karaflos also declared that the present directors of the affairs of Holy Trinity Parish are determined to clear up conditions and prevent a repetition of past agitations. Attorney Demetrios Petropoulos, one of the directors who withdrew, later explained to us his reason for resigning after Mr. Drossos' <span class="page-break">\3</span>appointment as principal of the Socrates School. Mr. Petropoulos said that he had learned that the secretary, Dr. Karaflos, had intimidated directors opposed to the appointment of Mr. Drossos, and had thus effected the appointment. When asked about the new constitution, he stated that he had not been present when it was adopted. Upon being questioned about the shortage of former President Palyvos, Mr. Petropoulos informed us that last January he learned that Mr. Kanneles, who was then treasurer, had allowed President Palyvos to keep six hundred and fifty dollars out of the parish treasury against the orders of the board of directors, in order that out-standing bonds of the parish might be redeemed. He added that it was the revelations made by former Secretary Gallios concerning this shortage that led to the tragi-comic encounter of Palyvos versus Gallios. This scene took place in the International Restaurant, operated by Mr. Andrew Spyropoulos, and during the skirmish a hot plate of beans was broken on Mr. Gallios' head.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petropoulos was asked whether he had known about this matter at the time of the general meeting when Mr. Palyvos and others assailed Mr. George Kokinis for criticizing the way the affairs of the church were handled. He replied <span class="page-break">\4</span>that he did not know about it at that time, but that he had learned of it afterwards, when he had been elected to the board of directors. He said that he was sure that Mr. Kanneles, the current president, Mr. Palyvos, and the special secretary knew then that the money was missing, and that this was the reason they tried to avoid any audit of the books or examination of the affairs of the parish at that time.</p>
