   <p>The extortion and intimidation which was domineering certain other trades, until now, appeared amongst the Shoe Repairers and Shoe Shiners of Chicago "who are mostly Greeks". The first bomb was thrown into the store at 1500 E. 53rd Street, situated in the center of the aristocratic Hyde Park district. The authorities learned that a Greek named K. Staurakas, president of the Shoe Shiners' Association, visited John Pirparos in his shoe-shining store, at 1612 East 53rd Street to collect $20.00 dues, overdue. Pirparos refused to pay on the ground that he did not get protection from the Association. Pirparos informed Staurakas that the Association did not stop the opening of a new store situated a block from his store.</p>
   <p>Both Staurakas and Pirparos visited Chialtas, the newcomer, in his unopened store and threatened to bomb his shop if he dared to open. The bombing of his store, the same night, was the answer to his refusal. Pirparos is under arrest, and Staurakas is a fugitive of the law.</p>
