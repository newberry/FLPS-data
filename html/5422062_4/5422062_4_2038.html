   <p>During the past ten or twenty years America had been enjoying a period of prosperity. As a result, everything that did not have a monetary value was ignored by the majority of the people in America. Mammon became the God, and he was extremely loved; for, after all, look what could be done with money. The ego of the entire nation was rooted in the material aspects of life. And we Greeks, influenced by our environment and bitten by the desire for wealth and display, acquired the same point of view. We became the victims of our own delusions by thinking we could all become millionaires without making great sacrifices.</p>
   <p>This mental process was unconsciously transferred and applied to our daily social life. Our subconscious mind produced such illusions as this: If the city of Chicago can build great, new skyscrapers, why shouldn't the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Greeks of Chicago buy expensive pieces of real estate, erect large and costly churches and schools, and so exhibit their wealth, power, and ability? .....but we did not count upon meeting all the pitfalls that such undertakings always present to the unwary; so the land has remained bare, or practically bare--with perhaps a few poor excuses for buildings having been erected upon it. And even at that time most of our churches were, and still are, mortgaged to the hilt.</p>
   <p>By a series of sleight of hand tricks, we have succeeded in maintaining our churches. All their problems have been consigned to the care of the Almighty God. During certain exceptional periods, we have even succeeded in erasing a portion of the debts which burden our churches. Even these payments have not helped the combined churches; for no matter how much may have been done for one, an examination of the amassed debts of all the Greek churches in Chicago is terrifying in its revelations. This condition cannot be remedied as long as the present system and practices are continued. The only <span class="page-break">\3</span>cure for our anemic and broken-down parishes is to unite them all into one undivided parish. This coalescence into one parish can be effected immedi-ately, since Chicago is soon to be the scene of the Greek Orthodox clergymen's and laymen's convention.</p>
   <p>We would have our readers recall that many years ago the representatives of the various Greek churches approved such a unification; but left its development to the Reverend Bishop Callistos. Although it seemed for a moment that the seemingly impossible had finally been accomplished, our hopes were again doomed to defeat. The Bishop turned the proposal over to a committee of five men, who were supposed to work out the details of the plan. The result was that, due to the incapability, indifference, and inactivity of the committee, the matter remained in its embryonic stage.</p>
   <p>This failure was due, however, to the administration of the idea, and not to rejection of the idea itself. This unification can be accomplished now, when <span class="page-break">\4</span>everyone is in favor of it. The problem should be presented upon the floor of the convention now while its solution is possible. We can learn from the mistakes of the past, and profit from them by completing our plans this time. The psychological moment is at hand. If the signal is given we will all follow eagerly.</p>
