   <p>The Regas Ferreos National Amateur Club, with the co-operation of the Greek-American Mandolin Orchestra, gave a benefit performance yesterday. The proceeds are to be sent to Greece to alleviate the suffering of our wounded soldiers of the Second Balkan War, between Greece and Bulgaria. A very stirring, patriotic drama, entitled "Esme, the Turkish Girl," was presented. We were pleased to see that a great number of our people supported this cause by attending the performance at Hull House.</p>
   <p>We should mention that the Tanias Society of Saint George voted to give five hundred dollars to the fund for the wounded soldiers in the homeland. The excellent and admirable Manthyrea Society also voted to appropriate five hundred dollars for the benefit of our gallant wounded soldiers.</p>
