   <p>Undoubtedly some of the Greeks of Chicago follow American habits and customs letter for letter. Unfortunately they follow the bad customs instead of the good ones, which are numerous and far superior to those of any other nationality.</p>
   <p>We know as a matter of fact that the majority of the foreigners in this country, when they begin to learn English, first pick up the foul words of the language, and so the Greeks of the West Side, or at least a group of them (fruit-dealers) before beginning to open their eyes in the rebirth of Americanization, have adopted lynch law, the barbarous custom of the South. Of course the law of initiation has a great effect upon intelligent and non-intelligent alike.</p>
   
   <p>A couple of weeks ago an ignorant Greek fruit-peddler beat an urchin for stealing his fruit. The youthful hoodlum cried and accused the Greek of beating him without cause. An infuriated mob surrounded the Greek with cries of "Lynch him! Lynch him!" and gave him a terrible beating. If the law of the land had not intervened, the ignorant Greek would have been a spirit by this time. So it was that the friends of the abused Greek learned about lynching the custom of the South. Last Saturday, they were treating a certain Miller, the leader of the previous attempt at lynching, a la South, they were scattered by the riot squad fifteen strong, which had responded to the frenzied calls of Miller's friends that the Greeks were on the war-path.</p>
   
   <p>Editor's Note:</p>
   <p>It is an utter shame that we should resort to things of this kind. Those Greeks who participated in that unpleasnat affair should bear in mind that they will get justice when they apply to any American Court. Intelligent, civilized people never take the law in their hands, in opposition and contempt of the law of the land. Only fanatics and their blood-relations, semi-barbarians resort to lynch law.</p>
   <p>In our next issue we shall write more extensively of this Southern tradition.</p>
