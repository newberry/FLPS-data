   <p>Dear Fellow-patriots: All the various sections of Greece are represented in Chicago by various Clubs; such as the Ipirotes, Islanders, and the Steriolladitons. Only one group so far has had no organization--the Cretans. This condition has been strongly felt by the Cretans; and finally, last week, they held a meeting for the purpose of organizing a benevolent and patriotic society. It was decided to call it "The Cretan Brotherhood Of Chicago".</p>
   <p>The purpose of the society would be charitable, and the Club would also provide medical aid and make arrangements for burial of its members. All Cretans are urged to join this so anxiously awaited organization; for by doing so they are aiding both themselves and their beloved Crete.</p>
