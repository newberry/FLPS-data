   <p>The philanthropic Greek Ladies' Association of Chicago, which since its establishment six years ago, has functioned so effectively among our needy Greek families in Chicago and has established a reputation all over the country, will hold a grand Bazaar to increase its funds. For this reason it appeals to the Greek Ladies all over the United States to send in any embroidery work which they would like to offer.</p>
   <p>The article and the name of the sender will be published in the Greek press, and our archives will keep record of all persons contributing to the philanthropic cause.</p>
   <p>Mrs. J. Refakes, Pres.</p>
