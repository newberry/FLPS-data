   <p>p. 1.- As we wrote last week, there is a society in our midst that loves to tell little white lies. This society has the honor to be called the Panhellenic Union. Everyone hoped for great things when this society was organized, but so far it has done absolutely nothing. Mr. Manousopoulus has forgotten the promises he made and the vows he took.</p>
   <p>We should not regard him in the light of a vallain, though, because he killed neither our fathers nor our mothers, nor has he caused any harm, except to fail to live up to our expectations. We cannot blame the man if the job proved too big for him to cope with.</p>

   <p>The Panhellenic Union has tried to rule the Hellenism of the United States, but it has failed. For four years they have been trying to become organized but there has been no progress made. We are sorry to have to say these things because we hoped to have the Panhellenic Union grow into a large and powerful organization. It still is not too late!</p>
