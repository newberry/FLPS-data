   <p>May we call to the attention of the Greek people of Chicago the new appeal of the Macedonian Relief Committee? The purpose of this committee is to collect funds and supplies for the victims and sufferers in Macedonia, Greece.</p>
   <p>The presidents and responsible leaders of our organizations, clubs, and church parishes in Chicago and in all other communities in the United States are urged to do their part, and to undertake the patriotic action of organizing local committees for the collection of relief funds. It is the duty of all true Greeks, whose hearts are inspired by altruistic sentiments and sympathy for our suffering brothers in Greece, to show that we have not forgotten our fatherland and that we are thinking of it in its difficulties and trials.</p>
   <p>The Star, an active supporter of this drive for relief funds, recommends that all the church committees, especially those whose task it is to care for the poor, undertake to collect maoney by passing an extra collection basket on Sundays and on every important feast day or holiday. This money will be used to provide food, clothing, shelter, and medical treatment for the unfortunate Greeks of Macedonia.</p>
