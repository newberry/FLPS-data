   <p>Greek-Americans of Chicago, last Monday evening set up a high mark for every other national group, large or small, to shoot at.</p>
   <p>Jamming the huge Aragon ballroom until not another dancer could find room, thronging the mezzanines, standing packed together in the boxes overlooking the main floor, applauding again and again as Greek-Americans danced and played and sang, Chicagoans showed the sponsors of this first program that Chicago is proud of the citizens of foreign birth or extraction who have made the city great.</p>
   <p>This gala event was given under the auspices of the Chicago Daily News for the benefit of the unemployed, and Mr. Paul Demos was chairman of the Program committee.</p>

   <p>Our own Mr. Andrew Karzas once again displayed his good will and cooperation in the things that are worth while. He generously contributed his Aragon Ballroom, the music and his personal efforts which were a great contribution toward making the event a success.</p>
   <p>If any one had wondered how Chicagoans in general would react to an actual carnival of nations, that doubt was set at rest by the ovation given the Greek-American sponsors of the show at the Aragon. From the moment when, long before 8:P.M. the scheduled opening hour, crowds gathered outside the doors, until long after midnight the orchestra played "Home Sweet Home," the program was vivid and varied and constantly entertaining, and the crowd grew and grew until Andrew Karzas, who donated the hall and the two orchestras as his contribution to the</p>

   <p>Greek-American program, said he never had seen as great a crowd in the Aragon, which is famous for its crowds.</p>
   <p>Miss Europe, Aliki Diplarakou, danced gracefully, slowly, to Wayne King's orchestra. Thousands stood silent, watching her, studying the slim, graceful girl in long Greecian robes who was chosen last year as "the most beautiful girl in all Europe."</p>
   <p>Then there was dancing, first to Wayne King's music, then to the music of Ted Weem's famous orchestra. Then Greek girls from St. Constantine's school danced again with Miss Diplarakou, then there were songs, musical trios, more dancing and more solos.</p>
   <p>The crowd kept growing. Greek-Americans in evening clothes, Greek-Americans who had come straight from work because they did not want to miss so fine a program, people of every national background, were there to see and applaud.</p>
