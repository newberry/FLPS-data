   <p>The Chicago Greek Ladies Society, last Sunday, in the presence of Consul General Dr. N. Salopoulos, the Greek press, professional men and the flower of the Greek community here, gave an account of funds they collected for the widows and orphans of our departed volunteers, reserves and recruits. $16,500 was the total sum collected, and no expenses were entailed.</p>
   <p>The ladies who have worked so enthusiastically and energetically are congratulated and we publicly express our deep respect and esteem for their patriotic deed. Photographs of the ladies will be published in our next issue.</p>
