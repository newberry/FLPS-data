   <p>We have noticed a very queer thing about the Greek organizations in America. If you try to unite them for a worthy purpose they immediately become hostile and have nothing to do with one another. But try to say something unpleasant about one of them! Every single organization, large and small, will unite to fight the common foe. This shows that the Greek is uneducated - he has not been brought up properly. Some people tell us it is because of the hot climate he was born in. The climate has nothing to do with it! We are to blame.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of today have forgotten who their ancestors were. They are quarrelsome, argumentative, boorish, uneducated. They are being led by the nose by a commercialized clergy.</p>

   <p>If a priest told the Greek people that an elaborate coffee-house for loafers and idlers was needed, they would band together and produce a colossal institution. On the other hand - if a newly established organization asked for a little support and cooperation, nothing would be given. The clergy oppose organizations of any kind because they are afraid their power and influence will be taken away.</p>
   <p>....And that is just what we need! we need a powerful organization to put the clergy where it belongs. We have been robbed and kept in ignorance long enough. But can we establish such an organization here? Can the Greeks get together and cooperate with one another until our Greek organization grows strong and powerful? The priest will put up a big fuss but we must ignore them if we are going to be successful.</p>
   <p>Can we do it, fellow Greeks? Can we break the chains that bind us to ignorance? Can we become a progressive, cultural people? Yes! All we need is a strong Greek organization.</p>
