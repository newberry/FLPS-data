   <p>Correspondence of Mr. P. S. Lambros, Dec. 31, 1908, 130 N. Wells St.,</p>
   <p>Hon. Guido Sabetta, Italian Consul,</p>
   <p>Masonic Temple, City.</p>
   <p>Honorable Sir:</p>
   <p>We beg to inform you that the Greeks of Chicago are grieving for the great catastrophe which has stricken your fatherland, and upon the pathetic event, we beg to express to you the sympathy of our countrymen as one body.</p>
   <p>In looking over history, we notice that the relationship between Italy and Greece has always been brotherly, and this is clearly demonstrated by the mutual friendship which binds the two nations at the present time.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we thought it was our duty besides the expression of our sympathy, to start a contribution in behalf of the sufferers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>An appeal was made to that effect in the editorial columns of the Greek Star, and the contribution collected by our paper up to 3: p. m. today, amounted to $185.50. In order to give an opportunity to all our countrymen to contribute, we have extended the time until the next issue of the paper, which will be next Friday, when the entire amount collected will be forwarded to your honor.</p>
   <p>Hoping that the contribution of our countrymen will reach a satisfactory amount, and hoping you will kindly accept the same as a token of our deepest sympathy, we beg to remain.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>The Greek Star,</p>
   <p>For: Peter S. Lambros,</p>
   <p>Proprietor and Editor.</p>
