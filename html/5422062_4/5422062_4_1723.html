   <p>Our communal affairs are in a state of quietness at present.</p>
   <p>Following the successful theatrical presentation given for the school, and the beautiful speech of Mr. Sikelianos, which refreshed our memory with ancient days of glory and grandeur, there is nothing worth while referring to, from a communal or social point of view, in our community.</p>
   <p>Christmas and New Year's holidays are being celebrated without any excitement, and the Epiphany holiday will be over within the week also.</p>
   <p>We ask our old calendar nationals to excuse us because we forget to mention soon that this coming Saturday they celebrate their Christmas, and so we shall have the opportunity to celebrate Christmas over again.</p>
   <p>Just exactly next Saturday the holidays of the new calendarites, with the St. John's feast, come to an end in order to have the festivities of the old calendarites begin with Christmas.</p>
   
   <p>Despite the fact that at we are followers of a new calendar, does not mean that we have severed relations with our good nationals that still adhere to the old.</p>
   <p>This question, on the other hand, we confess, is out of our jurisdiction and its solution is above our powers. Necessarily we accept it as the circumstances dictate hoping its solution would come with that of the Ecclesiastic one.</p>
