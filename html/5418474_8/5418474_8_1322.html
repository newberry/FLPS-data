   <p>Milwaukee, August 3rd, - At the convention of gymnastic instructors of the North American Turner Bund, the National Revision Committee, submitted their report, in which is recommended to replace the long gray pants, which are now worn by the "Turner's" in the whole country, with knee length breeches, black stockings and shoes. Long, not yet ended debates came up about the question, how far an approach should be made by the Turners, towards the system of the American games and the American customs in general.</p>
   <p>A committee, consisting of the instructors Suder and Greiner of Chicago, Fleck (Milwaukee) Kindervater (St. Louis) and Pertuch (Philadelphia) was nominated, to devise a plan for free popular exercises and a better marking system. The report of this Committee shall be presented, at the next National Conference in San Francisco.</p>
