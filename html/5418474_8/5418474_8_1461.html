   <p>"Fellow Citizens!</p>
   <p>"The Turnhalle (Turner Hall) on North Clark Street, center of German activity, pride of the progressive liberal-minded element of the city, our building and all it stands for, may be lost to us.</p>
   <p>"The members of the Turngemeinde (Turner Association) worked zealously and successfully for years to preserve the building in the interests of Chicago's Germans. But now the Association is unable to continue without the help of the people. The Chicago Turngemeinde needs twenty to thirty thousand dollars to pay the mortgage and debts.</p>
   <p>"We are appending the plan adopted at a general meeting.</p>
   <p>"The sum seems large but can be easily raised, if everybody does his share.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>May everyone who reads these lines remember that the Turnhalle is an institution which benefits all Germans, as well as the people in general.</p>
   <p>"The residents of the north side in particular should consider the fact that, in rebuilding the Turnhalle after the Chicago Fire, real estate values in that district rose considerably.</p>
   <p>"The Germans raised $37,000 six years ago, at a time when Chicago was a smoldering ruin and, let it not be forgotten, this money will be wasted unless everyone contributes his mite. Let us not abuse the confidence Turner G. Freygang of New York had in us when, years ago, he contributed $20,000 without security, to finish our building. All should give now, and emulate a good example!</p>
   <p>"Committees will be appointed to call on citizens. we ask you to receive these delegates in a manner befitting men who work unselfishly in the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>interests of the people and to maintain the prestige of the Germans in Chicago!"</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Publicity Committee</p>
   <p>Adolph Schoeninger, president;</p>
   <p>A. Boese, secretary;</p>
   <p>H. J. Christoph, treasurer.</p>
