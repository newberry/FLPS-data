   <p>About six weeks ago this new Dental College was founded with 14 students. It has already expanded to such an extent, however, that the directors plan to enlarge the institution and to equip and furnish the whole building instead of only the first story and basement. The directors of the institution stand squarely upon the regulations of the State Board, thereby insuring official recognition for the college. Because of this fact, the speedy and sound development has taken place. The student is required to study not less than three terms, two at the Junior-Class, and one at the Senior, before he is permitted to take the examination.</p>
   <p>A certificate must accompany the application of the student for the Junior Class, stating that the applicant possesses the necessary preliminary knowledge, which is required of pupils desiring to attend the American High Schools.</p>
   <p>The applicants for the Senior Class must furnish evidence that he has studied successfully for two years at a University or College, here or elsewhere, and must also furnish testimony in regard to good behavior.</p>
