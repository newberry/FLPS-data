   <p>Last night the members of the Northside Turner Hall had a carnival and picture show. Every ticket was sold; every seat taken; Prince Carnival's Parade was grand; costumes were beautiful. The scenes of Luther(s life in Wartburg were very touching.</p>
   <p>All kinds of small stage shows-wine-women and song, etc. Barnum's Circus was there on a small scale.</p>
   <p>At last came the ball which continued to early morning. Having enjoyed a very splendid evening, everybody went home happy.</p>
