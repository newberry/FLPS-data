   <p>Yesterday's business session of the Chicago Gymnastic Association was followed by a bit of scientific entertainment in the form of a lecture by Dr. Max Schmidhofer, professor at Jenner Medical College who was introduced by Ernst Kusswurm, first speaker of the Association. Dr. Schmidhofer, using everyday language that could be understood by all, gave a lecture on the Roentgen or "X" Rays, their discovery, nature, and effect. His lecture, during which he demonstrated the rays, was well liked by the large audience.</p>
