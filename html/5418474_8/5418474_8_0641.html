   <p>Yesterday we had the pleasure to again find among our exchange journals the Illinois Staats Zeitung. It was dated October 18, and was, as the head of the front page indicated, "after the destruction of Chicago, No.8." From this we gather that though in the night from Sunday to Monday, type, presses, and editorial offices had been destroyed, and the personnel had been dispersed into all directions - only forty-eight hours later, on the following Wednesday, the paper again began to appear regularly though in somewhat reduced size. That the paper for the time being is being printed in (the ninety miles distant) Milwaukee, while it is being written in Chicago, only adds to the difficulty.</p>
   <p>The spirit of enterprise and activity of Chicago already had a reputation all over the country - now it is going to become proverbial. And we are glad indeed to be able to report that the German-Americans in this respect have in no way remained behind the Anglo-Americans.</p>
