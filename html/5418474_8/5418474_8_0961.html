   <p>The German Press Club of Chicago sponsored an evening of interesting lectures and entertainments. The committee succeeded in obtaining the well known German-American, Dr. Pedro Ilgon; furthermore several other artists were offering some musical numbers in a very gracious manner, therefore the audience enjoyed several real pleasant hours.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ilgon prepared for his lecture the theme "An American Optimist", whom he explained to the audience in his own original way. He spoke in an exceedingly interesting style about Walt Whitman, that original naturalist, who loved nature beyond any thing else. Who listened to nature's life and movements, its breath and pulsation; he praised in him the poet, who called all men, either the high or the low, the free or the slave, the progressive or the backward, the misunderstood and relegate, the poor and disowned, and with a great understanding even the criminal, his brothers. The speaker attempted to reveal to his audience in a most beautiful way, the characteristics of this high priest of optimism.</p>
