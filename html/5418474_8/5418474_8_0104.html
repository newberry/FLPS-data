   <p>The picnic given by the workers of Zangerle and Company to bolster the treasury of the mutual sick benefit fund proved to be a very successful affair.</p>
   <p>At ten o'clock in the morning, the morning, the employees of the company met at the factory and formed into a parade, headed by four policemen; then followed the musicians, the leader and his adjutants, the flag-bearer, and the workingmen in groups: apprentices, designers, machinists, wood turners, wood carvers, carpenters, and finally the office force and executives. The parade started at the factory and, in a somewhat roundabout way, reached Clybourn Avenue; from there the assembly marched on Larrabee, Division, and Sedgwick Streets to the destination, Ogden's grove, where the picnic was held.</p>
   <p>The parade was similar to last year's,but a noticeable improvement was apparent. The banner, made of shavings from the various woods used at the factory, was more artistic; a float, drawn by four large horses, served to display some of the company's products--altogether a neat arrangement. The company employs many more people since the factory was enlarged.</p>
   <p>After reaching the grove, the leader once more inspected the ranks, then thanked the assembly for its attendance. Eating and drinking were next in order, and the crowd had a good time....</p>
   <p>Later in the afternoon, Joseph Rudolph was asked to give the festival speech and he addressed the crowd as follows:</p>
   <p>"Friends and fellow workers: As you have asked me to say a few words, I shall comply. To you, my fellow workers, I need not give encomiums, nor need I encourage you to continue in your philanthropic endeavors; but there are our friends--so well represented here--who, in a measure, have assisted our cause; to them a little explanation about our efforts may be in order.</p>
   <p>"Summing up the last twelve months, I must declare that we have had a year of misfortune. Nearly every week, someone has been on the sick list. Last year we asked for donations to help the people in the South who suffered from yellow fever, and we also gave money from our regular fund. A poor fellow, who had come from Europe only shortly before, worked at the factory. He fell sick and died. We not only provided the best of care at the Alexian Brothers Hospital, but we gave him a decent burial and sent money to his impoverished family abroad. Aside from the usual cases of sickness, which in one instance lasted eleven weeks, we recorded several accidents--injuries incurred while operating machinery--and we regret that even today our sick list shows no blank pages, and, for this reason, one of our fellow workers cannot enjoy the outing today.</p>
   <p>"We have been able to give this help, and could even have provided additional aid if the occasion had warranted it, yet the demands on each member of our fraternity were but small. But let us hope that next year will be better, and let us not mar the pleasures of today by thinking of the sorrows of the past--after all, we gave gladly, and what we provided was appreciated, and it helped. Everyone seemed to believe in the proverb: 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'</p>
   <p>"We have done our duty and have helped our fellow members as well as we could; that, in itself, is a source of satisfaction, so let us begin the festival of the second year by adhering to our principles of brotherly love, and let us remember the experiences of the past two years, that we may be even more successful in our future endeavors.</p>
   <p>"As you know, we proudly proclaim today that our achievements were realized only by unity and by honest co-operation.</p>
   <p>"We, the workers of one factory, regard each other as brothers. The misfortune which any one of us experiences affects all of us, and we try to help our fellow workers to the best of our ability.</p>
   <p>"We are not united by relationship, are not joined by creed, nor bound by oath exacted by some secret order; we act because we believe in helping a fellow member, and we intend to follow this principle in the future. I believe that we have thus realized at least one phase of true social progress.</p>
   <p>"It is not my intention to spread socialist propaganda, nor was the festival arranged for that purpose, but, since we regard our efforts as a part of socialist progress, you will pardon me if I make a few remarks about the aims and trends of socialism as manifested at present. I understand socialism, in its final analysis, to mean the mental and material welfare of everyone.</p>
   <p>"However, it appears to me that speakers on socialism stress material issues too much; money matters are given excessive prominence, while education--mental independence--is relegated to the background. The reverse course should be adopted. Without mental work--without knowledge--progress is hardly possible in our progressive age, since 'knowledge is power,' and this power of knowledge must become common property. Before this is attained, one can never hope for independence. Therefore, our political demands involving social betterment should include the demand that the state do its duty by the people by providing higher institutions of learning, particularly polytechnical schools, to enable even the poorest persons to obtain a proper education in the same manner as the wealthy, who now attend private institutions. However, it will not be sufficient, from the social standpoint, merely to provide education without regard to human sentiment, because a person endowed with certain qualifications which enable him to excel others will, because of inborn selfishness, soon use his talents for his sole advantage, irrespective of others, unless he has learned to consider the rights of his fellow citizens and to recognize that his gifts are but natural blessings--a loan--and that it is his duty to use his ability for the benefit of all--and that he will find contentment in so doing.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, it must be our goal to develop mind and heart simultaneously. And you will find that only those co-operative enterprises will be successful which are based on proven principles and good fellowship. But even these successful associations result in the betterment of only a few and, as far as people in general are concerned, they are still confronted by privilege and monopoly.</p>
   <p>"But as true socialism considers humanity as a whole, and as we believe that mankind can attain a higher level only by stressing a broader education, involving the mind as well as sentiment, we, who represent but a small number with limited means, shall endeavor at least to develop humane attitudes. Our activities are limited, and we know that our intentions represent nothing new, nor are we enabled to bring to materialization the longed-for millenium, but we shall not remain idly on the side lines in this great struggle for the welfare of humanity. Therefore let us subscribe to the motto: Unity and Fraternity!"</p>
   
   <p>Great applause followed.....The crowd increased considerably toward evening....music and dancing lasted until late at night.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the proceeds of the picnic will help considerably to increase the sick benefit fund of the club, and that similar benevolent labor organizations will be organized as a result of the festival.</p>
