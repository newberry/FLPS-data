   <p>Dr. Heinrich Banga last night in Fullerton Hall, at the Art Institute, before the Germanistic Society, opposed the idea of the Germans giving up their Gothic type of letters for the Latin. This lecture was inspired by the discussion of a new edition of a well-known medical book in a German medical paper. It was regretted that the book was printed in Gothic letters, and that it could have a larger distribution if printed in Latin letters. One of the principal points of the discussion was that, through the acceptance of the Latin letters, the learning of the German language would be facilitated for foreign elements. This, however, Dr. Banga said, was wrong as the letters were phonetic symbols. For the same reason the Japanese would refuse to adopt the Latin letters as it would greatly affect the pronunciation of the language. The speaker accused the German scientists as traitors to the national language. It is important that all Germans cooperate in maintaining the natural character of their language, which is an inherited legacy from their forefathers and must not be laid open to attack by foreign elements.</p>
