   <p>The report read in the semi-annually general meeting yesterday of the Gymnastic Club "Vorwaerts" showed she pleasing fact, that the agitation and working of the Club has been successful in every respect. The financial position is very satisfactory. The Treasury of the Club has grown to $13,839.50 of which the Fair just held brought $6,200.00. The idea of building their own hall may thus be realized.</p>
   <p>Membership has increased by 20 persons and amounts now to 500; also the number of gymnastic pupils has increased. Five hundred and four pupil are now distributed among 7 classes with 32 sub-divisions and are taughs by the gymnastic teachers A. E. Kindervater and Henry Eggert. The Singing and fencing section show satisfactory results also. The drum chorus is a valuable asset for the club.</p>
   <p>An absolute vote confidence was given with the re-election of officers and all previous officers who managed the affairs of the club so well have been reelected.</p>
