   <p>A very interesting lecture on Germany's early participation America's development was given to the Germanistic Society by Professor Camillo von Klentze at the Fullerton Hall in the Art Institute last night.</p>
   <p>Already in the 17th century, Germany like all other European countries showed a growing interest in the young American continent. This early interest found its reflection in German literature and even in German theater plays. It prepared the ground for the full hearted cooperation, which the first contingents of German immigrants gave to this country in all colonization problems. The quick rise of the United States would have been impossible without German culture, German perseverance as work in the field and factory and German enterprising intelligence.</p>
