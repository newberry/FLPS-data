   <p>Prof. Otto Peterson, who has made a for himself as a Goethe scholar, and who is one of the most prominent members of the Goethe society, spoke yesterday in the Atlantic Kotel, before a large attendance, invited by the German-American Historic Society of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Born in the time honored university city of Dorppat, Dr. Peterson, after finishing his studies, was for many years active as a pedagogue at German schools in St. Petersburg, and during and after the war became the manager of the refugees in Berlin, where he, through his self-sacrificing activity, gained the appreciation of the German and foreign governments.</p>
   <p>As a poet and scholar, he is favorably known, far beyond the borders of Germany. Especially through his exploration of "Theophilos," the first source, of the original Faust, did he make a name for himself. Furthermore science thanks him for discovery of "Mimus," the original source of religious and dramatic forms of expression in Eastern Europe. Also in the sphere of stage literature, he appeared with several works.</p>

   <p>Prof. Jul. Goebel of the University of Illinois presented it to the audience and in a few words introduced the theme. Mr. Peterson, through the modesty of his manner conquered the hearts of his listeners. He spoke with great warmth of broken down Germany, where at present the call for reconstruction has been sounded, the call which in the economically and financially rich America and in other countries, has found an answer.</p>
   <p>He spoke of the problems of political, economic, scientific, and artistic nature which must be solved. Until now, he said, we have thought only of financial and technical problems, which were to be solved, but the world needs a spiritual reform. The main condition to the world of the state and individual, is the spirit which creates the body.</p>
   <p>Then the speaker gave a picture of Goethe's philosophy of life, which culminates in the expression to look for God in nature and for nature in God. He touched upon the two questions which for forced the theme of his lecture: "Which spiritual connections unite Goethe with America? and "Where and how has the spirituality of Goethe any connection with the American soul and its world philosophy"</p>
   <p>Among other things he pointed out that the characteristic picture of Goethe <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in the middle of the sixties and seventies was strongly distorted in the public mind because of the matter of his love for Frederika Erinn, the daughter of the pastor in Sesenheim.</p>
   <p>A contemporary critic of Goethe's day said of him: "If a genius is not ruled by the same laws that govern common mortals, the genius produces immortality. Professor Peterson pointed out that Goethe's life should not be considered from the point of view of any of its separate phases, but in its entirety, "because the young Goethe, the Goethe of the period of storm and stress, the Minister of State Goethe, the naturalist Goethe - all were but steps in the development of the true Goethe."</p>
   <p>In regard to the women who played much a prominent part in Goethe's life, Dr. Peterson proved that his relations with them were only idealistic, what he, as the American, Bancroft, expresses it, "revealed to the women, the magnificence and the most wonderful part of his self."</p>
   <p>In the year 1881 in New York, Goethe's correspondence with his mother appeared in English and contributed a great deal to the better understanding of Goethe. The 20th century sees in Goethe something different than the 19th did. The <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>everlasting value of his thoughts has increased in depth while everything temporal has lost in importance.</p>
   <p>The speaker now turned to Goethe's realtions with America. He pointed out that young Americans as was the habit at that time studying at the University of Goettingen, through a visit to Weimar came into spiritual contact with Goethe, which was especially the case of Edward Everett and George Ticknor. Friendship and a regular correspondence developed.</p>
   <p>All these young Americans like Everett, Ticknor, Theodore Lyman, Professor Gogswell, George Calvert, H. E. Dwight, Albert Brisbane and particularly Taylor, the celebrated copywriter, not translator, of "Faust," contributed to awaken interest in their fatherland, for Goethe. Essentially is the first named to be thankful for having given the first impulse, 109 years ago to the professors of Harvard University for Goethe research.</p>
   <p>On account of the thoroughness of this study, understanding of Goethe has been made possible in America. Goethe, on his part, received much stimulation through his correspondence with the young Americans. Three times he made plans to come to America. And it was chiefly the American way of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>thinking which enthused Goethe, - the awareness of nature, the artlessness, and the feeling for liberty, all these excited him.</p>
   <p>Great applause thanked the speaker and proved that his lecture was received enthusiastically, his fight for the spiritual reconstruction, was a victory.</p>
