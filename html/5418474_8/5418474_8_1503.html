   <p>The third festival of the Northwest Chicago Schuetzenverein (Marksmen's Club) came to an end on Tuesday evening. The affair was pleasant for the prize winners as well as for those who attended the meeting only for the entertainment it offered. A dance was held afterward, and many a toast was given to the new club (which already has eighty members), to the ladies, and to the two other Chicago marksmen's clubs--the Chicago Marksmen's Club and the North Chicago Marksmen's Club--which were represented at the festival and contributed prizes.</p>
   <p>During the contest, 8,023 [sic] shots were fired: 7,075 on the revolving target, 225 on the Union (small) target, 330 on the King's target, and 570 on the man's target.</p>
