   <p>Under the auspices of the German weekly, Heimatbote, the Donau Radio Club was formed last week to maintain and further the German-Swabian hour on the radio.</p>
   <p>As a source of broadcasting material the folklore of the German people who hail chiefly from the domain of the former Hungary will be utilized on this program.</p>
