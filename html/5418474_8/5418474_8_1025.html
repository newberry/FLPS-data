   <p>Lecture by Professor Heinrich Spiro in Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute.</p>
   <p>Even if the attendance in Fullerton Hall yesterday evening, was not as large as expected, those present were fully compensated for their apperance. Dr. Heinrich Spiro, Professor of the academy of Art in Hamburg, was lecturing and he understood how to captivate his audience through his clear enunciation and purity of language. His theme was "Friedrich Hebbel" and while he described the life and evolution of the poet born March 18th, 1813 in Wesselburen, he wove many interesting events into his lecture, of which the public so far has known very little. The lecturer stated, that Hebbel was the first great German poet to come of obscure stock, but he worked himself up, through an inwardly driving force, to the greatest heights. He then spoke about the creations of the poet, especially his great work, "Die Nibelungen," and his never ceasing energy. Fifty years old, he had to depart this life in 1863, and not until 1893 did he get the reward due him, namely to be classed in the first rank of German dramatists. Among those who acknowledged this first of all was Emperor William the Second.</p>
