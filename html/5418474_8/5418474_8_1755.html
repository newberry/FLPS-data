   <p>It was quite gay yesterday at the charity ball of the Sick-Aid Society of the Tyrolians and Vorarlbergians in Fritz Koch's hall. Numerous members and friends came to spend a few pleasurable hours in a mixed circle. The ball was arranged to benefit the unfortunates in Tschengels, Tirol, who were recently affected by a fire catastrophe. Thanks to the large number of visitors, a handsome purse was raised for the poor ones. A skilled committee took good care of music, food, and drink, and of gay entertainment. The participants were generally full of praise for the success scored in every way.</p>
