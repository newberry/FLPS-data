   <p>All friends and lovers of Fritz Reuter are invited to a meeting held in old Quincy No. 9, Thursday, June 25th, at 8 P.M. Those gentlemen, who still possess collection books are asked to send them in together with the respective amounts collected. A movement has been started to install the memorial in Humboldt Park and all persons, who have made some payments are earnestly requested to appear at this meeting. If those favoring Humboldt Park as the place for the erection of the memorial and a down payment according to the amount paid up at present will be decided, it should be immediately resolved whether the memorial of Fritz Reuter should be placed in Lincoln or Humboldt Park.</p>
