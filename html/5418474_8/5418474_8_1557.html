   <p>The call for a general public collection for a Steuben memorial plaque to be erected in the rotunda of the federal building, has found a satisfactory response in numerous donations which have been received at the office of the Abendpost.</p>
   <p>The committee of German-Americans in charge of the plan is busy organizing the publicity, to be spread through churches and parochial schools, to give the younger generation of German-Americans a chance to lend a hand. Professor Emil Zettler, the prominent sculptor, is now working on a model for the plaque, which will be a lasting memorial to one of the most deserving fighters for freedom in the history of the United States.</p>
   <p>Following is a list of the first donors. Further lists will be published from time to time. Donations are accepted by the business office of the Abendpost. <span class="page-break">2</span>Contributions to the fund for the plaque have been made by:</p>
   <p>Edward J. Kaindl, Ludwig Plate, Frau Claire Dux Swift, Emil Eitel, Karl Eitel, Miss Suzanne Eitel, Dr. George Apfelbach, John J. Jacobsen, E. A. Julius, Dr. Carl Beck, and H. P. Heizer.</p>
