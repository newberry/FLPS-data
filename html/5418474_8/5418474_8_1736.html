   <p>A poor convent in Memmingen asks for a contribution. "Dire want of our institution, love for the dear sisters and fifty orphans, compel me to seek help," writes Sister superior. "Our former supporters cannot assist us anymore;they are impoverished. The terrible rise in prices afflicts the whole land, but especially the religious educational associations. It is impossible to procure even the essentials of life, and to this must be added the ever increasing requests for additional admissions of poor forsaken children. Indeed, we face great privation, a hopeless future. We cannot obtain sufficient provisions to tide us over the winter. We have confidence in God's intercession, whereby a benefactor will be found, otherwise, the convent which provided a blissful refuge, a second home for twelve sisters and fifty children, must <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be abandoned. Our order has been founded for the poorest of the poor." Sister Mar. Agatha, Superior of the St. Hildegard Institute, Memmingen, Schwaben.</p>
   <p>Pastor Meyer, Bad Liebenstein, writes: "May I express the sincere wish not to forget our community, and would it be possible to send us a box of underwear and clothing for distribution? To the poorest of today belongs the middle class of yesterday. Homes, which were once blessed with affluence, have become proverty-stricken long ago. And these destitute do not speak of their great distress. We would be profoundly grateful if you are able to grant our wish, so that the sufferers may be given linen and clothing."</p>
   <p>Mother Superior Kaethe Hofmann of the Children's home Klingenberg, kindly asks for help. The institute is a home for forty tubercular children <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of indigent families. Like all benevolent institutions, it suffers during the present scarcity. But it is essential that all these homes, which have been founded for the protection of German youth, continue their functions. Money, clothing, or provisions, everything finds glad acceptance.</p>
   <p>The Catholic orphanage Glatz, [Bald,] Schlesien, [Silesia,] Gartenstr. 6, [Garden Street,] supports sixty-five children. Even the smallest donation will be gladly and thankfully received. "It is difficult," according to their letter, "to obtain money for this winter's coal supply," "Convinced about your great compassion, I feel assured that you will help us, just as you assisted others during their time of affliction, that you will also bring joy to our institution through some benevolent deed." Sister Maria Evarista.</p>

   <p>Reverend von Wicht, chairman of the Evangelical Alliance for Children's Welfare in Berlin, E. V., writes: "Regardless of general assistance, and a large measure of self-help, we find that nutrition, in as far as our children are concerned, has suffered regression to the low 1919 level, due to the far reaching unemployment situation affecting the parents. The children lack mostly milk, which their providers cannot afford to buy. We only hope that you may help us to continue this great, beneficial work."</p>
   <p>A communication from Dresden contains the following item: "Our sewing and warming room is the meeting place of sixty elderly ladies who were well situated in the past. Through the devaluation of money, they lost everything, and must depend upon others now. They darn, knit, embroider and patch their own worn out clothing, or do odd jobs for others to obtain a paltry reward. They are representatives of a former cultured middle class, widows and daughters of secret councilors, [unknown vocation here; men of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>learning in various lines of endeavor, giving advice to Government departments, such as commerce, labor, sanitation, building, transportation, etc., Translator] professors, Government employees, teachers, etc. Here one finds genuine but mute distress, because these old ladies do not beg. Can a philanthropically-minded person be found who will supply this mending and warming room with a few dollars, so that it may continue in spite of the rise in coal prices? Miss Dost, Dresden A, Niederwaldstr. 28, [Low Forest Street] is in charge.</p>
   <p>Marie and Natalie Schoenbrunn are private teachers in Schmiedeberg, [Smithy hill,] Riesengebirge [Giant mountains] who have lost their entire savings. Both are sickly, and too old to earn a living. Thankful for anything.</p>

   <p>Equally grateful for money or food would be Adam Wendlin Brahm, in Villmar, on the river Lahn V. 200. Nassau. He is unemployed, and suffers from asthma.</p>
   <p>The Welfare Association appeals for help for all the above; money, clothing or provisions. 128 North La Salle Street, Room 47, phone: Franklin, 0339.</p>
