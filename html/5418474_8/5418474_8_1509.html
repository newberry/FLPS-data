   <p>Lively attendance prevailed at the Schuetzenpark (Marksmen's Park) in spite of bad weather. Of course, the crowd--in as far as visitors were concerned--was comparatively small, but the out-of-town marksmen, as well as the local contingent, were participating eagerly, and rivalry was keen.</p>
   <p>Rifle teams--consisting of six members of each club--were given a special target. Their performances were indeed exciting. The results were as follows:</p>
   <p>New York Club-1156</p>
   <p>W. Hayes, 216; [highest score].....[six members].</p>
   <p>Detroit Club-885</p>
   <p>Stahl, 183;[highest score].....[six members].</p>
   <p>Chicago Club No. 2-855</p>
   <p>Kersten, 159 [highest scored].....[six members].</p>

   <p>F. Toggenburger, 174; [highest score]....[six members].</p>
   <p>Chicago Club No. 1-947</p>
   <p>Henry Block, 100; [highest score].....[six members].</p>
   <p>Southwest Chicago Club No, 2-767</p>
   <p>M. Weinberger, 179; [highest score].....[six members].</p>
   <p>[Translator's note- Altogether 14 clubs from various parts of the country competed; the New York Club, at the head of the list, attained the highest score, 1156].</p>
   <p>Other targets:</p>
   <p>Union target: 51 entrants.</p>
   <p>Small target: 39 entrants.</p>

   <p>The tournament will continue today. The people's target and men's target are <span class="page-break">\3</span>free for the use of all, upon presentation of shooting permission card.</p>
