   <p>Professor Louis Schutt's famous and well known German-English Private School commences its new semester on September 9th. A very important step forward has been made, namely the addition of a ninth and tenth grade. The school has become that which its founders were striving for, and what its present name implies, a German English school and academy.</p>
   <p>We can not recommend it too highly, and appeal to our readers to let their children enjoy the advantage of not only studying German and English thoroughly, but to get all the various instruction more extensively.</p>
   <p>Because of the low tuition, which is much lower than in any other private school in Chicago the attendance of the school should be very large.</p>
