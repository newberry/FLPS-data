   <p>Caecilie Hammerstein Illing, Weisser Flieder Novellen (Gutenberg Press: Chicago, Illinois).</p>
   <p>The author of these beautiful short stories is not unknown to the Germans of Chicago, for she lives right among them. Those who have lived here for some years should remember her stories taken from life, which appeared quite regularly for years in the Sonntagpost. In this volume her friends will find many a dear acquaintance from former times. The Weisser Flieder (White Lilac Blossoms) contains a collection of about thirty of those small works which Caecilie Hammerstein wrote during the course of several years, and most of them have been published in the Sonntagpost.</p>
   <p>The selection may be considered a good one from two points of view: First, being a collection of short stories, it has something for everyone's taste, although lovers of the exotic and of so-called "modern" literature may not get what they paid for. Second, this collection constitutes a cross section of the best literary productions of the author.</p>
   <p>Inspiration for writing is, in most instances, provided by personal experience, some incidental encounter or observation; then the creative urge leads one to cast what has been experienced and lived through into a piece of fiction. Personal contact with life, a keen gift of observation and composition, a fruitful imagination, and a most unusual talent for narration give charm to Caecilie Hammerstein's stories which makes them popular. The things written by her awakened a response in the reading public because they recognized themselves in the forms and characters of her stories; because the heroes and lesser characters of the short stories were as close to them as life; because the environment in which the events took place was familiar to them, often exactly their own.</p>
   <p>Although many a year has passed since she first wrote them down, the many blossoms from the wreath of White Lilac Blossoms have lost nothing of their polish and freshness. They might just as well have been gathered only yesterday. The preface was written by Professor Richard A. Schiedt, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and another introductory chapter was done by Professor Ernst Jokkers of Narberth, Pennsylvania. Oscar Illing devotes a heartfelt epilogue to the work of his wife.</p>
   <p>The book, which is beautifully bound, was published in time for Christmas and will be a welcome holiday gift for many Germans.</p>
