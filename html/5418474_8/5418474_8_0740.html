   <p>The radio exposition at the Coliseum, which is drawing such huge crowds, also serves to heighten the interest in the special attractions offered to the Germans. In the first place one might mention the German radio hour of Station WIBO, which has enjoyed great popularity for more than two years. As will be remembered, the program has been directed for the last sixteen months by Hermann F. Meyer, who has endeavored to provide selections appealing to different tastes. It has been his aim to give variety to the programs and also to satisfy our longing for the homeland. Last year he offered "German Musical Travels," giving graphic accounts of the various rural scenes in Germany; the accounts were interspersed with charming melodies and folk songs, poetry and music of the homeland. Many requests were received for additional journeys into new German districts and repetitions of the former imaginative travels.</p>

   <p>Several German clubs of Chicago and vicinity recognize the value of the German hour and give due recognition to the ambitions of its director. These societies have offered their co-operation for the sake of the cause and are willing to appear on future programs. Since the beginning of the winter season several associations including song clerks and instrumental groups, have performed the preliminary work.</p>
   <p>As the first arrangement of this kind, a program sponsored by the well-known German Club of Chicago will be given next Sunday. Aside from popular singers, the climax is to be the "Farewell Scene" of "Hanne Nuette," as he leaves the pastor, taken from Fritz Reuter's classical work of the same name. A male quartette and five rectors will provide the cast. The president of the German Club, Oscar Stoffels, will give a short address and the orchestra will play delightful selections, thus providing a well-rounded program.</p>
   <p>Such promising entertainments will undoubtedly result in requests for many <span class="page-break">3</span>similar performances. The management of the German radio hour will gladly consider all written suggestions as far as possible.</p>
