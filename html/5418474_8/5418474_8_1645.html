   <p>The Humboldt monument, the gift of F. I. Deroes, was dedicated in Humboldt Park yesterday afternoon, under the auspices of the German Press Club of Chicago.</p>
   <p>At 1:30 o'clock the various German societies participating, assembled at Division St. and California Ave., from which point the column marched in the following order: Grand Marshall, Henry Greenebaum and staff, preceded by a platoon of the Police Band, the Deutscher Krieger Kameradschaft, Mannerchor, orchestra, band, and the Humboldt Park Celebration Club. Carriages containing orators of the day and committees of arrangements; the Humboldt Lodge No. 420, D. C. 26; Humboldt Lodge No. 658; I. C. O. F.; Humboldt Legion; Select Knights of America; Plattdeutsche Verein; and Count Almira, No. 125, I. O. F. Citizens.</p>
   <p>The parade entered the park from the south and marched to the concourse before the pavilion, in the center of which the statue stood enveloped in the veil. Immediately in front of the pavilion had been erected a large stand for invited guests and a stand for the speakers. A little further to the left was a tier of seats for the singing societies and a stand for the band, which was to lead the music. A throng of German speaking people numbering about five thousand were present.</p>

   <p>At two o'clock the procession reached the monument, which was at once surrounded by a cordon of the Humboldt League Select Knights of America, with drawn swords. This body acted as guard of honor throughout the ceremonial. After the bodies of men had formed in long ranks, extending from the speakers' stand to the monument on the right and left of the concourse, leaving a broad passageway to the memorial, President Hesing gave a signal, and the following societies accompanied by John Hand's Band, sang "Am Altar der Wahrheit": The Teutonia Mannerchor, Schiller Liedertafel, Liedertafel Vorvaerts, Freie Sangerbund, Humboldt Sanger Club, and Almira Gesang Verein. A. C. Hesing, president of the monument committee, then formally presented the monument to the park commissioners, delivering an address in German. At this point, Marshall Greenebaum escorted the little daughter of Park Commissioner Weinhardt to the pedestal of the monument and amidst the plaudits of the assembly, she drew down the veil; and the magnificent lines of the bronze memorial stood out in strong relief against the autumn sky. Two huge garlands of roses were hung upon the base of the monument. The crowd cheered.</p>
   <p>President Harry L. Thompson of the West Park Board accepted the gift on behalf of the commissioners. He said, "This graceful statue of Alexander Von Humboldt typifies one of the greatest and grandest characters of all the ages past. He was a scion of the great Germanic family, a nation of people unsurpassed in <span class="page-break">\3</span>their love of wisdom, their love of liberty, and in their devotion to the welfare of mankind. From the midst of this great nation of great men, Von Humboldt rose like a majestic oak, towering above every man of his generation, and unsurpassed in the greatness of his achievements and accomplishments by any other man within the lapse of two centuries. The work of Von Humboldt was done for all men and for all time. On behalf of the West Chicago Park Commissioners, I accept this rare gift in the spirit and for the purpose designed by its generous donor, Frederick I. Deroes." Mayor Washburne accepted the gift or behalf of the city.</p>
   <p>Dr. Max Henius, President of the German Press Club, delivered an address in German. Prof. Albion W. Strong, of the University of Chicago, said: "Ability to admire a man like Von Humboldt is a tombstone of fellowship. We forget that he was not a man of any one nation; of any one age; or of any one social rank. It is most appropriate that this memorial to Von Humboldt should be set up in this park. It might have dignified one of the quadrangles of our university, but it is better to have it here. True scholarship is never blind to the needs of the people. Men will pass this statue when they are complaining of the privileged classes, and it will teach them that Von Humboldt was not afraid to make sacrifices for the common good. It is not a crime to be rich, but it is a crime to use riches ignobly. Some say that Von Humboldt was a servant of monarchy. He was, because he was a patriot. Some will say he was a German, and why should <span class="page-break">\4</span>Americans pay homage to him? No nation can monopolize a man who is truly great. There are those who will say that his religion was science and that the descendants of the Puritans ought not to eulogize him. But the Puritans of this day do not find it necessary to be orthodox. May all the disciples of Von Humboldt and all the disciples of religion join hands."</p>
   <p>The ceremonies were closed with singing by the societies. Among those present were all the members of the West Park Board, representatives of the other park boards, and municipal officers; also aldermen and prominent Germans. The residents in the vicinity of Humboldt Park, through the Humboldt Celebration Club, expressed their appreciation of Mr. Derces' gift and extended their thanks to the park commissioners and the German Press Club for services.</p>
