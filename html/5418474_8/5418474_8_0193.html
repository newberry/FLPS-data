   <p>The Vorwaerts Fair continues, although not as successfully as we expected. The unfavorable weather may be to blame; but when we consider that 350 pupils attend the Vorwaerts Sunday school, then one might assume that the parents, at least, would be present. However, it is doubtful if the parents of even twenty children appeared at the fair. If participation does not increase, the continuation of the school becomes a problem. We hope that better results will be observed tonight and tomorrow evening. The program for these two nights offers special attractions.</p>
   <p>The voting for the various candidates [popularity contest?] will come to an end, and the public will surely be anxious to know who has received the valuable presents.</p>
   <p>This evening the charming one-act operetta "Mamsell Rosa, or The Return from the City" will be given. Miss Ottilie Abel, Mr. Julius Koch, and Mrs. Johanna Claussen have offered their assistance in making the performance possible.</p>
