   <p>The Sachsen Verein Saxonia celebrated its Saxon bird shooting yesterday in the traditional manner in Link's Grove on Glenview and Waukegan Roads. These shooting parties are quite well known and popular in German circles.</p>
   <p>Favored with good weather, the participants began to gather in the forenoon, and in the course of the day more guests came, so that from afternoon until late in the evening a veritable orgy of bird shooting prevailed. No little contribution to the gay mood was the very good care that the Saxonia took to entertain the guests by providing bowling alleys, shooting galleries, and other games which were put at the disposal of the guests. The bird on the pole was there too, of course, and the guests did their best to shoot it off. Genuine Saxon pork sausages and other foodstuffs, as well as drinks, were there in abundance and were of a good quality, so that those who did not bring their food with them would have to suffer neither hunger nor <span class="page-break">\2</span>thirst. Oskar Seifert and his wife incited the audience to real mirth with their performances in a truly Saxon fashion. The corps of drummers and pipers of the Verein Deutscher Weltkriegs-Veteranen (Association of German World War Veterans) entertained with music, while an orchestra played gaily, offering ample entertainment for the young folks who wanted to dance. The Landwer-Verein and the Thuringer Verein were present in large numbers.</p>
   <p>The committee, which carefully made all preparations and thus contributed much to the success of the bird-shooting party, was composed of the following gentlemen: Messrs. Kurt Bendorf, chairman of the festival; Albert Reiher, Kranz, Klemm, Greiner, Kraft, Gerber, Doebler, and Mathesins.</p>
