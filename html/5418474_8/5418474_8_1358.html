   <p>The attention of the members of the Central Athletic Club was attracted during the past summer by a series of articles entitled: "Social-political conditions and institutions in the United States". These articles were published in a Berlin newspaper, and were written by Dr. Mencke, of Chicago, Illinois. Not only was an excellent training in the theories of social sciences evidenced by the author of these treatises, but also a clear understanding of our conditions.</p>
   <p>The entertainment committee of the club contacted Dr. Mencke, and engaged him to lecture about the silver question in the club hall, in particular about "Silver as money in the financial politics of the United States."</p>
