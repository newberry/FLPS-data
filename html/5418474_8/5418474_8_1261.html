   <p>The twelfth convention of the Illinois Turnbezirk (Turner District) of the North-American Turnbund (Turner Alliance) meets today at Lincoln Turner Hall, Diversey Parkway and Sheffield Avenue. Since important business is scheduled for transaction, the session should be very interesting. One important matter to be disposed of is the election of delegates to the national convention, which will be held shortly in Louisville, Kentucky. The gist of the report made to the convention by the chairman, J. G. Blessing, is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Our hopes that the various turner societies would profit by the wide-spread knowledge of the necessity of gymnastics have not been realized. Instead of increasing their membership, some of the societies are at a standstill, while others report a decrease in membership. And although everybody is complaining about the situation, nobody does anything about it.</p>
   <p>"At the last convention the district committee was commissioned to persuade <span class="page-break">2</span>the members of the various societies to send their children to the gymnasium. These efforts should not be restricted to members of the society. In many instances the homes of members are so far from the gymnasium that there is some danger in sending the children unescorted especially in the evening when the streetcar service is not dependable. The gymnasium must seek pupils from its vicinity. This is borne out by the failure of all attempts to combine societies. These attempts did not result in the consolidation, but rather in the dispersion of our already scattered membership. Many members were ashamed of disloyalty to their original societies. But consolidation was advanced by many as a reason to sever affiliation with the society. Recommendations for new arrangements and adjustments to changed conditions will be made to the coming convention and to the districts. Though these recommendations are well meant, they apparently proceed from the assumption that world politics has uprooted us, just as it did the states of Europe. But that is not the case. The war has not shaken our foundation; on the contrary, it proved that our turner societies have a right to exist.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"The only urgent question that must be answered is: How can societies utilize the altered conditions? It would be useless to appeal to the Alliance or to a district. Neither the Alliance nor the district constitutes the foundation of the societies. Only the individual society can expand its activity in a certain district; its endeavors are local, and a basic difference in conditions and problems often obtains in various societies in one and the same city. This is not the time to go into details, and we merely wish to call attention to the fact, that self-help is the only fundamental principle from which all recommendations in regard to reconstruction must emanate.</p>
   <p>"The fourteen resolutions which were to be carried out by the committee are not as important as the well-known Fourteen Points of President Wilson, but they were just as carefully considered. I can only say that perhaps the results did not measure up to the expectations. What could be done was done. Some resolutions were not carried out because it was not possible to do so. For instance, a pregymnastic course was not arranged because of an insufficient number of pupils; and a district organ (paper or magazine) was <span class="page-break">4</span>not established because Stevenson refused at the last minute. The property of the Turnverein Eiche (Oak) was taken over by the Oak Land Association. It can be said of the camp committee that the meetings were well attended, and that good results are certain.</p>
   <p>"We hope that fees for admission to our gymnastic exhibition, which is to be held on May 4, will yield a profit large enough to defray the cost of the replacements which were made at our camp. The committee has received a request that we repeat our gymnastic exhibition in connection with a mass demonstration which is to be made in the interest of the Victory Liberty Loan. The Committee agreed, convinced that it will benefit our Alliance if we appear before the public at large, since it does not come to us.</p>
   <p>"The reorganized Turnverein Frisch Auf (Arise), of Aurora, Illinois, has joined our Alliance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"In closing, let me express the hope that our deliberations and resolutions will be guided and controlled by the spirit of progress; and especially that the pending convention will carefully consider the resolutions which will be submitted to it. Three cheers for our society, districts, and our Alliance!</p>
   <p>"John G. Blessing, chairman."</p>
   <p>The secretary, Leopold Grand made the following report to the convention: "The present membership is 2175, compared with 2173 last year; the number of societies is 22, against 21 last year. During the course of the year we had the pleasure of accepting into membership the Turnverein Frisch Auf, of Aurora. The latter society has one hundred members, and is represented at this convention....</p>
   <p>"The convention should also consider the question: How are the various committees to operate, especially those which receive and disburse money?</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In my opinion, a definite group should be responsible for the society's funds. Such a group is the Board of the Illinois Turner District; all other boards and committees are under the supervision of the District Board, and must report to it."</p>
