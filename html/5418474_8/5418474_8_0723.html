   <p>The incurable German hypochondriac Johann Becker- or, John Becker, after the Americanization of his name notwithstanding his dislike for America, published recently in Germany a thick book on the United States, painting it rather black. Things which he pointed out, are for the most part correct, but he almost exclusively depicts the sinister and dark side of America omitting the light sides altogether which he could not see during his several years of residence in this country, because his spirit was continuously gloomy.</p>
   <p>But he was not a cursed vagabond as old Hecker speaks of him. In Chicago, where he resided for several years, he enjoyed the reputation of an honorable man. His character is faultless, but not his temperament. Of course this work was food for those of the German people whom we could call enemies of America, and Friedrich von Hellwald one of the loudest of this group provided it with a preface sparkling with malice and ignorance.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, there are many newspapers in Germany which can discriminate between the untrue and the unjust in Becker's book, from the true and just.</p>

   <p>The "Schwabische Merkur" of Stuttgart for instance, although true to the kaiserly German and kingly Wurttemberg ideas, pointed out that Becker's work was not impartial and with a kind of satisfaction indulged in revealing the evil conditions in America. The "Schwabische Merkur" sums up the situation by saying: "No doubt that the unpleasant things which the author said about America are gathered from singular observations and marked by correctness, but it is our belief that he went too far when speaking on this condition in general. It is known that there are honest, respectable and able business men as well as factory owners in America who can be well compared to our European men of the business world.</p>
   <p>There are also educated American women who possess the virtues of managing a household and creating a beautiful family life. There are schools and institutions preparing the people not only for practical life, but impart knowledge and scientific research also. That Becker in his general summary omits the better classes, must be due to the fact that he did not have any contact with them. He was provileged to be in a position which brought him in touch with the people whose majority... constitutes the element of whom he speaks.</p>

   <p>We, on our part hope that the good which is unquestionably present, is much more powerful than the author is willing to grant them, and that from such seed a generation will develop concerning itself with State and Society.</p>
