   <p>Dr. Bernhard gave his last lecture yesterday on hypnotism, combined with experimental demonstrations.</p>
   <p>Explaining the fundamental nature of Hypnotism, Dr. Bernhard stressed the fact, that hypnotic achievements are not the results of black magic but the outcome of psychical forces which control our brain-activity and the subsequent reaction of the human nervous system. Hypnotism by all means, he said, should be taken away from misleading stage-performers and spiritualistic fakers.</p>
   <p>Hypnotism has entered the stage of serious scientific study and as such should not be mixed up with imaginary miracles. Hypnotism in its true nature and realistic effects will draw more and more the interest of scientists, who predict for hypnotic experiments a great future on the field of medical science.</p>
