   <p>During the term of the Song Festival the Illinois Staats-Zeitung contained twice as many pages as usual. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday (today), our publication was the largest newspaper ever printed anywhere in German. Regardless of this increase, which presented great technical difficulties, the paper was not large enough, so that we could not print all the reading matter intended for the Thursday issue, since 51 of the 72 columns were used for advertisements--proof that our wide-awake merchants are aware of the popularity of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
