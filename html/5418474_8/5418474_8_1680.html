   <p>The "Low-German (Dialect) Society" held its semi-annual meeting night before last. J. J. Rumpf, who presided, rather severely criticized in his annual report the lukewarm attitude in regard to the erection of a monument for Fritz Reuter. He commended the "Swabian Society", which had achieved, with the cooperation of the Germans in Chicago, the erection of a beautiful monument for their favorite German, Friedrich von Schiller, at Lincoln Park, but said that the "Low-German Society" and its branches must admit being far behind in the materialization of their plans. Then he suggested the appointment of a committee to get in touch with other "Low-German Societies" for mutual assistance in executing the plan. He also suggested that the President of the Society should try to enthuse some journalists and speakers to take part in this cause for the cultivation of Low-German dialects, and to hold lectures under the auspices of the Society.</p>
