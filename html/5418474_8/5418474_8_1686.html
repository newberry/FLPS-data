   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung: We thank you for the generous support given to our second Cannstatt festival, and hope that you will publish the following item in the local news column of Der Westen:</p>
   <p>"The committee on arrangements hereby thanks all who participated in the Cannstatt festival, and desires to express appreciation to those who decorated houses and streets for the occasion.</p>
   <p>"The proceeds of the festival, about $1,000, are available for a Schiller monument in Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>"Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>"Franz Demmler, secretary, acting for the committee."</p>

   <p>(Westen editor's note: For one thousand dollars, a nice monument could be erected, such as a large bust on a granite pedestal. But we hear the Schwabenverein has a higher goal in mind; nothing less than a large-sized figure of the great German poet is contemplated.)</p>
