   <p>"An exceptionally large audience congregated yesterday, at Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute where the above mentioned society arranged a musical program. Mr. Alexander Seebald and Heniot Levy, pianist. The program listed the following:-Kreutzer-Sonate by Beethoven; Sonata in D-Minor, Opus 108, by Brahms; Sonata in A-Major, by Cesar Franks.</p>
   <p>"It is but natural that these two eminent artists played these works masterfully and bestowed a great artistic treat to the audience, which consisted mostly of music connoisseurs. The external proof was given by the public's most generous applause. The great success of the evening encouraged the society to continue the promotion of musical divertisements. The next in line, is to be a Schumann evening."</p>
   
   <p>This coming Monday, Prof. Goebels of the University of Illinois, will give a lecture on "The Germans in American History." The subject which Prof. Goebels has selected, concerns one of the great and vital questions appertaining to Germanism, and this alone is a sufficient reason for assembling an extraordinarily large audience.</p>
   <p>That Prof. Goebels will treat his subject in a thorough and fascinating manner, requires no especial assurance as he is not a stranger to our public.</p>
