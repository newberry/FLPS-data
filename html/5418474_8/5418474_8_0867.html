   <p>The evening entertainment given by Fricke's school took place last night in Muller's Hall. Besides the parents of the children, numerous friends of the school were in attendance. The songs and declamations of the children were loudly applauded and gave testimony to the application of the children and the understanding of the teachers. We recommend Fricke's German-English school, Sedgwick and Division Streets, most warmly. The school is progressing constantly and is acquiring more and more friends among the Germans of the North Side.</p>
