   <p>In yesterday's meeting of the Chicago Gymnastic Districts, the much talked of affair concerning Vahlteich was to have been aired. The special committee was however, unable to make its report as the necessary charges had not been submitted to them yet by the Chicago Gymnastic Community. The executive had received a petition signed by 67 members of the Chicago Gymnastic Community, protesting against the unlawful actions of a part of the members. The expected suspension of the Chicago gymnastic Community on account of its unconstitutional action in the affair of Vahlteich did not take place yesterday. It will be tried in the first session of the month of March; perhaps it may be possible to come to an understanding by then.</p>
