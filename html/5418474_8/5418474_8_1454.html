   <p>The bond sale to raise money to pay the mortgage on the Turnhalle (Turner Hall) is not such an absorbing topic any more, because of General Grant's presence in Chicago--but nevertheless, more than twenty-four bonds have been sold. The two gentlemen who appealed to Grant to "help save the Turnhalle," a most unfortunate incident--the result of misdirected energy--should see that such activity was entirely uncalled for. The Germans felt that it was a disgrace to approach Grant in a matter of this kind. Our people here are well able to take care of their own affairs. The past has showed this. The next few weeks will give additional proof.</p>
   <p>The latest list of contributions [pledges to buy stock] follows:</p>
   <p>C. F. Schaefer, $100....[13 one-hundred-dollar bonds are listed].</p>
   <p>Schoenemann and Company, $50....[Purchasers of nine $50 shares are listed].</p>
   <p>Philip Stein, $25;....[Twenty purchasers of $25 shares are listed].</p>
   
   <p>To the total must be added an additional $200, since Bartholomae and Leicht, as well as Schmidt and Glade, increased their former pledges. Formerly each of these two corporations had subscribed $200; they raised the sum to $300.</p>
