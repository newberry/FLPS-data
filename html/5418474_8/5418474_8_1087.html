   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde has always considered the dissemination of knowledge, to be one of its duties and to provide information, engages bonafide scientists and eminent speakers. It has tried to reach its goal regardless of the fact, that the German-American public has not always shown proper appreciation for these efforts. The majority of the audience are generally regular members of the Turngemeinde.</p>
   <p>Recently a notable improvement has been noticed which makes the Turngemeinde re-double its efforts. Tomorrow evening Prof. Sophus Tromholt will give one of his popular lectures on astronomy at the North side Turnhall. The subject matter will be illustrated with lantern slides of excellent quality.</p>
   <p>Prof. Tromholt, investigator of the Aurora Borealis, speaks the German language so well, that one does not perceive his foreign origin. He has a certain peculiarity of pronunciation which, combined with his poetic sentiments, make a deep impression.</p>
   <p>Considering the aforesaid, it is to be hoped, that tomorrow's lecture will be well attended. Ladies and gentlemen who are not members of the Chicago Turngemeinde, will be admitted for the nominal fee of 25 cents. The visitors will thereby help the Turngemeinde solve its problem: that aside from physical culture, which strengthens the body, we should also acquire knowledge, for knowledge sets us free.</p>
