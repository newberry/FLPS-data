   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung:</p>
   <p>Many readers appreciate your report about the steady increase of literary works in German at the Public Library. This increase no doubt indicates that the large number of readers among the German population is being considered; still visitors to the reading room find only very few German-American newspapers. There are only seven, the two local papers not included. Of the seven weeklies are two of Chicago, and of the remaining five, two are of little interest because they are published in small cities.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians, as well as the Norwegians, have a much better selection, although the German reading public is larger than the Bohemian and Norwegian combined. The libraries in Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Detroit have the German newspapers of all larger cities on display. Chicago is an exception....Mr. Hild would receive the gratitude of many German readers if he would rectify this matter. A. Reader</p>
