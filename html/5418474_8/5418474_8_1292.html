   <p>An eager audience was present at the North Side Turner Hall yesterday, to witness the fencing contest that took place under the auspices of the Chicago Turn Community. Although three of the society's star fencers, Messrs. L. O. Greiner, Camille Waldbott, and George A. Freibert were selected to fight for the superiority in the contest, their opponents were winners in team fencing. Thus the silver cup--the winner's prize--was received by the Chicago Fencing Club, which was so gloriously represented by Messrs. O. C. Haier, L. A. Neebe, and W. J. Reinke. The winning fencers scored 25½ points, while the losing fencers could not raise their score above 24½ points. The gold medal, a gift by Dr. J. Frank, was received by L. O. Greiner, of the Chicago Turn Community, scoring 10½ points. The title of champion was also bestowed upon him. The second prize, a silver medal, was awarded to Camille Waldbott and the third prize, a bronze medal, was received by G. Freibert, also of the Chicago Turn Community, scoring 8½ and 7½ points respectively.</p>
