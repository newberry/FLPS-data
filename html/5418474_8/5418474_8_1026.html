   <p>Before the members of the Germanistic Society Dr. Arthur Ungnad of the University of Jena, held a lecture, accompanied by lime-light pictures, on the theme, "Concerning the Old-Babylonian Culture World." The scholar spoke in a very captivating manner. Through his words, the present distant disappeared, and a distant past emerged, which carried the listeners into a strange world, full of peculiar charms. Especially thrilling were his descriptions about the construction and monuments of old Babylon, about the religious life of its people, and the literature of that period. It can be stated with satisfaction, that the announced lecture, drew a large audience to the Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute.</p>
