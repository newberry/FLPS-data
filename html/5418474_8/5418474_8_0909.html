   <p>At the invitation of Sears Roabuck and Company, the German-American Architect Walter Woltersdorf gave a lecture yesterday afternoon, at the Exhibition Room of Modern Architecture, about the importance of German artistic influence upon the modern development of architecture.</p>
   <p>After an introduction by Mr. O'Neil, manager of the exhibition, the lecturer remarked that the modern development of architecture owes at least sixty per cent of its origin to German artistic creations, which <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in Germany more than in any other European country, have pointed the way to new methods of building houses and other structures in general. In the opinion of Walter Woltersdorf, architecture, like every artistic creation, is a direct expression of the times. Architecture would thrive more if the public in general would show a greater interest in its development.</p>
   <p>Today American architecture has reached a point where it no longer has to confine itself to the mere copying of European style. All it does now is to study the advantages of European art creations and apply them, if possible, to American purposes.</p>
   <p>The lecturer was introduced by the German Consul-General, Dr. Hugo F. Simon, who pointed to the architectural creations of Walter Woltersdorf, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of whose talent numerous important buildings give testimony. Consul-General Simon introduced the lecturer as one of the exponents of the creative spirit of German art.</p>
   <p>The photographs of buildings and models gave proof of the creative ability of its builders. Architects like Walter Grapius, Otto Hasler, Mies van der Pohe, Erich Mendelsohn, Karl Schneider, Erich Man, and Hans Scharoun reveal a cultivated taste in their creations and an intimate charm in the treatment of interior details. As great American architects the exhibition presents Frank Lloyd Wright, and the creator of the skyscrapers style, Louis Sullivan.</p>
