   <p>The German-American Institute of the North Side, usually called Fricke's School, has decided to open a branch school at 107 Wells Street on September 1. This is very good news for those parents who wish to send their children to a teacher who has been successful for fourteen years!</p>
   <p>Mr. Fricke is now associated with a highly capable American teacher, Mr. Coombs, and this gives the pupils an opportunity to become thoroughly familiar with the German, as well as with the English language.</p>
