   <p>The first number of the Amerikanische FrauenZeitung (American Ladies Journal) appeared last Saturday. The paper is edited with the collaboration of German-American women, and prominent educators. As a monthly gratuitous supplement, dedicated to the German-American youth, a paper called Kinderwelt (Children's World), also a fashion paper will be given. The first number is beautifully illustrated and contains articles of well-known and popular authors like E. F. L. Gauss and Dr. E. Balzer; also a very pretty poem by Max Hempel and others, dedicated to the German woman. The intention of the publishers is not to occupy themselves with untenable theories; they desire to cultivate in the "Frauenzeitung" the German spirit, the domestic character, and from the first number we may judge, that the editor chose the proper way, to attain his aim. It is to be expected, that the German ladies will not fail to patronize this undertaking.</p>
