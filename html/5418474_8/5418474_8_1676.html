A committee has been selected to consider the proposition and make suitable recommendations. The Schwaben Verein evidently runs true to form and character. It acts in conformity with its deserved reputation, and again shows its progressiveness by its endeavor to provide the funds for such a monument on its own initiative. Once more it will lead among the Germans by placing the contemporary, Goethe, near our famous and great friend, Schiller.</p>
