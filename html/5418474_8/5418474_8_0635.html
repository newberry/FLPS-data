   <p>Rev. Wilhelm Rapp has given up the editorship of the Baltimore Wecker on January, in order to enter the editorship staff of the Illinois Staats Zeitung. He moves with his family to Chicago and as soon as he is somewhat settled here, he will start in his new activity. We don't need to tell our readers how much we welcome the collaboration of so well-proven and able a man, and how much we missed him in the first three months after the fire.</p>
   <p>To especially introduce Wilhelm Rapp to the German public of Chicago is not necessary, because they still will remember him from earlier days as a tireless fighter for the maintenance of justified peculiarities of the German people in Chicago.</p>
