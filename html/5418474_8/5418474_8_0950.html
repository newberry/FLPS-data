   <p>Robert Steiner, generally known as an able author and popular orator, lectured yesterday evening in Social Turner Hall. The event was well attended and successful. Mr. Steiner is an excellent speaker, who can hold the interest of his listeners.</p>
   <p>He spoke mostly about social problems, declaring that the working man has to show first who he is, before he can expect that the other side will show due respect for him. A musical program was filled in by offerings of the Freiheit Singing Society and Gertrude Hass, Eva eizman, and Mr. Paul Miller, soloists.</p>
