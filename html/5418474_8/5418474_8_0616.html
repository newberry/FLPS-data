   <p>Chicago's curse is not its malodorous river; nor its Ogden ditch, which threatens our city with a deluge in case the Desplaines River should rise; nor its large number of wooden houses insured for double their value by avaricious insurance companies; nor its strong prairie winds which increase the danger by fire a hundredfold and which would defy the efforts of even the best European fire extinguishing apparatus; nor its gambling; dens and barmaids; nor even the Board of Trade: Chicago's curse is the Chicago Times.</p>
   <p>It is the Times which, with its infamous lies and diabolical slanders, has given our city, in the eyes of the world, the reputation of perfect pandemonium, a sort of Cheyenne or Laramie on a larger scale. It is the Times <span class="page-break">\2</span>which daily commits outrages that are worse than any which hell itself could devise. It is the Times which poisons public opinion and creates distrust and dissension between all classes--destroying the happiness of families, driving men into the madhouse and sending women to the offices of abortionists and finally into the grave. And all this is done for the purpose of creating a sensation and making a few dollars by selling a few hundred more sheets of that paper.</p>
   <p>The name of the villain who has made the Times such an anathema to Chicago is Wilbur F. Storey, a hoary old criminal, in comparison with whom every culprit sentenced to life imprisonment in the penitentiary at Joliet is an innocent angel; a fellow upon whose every feature vice has stamped its image; a creature who, after having been booted out of society, can find no other employment to satisfy his hellish lust, than to drag into the mire the honor of every man whose name society utters with respect, and to represent every decent woman as a prostitute, in order to reduce her to <span class="page-break">\3</span>the level of his own ideas of what a wife should have been and should be. It is this man,who, like old "Fagin" in Dicken's "Oliver Twist," has trained for himself a set of lesser villains who go forth at his command to destroy the honor and reputation of all men who enjoy the respect and good will of their fellow citizens. Occasionally it comes to pass that one of these lesser villains is soundly thrashed, as was the "artful dodger" (McCleuthen), and then the only thing to be regretted is that it was the wretched and shabby apprentice of the old criminal, "Fagin," instead of the arch-villain himself who would merely have gotten his just deserts if his miserable head had been smashed. [Translator's note: Mr. A. C. Hesing administered the beating to McCleuthen and was fined thirty dollars for the offense. Mr. Hesing claimed that he had been slandered by the Times.]</p>
   <p>There is no doubt but that ninety-nine of every hundred intelligent and refined citizens would celebrate with thanksgiving and rejoicing the day on which the arch-scoundrel, Wilbur F. Storey, was shot down on a public <span class="page-break">\4</span>street like a mad dog; for the thrashing meted out to one of his underlings is but small payment for the deviltry which the "Master" has committed against innocent people.</p>
   <p>The manner in which this criminal, Storey, endeavors to rob respectable men of their honor may be best explained by applying it to himself. Say, for instance, that we should publish a sensational article with the following headlines:</p>
   <p>HORRIBLE ATROCITY!</p>
   <p>JOURNALIST TURNS OUT TO BE ABORTIONIST AND MURDERER: WILBUR F. STOREY</p>
   <p>BUTCHERS HIS OWN WIFE!</p>
   <p>INFERNAL VILLAIN DENIES DEED BUT PUBLIC OPINION ADJUDGES HIM GUILTY!</p>
   <p>MURDER AND PERJURY!</p>
   <p>Following such headlines it would only be necessary to publish all manner <span class="page-break">\5</span>of talk and street gossip, which, taken separately, would impart little or nothing, but, when considered with the headlines would create in every reader the firm conviction that Wilbur F. Storey, the emaciated old sinner, having married a wanton woman, did not want to become a father, and hence attempted to perform an abortion, with fatal results to his wife. why he must have murdered her!</p>
   <p>All this is simply used as an illustration. We do not say that Wilbur F. Storey married a wanton women; nor do we say that he wished to avoid becoming a father, or that he used the necessary preventives, and selected Dr. Johnson as his scapegoat to hide his crime when the evil consequences of his deed came to light. we do not say anything of the kind; but we do say that if we were to say these things, we should only be paying him back in his own coin.</p>
   <p>It is precisely in this way that he attacks the reputation of other people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>In the same way that we had "public opinion," that is, malicious gossip, adjudge him guilty of murdering his wife, he seeks day after day to ruin the honor of respectable and esteemed citizens. He says in his paper that "A heard from B, that C heard from D, that E told D that F was a bribed scoundrel and a thief". [Translator's note: "F" refers to A.C. Hesing, owner of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.] And above that statement he places in large type the headline:</p>
   <p>"F SHOWN TO BE A BRIBED SCOUNDREL AND A THIEF!"</p>
   <p>In the body of the article he writes with the brazen effrontery of a convict cut loose from the gallows: "As may be seen in our local columns, F having been branded by the testimony of our respectable citizens A,B,C, and D, as a thief, we can only express our regret that...." and then follows a long philosophical dissertation which even Mephistopheles could not help but chuckle over. In this truly diabolical way Wilbur F. Storey has attempted to ruin the fair name of innumerable men, and, finally, that of <span class="page-break">\7</span>a man who as recently as last fall was recognized as the leader of the People's party. Having been cast out of the society of all respectable Americans, and limited to that of women of dubious reputation, he is now attempting to gain admission into society by trying, assassinlike, to annihilate that man whom the great majority of the Germans of Chicago recognize as their leader. But public opinion in Chicago will never cease to see in Wilbur F. Storey an infamous villain, nor will it ever look upon the man assailed by him, as a thief.</p>
   <p>One thing Storey must yet learn is that the cowardice which prompts some persons to submit to his outrages is not to be found in everyone. Some of our citizens do not think that it is necessary that they suffer their honor to be assailed just because the outrage is perpetrated by the press. Nor do they believe that because a fellow weighs but one hundred and fifty pounds, or has grown physically weak because of his vices, he may with impunity depict another as a scoundrel and a thief. A man weighing only <span class="page-break">\8</span>one hundred and fifty pounds, who besmears the honor of one weighing two hundred pounds or more, should bear the consequences, no matter whether he is the "artful dodger" or old "Fagin" himself.</p>
