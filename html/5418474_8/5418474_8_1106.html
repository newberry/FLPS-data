   <p>The Group Soutside held its regular agitation meeting yesterday evening. Comrade Fischer lectured on the theme: "The Unions and the International Workingmen's Association." Speaker laid stress during his lecture upon the fact that the I.A.A. does not oppose the unions as such, but that it fights against the reactionary tendencies, which seem to be prevailing in them. He refuted the union's principle: A good day's wages for a good day's work, and spoke against the silliness of harmony between capital and labor.</p>
   <p>The unions should desert the legal basis of the capitalistic way of production and follow a more radical principle, that of communism. He contrasted the confused principles of the Union with those of the Communists and pointed out, that only in the free communistic society could humanity live a happy life. The speaker was loudly applauded. The lecture was followed by a short but lively debate.</p>
