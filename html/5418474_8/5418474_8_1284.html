   <p>The Turner Club of Chicago had for some time the intention of making a present to the new Fredrich Ludwig Jahn School at their opening celebration in honor of the name of the great Turner master, adopted by them. A committee of five had been selected to study the situation. They came to the conclusion of having a bust made of bronze and an original drawing of the Master. None of the busts however correspond with their expectation to serve as a model and the committee instructed the well-known sculptor Hermann Gensch with the production of an original bust. This great master has produced a wonderful worl according to the opinions of experts one of the best Jahn busts in existence. The picture, an original sketch made by Turner Hermann Rascher will be suitably framed and will be hung up in the new school. The Friedrich Ludwig Jahn School is located at the corner of Lincoln and Belmont and is built according to the newest and most modern plans.</p>
