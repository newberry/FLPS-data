   <p>Mr. Harry Rubens, chairman of the Committee of the Schurz Memorial Service in Chicago has received the following letter from President Roosevelt:-</p>
   <p>"I wish I could take part in the service for the honor of Karl Schurz. As this, howeverm is not possible, I beg to express the high esteem, which I have for the services of this great man for this country. He had the great problem, to play a great part in American history at a time of a great crisis. He was one of the great men, who stood, in council meetings, election speeches, and on the battlefield for the principles of the mighty Abraham Lincoln and therefore his name stands in the front lines in the heroic periods of our governments, its formation and maintenance. He has proved to be true to a sublime idealism. After the war, he was one of the pioneer fighters of Civil Service-Reform and later for the cause of a sound currency system. His works in literature such as the biographies of Lincoln and Henry Clay deserve high praise."</p>
