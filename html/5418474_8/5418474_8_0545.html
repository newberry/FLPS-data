   <p>Four years ago there was no German paper in Chicago, which fought the Republican politics of interference and big business.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost appeared for the first time September 2, 1889 and was the first newspaper of this town, which dared to represent the principle, that no country will get rich by taxation and that the best government is the one, which governs the least. How much the Germans of Chicago appreciated this policy can be witnessed by immediate success. There was no need to reform the Germans of Chicago. The influence of the Abendpost lies in its knowledge of the thinking of the greater part of its conpatriots, and the true representation of their rights and welfare.</p>
