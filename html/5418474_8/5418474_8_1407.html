   <p>The Soziale Turnverein is developing a strength which in this "blossom time of cowards and scoundrels" - can be considered by every sincere friend of progress as a joyous sign of the times. Hardly one year in existence, the club has already bought the lot for building its hall.</p>
   <p>It is situated at Belmont and Racine Avenues and cost $5,000. We have only one wish: to see the "Soziale" soon in its own hall - in the interest of all the friends of truth.</p>
