   <p>Yesterday's closing festivities marked the termination of the 14th course of Drs. Robert Wahl's and Max Henius's successful Brewing Academy. Of the 31 students who enrolled for the course, 27 passed the final examinations more or less gloriously. The Brew-master's diploma was awarded to 19; the other 8 must prove first, that they are able to apply their acquired knowledge in a practical manner, before they will be given their certificate of merit.</p>
   <p>Max Hoefle was given a gold medal, since his examination showed the highest number of points. At the conclusion of the official festivities, cordial expressions of friendship and mutual recognition as well as gratitude, were exchanged by teachers and students. At the closing festivities of the scholars, which was given previously at the Orpheus Hall, 60 gentlemen were present. The Academy's next course will commence on October 4th.</p>
