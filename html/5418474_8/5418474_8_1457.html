   <p>Regardless of the election and the present Grant boom, the citizens have found time to think of the Turnhalle (Turner Hall)--as the appended list of contributions shows:</p>
   <p>E. Fuerst, $200; Cahn, Wampold and Company, $100. [Translator's note: Pledges range from $25 to $200.] Total - $2,000.</p>
   <p>We may expect subscriptions to increase considerably, since the people are not so busy now, and most of the wholesale houses have finished their fall work.</p>
