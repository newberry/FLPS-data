   <p>A highly interesting lecture was given last night at the Men's meeting of the Club. The speaker was the eminent writer and composer of music, Mr. B. Zieher, and his topic; "The present extent of knowledge concerning music." To carry out the program previously arranged, it was impossible to finish the lecture, and the desire was expressed to hear the second part of the address at the next Men's meeting of the Club.</p>
   <p>The speaker distinguished himself with his profound knowledge of literature, his wealth of thoughts and ideas, and his clear, constructive criticism.</p>
   <p>The more serious scientific knowledge found a counterpart in the humorous and artistic performances of the evening.</p>
