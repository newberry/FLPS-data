   <p>(p. 4) The German-English school and academy of Prof. Louis Schutt, No. 621-623 North Wells St., will start its new school year tomorrow. We have repeatedly recommended this school.</p>
   <p>As the various subjects are taught in both the German and English language, an opportunity is thereby provided to attain proficiency in both languages.</p>
   <p>Registration for new students will take place tomorrow, 9-12 A. M., in the school's hall.</p>
