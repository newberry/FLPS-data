   <p>Next Saturday in the "Vorwarts-Turnverein", Mr. John Gloy will be received by a flock of friends and admirers, trying to show their appreciation of the wonderful work he did for the young men in an athletic way. He was and is yet a wonderful leader. He has produced very capable young men who have taken leading places in the big tournament meetings. Hence, this feast tonight. The program will be as follows:- "Die Schoene Galathee", an Opera. The leading lady, Madame Lina Waszmann, Mr. Selig from Milwaukee will sing "My-das", Miss Gilbert "Canymed", and Mr. Wasserman, Pygmalion.</p>
   <p>With such actors and actresses the evening will be a great success. The Turners will also have a good number on the program.</p>
