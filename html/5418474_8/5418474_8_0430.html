   <p>When choosing an educational institution, the first question we ought to ask is: who are the heads of the institution and what is their reputation?</p>
   <p>Balatka Musical College, which is located in the Auditorium Building, 431 South Wabash Avenue, and to which six readers will receive a scholarship, is known beyond the boundaries of Chicago as a first-class institution.</p>
   <p>Established in 1879 by Hans Balatka, this school has made the name of its founder famous in Chicago. For twenty-one years he was the active leader and the chief teacher at the institution. His son and successor, Doctor Christian F. Balatka, received his elementary instruction at the school. His father later sent him to Europe to continue his studies. Upon his return he assumed active leadership of Balatka Musical College, which is still under his personal supervision.</p>
