   <p>Yesterday appeared the first issue of a new German newspaper called the "Chicago Tageblatt." The outward appearance of the paper makes a good impression. This publication is sponsored by a Lutheran association which is evidently trying to find readers among the orthodox members of the Saxonian Churches and similar sects. They are attempting to combat secret cults, scandalous immoral practices, picnics on Sundays and indecent theatre performances. The publishers think that Chicago offers a fertile field for a newspaper along that line.</p>
