   <p>Koelling and Klappenbach have published in attractive form a collection of poems under the title "AbendGlocken" (Evening Bells) and the author of them is the well known German-American writer Kara Giorg. What is especially touching by this collection is not only the beautifully formed language but still more the deepness of thoughts and the pleasant forms that pass through the poems. One can notice by the reading of the first poems that here a man speaks to us who explored the world and life with open eyes and warm heart and who understands how to dress up the abundance of his rich experience with the beautiful costume of poetry. Behind the pseudonym Kara Giorg is concealed the Cincinnati physician Dr. G. Bruehl, who as explorer and author stands equally honored and did become beloved by the German American readers chiefly by his "Urwald-Poesien" (Poesy of the Jungle) and his "Bilder Aus Der Neven Welt" (Pictures from the New World.)</p>
