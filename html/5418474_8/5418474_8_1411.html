   <p>A large crowd gathered last night at the north side Turner Hall to witness the gymnastic exercises of the Chicago Turn Community. The orchestra under the direction of Adolph Rosenbecker delighted the audience with a lovely musical program. The pole exercises of the young Turners were followed with much interest and earned them well deserved applause. Then came the excellent exhibition of club swinging, expertly done by R. Ruschau. Following was a wrestling match with these teams participating: Hambrock and Hess; Voss and Long; Carr and Schmidt. These gentlemen have been known for years for their work in this field, and they convinced the audience, last night, of their excellent progress. Then the Turners, Hambrock and Boehm, gave a fencing exhibition, but this failed to produce the expected effect as the newly imported sabres from Vienna were somewhat heavier than the exponents had been used to. The building of the pyramid and the ladder performed by all the active members of the Turn Community was done so beautifully, that it is impossible to express it in words.</p>
