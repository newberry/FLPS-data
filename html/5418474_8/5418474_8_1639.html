   <p>The marvelous statue of the immortal Low-German, poet, Fritz Reuter, was unveiled yesterday in a truly glorious manner.....</p>
   <p>People flocked to the beautiful spot in Humboldt Park, from all directions gathering around the still unveiled statue. The sound of trumpets in the distance announced the approaching parade which would add thousands more to the already huge crowds. The sonorous voices of the united men's choirs, the eloquent and deeply touching words of the speakers, the glorious spring sun focussing its rays upon the bronze statue, all uplifted and filled every heart with stirring emotions. This solemn and almost religious mood of the people truly represented the immortal spirit of Fritz Reuter.</p>
   <p>The parade was brilliant and impressive.....In the first division the guests of honor rode in richly decorated carriages. They were: Privy Councilor Wermuth, Germany's Commissary to the World's Fair, his aides and other representatives from the Reich....the German Consul, Dr. Buenz, the commissaries of the German women's department, Mrs. E.

   <p>A row of carriages with members of the Chicago Turn Gemeinde, and members of the German Press brought up the rear. The abundance of beautiful flags and banners made a grand and imposing impression.....</p>
