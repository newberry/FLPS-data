   <p>The Gymnastic Club, "Vorwarts", made a protest yesterday at the meeting in the following resolution.</p>
   <p>With reference to the sanctioning of a notorious and shameless election fraud on the part of the majority of the Chicago Aldermen by which rightfully elected member of the council has been cheated of his seat, the gymnastic Club "Vorwarts" makes the following declaration:</p>
   <p>(1) The happenings at the last meeting of the City Council are and remain an outrage for the community of the City of Chicago. The Gymnastic Club, "Vorwarts" condemns to the fullest extent the action of the majority of the aldermen in this affair by which from personal of political considerations and by apparently false motives the honorable M. Stauber has been cheated of his seat as Alderman and in his place has been substituted a person, who has as little right to the seat of the Alderman of the 14th Ward as of the title of a Gentleman.</p>

   <p>(2) The Gymnastic Club "Vorwarts" deplores the behaviour of a part of the local Press especially of the German one in this affair, which instead of protesting against this extraordinary fraud approved it-openly and in this way made itself an accomplice of a crime against the rights of the people. (3) The Gymnastic Club "Vorwarts" announces its full sympathy with all who have raised their voice in condemnation of this affair and who have decided not to rest till the Honorable Stauber has regained his full rights and the guilty ones have been punished.</p>
   <p>(4) Resolved to publish the aforementioned protest in the Arbeiter Zeitung, Ill. Staats Zeitung and Neue Freie Presse.</p>
