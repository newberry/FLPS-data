   <p>The family of the well known poet, Konrad Nies, who died a few years ago, is in dire need on account of sickness and other unfortunate circumstances.</p>
   <p>This refers to the wife and to the daughter of the German-American poet. Mrs. Elizabeth Nies has now decided to sell her late husband's poem collections entitled, "World and Wilderness." Mrs. Emma C. Eitel, 3750 Sheridan Road, has generously consented to effect the sale. Whoever wants to possess one of the books, should apply to Mrs. Eitel.</p>
