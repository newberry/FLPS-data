   <p>The new "Columbia" Gymnastic Hall has been inaugurated with an exceptionally numerous participation, yesterday. The evening before a splendid ball had been arranged already on which occasion the ladies auxiliary of the club gave it a present of a very attractive flag. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the gymnasts, accompanied by their musical chorus of 20 musicians and headed by their drum and piper corps, marched from the old home to the new one. The friendly clubs partly appeared in a body and partly they had sent strong delegations. The parade made a splendid attraction and the Sunday's Saints of Englewood must have wondered, where all these gymnasts came from. The spacious hall had been filled after the parade with so many persons, that it was hardly possible to get standing room.</p>
