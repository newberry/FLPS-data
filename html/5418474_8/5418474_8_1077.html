   <p>The first of the Chicago Gymnastic District's popular scientific lecture series and entertainments, at the Liberty Turnhall, 3417 South Halsted Street, was well supported by our Germans, and the Gymnasts in particular. The committee, with Dr. John A. Schmidt, chairman, Louis A. Scherbaum, Vincent Kaukusch, Frank Kyas, and Paul Schmidt, arranged an excellent program which was given in grand style.</p>
   <p>The overture, "The Chimes of Corneville," was the opening number of the entertainment, followed by the lecture of Adolph G. Vogler, editor of The Western Druggist, who spoke on "Child Investigation, the Results of the Department of Education." He restricted himself mostly to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>report of C. Victor Campbell and Professor Fred W. Smedley's findings at the Alcott School. His treatise was illustrated with drawings and tables. It received great acclaim.</p>
   <p>The next item on the program was J. V. Eichendorff's aria "Evening," a splendid offering of the Southside Gymnast's Song Club, which brought requests for an encore.</p>
   <p>Dr. Emanuel Schreiber gave a very intrinsic and excellent treatise on "Goethe, as an Epic Poet and Dramatist," wherein he uncovered many new angles.</p>
   <p>The remaining numbers consisted of a piano solo by Henry Verbeck, and several recitations by L. Saltiel.</p>

   <p>A ball and lively dancing were a fitting finale to the evening's entertainment.</p>
