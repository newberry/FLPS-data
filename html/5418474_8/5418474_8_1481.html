   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde (Turner Association) held a closed session yesterday which lasted until half-past ten o'clock in the evening. A general meeting was in progress after that. When the reporter of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung was admitted, the "Open Letter" published by us in a previous issue was under discussion.</p>
   <p>Max Stern addressed the assembly. He regarded the letter as proof that the Germans were not as indifferent toward the Turnhalle (Turner Hall) and the financial difficulties involving the structure as the members surmised at the last meeting. "The advice given to the Turngemeinde is very sensible, apparently." He [Max Stern] believed that the Authors' Carnival proposed <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by the Turngemeinde could not be produced successfully--either from the artistic or the financial angle. As to the production of scenes from the works of famous German authors, the Association would have many beautiful women available, but not enough of them to act the parts. A large number of ladies is opposed to "fairs" in general, and justly so. What woman would enjoy wheedling out of a businessman a costly gift for the occasion, and then urge several hundred young men "to buy a chance"? What father would like to see his daughters acting in such a manner? The methods by which fairs make money are detested by many people, and rightly so.</p>
   <p>And that is not all! The preparatory work for an "Authors' Carnival" would require an outlay of at least two thousand dollars for decorations, costumes, music, and so forth, according to the estimate of the committee. He [Max Stern] did not believe that there would be a big surplus under the circumstances. He felt convinced, however, that the ladies would be able to provide valuable gifts for the occasion.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>There is another question which Max Stern asked the assembly to consider: "What satisfaction would a businessman have in providing a present which costs twenty-five dollars wholesale, is raffled off at the fair for twenty dollars, at an expense of eight dollars, which leaves a net income of twelve dollars for the Turngemeinde?" Max Stearn believed that a businessman would rather donate twenty-five dollars in cash, knowing that thereby the Turngemeinde would get the benefit of the entire amount. He did not doubt that the Association would be supplied, free of charge, with beverages amounting to five hundred dollars in value, but after subtracting the cost of holding the carnival the profit would be only a hundred and twenty-five dollars.</p>
   <p>"It is not necessary to go to a lot of trouble," continued the speaker. "The facts should be presented to the public in a simple, truthful manner, and it should be explained what difficulties were encountered in rebuilding the Turnhalle. Of what benefit would the carnival be, even if two thousand <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>dollars were obtained? In two years we'll face the same problem again. Of course, the last fair was a great success, and about seven or eight thousand dollars was received, but at that time the members of the Association made more money, and they provided most of the funds by digging into their pockets. On that occasion, the Turngemeinde was able to obtain two thousand dollars in two evenings from the members alone. Today the Association is poor--the Turngemeinde members gave as much money as they could. But, strictly speaking, the last fair was not a success from the financial angle, since the prizes were worth twice as much as the amounts received."</p>
   <p>Toward the end, the speaker made a motion that the executive board and the fair committee be advised to consider the suggestions made in the open letter to the Turngemeinde, and formulate an answer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hunke was of the opinion that "self-preservation" should induce the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Turngemeinde to accept the proposals made in the open letter.</p>
   <p>"The public always regarded the Turnhalle more as a meeting place of Germans than as the specific property of the local Turngemeinde, and would therefore not ignore the appeal [for funds]. Above all, we must face reality. It cannot be expected that our Germans will help us in such a measure as we expect, without certain inducements. It might be possible to combine the various German clubs into a single unit."</p>
   <p>Mr. Fritsch said: "The gentlemen who wrote the open letter appear to be willing to help." He favored acceptance of the proposals.</p>
   <p>Mr. Weidemann spoke at length, advocating adoption of the suggestions, and was given tremendous applause at the conclusion of his speech. He said <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>that his employer had mentioned the letter and was of the opinion that the suggestions made were most sensible, and that, if the Turngemeinde would follow the advice, no liberal-minded German would refuse a contribution.</p>
   <p>Weidemann said that he also favored the carnival, because he believed it was preferable to do something in the matter than nothing at all, but that he thought the proposals made in the letter were by all means preferable. He thought that the Germans who contributed $30,000, eight years ago, to rebuild the Turnhalle, would certainly be willing to provide half as much now.</p>
   <p>"That would be the only solution. more than that, liquidating the debt would not be the only benefit! The German interest in gymnastics will be aroused anew, and our countrymen will again send their sons and daughters to the Turnhalle. When we have reached that phase, the Turbhalle will once <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>more be the center of German activity!"</p>
   <p>Julius Cohn said: "On October 12, 1871, three days after the Chicago Fire, many members decided to rebuild the hall, yet many of the unfortunates at the time were not able to save more than the clothes they wore. The members at that time paid $6,000 within a few months to pay off the mortgage which still encumbered the destroyed building. With the help of the Germans, and aided by many Americans, the new Turnhalle was built, the largest and most beautiful building of its kind in the country. Unfortunately, the price was $60,000 to $65,000 higher than the original estimate. But regardless of the hard times, the $75,000 mortgage and other debts, the Turnhalle managed to survive. The members did their utmost to save the structure, and were criticized repeatedly about their methods and efforts in replenishing the dwindling funds of the organization. Popularity contests involving politicians, and too much laxity in permitting people to attend masquerades, aroused more or less resentment.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>"Such occurrences would all be eliminated if $20,000 could be raised to pay the mortgage; that would enable the board to manage the hall in such a manner that it would be a credit to the Germans of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"The Turngemeinde does not want anything for nothing. Bonds may be issued as formerly. Whoever cannot pay one hundred dollars, may take a twenty-five-dollar bond, and this sum can be paid in four or five annual installments. If one cannot afford twenty-five dollars, then any amount will be welcomed. The most essential thing the Turngemeinde would have to do would be to give a detailed financial statement. The board must show that good management prevails--then it can confidently appeal to the public."</p>
   <p>Staab called the assembly's attention to the fact that, just eight years ago to a day, the last meeting was held at the old Turnhalle before the fire destroyed the building, and fourteen days later the $7,500 (sic) mortgage <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>was paid. And in three months, thirty-two thousand dollars' worth of bonds were sold to finance the new building. Can't we do this again?</p>
   <p>W. Hettich said: "The gentlemen who signed the letter know that we cannot give any more money, and, doubtless, if we select a committee and appeal to the citizens for aid, they will not refuse. Everybody knows that arranging a carnival costs a lot of money, but no one can give assurance that a profit can be derived therefrom--besides, there is still time to consider the matter."</p>
   <p>He believed that $25,000 could readily be raised by following the suggestions outlined in the letter.</p>
   <p>"We must realize that this carnival would be the last fair which could be given; the income from masquerades covers current expenses, and other <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>clubs have already been given accommodations at the Turnhalle."</p>
   <p>He made a motion that a committee be named immediately.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goetz, treasurer of the Turngemeinde, said that the debts, including the outstanding bonds of the Turngemeinde, amount to $114,000.</p>
   <p>"The Turnhalle cost $125,000. In the beginning everything went well, and $12,000 was paid off, but, later, accumulating interest played havoc. Time and again the Turners dug into their pockets to pay interest. If the public were properly informed as to what an uphill fight has confronted the Association and the dozen men composing the board during the last six or seven years, then no question will arise about management."</p>
   <p>Peter Hand remarked that he was elated when he read the letter in the <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>Illinois Staats-Zeitung; the suggestions encouraged him, and he had hope again that the Turnhalle could be saved from foreclosure proceedings. The proposals given, said Hand, would be the only solution.</p>
   <p>"It would be an easy matter to compile a list of ten thousand names, people who would be willing to contribute to the cause. Aided by a committee with the courage to try again, we can raise the money in half a year."</p>
   <p>J. P. Hand's hopes were revived by the letter, and other businessmen with whom he had spoken expressed themselves very much in favor of the plan given in the letter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Blum's employer had said that he would gladly give one hundred dollars, and he would try to raise the same amount by appealing to his friends.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>Mr. Kohtz asked Mr. Stern what program Mr. Schoeninger would suggest to raise the money, since the latter's was the first signature on the letter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stern replied that he had made a motion to submit the letter to the executive board and to the fair committee for an answer, and for consideration of the matter in general.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps it would be best to let the executive board decide, but the fair committee has a right to be heard."</p>
   <p>Carl Meier, chairman of the fair committee, said that he wanted to make a motion separating the executive board from the fair committee. Considering that the proposals given in the letter are much better than holding a fair, there would be no objection to giving up the latter. He suggested, however, that it would be well to strike while the iron is hot. The general meeting <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>should not be postponed until next Wednesday; the board should be advised to call the meeting for next Sunday.</p>
   <p>Hunke was in favor of inviting the gentlemen who signed the letter to attend a meeting on Saturday.</p>
   <p>Stern replied that we ought to be grateful for the good advice; to follow it is up to the Turngemeinde.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Hettich, Cohen, J. P. Hand, Max Stern, and others continued the debate, and finally a substitute motion of Cohen was adopted, whereby the executive board was instructed to answer the letter.</p>
   <p>Goetz promised to have the financial report ready for today's session.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>After giving a vote of thanks to the signers of the letter, the assembly adjourned.</p>
   <p>Open Letter to the Chicago Turngemeinde</p>
   <p>"The recent announcements from your organization verify the misgivings we have entertained for a long time. We, and most Germans, have admired the energetic and efficient management which has enabled you to maintain the Turnhalle, center of German culture in Chicago, during a period when even the most capable businessmen found it difficult to avoid failure in their own enterprises. We regret exceedingly that you are facing misfortune at a time when most business houses are experiencing an upward trend after five or six years of continued anxiety, and have at last reached that phase where one might exclaim, "The fight was not in vain!" We sympathize with you in your predicament, and we can understand the motives which prompt <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>the members of your association to hold a fair, an 'Authors' Carnival,' as you call it. But we have little use for fairs which are incessantly repeated, which irk the people in general, and which prove of definite detriment to small businessmen.</p>
   <p>"We do not doubt in the least your ability to make a success of your contemplated fair; we know that you can produce a splendid festival. We are also aware that such attractions cost considerable money, and therefore we fear that you will gain little, even if the attendance were exceptionally good; that your net proceeds will not be sufficient to prevent the financial debacle you are facing.</p>
   <p>"We therefore offer a well-meant suggestion which--if accepted--will meet with the approval of all Germans who are aware of the efforts of the Turngemeinde in its constant fight against legal inhibitions, prohibitions, <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>and other matters vitally affecting Germans. The Germans realize that they cannot leave the Turngemeinde and its hall--symbol of German culture--in the lurch. All our compatriots will help--commensurate with their ability--and will do so without a fair.</p>
   <p>"Call a mass meeting or see the citizens after naming ward committees, and we'd like to find the German who would not contribute something in his own or the community's interest, in furtherance of liberty.</p>
   <p>"By following these suggestions you will be more successful than by holding a fair, and, incidentally, it will meet with the approval of many of our citizens.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully,</p>
   <p>"Adolph Schoeninger....Herman Raster...."</p>
   <p>[Altogether 28 names].</p>
