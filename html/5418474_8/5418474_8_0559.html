   <p>The German Press Club assembled yesterday at McVickers Theater in honorable commemoration of the deceased German-American journalist, Herman Raster. The solemnity of the occasion was impressive and dignified.</p>
   <p>The stage was draped in black and decorated with flowers and palms. Upon the platform the German Men's Choir and others had assembled. Playing the grand imposing funeral march by Chopin signified the beginning of the ceremonies. Thereupon the president of the Press Club, Mr. T. Janssen, introduced Mr. Rosenthal as one of the oldest friends of the departed. Deeply moved, Mr. Rosenthal dwelled at length on the many distinguished services and noble characteristics of his deceased friend.</p>
   <p>Following him Dr. E. Preetorion, the publisher of Westlichen Post (Western Post) who came from St. Louis to pay tribute to his departed <span class="page-break">\2</span>colleague, expressed himself as considering the dead friend as the most outstanding German-American journalist. They have fought shoulder to shoulder as true and loyal German-Americans and had defended the old fatherland as well as their adopted one, whenever the honor or liberty of either was attacked, although their views in other respects had been different.</p>
   <p>A song by the Men's Choir, magnificently performed, made a deep and lasting impression. Mr. Thomas Bryan, Vice-President of the World's Fair, eulogized the departed. Several other speakers were present, giving tributes of honor and praise.</p>
   <p>A solo by Mrs. Brentano with dramatic presentation and another song by the Men's Choir brought the cermonies to a close.</p>
