   <p>H. Raster, editor for twenty years of the "Illinois Staats Zeitung," died of heart disease..... Raster was one of the most capable pioneers and fighters for the German cause in the United States.</p>
   <p>His efforts to make the German-American press a true instrument of the people of German origin were well recognized. Raster, like all peculiar people, possessed many prejudices. Quite frequently a sense of contempt for the world and men swept over him, and this explains his bitter and cynical attacks on new ideas and movements, particularly against labor unions. There is no doubt that he misjudged them, but his criticism helped to protect the labor movement against many fantastic attitudes and actions.</p>
