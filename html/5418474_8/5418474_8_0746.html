   <p>A film entitled "The Ordeal," which has been showing at the Bijou Dream Theatre on State Street, will be barred from further display. The movie has met with strong opposition from German groups. As a result of the opinion of Assistant Corporation Counsel George Reker, Second Assistant Chief of Police, Major Funkhouser, head of the vice squad, will prohibit the display of the film. In an interview which he granted to an Abendpost reporter, he said that according to the opinion of the Corporation Counsel a city ordinance prohibiting the display of pictures inciting race riots will furnish the legal power to ban the movie. The film shows war pictures which are downright insulting to any German. The showing was also prohibited in New York by court order.</p>
