   <p>The State Supreme Court yesterday rejected the appeal of Arthur Lorenz. He is the former editor-in-chief of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, and was sentenced by Judge Pam to six months in the workhouse and fined one dollar for criminal libel directed against the American Legion.</p>
   <p>In his defense plea, he pointed out that he had not attacked any specific person. In its decision handed down yesterday, the court of highest appeal argued that libeling a class or a group has the same tendency to incite to a breach of the peace or to inflame the populace as the libeling of an individual. Such a libel is punishable even if it could be proved that it was not intended for individuals of the class or group in question.</p>
   <p>Judge Heard handed down a dissenting opinion.</p>
