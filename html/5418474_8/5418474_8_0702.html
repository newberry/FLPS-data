The purpose is to enlighten the great masses of the American people by giving an unbiased account of the facts, thus facilitating a more objective and just evaluation of the situation. The first of the pamphlets, entitled Germany and the Peace of Europe, by Professor Ferdinand Schevill of the History Department of the University of Chicago, will give a description in rough outlines of the European situation from the time of the Franco-Prussian war up to the present.
