   <p>The masquerades of the Vorwarts Turnverein have been famous for as long as the Turnverein has been in existence. The expectation of the public was consequently very great and the big hall of the theater on West 12th Street was filled with spectators at an early hour. Numerous lamps lighted the hall and numerous pictures represented famous people from European history.</p>
   <p>A great procession started from the stage at 10 o'clock. A page (Miss Vietinghof) rode at the head of the procession. A pulpit was built on a huge wagon from which Moody (Mr. Meyer) was stretching out his hands in a benediction. President Grant was represented leaving the Capitol, astride of a rooster, loaded with money and cigars, drawn by four mice.</p>
   <p>After Prince Carnival had made a speech, Moody said a prayer whereupon all the participants fell crying into each other's arms. The masquerade was a great success and was not marred by any unpleasant disturbance.</p>
