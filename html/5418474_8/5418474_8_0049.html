   <p>Mask Ball of the Turn Society will to-morrow night have the most wonderful carnival of the season.</p>
   <p>It is rather late, but better late than never. The preparations for this great event have been so tremendous-hence-this late date. The program is the greatest ever put up. The festival will take place at the North side Turnhall.</p>
   <p>The big Parade with the wonderful costumes will be one of the greatest event of the evening. The floor committee has arranged that only members or persons with invitation cards can enter the Hall.</p>
