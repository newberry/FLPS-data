   <p>The installation ceremony of the newly elected officials of the Hermann Sisters Benefit society was held at a public meeting yesterday afternoon at Apollo Hall, Blue Island Avenue, near Twelfth Street. The following lodges of the order were involved: Thusnelda No. 1, Harmony No. 3, Hermann No. 4, Concordia o. 5, Faithful Sisters No. 6, Victoria No. 7, Friendship No. 8, Gross Park No. 9, Germania No. 10, Bavaria No. 11, Hope No. 12, and Liberty lodge No. 13.</p>
   <p>The Grand president, Mrs. Marie Kamel, gave the festive speech, which was given deserved acclaim.</p>
   <p>The order was founded in 1896, and now has nearly 2,000 members. The cash reserve of the order and its separate lodges are very gratifying, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>although they originated rather recently. During periods of illness, the members receive from $4 to $5 per week, and all possible assistance in case of accident; death benefits are $200. Initiation and dues are very low. The lodges are particularly interested in the German language and German customs.</p>
