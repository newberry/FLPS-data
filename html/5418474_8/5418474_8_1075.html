   <p>An interesting lecture on the subject of wireless telegraphy was given by Professor M. Frank at the North Side Turner Hall last night. He said: "The cost of the experiment of wireless telegraphy from England to France across the channel, amounted to 24,000,000 marks. However, with a similar sum of money at my disposal, I could demonstrate in a rather short time wireless telegraphy to New York and even Hamburg."</p>
   <p>Professor Frank, who is associated with the Electro-Technical School of the society, used his own apparatus to demonstrate his explanations before a small but select audience.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, Professor Frank did not try to conceal the fact that the experiment is still in its infancy, because electricity, which is the most important factor in the experiment, is an almost unknown force, <span class="page-break">2</span>recognized for its effectiveness only. It is beyond doubt, however, that this invention when completed will replace the present wire and cable communications. This assumption is justified, if for no other reason than that atmospherical conditions would have no bearing on the same. While describing the apparatus which he had used during the lecture, Mr. Frank showed the audience a radiator he invented [used for outgoing messages] which is constructed from a special preparation, the compound of which he did not disclose.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Professor Frank demonstrated his apparatus by sending wireless telegraphic messages in every direction throughout the hall, and then reversing the procedure by receiving messages from the audience.</p>
   <p>The lecture and experiments were followed closely by an interested and appreciative group of listeners.</p>
