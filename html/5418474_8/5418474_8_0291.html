   <p>Last night, before the members of the Germania Association of Chicago, at the Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute, Martin Schuetze, Professor of "German History and Literature," at the Chicago University, spoke about the modern German Drama and its principal representatives. He showed in a most fascinating manner, the three directions of drama in modern Germany and selected a few dramas, analyzing their fundamentals.

The historic drama: its characters are not stark reality, but patriotic conceptions, not the works of poets. Fulda is its exponent, referred to as: "a clever imitator."</p>
