   <p>The National Festival of the"Cannstatter Society" had the appearance, as if all the Swabians had taken a holiday and come to this country to help celebrate; this means of course, that there was an enormous attendance.</p>
   <p>At the head of the festive procession was the Marshal of Festivities, Hummel, surrounded by a group of Knights and adjutants on phantastically decorated wagons. A number of allegoric pictures, depicting the erection of the University of Jubinger by Count Eberhardt, Friedrich Barbarossa in the Kyffhauser, a picture from Schiller's Glocke, a Swabian marriage and the return from church, 64 riders, representing Wurttemberg's 64 districts, and many others of interest. The speaker, Mr. Hermann Sigel, of Milwaukee, remarked: "With all due respect to our friends and comrades in the battle for the object of our desire, only thus can we conquer, what threatens us all, that is:hypocrisy, enslavement, etc. It may seem strange, to mention all this in a festive speech, <span class="page-break">2</span>but politics are so interwoven with our existence, that it would be natural at gatherings like this, when we Germans would like to frolic to ask the question, whether we have any reason to be proud of our existence? Yes, we do, as long as faith and fraternity are uniting us. Hail to the German brotherhood!"</p>
   <p>The speaker was greatly acclaimed.</p>
