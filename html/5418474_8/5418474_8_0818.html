   <p>From now on free lessons in drawing will be given in this school, 58 Clybourn Avenue every Sunday.</p>
   <p>The Hildebrandt brothers will teach all the children attending this school who have reached the eighth grade the art of drawing, and hope to accomplish substantial results. They expect that the parents of these children will insist on their frequent attendance at the classes. The drawing lessons are from 1:30 to 4.</p>
