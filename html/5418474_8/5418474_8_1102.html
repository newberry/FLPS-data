   <p>At yesterday's meeting of the "Chicago Turngemeinde" (Gymnastic Assoc.) seven of their members lost their membership on account of their disrespect toward certain officials of the association. Mr. Nettelhorst, acting chairman, extended an opportunity to the defendant to defend or explain their attitude. Four of the members accused of disrespect made use of it. After they got through talking, the other members present voted 45 to 15 in favor of ousting the unruly men.</p>
   <p>After business matters were taken care of, Dr. Max De Vries lectured on the subject: "The destruction of the world". The speaker undertook to fascinate his audience for one hour and was compensated by an extended applause.</p>
