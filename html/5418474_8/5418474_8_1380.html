   <p>The Turner societies of this city are agitated over a matter that threatens to disrupt the largest organization in this district. The trouble has been brewing several years and has broken out in the stronghold of the Turners which is Chicago. The cause of the difficulty is a clause in the constitution of the national body; that only that body can expel a member of the individual societies; that no member of such a society can be ousted without the sanction of the national body, and that before the national body takes action the Turner is eligible to any office in the gift of such society.</p>
   <p>The North Chicago Turngemeinde, the most powerful of the Chicago societies, some time ago, tried one of its members for revealing society secrets, and other charges, and decided to expel him. Some of the members held that such action would be unconstitutional while others which the member expelled in spite of the constitution. The latter prevailed. This action raised a tempest and the Chicago district organization was called to make an investigation. This body agreed with the minority on the point of ejectment but found that the expelled member had joined the Garfield Turnverein. This is unconstitutional, and to render a decision on the delicate matter the District Board will meet in two weeks.</p>
   
   <p>The National Board will not be consulted in this matter by the District Board.</p>
   <p>The rebellion's north-siders are anxiously awaiting a decision from the National Board. The chances are that if the constitution is not changed on the point in question at the next National Convention in Washington in 1892, or before that time, that the North Chicago Turngemeinde will withdraw from the National organization. Such action would have the effect of disrupting the many Turner societies of this district, and the members of the various societies are using all their influence to dissuade the north-siders from taking any radical step.</p>
