   <p>The year-book of the German-American Historical Society of Illinois, is a festive publication in celebration of the 200th birthday of Baron Friedrich Wilhelm Von Steuben.</p>
   <p>Historically, the book, undoubtedly is the source of the most valuable information of the Steuben-years. It contains speeches and compositions by Richard Barthold, Dr. C. F. Hexamer, Brigadier-General Palmer, and Prof. Julius Goebel, as well as numerous letters and writings left by Von Steuben himself, which are published here for the first time and are offered to an extensive circle of readers.</p>
   <p>Of special interest is the first biography of Steuben, which was written by the courageous pioneer Christoph David Ebeling, and which is published in the year-book.</p>
   <p>The material, which increased in the course of years, especially during the festival year, to a great extent, has been arranged and edited by Prof. Julius Goebel.</p>
