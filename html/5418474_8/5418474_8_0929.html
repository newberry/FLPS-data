   <p>"There is no justification for a conflict over evolution and the Church. It cannot be denied that there are indeed quite convincing proofs of the truth of the theory of evolution. But it is by no means the concern of the Church or of the State to influence these theories by means of force, to interpret them in some untoward manner, or to favor the creating of laws and prohibitions which would stand in the way of teaching evolution."</p>
   <p>These were approximately the words with which Father Frederic Siedenburg began his lecture yesterday afternoon at the last luncheon of the season given by the German Club at the Morrison Hotel. The large hall was filled to capacity, proof of the interest which these social affairs arouse and how they are appreciated.</p>
   
   <p>Yesterday afternoon's lecture was, in a way, to be the answer to Clarence Darrow's speech given before the Club on March 14 on the topic, "Evolution".</p>
   <p>That the speaker had no intention of making this frequently discussed topic an opportunity for indulging in personalities, or of dealing with it as an official representative of the Church, could be understood from his opening words. It was soon apparent that the lecturer is a thorough scientist, teaching, as he does, at Loyola University.</p>
   <p>In a calm and realistic manner, making full use of science to substantiate his statements, the speaker devoted more than an hour to his lecture.</p>
   <p>"Evolution is a science and has nothing to do with the Church. No one, not even the State, has a right to prohibit the teaching of evolution as a theory. Evolution as a scientific hypothesis should be taught without bias to those who are eager to learn and to know.</p>
   
   <p>The citizens of the state of Tennessee have no justification whatever for the law they recently passed forbidding the teaching in public schools of theories which contradict the Biblical story of creation. The Constitution of the United States provides for the separation of State and Church, and for this reason public schools are prevented, and prohibited by law, from teaching any theory as an established fact, whether it is evolution or any religion.</p>
   <p>Then the speaker discussed the assertions made by evolutionists at some length, and showed that they differ widely in their findings.</p>
   <p>"Of late a number of scientists have adopted the theory that man is not descended from the ape in a straight line, but that man as well as ape spring from a creature in the remote past whose existence and manner of living remain almost unknown. Neither Darwin nor Lamarck ever considered the original forms of existence; they assumed the existence of certain types of animals and plants which later evolved through natural selection and the survival of the fittest.</p>
   <p>"Evolution as viewed in relation to the human race suggests the question: Has man evolved from a creature which cannot be called human, or was he human right from the beginning? As far back as historical records are available there has always existed what we call man. The evidence most frequently adduced in favor of evolution is some petrified remains of a few creatures, uncovered in various parts of the earth. Upon critical examination of these fossils, it soon becomes clear that they come from beings which are in some cases decidedly human, and in others as decidedly simian. That man is derived from an animal is not a proven fact; it is rather a theory which sounds plausible."</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the lecturer quoted a few statements of Alfred Russell Wallace, Darwin's assistant: "Nature's great enigma forces upon us the certainty that creation must have taken place at some time; that the earth was given something which it formerly did not have. Then followed a second act of creation when man evolved from his simian ancestors and that was bestowed upon him which we call soul. This soul can be explained by no theory of evolution; it makes an impossible chasm between man and beast. Evolution can explain much, but not the beginning and the end of life. It is an hypothesis built upon a good foundation."</p>
   <p>With concentration and the greatest attention the audience listened to the speech, which was at times rather difficult to understand. They proved by this undivided attention that they were ready to accept the speaker's discourse as an enrichment of their store of knowledge. Prolonged applause rewarded the priest for his efforts.</p>
   <p>Mr. Richard Czerwonky, the well-known violinist and director of the local Philharmonic Orchestra, gave pleasure with his masterful playing. Mr. William Schwartz pleased the audience with two songs.</p>
