   <p>Paul F. Mueller (1857-1931), publisher of the Abendpost and Sonntagpost, died this morning after a long illness. The deceased reached the biblical age and even exceeded it by four years. A kind destiny allotted him a full, whole life, a life which he spent in an honorable, fruitful activity. Paul Mueller was a man of work. Although he was sick for a long time, he nevertheless appeared daily in the editorial office of the Abendpost. He did not appear today; death had taken the pen out of his tireless hands.</p>
   <p>A Life of Work</p>
   <p>Paul F. Mueller was born in Krimmitschan, Saxony, July 7, 1857, the son of Helmuth and Augusta Leonhardt Mueller. He attended school at the place of his birth and completed his education at the Cooper Institute of New York, to which city he came with his parents in 1871. Already in his younger years, he showed an inclination for journalism, writing articles for German and <span class="page-break">\2</span>English Newspapers. At last, breaking loose of his original commercial career, he devoted himself entirely to journalism and started on this career forty years ago on the Philadelphia Gazette, under its founder, Carl Theodore Mayer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mueller came to Chicago as correspondent for an Eastern newspaper during the World's Fair in 1893, remaining here after its close.</p>
   <p>He was active as a journalist in Chicago up to the last day of his life. Entering the Abendpost in 1894 as a writer of editorials, he soon became editor in chief. In this position, he elevated the journalistic level of the paper he had taken over in 1914 to such a degree, that the paper's editorial policy became respected and acknowledged all over the country.</p>
   <p>With untiring ardor, Mr. Mueller, in spite of his illness, was until the last day of his life at the head of the editorial staff of the Abendpost. Very sick after an operation performed a year ago, he was forced to remain at his home, 2114 Estes Avenue Rogers Park, where he was being nursed back to health by his <span class="page-break">\3</span>wife, Julia M. Weisenbach - Lucke, of Hamburg, and his son, Paul, who is to succeed him in the Abendpost. Despite their care, he was often compelled to retire to his estate "Perdido Bay,"in Alabama, where he enjoyed growing oranges.</p>
   <p>Even during his hours of recreation, never forgetting his beloved journalism, he frequently wrote long articles under the southern sky of Alabama, articles which appeared in the Abendpost and Sonntagpost.</p>
   <p>Besides his widow and only son, Mr. Mueller is mourned by three stepchildren: Mrs. Emma Julius, Mrs. Berta Matenaers, and William B. Lucke.</p>
   <p>The funeral will be held Monday, January 12, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
