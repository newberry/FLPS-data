   <p>Trump is the title of a German illustrated weekly paper, semi-comic in its nature that made its appearance in this city yesterday. It is published by Hon Edward Runnel, Esq. Allowing for the usual drawbacks incident to an initial publication Trump makes its appearance in a taking shape and in receiving many ecomiums.</p>
   <p>The title page illustrates the title. About a table are seated a monarch, a priest, and a bondholder. The former plays a card with a crown and scepter, the priest plays are marked with a cross, the bondholder presents are marked "bonds" Liberty, standing erect, plays the ace of spades represented by the national shield, labelled "Liberty" That is trumpo. A happy illustration is one entitled" The farmers' war; The Grangers Crossing the track of Monopoly."</p>
   <p>The literary features are poems by Mr. Binder and Emil Dietzsch.</p>
