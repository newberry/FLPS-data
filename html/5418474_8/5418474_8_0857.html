   <p>The elementary school of the Chicago Turngemeinde (Gymnastic Community) was reopened on January 1. As is generally known, the school is conducted by Mr. Lang, an excellent instructor, whose success as a teacher is apparent to those who have watched the youngsters perform.</p>
   <p>We consider it our duty to inform the German people of the North Side that there is no better method of developing their children, mentally or physically, than by having them attend classes at this school.</p>
   <p>There the children are disciplined, exercised, and taught good posture and carriage. Many a puny child has been strengthened by exercise; many who have suffered from curvature of the spine have grown straight.</p>
   <p>We believe that parents are actually neglecting their duty if they fail to let their children participate in the classes of the gymnasium.</p>
