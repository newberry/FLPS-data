   <p>At yesterday's Turn-Exercises, most of our German Turners were excluded from such exhibition of gymnastics, at which they would have had a chance of winning prizes, nevertheless, Turner Wilhelm Zoller, of the Turn-Society Vorwarts, won the first prize, a gold medal, for his extra-ordinary work.</p>
   <p>It must have been anticipated, what will happen, therefore when the exclusion of the German group, from other exercises resorted to.</p>
   <p>It is probably due to this measure, that anybody else, had a chance to win a prize.</p>
