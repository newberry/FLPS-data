   <p>The "National Zeitung" (National Newspaper) which up till now was a weekly, working for the Republican Party, is issued from now on as a daily morning paper with eight pages and seven columns. The arrangement of the reading matter is patterned according to "German" methods, but its political views are supposed to be exclusively nationalistically American.</p>
   <p>Political independence is in the minds of the publishers, a half-hearted affair only; out of the "misguided" German-Americans and they will try to make strict Republicans.</p>
   <p>The "National Newspaper" is well edited, rich in contents and low in price.</p>
