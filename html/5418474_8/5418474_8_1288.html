   <p>On occasion of a banquet which the Press Club had arranged last night, it was discussed about the introductory steps to the preparations for the olympic Games that shall be held in Chicago in two years. The first of these games were held in Athens, the second in Paris, and now Chicago has been selected as the place for the third games.</p>
   <p>The costs of this arrangement to which all sport fans in which all parts of the world will be invited are estimated at $2,000,000.00. Mr. B. J. Rosenthal expressed in an address his positive expectation that the raising of this fund will offer no difficulties and that also foreign governments are willing to carry a share of the costs.</p>
