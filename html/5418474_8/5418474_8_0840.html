   <p>The Director of the "Deutsch-Amerikanische Academis von Chicago" (German-American Academic of Chicago), 623 West Adams Street, has just published a very interesting yearly report of which we cite the following:-</p>
   <p>"On September 1, 1883 began the current school-year with 85 day pupils, who will be taught by 6 permanent teachers while the number of the private evening class attending pupils is 35-40, so that altogether 120 to 130 pupils are taught in the school."</p>
   <p>In the institute there are now eight teachers. Although the number of pupils has more than doubled, the income is not sufficient to cover the expenditures because the maintenance of the System has to be considered before effecting savings. I am pleased to state that in general the progress was highly satisfactory. Not only have the aims of the classes been reached, but a lively rivalry of the pupils could be observed.</p>
