   <p>During the annual festival of the Chicago Schuetzenverein (Marksmen's Club) last Summer, the delegates of the marksmen's clubs of Milwaukee, Alma, and Monroe, Wisconsin; St. Louis, Missouri; Rock Island, and Highland, Illinois; southwest Chicago; and the local club founded the Northwestern Schuetzenbund (Marksmen's Alliance), and decided that the Chicago Schuetzenverein should establish headquarters and make the necessary arrangements for the first annual Bundesschuetzenfest (Marksmen's Alliance festival).</p>
   <p>After sending invitations to all the marksmen's clubs in the west, the following associations, aside from the above, expressed their willingness to participate: Bloomington, Joliet, Princeton, Aurora, and Collinsville, Illinois; New York City; Dubuque, Iowa; Stillwater, Minnesota; Sheboygan, Wisconsin; and Detroit, Michigan. It is expected that clubs of other cities will also join.</p>
   <p>The master marksmen of the Club are convinced that at least two hundred active <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>riflemen will participate in the festival, and have made their plans accordingly.</p>
   <p>Medals, diplomas and prizes aggregating five thousand dollars are offered, in addition to the usual donations given during such contests by riflemen and enthusiasts.</p>
   <p>A ball is being arranged for Easter Sunday at Klare's Well to enable the Chicago Schuetzenverein to provide a valuable donation and, undoubtedly, no genuine marksman will be absent.</p>
   <p>The time for the festival has not been definitely established at this writing; however, the last week in June has been tentatively selected.</p>
