   <p>Among the agencies that contributed most powerfully to the enormous success of the Republicans in the late city election was the Staats Zeitung, which has been independent in politics for a long time past. Last fall it leaned to the Tilden side, and helped very potentially to give him the 5,000 majority he got in this city.</p>
   <p>But the wise and noble course President Hayes has pursued since his accession to the presidency has quite won the heart of the Staats Zeitung. The morning after the Democratic nominations were made the Staats Zeitung threw a harpoon into the ticket which mortally wounded it in the eyes of the independent Germans. The subsequent blows it gave to bummer nominations destroyed all the remaining chances they had for election, so far as the German wards were concerned. Lieb and his Daily Democrat were utterly powerless to prevent the divorce of the Germans from the Irish in city politics. He only held those Germans who were Democrats in 1872 and always. On the arverage ticket, leaving out the run of the Mayor, which was exceptional, the Republican majority is between 6,000 and 7,0000 Last fall it was 5,000 for Tilden. The Germans, under the powerful leadership of the Staats Zeitung, contributed fully one-half of the gains. They were just as anxious for economy, retrenchment, and low taxes as the Americans, and are entitled <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to a full share of the honor of the great victory over the tax-devourers.</p>
