   <p>The Northside Group held its regular agitation meeting yesterday evening at 58 Clybourn Avenue. Comrade Meng presided. It was intended to hold the discussion in English, but considering that everyone present understood German this language was chosen.</p>
   <p>The minutes of the last meeting caused a lively debate over anarchism and communism which we hope will lead to the clarification of views.</p>
