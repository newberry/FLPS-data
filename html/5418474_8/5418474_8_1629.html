   <p>The commission of Lincoln Park has given permission to the Schwaben and the Turner Clubs to remove the Schiller statue from its present position before the Greenhouse and to place it in front of the building of the Academy of Science at Clark and Center Street, near the entrance of the Park. The Goethe Statue as well could be placed there. The Germans of Chicago had paid $15,000 for this monument. The costs for the placing of the Goethe and the removal of the Schiller statue must be paid by the Clubs.</p>
