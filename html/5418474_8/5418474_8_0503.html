   <p>Rumors fly thick and fast. It is well to stick to facts, at least, where they are easily obtainable. Rumors relating to this newspaper can easily be substantiated, or proved false, by the very simple method of asking us about the facts. All sorts of rumors seem to be about. One is that this company is now controlled by a Chicago English language newspaper. That is untrue. No newspaper in any language Whatever controls this company, nor does any person, firm, corporation, association, political party, religious sect, business venture or government control this news-paper, or the company which publishes it; except the stockholders of the company. Another rumor is, that the stock of this company has been sold to persons who were formerly not stockholders. That is equally untrue in so far as no stock of this company has changed hands since August 1st, 1914. Since the European war broke out. The very same persons who publish this newspaper control the company and have controlled it ever since the latter date. Another rumor is, that the Illinois Staats Zeitung was forced by the Administration at Washington to change its policy in reference to itself and the war. That also is untrue. This newspaper is true to its principles, and endorses the same policies that it always has. It appears, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>however, that those policies, which were and are endorsed by this paper, have been thoroughly misunderstood.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung always was and is, today, an American newspaper printed in the German language. Before war broke out between the United States and Germany, this newspaper declared at two different times, that it would support the United States in any war, even in a war against Germany. On april 6th, 1917, the day after Congress passed the war resolution, this paper reiterated that declaration. It has supported the administration in its war program ever since. It is loyal to America as the wisdom of its Editors see how the best interests of the United States are to be served.</p>
   <p>At the present time the Illinois Staats Zeitung, has dropped all partisan politics and is neither Republican, Democrat, nor Socialist. It is American. Politics should not enter the discussions of important topics of the day. Non-partisanship should rule. Everybody, irrespective of political leaning, should be American to the core, and do his level best to serve the best interests of our country even if that means support of a Democratic administration. The Illinois Staats Zeitung does so cheerfully and fully. However, just criticism of the conduct of the war is not only <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>necessary but even advisable provided, always, that the motive underlying the criticism is an honest desire to aid our country in its hour of trial, and is not an endeavor to embarrass those in whose hands are placed the duties and responsibilities of waging a successful war. This newspaper does not desire to criticize and will refrain from doing so as long as possible, perhaps longer than wise, because much more harm than good is usually done by criticsm of officials for acts committed during war time. The Administration has been remarkably successful and careful in its undertakings. It has shown breadth of vision and determination in following policies, and has earned the support of all fair minded Americans in its efforts to win the war and end it soon. Support should be given ungrudgingly.</p>
