   <p>It was a splendid meeting, indeed, the one held last night by the Schwabian Society and conducted by its president,Eugen Niederegger. To the $10,000 in contributions collected by Mr. Niederegger during the last twenty years toward the erection of the Goethe monument, $5,000 was added last night.</p>
   <p>Since the plan for the long wished Goethe monument is about to materialize, it took little persuasion on the part of Harry Rubens, Karl Haerting, and Alderman Traub, of the Schwabian Society, to obtain this last large contribution.</p>
   <p>Although $20,000 was raised during the past few weeks, $20,000 is still needed to cover the cost of the erection of the statue.</p>
   
   <p>The Schwabian Society has a membership of 1200, to which 30 new members will be added soon.</p>
