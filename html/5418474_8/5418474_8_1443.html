   <p>Under the chairmanship of Mr. Otto Zeitz, a special session of the Nord Chicago Schutzenverein [North Chicago Rifle Club] took place last night at Folz's Hall, with a large number of members present. After two prospective members were recommended and four new members admitted to the club, the discussion about the construction of a Schutzenhalle [rifle range] took quite a long time. According to a resolution adopted at the last meeting, the following offers for the construction of a range designed and submitted by Mr. Blumenthal, architect, had been received: Mr. Adams, $5,363; Mr. Peter J. Hurter, $5,524; Mr. Spiess, $5,740 and Mr. Jung, $5,875. Since Mr. Adams, according to some members, had practically withdrawn his offer, only Mr. Hurter's proposal was considered, and after a lengthy debate it was resolved to sign a contract with Mr. Hurter for immediate construction. The terms of payment made by the contractor are as follows: one thousand dollars after half completion; one thousand dollars after final completion; and the balance in monthly installments of five hundred dollars. After minor business details were taken care of the meeting adjourned.</p>
