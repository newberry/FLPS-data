   <p>The classes increase from week to week and the lessons have already begun in all existing classes. The pupils are made familiar with the early principles of the music in an easy and comfortable manner by the intuitive method and musical writing lessons of Mr. and Mrs. Katzenberger, which give them a sound foundation for their whole life. On the request of numerous applicants from districts where no classes have been held yet the following new classes have been opened; Central Gymnastic Hall, 1113 Milwaukee Avenue for Friday afternoon; Grand Crossing (Gymnastic Hall) Tuesday Afternoon; South Chicago, Monday Afternoon. In the course of last week Mr. Katzenberger was introduced by a member of the town council, Mr. Vierling to the chief director, Davis, who welcomes the excellent undertaking; and the artistic motives and actions of the Germans in Chicago.</p>
   <p>He encouraged Mr. Katzenberger to continue the good work. Applicantions of new pupils can be made at the residence of Mr. G. Katzenberger, 633 N. Clark Street.</p>
