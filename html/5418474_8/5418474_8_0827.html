   <p>Encouraged by the results of the founding of the Sunday school on the North West Side by the Workingmen's Educational Society, and in order to meet a long-felt necessity, this society last Sunday opened another progressive school in the Thalia Hall.</p>
   <p>The attendance was close to 100 children who, divided into two classes, were taught by an instructor and an instructress.</p>
   <p>We quite safely expect that number to be doubled within a short time.</p>
