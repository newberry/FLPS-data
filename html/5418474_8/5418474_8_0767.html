   <p>Under the management of Miss Recca Dormeyer an English-German School will be opened at 557 La Salle Avenue on September 15th. The instruction will be given in English in all those branches that are taught in Public schools, but other branches like History, Natural History, Drawing, will be taught in the German language. In this way the pupils will be trained right from the beginning in both languages, so they are able soon to master both languages alike. The director of the new school, Miss Recca Dormeyer, passed her teaching and director's examinations in Berlin; She also studied in London and Paris and passed her teacher's examination here, shortly after her arrival. The first school year will begin on September 15th and will end on June 19th.</p>
