   <p>Mr. August Boeklin, who is well known to our readers, through his interesting travel articles about Germany and Russia, has returned to Chicago recently to publish a weekly paper which will be known as Deutsch Amerikanische Verkehrs-zeitung, (The German American Commercial Newspaper, it could also be called, "trade and traffic" since the German word is ambiguous and of a broad meaning, trans.) It is intended as a guide to the old and new world and, as the publisher announced today, in its first issue, it will contain interesting stories, articles, and communications about European and American conditions. Under a special heading it will contain a limited directory of hotels and business houses, which it recommends to the travelling public.</p>
