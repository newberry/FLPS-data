   <p>When the Chicago Turngemeinde (Turner District) arranged an Old Settlers' festival four years ago, the association probably did not expect that the affair would develop into an annual festival. However, after a short time it became apparent that the affair was very popular and served, as nothing else could, to bring together the various [national] elements in the city and so promote good fellowship in general. The Old Settlers' picnic is not only of interest to Germans; it became a festival of the people in general, or, let us say, there are prospects that it will eventually be of interest to our inhabitants.</p>
   <p>This must have been obvious to all who saw the large group of Irish and Americans who came to Ogden's grove yesterday, and observed the great interest manifested by the old settlers--regardless of national origin--in the yarns told, and noticed the rapt attention of the youngsters who listened to stories of bygone days.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde was again favored by good weather--a delightful, though somewhat cool, day. It appeared to us that the crowd was even larger than that of last year. Probably more than five thousand people came to yesterday's festival. An indication of the large attendance may be had from the registration, since more than seventeen hundred old settlers of the city entered their names in the book.</p>
   <p>The afternoon and early evening hours were dedicated to youth, as is the custom at all popular festivals. There was the climbing contest, where boys could procure drums, trumpets, and other toys mounted out of reach; dancing was on the program, as was javelin throwing. All of this was calculated to amuse the crowd; but the climax came in the evening, when thousands of paper lanterns and calcium lights, as well as splendid fireworks lasting for several hours, illuminated the park. The pyrotechnic display was arranged by G. D. Zernitz.</p>
   
   <p>The festival started officially at six o'clock, when Emil Hoechster, president of the Turngemeinde, mounted the speaker's platform and addressed the crowd. He expressed his satisfaction that the Old Settlers' festival had proved to be so popular. He said that this was the fifth annual festival, and that each year showed greater attendance, so that we may well expect the festival to survive and to form a bond between our various nationals long after the originators of the festival have departed. It was apparent that the strictly German character of the festivities had faded, and that the aspect was that of a general festival comprising all groups of people. The speaker said that he hoped this trend would continue in the future, so that the various elements in our city might become more firmly cemented together.</p>
   <p>He then introduced W. Bross as the next speaker.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bross said: "Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: Congratulations! Your festival, though primarily a social affair, has taken on a certain historical significance, since prizes or medals are given to the oldest settler as well as to the oldest persons in certain professions and commercial pursuits. It will undoubtedly be an interesting day for the recipients of the prizes as well for the donors. Of course, on such a day, subjects of a seriously controversial nature should be avoided. After all, you came here for amusement, and therefore it is our duty to make the meeting as pleasant an event as possible. However, I am fully aware of the intellectual attainments of those who asked me to speak here, and know that you will be interested in historical matters, or at least in some facts which broaden our knowledge. I do not know when the oldest settler came to this city; perhaps it can be ascertained during the course of the festival. But I do know that there were comparatively few Germans here when I came to Chicago in the year 1848.</p>
   <p>"At the festival given by the Calument Club on May 27, this year, 161 old settlers were listed as having come here prior to the year 1840, but not a single German name was evident. The list contains only English, Irish, and Scotch names. If there were Germans here prior to 1840, they either died, moved, or failed to register when the festival was held. Up to 1840, and probably for ten years after that, Chicago was an American city with American ideas and habits, which were but little influenced by the influx of foreign elements.</p>
   <p>"Changes, political dissensions, and revolutions occurring in one country often prove a blessing to another nation. And so it quite often happens that the better elements among a people--progressive persons, and individuals with a communal spirit and enterprising mind--seek new homes elsewhere. Instead of hoping for improvement and progress within the boundaries of their native land, these people their escape from conservatism and tradition by emigrating, and America becomes their goal because this nation offers a broader field for their activities, and also because the Americans have the same views as far as social questions are concerned. That is best shown by the German revolution of 1848-49. The most intelligent and patriotic contingent of the people insisted upon a more liberal and humane form of government, an administration based not on absolutism, not to say despotism or decree by royal proclamation. These Germans wanted a government which considered the social welfare of the people. The upheaval failed and, as a result, some of Germany's most outstanding men came to America, among them Carl Schurz, who became one of our greatest senators and cabinet members; Georg Schneider, one of our most eminent editors, who is now president of the National Bank of Illinois; George Raster, a highly educated man and indefatigable journalist; Caspar Butz, great speaker and public official; General Sigel and Colonel Fred Hecker, whose valor entitles them to be counted among our most outstanding heroes of the Civil War. And, aside from these few, legions came to our shores--Germany's greatest men, thousands, tens of thousands--and a large portion sought Chicago as a home. Gustavus Koerner and others came before them. Chicago had many Germans prior to 1849, as the Staats-Zeitung was founded in 1846; it was a weekly paper at that time. After the German revolution in 1848-49, the Germans became prominent here in business, politics and society. For several years there was some friction, which was to be expected.</p>
   <p>The Germans did not understand our ways, nor did we try to become friendly. Then around 1854, the Know-Nothing party was founded, and its conduct spread terror among the immigrants, but the organization came to life chiefly because of the peculiarities and progress of another large foreign element, while the fact that the new arrivals happened to be Germans was of little concern. I, for my part, instantly recognized the bigotry and untenableness of the party's principles, and wrote a number of articles in my paper, the Democratic Press, to expose the movement--and had the satisfaction of witnessing the eventual disintegration of the party. The friction and animosity engendered by this gospel of hate is now in the past--since we have been neighbors for a quarter-century. After we have seen the rapid growth of our city, its destruction by fire and its rebuilding, we can now look impartially at the process of assimilation, that beneficial influence which will make us a homogeneous people.</p>
   <p>"What were the good influences of the German immigration? In that connection, I would like to mention, first of all, the wearing of full beards, which were seldom seen until the Germans came and proved the usefulness of the hairy growth, quite aside from the manly appearance provided thereby and the respect thus created among the ladies. Concerning these beards, let is be said that many a formerly smooth-shaven American face can now be favorably compared with a true German countenance.</p>
   <p>"Second, the Germans gave us a very important and effective example in moderation. I believe that, at present, we have less intemperence among a half-million people than we had when Chicago had only eighteen thousand inhabitants. I base this assertion on my observations during the year 1848, when I first came here. However, one might point to the large number of saloons in the city and ask 'What can you say about that? Are not these taverns of German origin?' True, they are, and many Americans patronize the German saloons. But, as a rule, the frequenters of the German taverns do not indulge in whiskey to the same extent as do our native Americans. The Germans abroad drink beer or wine as a matter of course, but you seldom see a drunken person. In 1867, I was in Berlin for a week or longer, likewise in Munich and Vienna; then I spent several days in Dresden, Prag, Salzburg, and other cities; yet, throughout my entire journey in Germany and Austria I did not see one drunken person. If we follow German customs for another quarter-century, insobriety will be wiped out, just as drunkeness is virtually nonexistent in our fatherland.</p>
   <p>"Third, I assert that the Germans have taught us music--one of the most up-lifting and sensible diversions we have. Of course, we had music before the Germans settled here, but it lacked quality and popularity. Nearly all Germans sing or play some musical instrument--and they perform well. One can hardly estimate the elevating influence which a musical education provides. Only operas by the greatest masters and outstanding works of the most gifted composers are considered by the Germans. All our children study music, and no branch of education exerts a better influence on mankind. Now, with respect to the success and achievements attained in music, I have heard from the most prominent German authorities that our Apollo and Beethoven clubs compare favorably with the oldest musical societies of Germany. Although the Apollo Club is a strictly American organization, its members undoubtedly recognize the German influence which was the motivating force for its progress.</p>
   <p>"Furthermore, I must not fail to mention that our German fellow citizens have always defended liberty and supported the constituted authorities. The Germans were patriots in their own country and a vast majority were, likewise, patriots when they became Americans. It must be remembered that the Germans left their own nation because they could not form a liberal government and, in coming to the United States, they now support the Republic because it represents the ideal they had in mind for their own native land. When the South threatened the existence of our form of government, the Germans--to a man--rallied to the support of that party which fought for liberty. The German votes and bullets were cast in the name of freedom. And that explains why the Germans so gladly and liberally bought government bonds to help continue the war; of course, a profit was made thereby, and we are glad of it. These bonds were acquired by Germans at a time when the English aristocracy spent hundreds of millions of dollars to buy Confederate bonds and to equip rebel privateers. But John Bull lost his money, and paid the tidy sum of fifteen million dollars as indemnity for acts committed by British vessels. He [John Bull] got his just reward. Naturally, I am fully aware of what the Scandinavians and others did for the Union and will, at some opportune time, cover that phase at length. But today I am speaking of the Germans, who did their duty at the elections and who shed their blood for the nation, the men who deserve the gratitude of all people who believe in liberty. The heroism of these Germans was indeed monumental, so let us not stint with our praise.</p>
   <p>"I also like to reiterate the biological fact that a mixture of two strong races produces a better race than either one of the original races. This was proved by the Romans and also by the English, on whose possessions the sun never sets. The small island of Queen Victoria was invaded and conquered time and again--a great blessing. The Romans, Saxons, and Normans sent their select armies, whose members mingled with the British, Irish, and Scotch people, thus producing a race which is unequalled in bodily strength as well as mental accomplishment. Think what we may, therefore, expect here in America, where we have assimilated the best elements of these highly select races!</p>
   <p>"Where can one find more auspicious conditions for the development of an enterprising, diligent, intelligent hybrid people than here, where liberal laws prevail and where we are blessed with continental possessions--a land of great fertility and exceptional resources, which not only provides the necessities of life but helps us to produce articles of luxury which the whole world covets today--a country whose mineral wealth rivals the fantastic tales of bygone ages; here, in America, where we have schools, colleges, and churches to further our education; a great land with freedom of speech--a press which resorts to biting sarcasm in fighting vice in all its branches--a country where the son of even the poorest family can aspire to greatness--where mind and labor can perform miracles--with these countless benefits available to us, the greatest blessings the Almighty ever gave to mankind--who, then, considering these conditions, can predict what we will amount to when our population reaches two hundred million?</p>
   <p>A great race, free and highly cultured, has never existed; when we reach that stage, it will affect all of the people on earth. It is destined that our Republic shall reach this goal."</p>
   
   <p>The speech evoked great applause.....The next part of the program was a vote on the question: "Who was, or is, the best mayor Chicago ever has had?" This, of course, proved of great interest to the politically minded, and toward the end a great, lively crowd milled around the voting booth, just as though it were an actual election. It appeared certain that Monroe Heath would win, but at the last minute Harrison's friends managed to gather considerably more than two hundred votes, and so the latter won.</p>
   <p>The results of the balloting were given at the large musicians' platform. The festival committee, consisting of Messrs. Emil Hoechster, president; John D. Zernitz, secretary; Frank Schweinfurth, treasurer;....[altogether, sixteen people], walked from the tent where the balloting was in progress to the stage, while the band played.</p>
   <p>Emil Hoechster, in making the announcement, declared that according to the votes, Carter H. Harrison had won; he received 282 votes, Monroe Heath 208, H. S. Colvin 111, John Wentworth 44, Joseph Medill 40, J. W. Rice 9, and several others one vote each. (Cries of "Never! John Wentworth was the best mayor! The votes must have been short!"). However, Mr. Hoechster declared that the votes were cast and paid for and, under the circumstances, he would have to give the medal to Mayor Harrison, who, unfortunately, was not present to receive it in person.</p>
   <p>The Oldest German Freemason</p>
   <p>There were six contestants: H. M. Peters, in office from 1859 to 1861..... The medal was given to H. M. Peters, because he was inducted eight days prior to Mr. Kauffeldt. In accepting the medal, Mr. Peters regretted that it was not given to Mr. Kauffeldt.</p>
   <p>The Oldest German Teacher</p>
   <p>The oldest German teacher is G. H. Fischer, the well-known director of the German Lutheran parochial schools. He first taught German here on June 1, 1850. The only other contestant was Mrs. Caroline Schuettler who taught German here in 1862.</p>
   <p>The Medal for the Swabians</p>
   <p>Mrs. Philippine Schmutz received this medal; she came here in 1842.....[Altogether six entrants].</p>
   <p>The Oldest German Doctor</p>
   <p>The oldest German doctor, and also the oldest German newspaper writer, is Dr. Carl A. Hellmuth, who practiced in Chicago in 1847, and who was editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung in 1848. In accepting the medal, Dr. Hellmuth spoke of the unfortunate seven years 1849-1856, when the cholera raged in Chicago. The second oldest physician is Dr. Ullrich.</p>
   
   <p>The Largest Number of Descendents</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly Mrs. Marie Grauel can lay claim to that. She came here in 1847, and has two sons, four daughters, thirty-one grandchildren and sixteen great-grandchildren, making a total of fifty-three descendents. However, quite a few contestants proved close seconds. Mrs. Lorenz Baer, here since 1840, has four sons, six daughters, and thirty-three grandchildren, a total of forty-three descendents....[Eight other names appear].</p>
   <p>In presenting the medals, Mr. Hoechster each time added a few appropriate words, while the orchestra played a flourish. After the end of the official ceremonies, the crowd remained for several hours and enjoyed itself.</p>
   <p>The festival committee and the police, commanded by Lieutenant Bauss, maintained perfect order and saw to it that no disturbing element marred the festivities, so that everyone of the participants will always think of the occasion as a perfect day. The only disagreeable feature was the construction work on Clybourn Avenue, which is to be filled in and paved; that prevented streetcars from continuing beyond North Avenue.</p>
