   <p>The preparations for the great Labor and Socialist Press has already been started; it will be celebrated on the 6th day of June on the Northside of Chicago, Shoating Park, corner of Lincoln and Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>The Park is readily accessible as it is located at the end of the streetcar line on Milwaukee Avenue. Last year's picnic is still in the memory of the people, and no doubt this year's picnic will also be a great success.</p>
   <p>Nature itself will decorate the park in full bloom.</p>
