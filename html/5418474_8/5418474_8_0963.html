   <p>Professor George L. Scherger gave yesterday evening, in the building of the Lincoln Club, before a large public his third lecture, and he spoke this time on "Nietzsche and the Philosophy of the Super Man."</p>
   <p>He characterized Nietsche as one of the most remarkable and revolutionary thinkers of all times who drew the interest of our time upon himself, more than anybody else, not only in Germany but in the whole educated world. As he is considered by many as the thinker, through whose ideas the world was was brought on, the pursuit of his personality and his works after the war were even larger and more general than before.</p>
