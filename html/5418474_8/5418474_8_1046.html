   <p>President of the School Board, Otto C. Schneider, lectures before the School principals.</p>
   <p>President Otto C. Schneider gave a lecture today, in the Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute before the principals of the city schools about the increasing necessity of taking into consideration the needs of commerce and industry. Mr. Schneider pointed out, that in this respect, Germany could be taken as an example, which as known possesses the best commercial schools, besides excellent trade and special schools for mechanics,mining and building, etc. There is today, strong competition among the people of the earth, for the world markets and only that nation will emerge a victor which possesses the best and most efficient armor. Mr Schneider laid stress on the great success of the so-called correspondence schools and came to the conclusion, that there exists a demand for professional education, which will, no doubt increase in the course of time.</p>

   <p>Therefore, this demand should be reckoned with in a practical way, because the correspondence schools, which teach only by mail, in the form of theoretical treatises and courses, do not fully answer the purpose and that fact may be clearly seen.</p>
