   <p>About the middle of January the German Boxing Club will present their first public event. It will give all its members an opportunity to box, and this will naturally give a great impetus to all boxers taking part in training; and every athlete is doing his best to get into trim as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>In the gymnasium at 953 Belmont Avenue there is "heavy traffic" day after day and the superintendent, Bernie Hessling, is always on the spot to give instruction to tyros and experts alike, and to recommend improvements in fighting from. It is one of the policies of the German Boxing Club to match boxers properly, a thing seldom observed on such contests. Thus, when the names of the contestants are drawn, often a beginner is faced with a man who has been boxing for months (or years) and so he is badly defeated. Not only may this damage his body badly; this athlete may be retarded in his career for months. Not infrequently this may also be the end of his career as a boxer.</p>
   
   <p>The training of a boxer must be unhurried and conscientious. It is in this manner alone that skill is coupled with strength, and made to grow. Bernie Hessling's professional aptitudes afford assurance that every boxer will be treated as an individual and, in fighting, will not be matched against superior opponents. There is no doubt that the German boxers will be able to show greater achievement within a reasonable time.</p>
   <p>The gymnasium is open daily from 11 A. M. until 10 P.M. On Sundays the hours of training are 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. The costs of training are relatively low. Enrollment may be made at any time. Spectators are admitted free, and are always welcome.</p>
