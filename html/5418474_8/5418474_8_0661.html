   <p>"The Fatherland", a weekly paper printed in English and published in New York, has enjoyed such an increase of subscribers lately that it seemed advisable to establish branch offices in Chicago, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, and St. Louis.</p>
   <p>The purpose is to intensify propaganda here in the Middlewest for this magazine, which champions German interests exclusively.</p>
   <p>"The Fatherland" is to become a large national organ which will take care of German and Austrian interests even after the war, and should find enthusiastic support among all pro-German elements. This can best be done by becoming a subscriber. The magazine costs two dollars a year for fifty-two issues, delivered to your home.</p>
   <p>For subscriptions, advertisements, and applications for an agency, please write to "The Fatherland", 332 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Business manager is Mr. Sigmund Krauss, former editor and publisher of"The Hornet".</p>
