   <p>The annual swimming contest arranged by the Illinois Athletic Club was held this afternoon. There were sixty-eight contestants, many of whom were of national repute. The mouth of the Chicago river was the starting point, ending at the Jackson Boulevard bridge.</p>
   <p>The winner of this swimming contest was J. Stener, a non-member of the club. He reached the point of destination in forty-eight minutes; the second winner in the race was T. W. Ninans, both of whom out-distanced E. Heath, from the Missouri Athletic Club of St. Louis, who despite being the favorite, came in fifth.</p>
