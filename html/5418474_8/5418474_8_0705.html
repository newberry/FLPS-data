   <p>Four years ago German science was shown a great honor by the University of Chicago, they having sent over for this purpose their representatives, Professors Joseph Kohler, Eduard Meyer, Berthold Delbouck and Paul Ehrlich. Big receptions and festivities took place on that occasion, and the German element of the city's population took a lively part in the demonstrations, in honor of the above named champions of German intellectual culture. The events of those days were an occasion for Mrs. Katharine Seipp, who is well known for her magnanimity in behalf of German efforts, and also through her philanthropy - to found three prizes in memory of her late husband, the brewer Conrad Seipp, - for the best historical works, about: "The German element in the United States, with special consideration of its political, moral, social and educational influence."</p>
