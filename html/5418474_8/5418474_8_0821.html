   <p>This school started its third term under very satisfactory and promising conditions. The number of children has increased to 135, and it is to be expected that during the next few weeks quite a few more will be added. The staff of teachers consists of the Messrs. H. H. Fick, L. Schutt, Mrs. Fick, Miss Goetz, Miss Ford, who gives instruction in English; Mrs. De Smet Frizelle, instruction in French, G. Katzenberger, teacher of music; Mr. Schmidhoefer, teacher of gymnastics; Mrs. and Miss Fick, instructions in needle work.</p>
   <p>The building, which was especially erected for this purpose, is exceedingly well furnished and surrounded by large play-grounds. Parents, who desire that their children should learn English and German thoroughly, and become in heart and mind geniune German-Americans,should send them to this school.</p>
