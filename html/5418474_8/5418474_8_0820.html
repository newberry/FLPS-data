   <p>About 60 pupils attended the newly opened Sunday School at 58 Clybourn Avenue yesterday. The teachers were Mr. Arnold and Dr. Kleinodt. The little ones liked their lessons and we expect to see the new Progressive Sunday school expanding. The children will be divided into classes by next Sunday.</p>
