   <p>About <span class="gap">[gap]</span>0 pupils attended the newly opened Sunday School at <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Clybourn Avenue yesterday. The teachers were Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Dr. Klein<span class="gap">[gap]</span>t. The little ones liked their lessons and we expect to see the new Progressive Sunday school expanding. The children will be divided into classes by next Sunday.</p>
