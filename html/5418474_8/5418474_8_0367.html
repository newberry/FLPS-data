   <p>The members and friends of the Technical Society assembled Saturday evening in the large hall of the Germania clubhouse, at a masked ball. The Technical Society in the last years have drawn the best circles of the Chicago Germans to its festivities. This was shown at the masked ball. A large number of ladies and gentlemen appeared in costumes, some very smart, some very frolic-some. The others were content, to show their attachment to the court of the jolly prince, by wearing the usual paper caps.</p>
   <p>But all were in an excellent mood. Unaffected gaiety ruled, which characterize masked balls usually. There was no program but the orchestra furnished spirited dance music. Otherwise there was free scope left for personal initiative. The arrangement for this magnificently run festival was in the hands of a committee composed of Messrs. John P. Bambach, Jul. Klostermann and Dr. Eric Michaelis.</p>
