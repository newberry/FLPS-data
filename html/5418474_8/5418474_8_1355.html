   <p>The women's department of the Chicago Turngemeinde visited their athletic grounds yesterday with special zeal and interest, because they gave the finishing touch, as it were, to a successful season of gymnastics. Many visitors attended this festive occasion and they watched with keen attention the gymnastics, carried on with grace and exactness.</p>
   <p>The Tournament was not only complimentary to the women athletes but especially to their brilliant and tireless teacher. Mr. Suder. A very enjoyable dancing party in the dining hall brought the affair to a happy end.</p>
   <p>During yesterdays business meeting of the Turngemeinde a committee was appointed consisting of L. Nettelhorst, G. A. Schmidt, and M. Stern. This committee was requested to take the necessary steps to have playgrounds arranged in Lincoln Park for men, boys, and women athletes. The secretary of the Board of Executives reported that $20,200.00 worth of bonds have been subscribed for the construction of the hall for the club, and expressed the hope that the full amount would be subscribed before the general meeting to be held in the near future.</p>
