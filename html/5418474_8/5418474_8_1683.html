   <p>The collections for the Schiller Monument fund can be closed in a very short time, if all German Societies and Lodges will decide at once regarding the amount of their contributions, and if the one hundred selected members of the Collection Committee will sacrifice one or two days time in the near future to receive these contributions. No sacrifice in time or money should be large enough to glorify the man, whose name is buried deep in the heart of every German and whose creations have been enjoyed by all Germans.</p>
   <p>The one hundred chosen collectors are requested to hand all money from collections and donations to Mr. Gustav Stieglitz, Treas., 192 E. Harrison Street.</p>
