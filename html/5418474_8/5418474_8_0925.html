   <p>Professor Moritz J. Bonn, who is one of the most prominent and popular political economists of Germany, and who also enjoys an excellent reputation in other countries, including the United States, held a most interesting lecture before the Chicago Association of Commerce.</p>
   <p>In an interview with a representative of the Abendpost he spoke appreciatively of the hospitality which Chicago has lavished upon him, and expressed his amazement and his admiration for the progress in building accomplished here in the last few years.</p>

   <p>Professor Bonn is no stranger in the United States. He has been here several times as exchange professor in American universities. The last time he taught at the University of California in Berkeley. His present visit is at the invitation of the Institute of Politics of Williamstown, Mass. There he spoke on "New Economic Formations in the World."</p>
   <p>Besides expressing his opinion of financial conditions in Europe, before the Association of Commerce, at the luncheon in the La Salle Hotel, Professor Bonn also spoke today of Germany's position in the League of Nations. He said:</p>
   <p>"From the German standpoint, the question of Germany's entering the League of Nations is to be judged entirely different than the entry of America. America has the privilege of deliberating its step <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>carefully before joining, while Germany found itself, at the conclusion of the peace treaty, already in the League. This highly important assembly is entrusted with the consideration of a number of questions which turn the scale in deciding the fate for Germany. The League of Nations has authority in regard to the trusteeship of the Danzig and the Saar districts, and possesses great influence over matters highly important to Germany.</p>
   <p>"Among others, it is appointed as an organ, that, with the consent of all participants, has the authority to modify the peace treaty. It has in the past, according to this authority, interfered in German conditions in a highly unfavorable manner. What else was left for Germany to do, than to join the League of Nations?</p>

   <p>"Only in this way was it possible to cooperate in decisions which were highly important for our country and to influence them according to our own opinion."</p>
