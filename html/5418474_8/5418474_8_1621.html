   <p>Contributions for the National Monument of "German-Americanism" are accepted at the office of the Abendpost.</p>
   <p>Congress will in the near future set aside $30,000.00 for the "German-American" National Monument,"if the" German-Americans" will contribute an equal sum up to that time.</p>
   <p>It has become a matter of honor for the "German-Americans" to get this amount together. What will the strong "Germanism" of Chicago do in this matter?</p>
