   <p>The German modern plastic art was the subject of a lecture given by Professor Paul Clemen last night to the Germanistic Society at the Art Institute. It was the last lecture of Professor Clemen, who will soon return to Bonn (Germany), where he is a university teacher.</p>
   <p>Professor Clemen described how German plastic art, like German art painting made enormous progress during the last twenty years. A new direction, developing colossal monuments, has penetrated German plastic art. These large monuments remind us of the ancient sculptures in Rome and Greece.</p>
   <p>The founder of this new plastic art is Prof. Bruno Schnitz, who made the colossal monuments at the Porta Westfalica, the Kyffhauser monument and the Kaiser Monument near Coblenz. Another enormous monument will be the group of giant statues commemorating the battle near Leipzig.</p>
   <p>The latest type of this monumental art is the Bismarck statue, made by Professor Hugo Lederer at the mouth of the Elbe River.</p>
