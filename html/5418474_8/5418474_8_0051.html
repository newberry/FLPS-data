   <p>The Ladies' Aid, a branch of the German Society, arranged a festival yesterday afternoon at Brand's Hall, located at the corner of Clark and Erie Streets, for the benefit of poor children. Many of our German women participated and a large number of presents were received. The interest manifested by the visitors, and the liberal attitude of our businessmen, deserve commendation. The association received more gifts than could be distributed yesterday. The success is attributable in a large measure to the endeavors of the committee headed by Mrs. Marie Werkmeister. This applies to the presentation of the gifts as well as the afternoon's entertainment.</p>
   <p>Although only 103 children had been listed, the number increased to 140 by the time the distribution was in progress. Many women, particularly the mothers of the little tots, were present. A Christmas tree was mounted on the stage and was surrounded by cardboard figures representing Biblical subjects. These were the deft handiwork of the ladies forming the committee. The children tried on the clothes, given as a present, in an adjoining room before the commencement of the festivities.</p>
   <p>Oscar Schmoll played an introductory number on the piano, whereupon the children marched through the hall to the stage and there grouped themselves into a half circle. All of them carried little baskets containing their presents: a complete outfit of clothing for the boys as well as for the girls. Miss Blanca Pick recited a poem, a composition by Mrs. Werkmeister, and, while most of the children were too young to understand it, the work proved very impressive to the older contingent.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Clara Huck sang "Herz Aller Liebstes Schatzerl Du" and Oscar Schmoll played the piano accompaniment. Because of her splendid voice and good training, Mrs. Huck's rendition proved a musical treat indeed.</p>
   
   <p>Miss Krause and Miss Trautwein then played several appealing piano selections.</p>
   <p>After a short intermission, Miss Wangemann sang. She was followed by Miss Pick, who recited the tragic poem "Mona's Waters". The next number on the program was "Waer Ich Ein Veilchen Auf Der Au," sung by Mrs. Huck, who followed with an encore, "I Und Mei Bua".</p>
   <p>Next, several piano pieces were played by Oscar Schmoll, and the children and young ladies danced to the music. Then followed the raffling of a bouquet of waxflowers, donated for the occasion by Miss Trautwein. Mrs. Peipers, treasurer, who was in charge of this part of the program, sold 107 chance tickets at twenty-five cents each; number fifty was the lucky winner.</p>
   <p>Finally Miss Wangemann sang another number, dancing continued, and the festival came to a close at half past seven in the evening.</p>
   <p>The members of the Ladies' Aid hereby express their gratitude to all who participated, particularly the numerous donors.</p>
