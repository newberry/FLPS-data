   <p>A great celebration, in which a number of other associations also took part, was held yesterday by the George Washington Benevolent and Aid Society, formerly Kaiser Friedrich Gegenseitiger Unterstuetzungsverein (Kaiser Friedrich Mutual Aid Society) in the Social Turner Hall. The occasion was the consecration of a magnificent new flag, dedicated by the members of the Society. This solemn act became an impressive and patriotic ceremony. As the flag was carried through the hall to the stage, on which the flags of other associations were grouped in a picturesque manner, the audience, which filled every seat, sang the "Star-Spangled Banner", accompanied by the band. The actual celebration began with the singing of "This is the Day of the Lord" by the Polyhymnia Ladies' Chorus and the Edelweiss Ladies' Chorus of the South Side, conducted ty Mr. Tegtmeyer. Mr. John Gross, of the administrative council of the association, made a patriotic address and handed the flag over to the president of the association, Mrs. Margarete Scholz, <span class="page-break">\2</span>who, in the name of the association, accepted the beautiful present with words of thanks and appreciation.
