   <p>The Swimming School of Mr. Gutschow at the foot of Erie Street offers all desirable bathing comfort. The piers are 280 feet long, the breath is about the same, so that the water surface inside the enclosure measures almost 80,000 square feet. 75 bathing cabins are completely sufficient for the numbers of visitors on the average. The number of the regular visitors, or the holders of season tickets, is about 80, the number of swimming pupils 40. The establishment has much to suffer from the weather, especially in Spring, so that it costs quite a bit of money to keep it always in such good conditions, as it is being kept. It is therefore worthy of public recognition that Mr. Gutschow not only maintains this swimming school, but has now created a second one on the South side, at the foot of 18th Street.</p>
   <p>The City council, as has been mentioned before, appropriated some money for this establishment under the condition that part of it be kept open to the public free of charge. This then is a public swimming establishment which, we hope, will soon be followed by others.</p>
