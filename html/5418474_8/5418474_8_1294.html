   <p>Sam Traub, the well-known hardware dealer on State Street, celebrated his 41st birthday by dedicating an honor target to the club, in conformity to a long-established custom, and yesterday the members competed to obtain the coveted prize. Such splendid results were shown that a calibrated measuring device had to be used to ascertain the exact standing of participants, particularly where the bull's eye hits were involved. Everyone of the following winning marksmen received a beautiful, miniature, silver revolver as a pendant, the present of the birthday celebrant: John Brockmann, Mayor Carter H. Harrison, Oscar F. Mayer, Reverend G. D. Heldmann, Inspector Heidelmeier, Judge George Kersten, and Doctor Warner.</p>
   <p>The next set-up was the King's target. In this event, Judge Kersten attained 233 points out of a possible 250, with ten shots, a heretofore unaccomplished feat in Illinois. Lowest score was Mayer's, 183 points.</p>

   <p>A typical hunters' dinner, venison back, quail [California specie; the European quail sings and is not eaten in Germany] and champagne, was served after the meeting.</p>
