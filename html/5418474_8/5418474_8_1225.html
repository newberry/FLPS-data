   <p>In spite of unfavorable weather, a considerable number of participants appeared at the Turner camp for the sports festival of the Turners. Over 1,000 visitors were interested in the contests.</p>
   <p>The high jump was closely contested, when seven Turners failed to reach the five-foot-seven-inch-mark, and had to repeat the jumps, until finally F. Neher of the Grand Crossing Turnverein, was the only one to succeed. The 100 yard dash had to be shortened, on account of the uneven ground, to a fifty yard "cross-country" run. Eugene Preiss of the Turngemeinde won the silver cup for his society with three victories. With a lead of four points, the Chicago Turner Society won over "Frisch Auf" Aurora.</p>
