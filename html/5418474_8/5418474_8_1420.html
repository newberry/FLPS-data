   <p>Mr. Legner, the first speaker of the Aurora Turn-Society, gave a very encouraging report, at last Wednesday's meeting, as to the Society's development during the past half year. The Aurora Turn Society made progress in all of its activities; meetings had been well attended; participation in debates had been very lively, and seventeen new members had been enlisted. The finances of the Society are also in good order.</p>
   <p>As for the library, it was necessary to put in, an additional bookshelf. The library disposes of over 650 books, a number of which are of great value. The Turn School, which is in the hands of August Zapp, has a large number of pupils, who gave, only a short time ago, an exhibition of turn exercises.</p>
