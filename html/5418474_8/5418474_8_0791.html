   <p>The noted German-American School of Louis Schutt, 621 Wells Street, held yesterday its school-end celebration. After a successful and impressive examination of graduating pupils, a well arranged program of amusements, entertained all those that were present. Chorus-songs, monologues and music-recitals were carried out with skill and talent. Particular praise must be given to Clara Hau, Elsa Henne, Louise Stieglitz, Susanna Lehle, Walter Christmann, Ernest Sturm and Wm Schaffer for their first-class achievements.</p>
   <p>The Louis Schutt School has now 150 pupils.</p>
