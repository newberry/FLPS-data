   <p>The Lehr and Wehr Club decided at a meeting held last Monday to take part in an excursion on the 12th of this month with the S.A.P. to Colehour's farm and elected a Committee to make the necessary preparations with the already existing Arrangements Committee for the prize disc shooting to be held there. It is anticipated that the Hunters Association will not take a back seat and as all other Clubs show a lively interest, it will not be going too far to promise very great success.</p>
