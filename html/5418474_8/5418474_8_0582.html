   <p>This independent organ for the true proletarian interest just came off the press. This paper is as usual rich on interesting readings. We will call a few of the more prominent works: World's situation, The Congress of Socialistic Labor Party of New York. Example: To all women and cooperators: Individual Freedom; Lies on Bebel; Secret Organizations; and Machine politics of the N. Y. Congress.</p>
   <p>On account of the 9th Birthday particulars in this weekly paper, connected with the Chicago Arbeiter Zeitung, the Editor will make the following remarks:</p>
   <p>The "Vorbote" is really the only socialistic paper in America which under all circumstances will preach true and consistent class-hatred. Also the "Vorbote" represents the old principles of the Red Internationale, which rejects reconciliation no treaties, no reform scandals and no compromising, but unflinching firmness as the only alternative.</p>
