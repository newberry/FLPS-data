   <p>The Hall of the Turner Club, Fortschritt, on Milwaukee Avenue, lays in dust and ashes. That it will be rebuilt is doubtful, because the Club was hard pressed by debts and the amount of the insurance will hardly cover the obligations. At the Christmas celebration of this Club last night it was mentioned that many clubs which still have their own halls are in no way better off than the Club Fortschritt. It was proposed to merge some of the thirty-five clubs and form five or six large organizations. The proposal met with approval. It is planned to nominate at the next congress a committee which shall confer with all the clubs and work out a plan to bring this merger to a result.</p>
