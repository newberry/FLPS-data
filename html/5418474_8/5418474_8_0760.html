   <p>The American Brewing Academy of Wahl and Henius held examinations for members of its 19th class, ending yesterday. Thirty-two students who had enrolled for the course offered by the Academy passed their examinations.</p>
   <p>Both instructors and students met at the large auditorium of the Academy at three o'clock in the afternoon, where Doctor Henius gave a certificate to all who passed the examination and awarded a diploma to those deserving it. Doctor Wahl, in explaining the difference, called attention to the distinction. A Brewmaster's Diploma represents a statement wherein the Academy considers the holder thereof qualified to perform a brewmaster's duties, even to the extent of managing a brewery, a position which, in addition to a theoretical knowledge, requires long experience and mental stability.</p>
   
   <p>Those who still lack some of these essential qualifications can obtain their diplomas later, upon giving proof to the institution that they are fully qualified.</p>
   <p>As usual, the highest ranking graduate received a gold medal. George Stuhlfauth, of Marathon, Wisconsin, came into this category.</p>
