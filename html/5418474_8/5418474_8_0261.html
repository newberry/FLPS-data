   <p>In almost all the larger cities of the country the American citizens of German birth plan to celebrate the end of the war between Germany and France.</p>
   <p>But in what manner shall it be done? In most cities the Germans have come out against a public procession, and, we think, with much right. If one celebrates the glorious rise of the German people to the apex of its power. Why do it in a totally un-German manner? These street parades, as we see them in America, are something utterly un-German and would cause nothing but laughter in Germany. Is the fact that several thousand people wade for some hours through ankle-deep or even knee-deep mud, so impressive? Is it likely to have an edifying effect on the minds of on-lookers or participants? Will the fact that several thousand Germans facilitate the street cleaning in Chicago by carrying home on their boots so and so many cubic feet of dirt prove anything to the Americans and the Irish that they dont know already? Will it diminish the envy and ill-will with which certain elements of the population regard the German victory? To all these questions the answer is no.</p>

   <p>A street procession means nothing, proves nothing, and effects nothing. It is nothing but a thoughtless imitation of an American custom. One celebrates with the legs, instead of with the heart and head.</p>
