   <p>The Republican Party's state headquarters are working on their reply which is to be a defence against the attacks on Deneen, which the Democrats have formulated, charging that he did not conduct himself as he should have, as for as the opponents of the Edwards' Law are concerned.</p>
   <p>They intend to produce evidence to prove that Mr. Deneen, like the great majority of his colleagues, finally voted for a repeal of the aforementioned law, and he should not be blamed because he originally advocated more lenient measures. These were not intended to weaken the interests of the public schools, but to strengthen them. The contemplated changes in the law provided that schools should not be denied state recognition as bona-fide institutions of learning, if it can be shown that English is also adequately taught.</p>
