   <p>Chicago, Illinois,</p>
   <p>May 7, 1866.</p>
   <p>After having served faithfully, and, I believe successfully, on the editorial staff of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, for five years, the undersigned hereby gives notice that he has severed his connection with that publication.</p>
   <p>Wilhelm Rapp</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois,</p>
   <p>May 8, 1866.</p>
   <p>In Mr. Wilhelm Rapp, whose affiliation with the Illinois Staats-Zeitung was terminated yesterday, as may be seen from the above statement, we have lost a very able associate, and we regret that he is leaving us. He has devoted five years of faithful and efficient service to this newspaper, giving his time and talents during a very trying period.</p>
   <p>Beginning today, Dr. Adolph Wiesner, for many years the Baltimore and New York correspondent of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung and formerly editor of the Turnzeitung, will take the place of Wilhelm Rapp in our editorial department.</p>
   <p>Illinois Staats-Zeitung Company.</p>
