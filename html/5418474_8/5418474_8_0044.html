   <p>The prospects are getting brighter daily, the great "People's and Worker's Festival" which is going to take place next Sunday in the North Chicago "Schutzenpark", will not fall behind those previously arranged, as far as success is concerned, on the contrary we expect to see same even to excel them. The Committee of Arrangments has finished its preparations and taken the necessary steps to provide refreshments solid as well as fluid-, and all kinds of amusements, etc. to satisfy the public.</p>
   <p>The presence of delegates to the National Workingmen's Convention from all parts of the country, also official speakers- whose fame is spread all over the United States -will no doubt help to demonstrate the festival to be an important factor of the working classes strength.</p>
   <p>Therefore lets all go to the North Chicago "Schutzenpark" next Sunday.---</p>
