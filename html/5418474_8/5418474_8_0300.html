   <p>Mr. Nicolaus Kanmanns, the economic attache of the German Embassy of the United States of America, gave a very interesting lecture about the Mosel land before the members of the German Society of Northwestern University at 1709 Chicago Avenue. The German Society consists of students of the German department of Northwestern University, and is conducted by German professors. They have their regular meetings in private residences, whose owners understand the German language. It is a strict rule to use only the German language on such occasions.</p>
