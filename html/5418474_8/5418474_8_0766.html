   <p>In the New English-German School, 557 La Salle Avenue the first public school celebration took place several days ago. It was attended by a large number of interested visitors. Poems in the German, English and French languages were recited by several of the pupils with the correct pathos and good expression. The exhibited school books were kept so clean that it was a pleasure to look through them.</p>
   <p>A chorus, conducted by Mr. C. E. R. Mueller offered several songs that received general recognition. The school which stands under the supervision of Miss Rebecca Dormeyer has seemingly a good future. At present the number of pupils is about 60.</p>
