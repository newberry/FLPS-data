   <p>Yesterday was Ladies Evening at the German Press Club and in connection therewith Dr. Peters was invited. He is a well-known African explorer and also Commissioner of the German government. After the delightful musical part of the program came to an end...., the famous traveler gave an interesting account of Kilimandschara and its inhabitants, a mighty mountain which rises from the Massai prairies to an imposing height of 23,000 ft. He described the natural beauty of that territory in a fascinating manner, saying how one may experience all climates of our earth by climbing to its summit, from tropical primeval forests to eternally frigid glaciers and to snow-covered Kibo, one of the two cones of this ancient and more recent volcanic mountain. He then spoke on the cultural phases of the various people of the district and their subjugation, which was a part of the explorer's problem. He gave a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>lengthy resume of the animosity of the sanguinary Karombo tribe, whose peculiar fortifications on the mountain-side made it exceedingly difficult to subdue them and to make them amendable to civilization.</p>
   <p>During the early part of the evening musical selections were given which found much acclaim. The Misses Beck and Siegel, Viennese singers; Mr. Charles Balatka; Mr. Selz, as well as an excellent monologue by the Reuter narrator Mr. Bartelt, who is scheduled to tour the United States in the near future, helped to make it a most enjoyable evening. Later, during the social part of the program, Mr. Balatka proposed three cheers to the future welfare of Mr. Peters, who had celebrated his birthday on the previous day, and the assembly responded with great enthusiasm.</p>
