   <p>After considerable effort, manager Reinhold Oeschler succeeded in having the travelling division of his football players accepted by the Major League. This represents definite progress for the Club and German sports.</p>
   <p>That the Club was able to attain the respect of its adversaries during its speedy rise can readily be shown by the delegate session of the Major League. Altogether, five teams applied for affiliation with the League; three finding acceptance. The German club obtained six votes, North Shore, four; and Harvey, two.</p>

   <p>Now it behooves the German Club to do its best always so that the German colors will be well represented in future games. Simultaneously, the clarion call admonishes all German sportsmen and compatriots to visit the contests, and thereby support the Club in its endeavors. Interested parties can obtain further information at the Club's headquarters, 201 West North Avenue.</p>
