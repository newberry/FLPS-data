   <p>A plan is under consideration for partial merging of the business interests of the Freie Presse with the Illinois Staats Zeitung. By the terms of the proposals the Sunday issue of the Freie Presse would be abandoned and the Staats Zeitung on that day of the week would represent them both. On week days, however, the publications would retain their present identity. If the plans are carried out the printing plant of the Freie Presse would be no longer used, the mechanical work of both papers being performed in the Staats Zeitung office.</p>
   <p>According to Edward S. Halle of the Staats Zeitung, however, the negotiations looking to this arrangement have not progressed to a definite point and are not likely to reach conclusion for some time. In the office of the Freie Presse it was stated that, if no hitch occurred the plan would go into effect within ten days. The two papers are issued as usual this morning.</p>
