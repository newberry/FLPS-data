   <p>At a meeting held in the Stafford Hotel, the Technische Verein (Technical Society) of Chicago decided to send the German-American National Bund seventy-five dollars for the Red Cross, and, in addition, to turn over half of the collected membership dues from now on until December. The seventy-five dollars was to be used originally to send a delegate to the Technicians' Day celebration in the East, but it was agreed that it would be much better to use the money for charitable purposes. The offer which was made the German-American Technicians' Association, to hold next years' Technicians' Day here in Chicago, was withdrawn.</p>
   <p>During the meeting the members started a collection among themselves, and this netted another sixty dollars for the Red Cross, making a total of one hundred and thirty-five dollars which can be sent to the National Bund immediately.</p>
   <p>Mr. Walter Desterle, secretary of the Society, has collected fifty dollars for the seventy-five penniless German reservists whom he brought about a week ago to the Evangelical Seminary in Elmhurst.</p>
