   <p>has been held last night, at the Arbeiter Halle, corner 12th and Waller Streets. Although, there was a heavy snowfall, the meeting was well attended. After agent Bartels opened the meeting, and Comrade H. Selle was appointed Chairman, Comrade Sievers took the opportunity to speak on the necessity of a strong labor organization.</p>
   <p>He pointed out, that the movement is of utmost importance, not only for political and industrial reasons, but assistance should be given, the armed organizations also. But above everything else, be mindful, that only in unity, is strength. Professional politicians are not needed for the socialists movement, but we do need a unity of the workingmen, who are self-sacrificing and courageous enough, to help the labor movement toward its aim. The lecturer, Mr. Sievers was much acclaimed for his speech, which was followed by a discussion, in which Mr. Bartels and Mrs. Saubert took a lively interest.</p>
