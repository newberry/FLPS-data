   <p>There are two German-Americans, who must not be forgotten by their compatriots and whose names in the history of German-Americanism must be made immortal. Every German-American must be proud of the two men of German descent "Steuben and De Kalb". In Valley Forge during that terrible winter, Steuben created an army from a group of badly-dressed and underfed men and assisted Washington to finish his war for Independence. It is intended to erect a Steuben memorial in the same Valley Forge where the memorial chapel stands for the father of the country. It is further planned to erect a series of patriotic buildings as a Patriots Hall for the holding of memorials and a library, where principal works referring to the battles of the Revolution will be kept. At the entrance of the Hall statues of our Allies will be erected. Three statues have been chosen already, Steuben, De Kalb, and Lafayette. It is a duty of honor for the Germans of America to contribute to the cost for these monuments for Steuben and De Kalb.</p>
   
   <p>A rough estimate gives the amount for the cost of these statues at $4,000. The National Union has pledged a $100.00. A committee has been formed by Dr. Hexamer, President of the German American National Union, assisted by Dr. Herrmann Ridder of New York. All Germans know what this German General Steuben has done in the War of the Revolution and we must show that we know how to honor the memory of such men, who have been a credit to German prestige.</p>
