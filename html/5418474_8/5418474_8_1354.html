   <p>On the isle in the Hunter's Park the Thueringers amused themselves yesterday in the forest's green. Not only members of the Thueringer Club but their numerous friends and acquaintances and numerous guests of other associations had made their appearance. The principal object was to enjoy the hunting sport, and a bird shooting had been arranged for the men, including the distribution of 12 prizes. For the ladies who had a sure eye and a steady hand, a "star shooting" was arranged with prizes for the best shooters.</p>
   <p>Frieberg's Orchestra played up for the dancing which notwithstanding the great heat, was very much enjoyed. All over a gay life reigned under the shady trees and the excellent picnic finished very late.</p>
