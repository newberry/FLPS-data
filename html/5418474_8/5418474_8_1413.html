   <p>The "Vorwarts" Turnverein is giving a benefit next Sunday for its retiring teacher of gymnastics, John Gloy, with the co-operation of the popular "Liederkranz Eintracht", the double quartet of the Aurora Turnverein, and Miss Clara Schaumberg, the singer.</p>
   <p>Gloy, the jolly old boy, deserves a full house on that occasion.</p>
