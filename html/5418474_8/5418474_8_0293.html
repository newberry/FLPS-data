   <p>Professor James Taft Hatfield last night gave a lecture in the English language before the Germanistic Society, about the poet Mueller.. He pictured him as one of the most important representatives of German romancitism. Longfellow was the first American who acknowledged his importance, though his translations of Mueller's poems could not effectually replace the originals. Mueller, like Goethe and Burger represented the spirit of popular song. Heinrich Heine stated that Mueller in that respect did not find his equal.</p>
