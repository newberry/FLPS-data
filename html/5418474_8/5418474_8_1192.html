   <p>The sixteen organizations belonging to the Schutzbund Deutscher Sportvereine are requested to send a delegate, with credentials from his organization, to the general assembly of German Day, and for the election of all officers for 1933, which will take place this coming Friday, December 9, at 8 P.M., in the Hotel Atlantic, 316 South Clark Street.</p>
   <p>At the election of officers, only such delegates are allowed to vote who can, following registration, identify themselves as such. Applications are to be made to Adolph Glauche, Secretary of the German Day Organization, care of Hotel Atlantic, 316 South Clark Street.</p>
   <p>German athletes have been highly interested in the shaping of the German Day celebration in the year of the World's Fair. It is, therefore, necessary that each organization be represented by a delegate. The Superintendents must not neglect their identification cards.</p>
