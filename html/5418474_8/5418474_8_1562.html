   <p>The business office of the Abendpost, 225 West Washington Street, is already accepting donations for a plaque which, as reported before, will be placed in the rotunda of the old federal building, Clark and Adams Streets, as a lasting tribute to the famous German-American, Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, the creator of the American Army. Our fellow citizens of Polish descent will put up a plaque in the same place in honor of General Kosciuszko, and those of French descent will put one up in honor of General Lafayette.</p>
   <p>More collection depots will shortly be opened, and will be announced in the Abendpost and Sonntagpost, as will the names of donors.</p>
   <p>The underlying idea that has guided the committee is to make this plaque a gift of all German-Americans of Chicago, and so to make no minimum limit. This will permit everyone to participate in accordance with his financial ability. Every <span class="page-break">\2</span>donation, even the smallest, is accepted with thanks. Children, too, should take part in the collection, because no enormous sum is solicited, but rather a fund which comes from a true cross-section of the German population of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The plaque is to be of truly artistic design, so that the German-Americans may be proud of it. The noted Chicago sculptor, Professor Emil Zettler, is at present occupied with the creation of a fitting design, which will be submitted to a subcommittee for approval.</p>
   <p>Another committee has been named to publicize the cause in wider circles, especially among German-American organizations. Similar work in churches and parochial schools is in the capable hands of Reverend [George L.] Scherger.</p>
   <p>At the head of the committee of outstanding German-Americans who have made it their special task to execute this enterprise, so long planned, are: William P. Doerr, chairman; Albert Weinberger, treasurer; and Paul H. Mueller, secretary.</p>
