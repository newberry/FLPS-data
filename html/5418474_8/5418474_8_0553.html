   <p>The German Press Club had a festival arranged in honor of the ladies and the invited members and friends came in countless numbers.</p>
   <p>This fact must be considered as an evidence that the better educated "Germans" understand and appreciate what the club is trying to do.....</p>
   <p>The concert started at 8 o'clock. After music and song followed the comedy, "I Married My Daughter." This play was immensely enjoyed by the guests and there was no end to the applause.</p>
   <p>After this entertainment, the guests participated at the banquet and the dance.</p>
