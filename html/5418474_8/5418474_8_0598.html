   <p>The Editor of the Freie Presse (Free Press) has been brought to court by one attorney for spreading the rumor that one newspaper is nearing a state of bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung was forced after the great Chicago Fire to build its own establishment and therewith, like so many concerns, had to borrow money at 10% interest from a Chicago Bank.</p>
   <p>The excellent business standing of our newspaper has been used by our lawyer as a sound and fundamental argument, to obtain for us a lower interest for our debt through some acceptable transaction.</p>
   <p>One lawyer's various negotiations with banks doubtless leaked out and tempted the Freie Presse to suspect a weak standing of our financial capability. As a fact our business affairs never have been more prosperous thanright now, and we are expecting a steady expansion of our circulation. Based on this <span class="page-break">\2</span>favorable state of affairs, we have finally succeeded in stablizing our debt on sound bonds at 8% interest. This favorable transaction in conjunction with our bank has naturally increased and solidified our credit and expansion capacity.</p>
   <p>The payment of our bills, salaries and running expenses has not stopped a minute during the described transaction. This fact has been completely ignored in these mentioned rumors, which we are clearing now in court.</p>
   <p>In the meantime we call our readers' attention to the fact that the Illinois Staats-Zeitung has the largest circulation of all German newspapers west of the Allegheny Mountains.</p>
