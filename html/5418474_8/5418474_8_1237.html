   <p>The Schweizer Turnverein yesterday celebrated the thirty-seventh anniversary of its founding at the Lincoln Turner Hall, with gymnastic exercises, a concert, and dancing. The celebration was well attended and was harmonious throughout. The program, exceedingly rich in content, began with a lively overture followed by performances of the various turner classes, whose prowess met with general applause. Various exercises, which are to be performed at the meeting of the Schweizer-Amerikanische Turnverband in Cleveland and at the National Turner Festival in Louisville, were likewise shown. In short, the turners--both men and women--were a credit to the organization and to their teachers, Burger and Fricker. The songs of the three Swiss singing societies; the Schweizer Liederkranz, the Schweizer Maennerchor, and the Schweizer Damenchor, were well received, and did much to beautify the festival of their countrymen.</p>

   <p>A pleasant dance concluded this evening which had been so enjoyable for all participants. The festival committee, consisting of Mr. C. Mueller, chairman; Messrs. A. Vogelsonger, E. Wirth, A. Longworst, and J. Schuepp, worked hard to make the festival of the Schweizer Turnverein an outstanding success.</p>
   <p>In the same building, in the large turner hall, the Baere (Senior Class) of the Lincoln Turnverein arranged a great bunco and card party which included pleasing entertainment and dancing. This festivity likewise took a pleasant course; visitors came in large numbers, so that not only was the immediate aim of the arrangements attained, to get money for the turner festival in Louisville, but everyone of the participants enjoyed a pleasant and agreeable evening.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, in the Garfield Temple, the Liedertafel Vorwaerts celebrated the fifty-first anniversary of its founding by a social gathering and dancing.</p>

   <p>The festival committee, consisting of J. Jung, C. Roule, F. Fleck, H. Dettmer, F. Poulke, J. Reinmueller, and C. L. Fassbauer, made careful preparations and provided for a good program, thus taking care that the festival turned out a success. The chorus, under the direction of [H.] A. Rehberg, sang a number of songs, among which "Zieh mit," "Die Muellerin," and "Der Traum der Liebe" met with general applause.</p>
   <p>But the sensation of the evening was certainly Miss Ruth Steinmetz, a promising young singer who, with her solos, took the hearts of the entire audience by storm. The other soloists, Mr. G. Kuhn and Mr. Paul Richter, also won general applause by their recitals.</p>
   <p>The women's section of the society deserves praise for the way they took charge of refreshments and provided a hearty repast. A pleasant dance concluded an evening that was in every way enjoyable.....</p>
