   <p>At the latest session of the Turn-District, Chicago, the Mayor was, as is well known, unfavorably criticised because he had ignored entirely the wishes of the German Turners in the nomination of School Board members. Today Mr. Gallagher declared, that the Turners had no real cause to act so harshly that the reactionary tendency credited to the School Board did not exist in reality, and that the reforms recommended by the new members have been demanded in the interest of the Board of Education alone.</p>
   <p>Also that there did not exist any opposition against President Halle as he only, should be prevented from playing the part of an autocrat on the School Board.</p>
   <p>Now, be it as it may, the protest made by the Turners was not in any case, made in vain.</p>
