   <p>According to existing indications this festival will outshine all previous ones, in attendance as well as in practical gymnastics. An area 250 x 300 feet is to be cleared in North Chicago's Schuetzen Park (Marksmen's Park). The trees, 300 altogether, will be awarded to the wood-choppers in order to obtain a suitable clearing for the gymnasts. When completed, the area provides room for 1,000 active participants and so far the number of applicants warrants the procuring of such extensive space for a Turnplace.</p>
   <p>The festival will be for a duration of four days and arrangements have been made, that no one after a wearisome and strenuous day will be obliged to seek rest and sleep under the star-adorned firmament. Reception of 'out of town Turners' June 28, June 29 and Monday, 30; practical gymnastics are listed and July 1, mass exercises of students and children's classes, though the latter is not definitely decided.</p>
