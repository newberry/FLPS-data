   <p>Fifty years ago this month the Workers' Sick and Funeral Chest was founded in New York by a handful of German men, most of whom had recently come over from the old homeland, and all of whom belonged to the working class. Today, after half a century, the organization, as one of the largest and most reliable of its kind, has a membership approximating 50,000 throughout the United States. In every city where there is a branch, the Golden Anniversary was celebrated in an appropriate manner.</p>
   <p>The joint celebration of the nine Chicago branches took place yesterday afternoon and evening in the rooms of Wicker Park hall, and was in every way a perfect success. The program consisted of a great concert at which no less than seven singing clubs and Henke's orchestra participated. There was also a good stage show and a dance which started in the lower hall in the afternoon. After the main program was finished, the dance was continued in the large hall, and lasted until long after the midnight hour. At any rate, it was a pleasant celebration <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in keeping with the occasion, and will probably remain a pleasant memory with the participants for a long time. It will also doubtless bring the organization many new members and friends, the more so because yesterday the initiation fee was suspended.</p>
   <p>Although the fest was scheduled to start at 3 P. M., it was 5 P. M. before the officially announced program began. After the orchestra had delighted the audience with the rendition of various musical pieces, thus shortening the time of waiting, the male choir of the Chicago City organization opened the fest by singing Uthmann's "Kroent den Tag" in a dignified manner. Director Reckzeh has excellent material at his disposal in the voices of this organization; he has made use of it to the full. A mixed choir composed of the Saengerbund Freiheit and of the two ladies' choirs Furtschmitt and La Salle, likewise directed by Reckzeh, followed with three more songs, and they, in turn, were followed by the Uthmann Glee Club, under Director Max Schuh. Next came the Alpenlaender Maennerchor under its new choir leader, Steiner; then a mixed choir composed of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>ladies' choir Freiheit and the Bakers' Singing Society, accompanied on the piano by Frau M. Larsen. All discharged their duties in a manner meriting the highest praise for themselves and their directors. The ovations given them were well earned.</p>
   <p>Herr Henry Schuh was the author and reader of the great prologue for the fest, playing the main part of the host Jean Gross in the fest show "Vor fuenfzehn Jahren." It is a historical episode taken from the life of workingmen with themes taken in part from the history of Workers' Sick and Funeral Chest. As this stage show presented a bit of the organization's past, the following scene "Vater Zeit," excellently personified by Walter Ziezen expressed, as it were, what the members hoped the future would be. The scenes were greeted with enormous ovations, which were also given to the "living pictures" of members of the Workers' Turn and Sport Club, of the Freiheit singing society, and of the organization giving the fest.</p>
   <p>All members co-operated as much as they could in preparing for the anniversary <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>fest, which was most pleasant in every respect. The fest committee consisted of the chairman, Leopold Baer; vice-chairman and program supervisor, Joseph Schlesinger; secretary, Frank Klein; treasurers, Bill Levine and Alvin Schuh. Later in the evening Herr Baer took the floor and, after giving a hearty welcome to the guests, gave a brief resume of the history of the Workers' Sick and Funeral Chest.</p>
   <p>The speaker began by pointing out the difficulties a handful of men had fifty years ago, in New York, to create the organization; he told of how the first branch came into existence in Chicago seven years later, consisting of ten members only; he spoke of the achievements, but also of the setbacks of the organization, and, at the close, he stated with pride that there are now nine branches in Chicago, with approximately two thousand members. Herr Baer called upon the members present in the hall, who had belonged to the Chest for more than forty years, to come onto the platform; about thirty responded, and Herr Baer shook each by the hand.</p>
   <p>Later in the evening, Herr Adolf Dreyfuss announced that the famous Austrian <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Socialist leader, Julius Deutsch, expects to be in Chicago during the latter half of November, and that two great propaganda meetings are planned, at which Deutsch is to be the main speaker; the first will be on Wednesday, November 21, in Orchestra Hall, with the address in the English language, and the other two days later--in German--in a North Side hall yet to be decided upon.</p>
