   <p>The card party given by the benevolent society Recreation at the Kaiserhof yesterday brought a greater response than expected. The club's president, Mrs. Ida Schrader, and the committee members, were swamped with work to provide for the extra crowd. They obtained additional prizes to satisfy all, and so the afternoon proceeded in a most harmonious manner. Foremost in the program were Mrs. Ailda Matthey's splendid vocal selections which were enjoyed by all. She is gifted with an exceptionally pleasing and faultless voice, evidence of a thorough musical education. To-night Mrs. Matthey will give a lecture about the war at the North Side Turnhall.</p>
