   <p>The Committee for Douglas Park affairs has called a meeting for tonight in Herman Henning's place 1101 West 12th Street to which have been invited the presidents of the gymnastic clubs, lodges, singing clubs and all other associations, which are interested in the installation of a public sport's place in the above mentioned Park. The meeting will be very interesting as the advantages of such an enterprise will be discussed in all directions and from different points of view. Mr. Gleason the superintendent of Douglas Park will speak about the sport places of the public parks in England. Numerous representatives of the German, English, and Bohemian Press will be present, as well as very influential citizens. The committee has finished all necessary preliminary studies. The Governor and the majority of the Park Commissioners, have already been informed about the petition and are favorably inclined to this proposition. It therefore only needs cooperative and universal action, so that the Park authorities have the right to declare, that it is the unanimous wish of the people, and not one of a small group of associations. Tuesday, July 2 the petition will handed over officially to the Park authorities, and the Committee for handing over this petition will be elected in the meeting called for tonight.</p>
