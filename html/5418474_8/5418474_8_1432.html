   <p>The expected has happened. The Vorwarts Turn Halle was over-crowded last night, at that Society's entertainment, which is again a proof, how popular the Vorwarts Turn-Verein with the Germans of Chicago is. They have also a reputation, of selecting programs with great care as to keep the audience in a cheerful mood. And happiness could be read, on every face present. Two plays under the direction of Mrs. Hagemann were acted. The first of which was "Dem Herrn cin Glas Wasser" ( A Glass of Water for the Gentleman) and the second "Wenn Frauen Weinen" (When Women Weep) both of which have been very well rehearsed, and the participants greatly acclaimed. But the height of the evening's entertainment, consisted of gymnastic exercises, and the building of a Pyramid, exercised by 24 Turners. The excellent performance of the Turners with special mention for Mr. Zeller, earned them salvos of applause. Mr. Gloy, the Turn teacher, can justly be proud of his accomplishments. An appreciative crowd lingered until in the early morning hours.</p>
