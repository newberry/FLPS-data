   <p>The Popular Fair for the benefit of German immigrants was opened last night at Ulrich's Hall. It was well attended and the visitors evidently took great interest in this worthy undertaking. Both rooms of the Hall in which the Fair is being held have been appropriately and beautifully decorated. The walls of the north room of the hall which contains the sales booths are adorned with pretty garlands; in the center of the room there is a magnificent pyramid of flowers, and on the speakers' platform there is a very good portrait of Count Bismarck, painted by our artist, Mr. Highwood. The south room is arranged for-concerts, and also serves as a barroom. In the center of this room there is a temple made of flowers, where the Goddess of Liberty (in miniature) holds sway. The walls of this hall have also been decorated with wreaths, and at the end of the room, visible to all who enter, is a banner inscribed "In Unity There is Strength".</p>
   
   <p>Dr. Fessel, director of the Aid Society for German Immigrants opened the Fair. In his address he said that the large Chicago German attendance at this Fair is commendable. He thanked all visitors, the Concordia Maennerchor, and the Germania Maennerchor. He expressed his gratitude to all the ladies for their interest and participation in this benevolent enterprise. He also expressed gratitude to Mr. Knobelsdorff, who conceived the idea of holding the Fair, for his tireless efforts to make the affair a success. Thereupon Mr. E. Juessen delivered the principal address as follows:</p>
   <p>"It is a noble, exalted purpose that brings us together here today. In no other way could we achieve greater honor than by aiding poor lonely German immigrants. We support the picnics given by turners and choruses and we attend their concerts and entertainments, because these men serve to prevent puritanism and temperance from gaining control of our political parties.</p>
   <p>"However, we are not assembled for political purposes this evening. Moreover, we are actuated by sympathy, deep and sincere sympathy, toward poor German immigrants who are being cheated by land pirates and confidence men in America, and whose German uprightness is no match for Yankee 'smartness'. This Society was established to protect German immigrants in this allegedly Christian country where they are not supposed to enjoy themselves on Sunday, although they are forced to toil like slaves on the other six days of the week.</p>
   <p>"In conclusion I wish to thank the German ladies and girls for the great sacrifices which they have made in the interest of this Fair. When the wounded returned from the fields of battle, it was the German ladies and girls who cared for the brave soldiers, and when our immigrants were in need of assistance, these good Samaritans again exerted their magic and influence by persuading German men to donate liberally, and the fruit of their labor is before our eyes."</p>
   <p>The Concordia Maennerchor then delighted the audience with well-rendered vocal selections, the most enjoyable of which were: "Saengergruss," "A Prayer At Sea," and "March Serenade". Mrs. Auguste Herrenkind sang an aria from "Freischuetz," and her melodious, well-trained voice enchanted the audience. We look forward to great things from her. The duet from "Don Pasquale" rendered by Bischof and J. Nielsen, was greatly appreciated and won much applause.</p>
   <p>A great variety of valuable articles is on display in both rooms of the hall, and the ladies and girls are showing great zeal and ability in disposing of them at a good profit.</p>
   <p>At the entrance of the north room there is a very good piano, donated by Kraushaar and Company. The instrument is to be raffled off. To the right of the entrance there is a well-arranged display of excellent furniture. Mrs. Johanna Lindemann is the supervisor of this department, and she is assisted by the following salesladies: Miss Caroline Schmitz, Miss Julie Gloeckner, Miss Goothe, Miss Marie Wischendorf, and Miss Sophie Kiessling.</p>
   <p>Mrs. J. Metzke, chairman of the Fair, and Mrs. Rosalie Nelke, secretary, and Mr. Max Koerner, auctioneer, have their office in the northwest corner. Next to it is the candy department which is supervised by Mrs. Sophie Koerner. Adjoining the candy department is the booth in which ladies' handiwork is shown. Mrs. L. Knobelsdorff, Mrs. Auguste Ahrens, and Miss Marie Woeliffer are the supervisors, while Miss Margaretha Schoetzer and Miss Lena Nemett are the salesladies.</p>
   <p>Proceeding west we come to the well-arranged display of gold and silverware which is under the supervision of Miss Betty Faber. Next to it is the porcelain department where Mrs. Marie Mueller presides, and in the adjacent booth Mrs. Auguste Schmidt is engaged in selling fine perfumes.</p>
   <p>Continuing our journey we find Mrs. Bella Achert selling cigars, Miss Emma Rietz selling ironware, and Mrs. Minna Meininger and Miss Mattel selling shoes.</p>
   <p>The postal division is conducted by Mrs. A. Specht assisted by Miss Anna Achert, Miss Anna Kirchner, Miss Therese Scheider, Miss Lina Mehrle, Miss Louisa Nass, and Miss Ulrike Roman. This department apparently does a good business, for very few people leave the room without purchasing a letter.</p>
   <p>To the left of the entrance Miss Helene Mueller is accepting votes for the ladies' popularity contest. Mrs. De La Heye, Mrs. Emma Grotz, Mrs. Emma Schade, Mrs. Lina Niethmann, Mrs. Louise Jacoby, and Mrs. Marie Fluegler are selling tickets for raffles.</p>
   <p>The culinary department, where excellent food and beverages may be had at little cost, is supervised by Mrs. Friedericke Rietz who is ably assisted by Mrs. Carolina Ludwig, Mrs. Auguste Rietz, Mrs. Carl Schmidt, Mrs. Hepp, Miss Lena Rietz, and Miss Krause.</p>
   <p>The entire Fair is well arranged, testifying to the skill of Mr. Charles Rietz, the treasurer of the Society. We expect that our German residents, who are well known for their benevolent spirit, will give this undertaking the support which it justly merits.</p>
