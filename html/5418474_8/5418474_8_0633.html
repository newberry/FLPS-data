   <p>Heinrich Binder, veteran of the German American Press, and especially of the Chicago German Press, favored us yesterday by his visit. Herr Binder returns to Chicago after an extended absence in order to enter the editorial staff of the "Chicago Union".</p>
   <p>We can only congratulate the "Union" on the acquisition of so experienced and talented a Journalist.</p>
