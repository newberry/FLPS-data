   <p>Chicago can be proud to own one of the oldest and most modern German dancing schools; although the establishment of the first dancing school does not reach back to grandfather's time, yet it is many years ago that Louis Kretlow began to initiate the youth of Chicago in the secrets of the terpsichorean art; at that time, and not so far away from Chicago, in all probability, the Indians may have exhibited their war dances, accompanied by their wild war cries, while Louis Kretlow taught his pupils the "Pas" of the "Quadrille" and the "Coutra dance", which were followed by the graceful "Menuett of the powdered ladies and gentlemen of the Empire." Then came the charming round dances, Tirolienne, Polka, and Mazurka, which originated in Vienna and Poland. Then the waltzes of Strauss followed and won the world.</p>
   <p>America was designed to invent such dances, as the "One step", Fox trot" and the like.</p>
   <p>Artists like Pavlowa, reached back to the ancient Greek times to awaken the poesy of the dance to new life; and today we dance to the works of classical <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>music, the composers hardly would have conceived of the possibility of their compositions serving the art of the dance, and the sentiment of expression through the movement of the legs.</p>
   <p>Through all the metamorphosis of the dance, Louis Kretlow, first has learned and then has taught, until the present day.</p>
   <p>Louis Kretlow is not only one of the oldest, but also one of the best dancing teachers in America, highly respected by all, and his pupils are proud, to have learned their art from him.</p>
