   <p>The National Zeitung of Chicago has been discontinued at least for the present. It started in September last year as a Republican Party organ to lead back into the camp of the Republican Party the German-Americans of Chicago and the middle west.</p>
   <p>The Germans of Chicago and the middle west are not inclined to step down from their independent position which the majority of them have held for many years, and to be shackled again to a political party. This fact is in evidence, because of the papers discontinuance after only seven months existence.</p>
   <p>The publication of the paper is discontinued in spite of the fact that Mayor Washburne, Judge Brentano, and other local Republican politicians have supported it politically and personally, and cash contributions have been made repeatedly by personal friends irrespective of party affiliation.</p>
   <p>This result was expected by all who are familiar with German attitudes. It is evidence of the sense of independence by the German-Americans of Chicago, and therefore the failure of the National Zeitung can not be regretted.</p>
