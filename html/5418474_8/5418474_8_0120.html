   <p>When the first excursion train left the station at Clinton and Carroll Streets at ten o'clock, everything must have appeared "rosy" to the occupants of the six coaches--one of which was reserved for the members of Nitschke's popular band. The temperature was exceptionally mild, fields and plains were of magnificent verdure.....</p>
   <p>The train reached its destination shortly after eleven o'clock. The crowd walked to the park; the marksmen who also were on the train formed a column, led by the musicians, and marched to the hall. Wassermann's wines and Seipp's beer proved an attraction for many, while others enjoyed the scenery, and flowers, or went to the bowling alleys.</p>
   <p>The prizes were displayed at the left of the main hall; this phase was in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>charge of John B. Hefner. President Boese, Master Marksman Kersten, and various assistants were at the secretary's office scanning the prize list, while the band played at the music pavilion. The orchestra provided the proper atmosphere, and gave the right color to the environment, since no German would consider a festival complete without music.</p>
   <p>The Agenda</p>
   <p>At about one o'clock, the session opened, presided over by the president of the Alliance, Mr. Boese. The following delegates were present:</p>
   <p>George Aery, Manhattan Rifle Club, New York..... [Altogether thirty persons, from various states.]</p>
   <p>....Preliminary business was handled.... The delegates' credentials were accepted.....</p>
   
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The financial report of the secretary was read and referred to a revisory committee, as the receipts and expenditures of the various clubs were involved.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy debate, it was resolved to hold the next tournament in 1882, and St. Louis was selected for it. The Riflemen of Missouri, or to give their specific title the Missouri Scharfschuetzenverein (Club of the Missouri Dead Shots), offered to make the necessary arrangements.</p>
   <p>Secretary Kuehl then read the report of receipts and expenditures during the festival:</p>
   <p>Receipts.......................................$4,089.00</p>
   <p>Expenditures...................................4,041.77</p>
   <p>Surplus..........................................$ 47.23</p>
   <p>President Boese then gave an address, and stressed the fact that no loss was <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>incurred. "The first attempt ended favorably, and we should be well satisfied. Nevertheless, something must be done to promote marksmenship. In Germany, riflemen have progressed considerably, they have breech loaders, etc., but the Americans now are far ahead with respect to guns and to hitting distant targets." He made a motion that a committee of three be named to make suggestions for improvement to the Excecutive Board. The motion was carried.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Meunier, Streif, and Grau (Milwaukee, Highland and Chicago), were selected for the committee.</p>
   <p>Upon Dr. Merkle's motion, the Alliance expressed its thanks to the Executive Board.</p>
   <p>President Boese said that considerable difficulties had been encountered in making the necessary tournament arrangements. The target range was far away <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>from the city, and extra income (sic) could hardly be expected. It would, he said, be a good idea for the Alliance to provide $300 to $400 for targets and stands to be used at the next Alliance meeting.</p>
   <p>Herman Block, of St. Louis, said that he is not opposed to the suggestion, but that, in St. Louis, the park is easily accessible, and the prospects of arranging a very successful festival in that city are very favorable. The St. Louis park has nineteen targets.</p>
   <p>Mr. Meunier of Milwaukee, supported Boese's motion, on the ground that nineteen targets are not enough. Undoubtedly, more riflemen would go to St. Louis than were here, and a shortage of targets had been apparent even at the Chicago tournament.</p>
   <p>Mr. Streif, of Highland, thought it would be best to let the special committee, appointed shortly before, decide the question. The motion was tabled.</p>
   
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>A motion was made that the Chicago club should be reimbursed for certain expenditures.</p>
   <p>Mr. Boese did not consider it advisable to set such a precedent, as no one knows just what the results might be, as far as the Chicago club is concerned. Every club must naturally take a certain risk.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Boese once more thanked the local clubs, the meeting adjourned. Finally the assembly gave three cheers for the Alliance.</p>
   <p>At two o'clock, a second train brought scores of families to the park, and soon after, a third train arrived with additional crowds. Probably a larger throng was at the park than at any time in its history, and new hope animated the despairing restaurant owners, who had had no business to speak of during the week. Dinner, under Mr. Klare's supervision, was served for three hours, and by that time bird shooting, crossbow shooting, etc., were indulged <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>in.</p>
   <p>Distribution of Prizes</p>
   <p>The musicians marched to the gift booth, where President Boese received Rifle King William Hayes. After speaking a few fitting words, Mr. Boese pinned the medal on the winner.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kayes, speaking in English, expressed thanks for the honor shown him, and assured all of his high regard for the marksmen present, and added that he lacked words properly to express his sentiments. He felt, in common with the others assembled, that these tournaments provided by the Alliance were necessary, and he was glad that the Americans have started to hold such meets. In accepting the prize, he did not pride himself that it was given to an American. This happened to be an American festival arranged by Germans, and nationality was not an issue; that phase was unimportant.</p>
   
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>At the end of his short but forceful speech, he was given three cheers, and then was led in a triumphal march around the park; the musicians at the head of the column played a victory march.</p>
   <p>Then came the great prize for the marksman ranking highest on the Union target. Mr. Boese awarded the prize to John B. Hefner. The prize was a one-hundred-dollar United States bond, bearing 4 1/2 per cent interest; framed, and with its coupons, it is valued at $175. Mr. Hefner expressed his thanks in a short speech, given in his humorous native dialect.</p>
   <p>J. T. Fessler, of St. Louis, was given the second prize on the Union target amid deafening applause. Mr. Faessler, in his speech, gave chief credit to the press.</p>
   <p>Mr. N. Gerber, of Monroe, received the third prize, worth $70, donated by the Missouri Scharfschuetzenverein.</p>
   <p>The fourth prize, $60 in cash, nicely framed and provided by the marksmen <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>of Highland, was given to C. Schotte.</p>
   <p>Aside from the above, the following prizes were given:</p>
   <p>Union Target</p>
   <p>Originally this target provided fifty prizes; in addition, clubs and individuals gave another fifty awards, consisting of cash and various objects.</p>

   <p>First prize: William Hayes, New York, $25. [Altogether 15 premiums, value $1 to $25.]</p>
   <p>Dancing</p>
   <p>Dancing prooved a popular diversion during and after the distribution of prizes. At times the hall was so crowded that there was no room for spectators.</p>
   <p>At the approach of darkness, when the distribution of bowling, ladies', and bird shooting prizes was announced, the dancers had an intermission.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>Bowling Prizes</p>
   <p>Joseph Bartenschlaeger was pronounced bowling king; he made 6 points. The second prize went to C. F. Miller.</p>
   <p>The first prize for the highest average, was given to Mr. Mette, the soda water distributor; his prize consisted of $75 in cash, mounted in a beautiful frame made by Richter and Becker.</p>
   <p>The second prize, for the second highest average, was given to C. F. Miller; it was $40, cash, nicely framed.</p>
   <p>The following gentlemen also won prizes:</p>
   <p>Bartenschlaeger, 3rd prize, Mette 4th prize....[altogether, 16 prizes and names are listed].</p>
   <p>All who have not yet received their prizes are requested to see Mr. Andree, corner Division and Clark Streets.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>Charles E. Miller, Bartenschlaeger, and S. Mette were tied for first prize, each with a score of 45 pins; an elimination contest was held, in which Mette won first prize, Miller, second prize, and Bartenschlaeger, third prize.</p>
   <p>Charles F. Miller "threw eight pins around the king" oftener than any other participant, and no one was able to beat him. Last year he won the first prize; this time he earned the gold medal.</p>
   <p>It might be mentioned that Mr. Andree, as chairman of the bowling committee, did his utmost to make this feature of the festival a pronounced success. Since Wednesday, he has worked indefatigably in the interests of the sport.</p>
   <p>Shooting Event for Ladies</p>
   <p>This feature proved to be a big attraction, and the participants carded <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>the following scores.</p>
   <p>Union Target</p>
   <p>1st, Mrs. Merkle, Chicago, 46 bulls'-eyes 2nd, Mrs. J. Lippert, Chicago, 45 bulls'-eyes [Altogether eight names appear, seven from Chicago.]</p>
   <p>King's Target</p>
   <p>1st, Mrs. Schroeder, Sabula, Wisconsin, 56 bulls'-eyes. [Altogether eight names are listed.]</p>
   <p>When President Hartmann distributed the prizes--bracelets, broaches, earrings, rings, etc.--enthusiasm was boundless.</p>
   <p>Whenever a prize was given, the band played.</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>Bird Shooting Contest</p>
   <p>This part of the program, which actually began only yesterday, showed the results herein enumerated. [Altogether 23 names, of contestants are given nearly all of then Germans; no women appear in the list.]</p>
   <p>The king on this target, William Baruth, was given a gold medal, and the others received less valuable prizes.</p>
   <p>After Dark</p>
   <p>The night scene will be long remembered by the visitors. Lamps, bengal fire, calcium lights, and other kinds of illumination were employed; the orchestra, played, and the waiters saw to it that the throats of the crowd were well cooled; the people, in turn, sang many songs.</p>
   <p>Everyone who returned on the eleven o'clock train felt that the festival had been successful in every respect.</p>
