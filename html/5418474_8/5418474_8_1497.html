   <p>The German likes the great out-of-doors. He is also interested in music and dancing as well as in beer and wine. But all this gives him but partial satisfaction if there is no silvan environment. And so the German is quite oblivious to the torrid rays of the sun, to the suffocating dust and relentless mosquitoes which pester him on his way, as long as he is sure that at the end of his uncomfortable journey he shall find a grove. To relax in the green, shady forest,--that is the German's ideal diversion. Such surroundings so affect the matter-of-fact businessman that he becomes a human being, released from dull restrictions.</p>
   <p>Small wonder, then, that Chicago's Germans obeyed their natural instincts yesterday and sought the open spaces beyond the city limits. The weather, too, was an inducement; after all, we cannot expect many more pleasant Sundays, considering the advanced season. There were three attractions <span class="page-break">2</span>which appealed particularly to the German element: the new park of the North Chicago Schuetzenverein (Marksmen's Club), the festival of the Chicago Schuetzenverein [another association] at Washington Heights, and the dedication of the new concert pavilion at Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>The Picnic of The North Chicago Schuetzenverein</p>
   <p>Admission to the picnic grounds was free; the club made this provision to draw the public. A large crowd was present. Several hundred buggies, a large number of coaches, and busses drawn by four horses gave ample evidence of the huge attendance. People who owned no conveyance rode to the end of the Lincoln car line, and from there busses hauled them to the park.</p>
   <p>The park can be reached by following Clybourn Avenue; this road, however, is passable only in dry weather. The other route is along Clark Street <span class="page-break">3</span>to Belmont Avenue, which is paved, and west on Belmont to the park. There are prospects, however, that Clybourn Avenue will soon be paved. The North Chicago Horse Car Company also intends to construct a spur at the end of the Lincoln car line. Negotiations are in progress. The Northwestern Railway passes near by and it is therefore very likely that the railway company will build a station there or even lay tracks to the park itself. At all events, after the park has been improved, and buildings have been erected, a work which must be postponed until spring, proper transportation facilities will be provided. An icehouse is to be built this winter. Since the grounds are bordered by the river, ice can be cheaply procured.</p>
   <p>The park has an area of nearly twenty-four acres and a good stand of timber. It is situated on the river at the end of Clybourn Avenue and at the corner of Belmont and Western Avenues. A good landscape gardener can make the place very attractive.</p>

   <p>Attendance, as we previously remarked, was excellent; not only was the North Side well represented, but prominent Germans and their families from other parts of the city were there, and even people from Lake View and Jefferson. (Let us mention right here that the park is in Jefferson, so that the "Drys" who rule Lake View cannot interfere when we wish to enjoy our beer.) I do not think that it would be an exaggeration to put the number of persons attending at fifteen hundred.</p>
   <p>The arrangements were as good as could be expected. After all, the land was bought only a short time ago. A clearing about four hundred feet from the entrance provided space for dancing, and a stand for the orchestra was built on top of the temporary icehouse. Beer and wine were served at three or four bars, and a few targets indicated future activities.</p>
   <p>The opening ceremonies were simple. The North Chicago male chorus sang <span class="page-break">5</span>several pretty songs, and Heinrich Engelhardt addressed the assembly, explaining that six or eight marksmen had conceived the idea of a rifle range for the North Side; the proposal found acceptance, and the members of the club decided that the acquisition of land would prove profitable. Within a short time 250 members were initiated. The speaker expressed the hope that the public would support the venture so that the mortgage may be paid off, and a suitable meeting place for Germans of the North Side may be established.</p>
   <p>Three cheers were given for the club.....Songs, dancing, and the inevitable beer followed.</p>
   <p>Dedication of the Humboldt Park Pavilion</p>
   <p>.....[Nothing about Germans; omitted.]</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The Annual Festival of the Chicago Schuetzenverein</p>
   <p>The Attendance was very good; five cars of the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad were crowded.....Target shooting commenced at two o'clock. Mr. Toggenfuager scored 195, the highest score so Far. The club furnished music and served refreshments. Another large crowd is expected today.</p>
