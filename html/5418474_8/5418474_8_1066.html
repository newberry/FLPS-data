   <p>Just as Professor Oncken lectured last winter so this winter Professor N. Kraeger, who reads art-history at the Art Academy in Duesseldorf, will give weekly lectures in the Club building of the Germania Men's Chorus in the German language. Professor Kraeger was called here from Germany to read at the University of Chicago. For these readings, he uses the English language.</p>
   <p>Non-members can be introduced to the lectures at the Germania Club by members.</p>
