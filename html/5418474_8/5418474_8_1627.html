   <p>The permanent retention of his name in Hampton, which is dedicated to the volution of two races, for which he has worked officially and privately during his lifetime, was especially sponsored by the executive committee. In Hampton, Carl Schurz, as Secretary of the Interior made his first successful experiments with the education of the Indians, which led to the present system of government schools with their civilized influence. It was his wish in the last years of his life to contribute to a proper installment of such institution and it is the plan of this society to accomplish these wishes. The former American ambassador at the English Court, Joseph H. Choate is the Chairman and the Banker, Isaac N. Seligman, is the Secretary of the National Society. Mr. Wilhelm Bocke is Chairman and Mr Otto E. Schneider, Secretary of the Chicago branch. The Milwaukee branch will erect a memorial themselves and after completion they will participare on the National movement in honor of Carl Schurz. The Society will also honor Schurz's activity for the development of the Negro and Indian races by the erection of a suitable building or in other suitable manner in the institution of Hampton, Va.</p>
