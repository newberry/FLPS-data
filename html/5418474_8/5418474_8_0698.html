   <p>Since the Deutsch-Americanische Literarische Verteidigungsausschuss [German-American Literary Defense Committee] has received all kinds of inquiries about the book entitled The Truth about Germany, the Committee has decided to publish this book in pamphlet form and to distribute it in the same manner as they did the Burgess articles. But, unfortunately the Committee is still short of means to go ahead with it. Prominent and well-known English editors have called the book one of the best that has ever been written about Germany. The language is plain, forceful, and convincing, the topic has been treated exhaustively and is splendidly presented. An American newspaperman has sent the Committee a small amount to start a printing fund. Since the book is rather comprehensive, this sum is unfortunately not sufficient. The Committee is therefore compelled to make an appeal to all those who are directly interested in the publication of this book. A special fund has been created for this purpose and the initial steps for printing have already been taken.</p>

   <p>If more money should be collected than is necessary for this particular job, as we sincerely hope, the surplus will be used to publish and distribute similar enlightening pamphlets by the thousands to serve as a countermeasure against British [anti-German] propaganda in this country. The Burgess article swept all over the United States, from New York to New Orleans, from Pittsburgh to San Francisco. The Committee, since it was established, has found out that propaganda with pamphlets and fly leaves is the best and most effective propaganda yet. The operating funds of the Committee, however, are very limited and it is up to the German-Americans whether the work can be continued or not.</p>
   <p>Informative literature, distributed over the country in thousands of copies is the only weapon which we have to combat that poison which is spread incessantly over America from Great Britain. But this fight costs money and the Committee therefore appeals to all German-Americans who are smarting under that daily slander, to lend a helping hand. We need the contribution <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of the little man. Everybody can and must co-operate in this great undertaking. It won't do any good just to denounce the British-inspired press. We need action. All of you Germans, who are suffering from the constant calumnies of the Anglo-philes, whose faces flush with anger when you see American public opinion caught in the net of London-fabricated lies, help us to tear apart this tissue of infamous falsehoods! Even the smallest contribution is appreciated and he who gives quickly, gives double. Donations will be receipted publicly in the German language press. Gifts for this special fund are to be addressed to the president of the Committee, Henry Weismann, 183 William Street, New York City. Orders for the book The Truth about Germany will be accepted now. Please enclose five cents in stamps for mailing and wrapping with each order.</p>
   <p>Within a few days we will also be ready to mail you the following: An article by Professor Scheuill of the University of Chicago, entitled, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>"Germany and the Peace of Europe"; an essay by Rudolf Kronall, "Do we need a Third War of Independence?; and also an article by Professor Sloane and many other affective pieces of literature.</p>
