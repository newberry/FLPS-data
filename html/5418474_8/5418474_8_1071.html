   <p>Yesterday afternoon the monthly meeting of the "Columbia Ladies Club" took place at the Germanic Club House. Miss Louise Troost held an interesting lecture about "Christmas Music of the various nationa." The captivating explanations given in poetical language were made clear by a double-quartet of men's and boy's voices besides some soloists. Christmas carols in the German, English, Scandinavian, and Russian languages were recited, and made like the lecture itself, a deep impression upon the numerous club members.</p>
