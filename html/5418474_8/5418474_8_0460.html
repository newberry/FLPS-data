   <p>President Hoover signed the bill which authorized the acquisition of the famous Vollbehr collection of books. The purchase price amounts to 1,500,000 dollars. The value of the collection is appraised at three million dollars.</p>
   <p>For more than thirty years the well-known collector Dr. Otto Vollbehr, of Berlin, Germany, has roamed all over Europe in search for rare copies. Henceforth, the Congressional Library will receive the Vollbehr collection of original prints and, together with it, the Gutenberg Bible on parchment, which was printed in 1450. Of the three parchment prints, of which one is to be found in London and the other in paris, the Vollbehr Gutenberg Bible is the best preserved and the most valuable.</p>
   <p>Connoisseurs appraised its value at one million dollars. The entire collection of Dr. Otto H. F. Vollbehr consists of 3,000 books. Besides the Gutenberg Bible, the value of which can only be guessed but cannot be exactly estimated, there can be found also original prints of the years 1450-1500. These are printed in the Latin, German, French, Italian, and Spanish languages, and include, besides the edition of classics, the entire domain of knowledge of those times, which are the forerunners of the Renaissance and Reformation.</p>
   <p>Dr. Herbert Putnam, the librarian of the Congressional Library, who has been for more than thirty years in the employ of the library, and has contributed greatly to its extension in order to make it one of the largest of the New World, appraised the value of the Vollbehr Collection at nearly three million dollars.</p>
   <p>Appreciation of the German-American Press</p>
   <p>The Library Committee of the Senate recommended unanimously the expenditure of 1,500,000 dollars for the purchase of the Vollbehr collection, including the Gutenberg Bible and 3,000 incunabula.</p>
   
   <p>Representative Collins declared that, according to his opinion, there was no doubt as to the correctness of the bill signed by the President. He paid tribute to the German press of this country for their exceedingly effective support in regard to the sanction of the bill. He declared that their support had been extraordinary and has greatly helped in stimulating the interest of the public throughout the country in favor of the purchase of the Gutenberg Bible and Vollbehr original collections.</p>
