   <p>The German Press Club gave its members an interesting and enjoyable entertainment last night at the Bismark Hoetl. Dr. Siegmund Zeisler gave a fascinating lecture on Rudolf Baumbach as poet. Several songs and music-recitals followed. The program of the evening wound up with a supper and dance.</p>
   <p>The Pressclub, which has gained many members during the last year, is serving its purpose well, to cultivate German literature, German Music and a jovial solidarity among German journalists.</p>
