   <p>To Mr. A. Schoeninger, Dr. Hessert, and others:</p>
   <p>Gentlemen: Your open letter encouraged us, and leads us to believe that not all is lost. [Translator's Note: For full details please see article entitled: "We Are On Our Way," Illinois Staats-Zeitung, October 9, 1879.] We were enthusiastic about your proposal, and the members adopted your suggestions unanimously. The fair will therefore not be held, and we shall appeal to Chicago's Germans for support.</p>
   <p>I find no adequate words properly to express our gratitude, nor the sentiments which your letter aroused among our dejected members.....</p>
   <p>We are submitting herewith a detailed account of our expenditures, and believe that this is in line with your reasoning.....</p>
   
   <p>After the destruction of the Turnhalle during the Chicago Fire on October 9, 1871, the Germans in Chicago encouraged the Turngemeinde to rebuild, so that a suitable meeting place would be provided for the liberal-minded element of the city. Splendid buildings arose everywhere in Chicago and, as the Germans made large donations, the Association decided to erect a magnificent hall--an idea which conformed to the spirit then prevailing.</p>
   <p>Of the three hundred members of the Turngemeinde, only forty-two suffered no loss during the great fire, yet $7,000 was raised in a short time among this group to pay the mortgage on the destroyed building, so that a loan of $55,000 could be negotiated for a new structure. Non-interest bearing bonds were issued and sold to the public, which netted $33,000. The members also took a financial interest and provided $7,000.</p>
   <p>We started building; the magnificent exterior was very imposing, and every German felt elated as he passed the edifice. Before we put on the roof, we ran out of funds. What were we to do? We could not wait for "better times," as one might do in everyday pursuits. The people wanted something for the money which had been spent. The members did what they could, and others provided as much as was possible under existing conditions.</p>
   <p>We appealed to out-of-town friends. G. Freygang, a Turner of New York, heard about our predicament and came to Chicago. He was impressed by the city's activity and became acquainted with the Germans here; he perceived the interest manifested by the Germans in the efforts of the Turngemeinde and said, "With that typical German spirit prevailing here, I consider your word to be better than a bond," and gave $20,000. He had confidence in us and will not lose--just as we Germans will not lose the hall.</p>
   <p>In 1874, the Turngemeinde was just about on the rocks; unforeseen circumstances curtailed our income and six per cent bonds were issued. The members bought enough to bring in $1,825. Two years ago, $3,000 had to be raised. But how? A general meeting was called on a Sunday afternoon. The board urged the members time and again to help, and $1,500 was pledged; eight days later the entire $3,000 was received, and more than half of it was an outright gift.</p>
   <p>Of course, under such conditions, our membership could not grow. But regardless of these inauspicious circumstances, and the hopeless prospects, the Turngemeinde persevered. The activities of a few, and of the thirteen who at various times served on the board during these many years shall not be forgotten here. These men deserve our gratitude. They worked zealously, unselfishly, at a time when they had difficulty in providing the wherewithal to support their families. Their constant efforts saved the Turnhalle.</p>
   <p>Herewith we append the report of the secretary:</p>

   <p>"According to the aforesaid, all the liabilities of the Turngemeinde, including bonds worth $32,361.25, amount to $153,468.75.</p>

   <p>"Interest per year amounts to $6,649.20.</p>
   <p>"Our income during the past year was as follows:</p>
   <p>"Receipts</p>
   <p>Rents collected...................................................$ 5,958.54</p>
   <p>Net receipts from 38 Sunday concerts...........................1,242.02</p>
   <p>Net receipts from masquerades..................................3,066.24</p>
   <p>Net receipts from the tavern and lunch room..................1,729.25</p>
   <p>Net receipts from sales of articles...............................362.85</p>
   <p>Donations............................................................498.32</p>
   <p>Claim paid by the insurance company on the old hall, destroyed by the Chicago Fire....................................22.50</p>
   <p>Sale of old piano....................................................54.00</p>
   <p>Total.................................................................$13,058.72</p>
   
   <p>"Expenses</p>
   <p>Uncollected rents......................... $166.00</p>
   <p>Loss, stockholder's dance..................12.29</p>
   <p>Interest...................................... 5,570.23</p>
   <p>Various expenses............................6,530.36</p>
   <p>Total........................................ $12,278.88</p>
   <p>"This would give a surplus of $779.84, but we are in arrears with our interest payments amounting to $2,000, and taxes for 1878, which were $800.</p>
   <p>"Under the heading, 'Various expenses, $6,530.36,' a large portion was spent for alterations and building. Next year this item will show a considerable decrease. Insurance rates, taxes, and wages are also lower, which will represent a saving of about $2,000 for next year.</p>
   <p>"Receipts, particularly hall rent, do not cover the high maintenance cost; but this is unavoidable because of competition, and so we must be satisfied to charge low rentals, since we have no alternative; nor is it possible to devise other means to cover this loss. Our hall was rented more frequently last year than during the previous three years, yet our income was less.</p>
   <p>"As a comparison I submit a financial report from the year 1874, the first year after the hall was completed: ..... [long list of particulars]. According to these figures, our debts at that time amounted to $122,061.65. Our present debts are $115,813.94, a diminution of $6,147.70 (sic).</p>
   <p>"During the past six years the board paid, in interest alone, $41,790.16, and decreased the original debt by $6,700.</p>
   <p>"Fritz Goetz, Secretary."</p>
   <p>You will undoubtedly ask how we were enabled to cover our enormous expenditures, considering the low income enumerated above. I explained this at the beginning: The members of the Turngemeinde often paid money out of their own pockets, and gave until they could contribute no more. They did this, not only in the instances given here, but even when dances, picnics, and other festivals were arranged.</p>
   <p>We have no recourse to this now; the members are nearly broke, and therefore we intended to hold a fair. We are glad that you suggested something better, and we certainly will follow your advice--just as soon as the members have decided on the procedure.</p>
   <p>If, as you believe, every German, every liberally inclined person, will do his share and contribute something to liquidate the second mortgage of $20,000, then we will be on a solid financial foundation, and it won't be necessary to resort again to the kinds of entertainments which are not compatible with the standard of our institution. We will then be enabled to use the Turnhalle for the purpose it was intended for, the development of physical and mental ability, and to provide a meeting place where the interests of the Germans can be considered!</p>
   <p>When the time comes that a German might exclaim, as he enters the Turnhalle, "This is our building forever, and I did my share," then, gentlemen, all of our Germans will express their gratitude in the same measure as I do now in behalf of the Turngemeinde.</p>
   <p>Emil Hoechster,</p>
   <p>First speaker of the Chicago Turngemeinde.</p>
