   <p>Last Saturday, the Chicago Sport Club celebrated its seventh anniversary at the Germania Club. The large number of participants were an indication of the reputation enjoyed by the organization. There were well over six hundred persons present.</p>
   <p>The Alvin-Bevier orchestra played for dancing in the large hall, while in the adjoining hall a trio entertained the guests. In addition, the well-known artist, Kurt Schlegel, contributed to their entertainment by giving his recitations.</p>
   <p>Not until the morning hours did the crowd of participants begin to diminish, and it is said that the faithfuls did not start for home until dawn.</p>
   <p>The first entertainment at the Germania Club won new friends and sympathizers for the Chicago Sport Club. All but a few German sport organizations were represented by delegates. Likewise, various singing organizations were represented.</p>
