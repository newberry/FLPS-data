   <p>Although not so many were gathered Saturday evening in the beautiful Hall of the Athletic Club "Unity", yet it was a very happy crowd. A splendid orchestra under the direction of Professor Louis Thies played exceedingly well.</p>
   <p>Young and old enjoyed the dances and the music and all seemed to be good humor.-</p>
