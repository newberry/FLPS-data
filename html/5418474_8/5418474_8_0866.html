   <p>The local Waldeck lodge has sent a circular to its German sister lodges. It says among other things: "What we want is the improvement of humanity, based on science morality and art. This is the trinity in which we believe. This is the religion which some say will become the religion of the world. No philosophical system nor church dogma has ever been more simple. But the word must be translated into action.</p>
   <p>"Guided by this conviction, we have made the attempt to found a free drawing school. We note with joy that this attempt has been crowned with success. The Waldeck drawing school has now been in existence one year, and is attended regularly by almost 100 students. We hope that some day it will become a true cultural institution for our young people."</p>
   <p>The school is in Kemmler's hall, corner of S. Clark and 18th St. The Waldeck lodge has been in existence since Jan. 30, 1871.</p>
