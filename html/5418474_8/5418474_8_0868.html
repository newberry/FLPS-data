   <p>It is with joy that I have learned that the Germans of this country are taking up a collection for a normal school.</p>
   <p>If the collection taken up here in Chicago should be a success, other cities, influenced by the example, will without doubt follow suit. But no time is to be wasted. Even now the lack of German teachers is felt. This is due partially to the lack of teachers in Germany and partially to the decreasing immigration. By supporting the normal school we can now become independent of our old fatherland.</p>
   <p>We have shown sufficiently what we are able to do when we have had to alleviate the sufferings of the wounded ones in the Franco-German War. <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Should we not be able to raise now one-fourth of that sum which we collected in 1870, for the benefit of the education of our children?</p>
   <p>The normal school is very modest in its demands. A yearly income of $8,000 will be sufficient to begin the work. Fifty-two thousand dollars was subscribed at a meeting last May in Cincinnati and a great part of it has so far been paid in. If the matter proceeds favorably, the normal school can be opened in July 1877.</p>
   <p>Considerable sums have also been subscribed in the East and in a few cities of the Northwest. Chicago, as a center of Germanism, will without doubt take an active part in this matter, concerning the preservation of the German language. Mr. H. Enderis, 130 Lake Street, will receive all the contributions for Chicago and forward them to the treasurer, Mr. Ch. Preusser in Chicago.</p>
