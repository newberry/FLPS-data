   <p>The City Council which was elected in November, 1869 (with a majority of "reformers") tried to take away the job of printing the official city news in German from the Illinois Staats Zeitung and to turn it over to the "Volks Zeitung" a paper founded in opposition to the Staats Zeitung. The Illinois Staats Zeitung got out a judicial injunction as well as a directed order to the City Council to give the job to the Staats Zeitung.</p>
   <p>The Volks Zeitung appealed. The Superior Court has now handed down a decision saying that it should not have been forbidden to the Volks Zeitung to get the city printing job at some future time when it should be the German paper with the largest circulation in the State.</p>
   <p>The Staats Zeitung is pleased and amused by this decision, the editor saying that his paper still has eight times as many subscribers as the Volks Zeitung.</p>
