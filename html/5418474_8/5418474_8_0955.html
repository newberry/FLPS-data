These bleak scenes are relieved by pictures of the charitable acts of a blessed man, Julius Kuder, who in his beautifully situated Swiss home, Neutal, has for years been gathering the most miserable children from all parts of the unfortunate German homeland, and restoring them to mental and bodily health.
