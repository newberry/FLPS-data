   <p>The German-American Historical Society of Illinois held their monthly meeting yesterday. At this occasion Mr. F. Baumann, a architect, finished his interesting lecture on "Architecture in the State of Illinois", and in particular about the buildings in Chicago. The Society resolved to print in their publication,"Leaves of History", the lecture on architecture verbatim.</p>
   <p>It also was suggested to get in closer touch with other German organizations by sending delegates to their meetings. This is aimed at a closer cooperation of all the German-Americans in the State.</p>
   <p>The annual meeting will be held on February 12.</p>
