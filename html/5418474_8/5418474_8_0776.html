   <p>The institution located at No. 205 Cass St. supplies a long felt want, as it gives grown persons an opportunity to resume their neglected linguistic and artistic studies.</p>
   <p>The head of this academy has obtained her scholastic degrees in Germany and France. She has also gained considerable experience in the teaching profession as she has been teaching in many colleges.</p>
   <p>Languages are taught through conversation; use promotes proficiency, as it compels the student to think in the new language. Those who wish to study, so as to prepare themselves for the teaching profession, will be thoroughly grounded in history, literature and educational methods.</p>
   <p>Good opportunities are provided for those who wish to develop their artistic proclivities. Copies of famous masterworks from the Louvre and the palace of Luxemburg in Paris, such as Claude Lorraine, Millet, Dagnon, Bouveret, Ponot, Billotte etc., are available. The thoughts of the classical masters lend themselves to observation and analysis.</p>
   <p>The Fall course commences next Wednesday, September 6. Applications for enrollment are accepted any day.</p>
