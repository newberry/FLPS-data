   <p>The [marksmen's] festival continued yesterday. Great rivalry prevailed throughout the day--and considerable effort. There were few visitors in proportion to the bonafide riflemen. But whoever was present had a nice time. The ladies and the riflemen who were not members of any club tried their luck on the "ladies'" and "bird" targets, at the bowling alley or at ring pitching. The children appeared to be delighted by the swings, or when the wheel of fortune let them win, or if, when shooting at a target, they hit a star.</p>
   <p>This forenoon, two trains will leave for the park, one at 8:40 A. M., (for the riflemen) and the other at 10 A. M. (for the visitors).</p>
   <p>The following list gives the names of the gentlemen who proved to be the best marksmen at yesterdays meeting: 1.) M. Grau, Chicago; 2.) Wm. Hayes, New York.... [Translator's note: Altogether fifty-seven names were listed]</p>
