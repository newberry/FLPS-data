   <p>Prof. Dr. R. R. Schmidt of the Tuebingen University, held a very interesting lecture in the Lincoln Club about the old Germanic culture. Dr. Schmidt who, upon request already has spoken at several universities, about his own epochal discoveries, presents the life of our German ancestors in an entirely new light.</p>
   <p>His statements which rest upon the reliable foundation of his own research, in regard to the prehistoric times of Germany, transform completely the assertions of the old Roman authors, which a short time ago were blindly depended upon; and a German epoch of culture around 2,000 B. C. is recognized, which, apparently even influenced and favored Greek culture.</p>
