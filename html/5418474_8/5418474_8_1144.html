   <p>An interesting lecture was given last night in Hoff's Hall, 703 Milwaukee Avenue, by Mr. F. Bielefeld, a socialist, who spoke about immigration to America and its increase from year to year, with special reference to German immigration. The speaker stated that one of the major reasons for this increase was high taxation [in the countries of origin] --a taxation brought about by the expenses of a large standing army. He pointed out that we should mix with these newcomers and get them united with us before the rich factories get them for small wages. The big men are tickled pink to see the immigrants, unaccustomed to our wages, go to work for them. The speaker received great applause.</p>
