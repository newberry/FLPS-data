   <p>The first Progressive Sunday School in the Fortschritt Turner Hall, being considered a success and assured of its existence in the future, the Arbeiter Bildungs Verein of the North West side resolved to open a second Sunday school on August 12th in the Thalia Hall, 636 Milwaukee Ave.</p>
   <p>The school begins at 9:30 A.M. and ends at 11:00 A.M.</p>
   <p>The Verein succeeded in acquiring several good teachers and requests all progressively minded parents who want their children to participate in sound teachings, free of any religious swindle, to make it their duty to help this undertaking and make the second school on the North West Side also a success.</p>
