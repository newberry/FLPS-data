   <p>The Group Jefferson No. 1 held yesterday an Agitation Meeting in which Comrade Fehling lectured on the theme "Change for the worse of the working men's position." The speaker remarked that the anarchists were reproached, that they would have nothing to do with unions; naturally the anarchists could not be persuaded to be enthusiastic about Reform swindles and Election Humbugs, but they tried to prepare the people for the coming Revolution,</p>
   <p>Furthermore, he pointed to the uselessness of strikes. In conclusion he opposed the assertion of certain Reform advocates, that the workers conditions have improved and proved the foolishness of such statments, through statistics.</p>
   <p>The debate on this lecture was postponed till the next meeting. Comrades Hirsch and Bulian were elected as delegates to the arrangment committee of the next picnic.</p>
