   <p>Today's anniversary copy of the Illinois Staats Zeitung is the biggest single edition that ever has been published of any German newspaper in America. It contains 45 columns of articles which printed in the size of a book would form a volume of 200 pages. For the lively business activity of the city characteristic is the fact, that in this single number there are not less than 35 columns of new advertisements. What a contrast to that first skimpy sheet, 364 days ago, through which the editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung managed to give its readers a first sign of life.</p>
