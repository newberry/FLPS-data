   <p>Never has the Vorwarts Turnverein been so fully packed as last night in honor of Gloy's Benefit. The program was beyond expectation. Mr. Gloy, the leader, showed his craft last night. He had sixty Turner students of his working on the floor in different tableaus and different athletic poses. With pride, the boys parents were watching their sons' wonderful work. The second part of the program was the stage opera which was explained in announcing the event in yesterday's paper. The audience was very much taken by everything. Finally a dance was given which lasted until daylight.</p>
