   <p>Professor Wiedinger, the well-known educator, will open next week a German-English school at 533 N. Clark Street. The new institution will teach several high school subjects, and it will be under the direction of Professor Wiedinger himself. The subjects offered will be taught in either German or English.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wiedinger's reputation as an educator is so well known by the older German generation of the city that he will have no difficulty in attracting a great number of students. We consider it our duty to call the attention of the parents to this new school, which we heartily recommend.</p>
