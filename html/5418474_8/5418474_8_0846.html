   <p>Monday, December 6, 1880, this School was opened, and pupils during the first school year will be accepted at any time. The object of the institution is to educate deaf and dumb children according to the principles of Pestalozzi and Froebel and to make them self-reliant and useful members of the human society. The deaf and dumb not only will be taught to read and write English and German but also to learn to speak distinctly and lip reading. Thousands of deaf and dumb have already reached that goal and, the majority of the pupils will likewise get there with the necessary persistence. For the beginning as long as circumstances do not permit a closer location of the school, lessons will be given in a private house.</p>
   <p>All parents of deaf and dumb children and other friends of this movement, are cordially invited to visit the school occasionally and to judge my methods of teaching and its success.</p>
