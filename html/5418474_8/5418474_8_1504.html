   <p>A splendid affair! That is what the members of the Nord-Chicago Schuetzenverein (North Chicago Riflemen's Club) will exclaim about yesterday's festival. About two hundred members were present during the dedication ceremony at their recently acquired property--a delightful grove at Clybourn and Belden Avenues. A jovial crowd gathered at the river where--and let this be emphasized--the water is still unpolluted, and is clear as a brook. Immense oaks, hickory trees, and elms provided ample shade, yet did not exclude the cool western breezes, as the land is free of brush.</p>
   <p>A dance floor had been built, excellent music was provided, and the younger people enjoyed themselves immensely, while those more advanced in years conversed with friends and watched the antics of happy children. The North Chicago Schuetzenverein did the right thing at the right time, and deserves the support of all liberally inclined people.</p>

   <p>The charter, sent by the Secretary of State, was presented to the club at about five o'clock, and was read to the assembly; this event heightened the impressiveness of the festival.</p>
   <p>The Schuetzenverein is now duly incorporated, and it is to be hoped that hundreds of our more prominent citizens will become members.</p>
