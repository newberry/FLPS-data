   <p>The improvement anticipated by the Society for June, July and August has not taken place. A comparison with the corresponding period of last year shows a small decline in the number of the unemployed but a great increase in requests for food and lodging.</p>
   <p>From June 1st till August 31st, the German Society has assisted 179 families with 619 children and 65 single persons, among them 21 women. It has provided shelter including 522 meals to 426 unemployed, and free medical care and medicines to 355. Through the Society's intervention, 19 were placed in private hospitals, 26 in the County hospital, 14 in Oak Forest, two in the State Insane Asylum, two in the T. B. Sanitarium, and one in the Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor. Of the almost 10,000 people who called at the offices of the Society, 329 only could find employment. For these means of assistance, the German Society of Chicago spent a total of $2,629.20.</p>
