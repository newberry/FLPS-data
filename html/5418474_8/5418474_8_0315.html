   <p>Mr. Wolf Von Schierbrand, associate member of the Herald and former secretary to Ambassador Winston of Persia, gave a lecture about that nation before the above-mentioned Society. To hear a detailed account of this distant, strange country, especially when given by an individual who actually lived there, would naturally be interesting; so it is not surprising that a large audience gathered there.</p>
   <p>The "German Literature Society" consists mostly of native Americans, but their object is to popularize the German language amongst the English speaking people. We congratulate the "Society" upon its intentions and we ardently wish for its success.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be Tuesday, 8 P.M., room D, Central Music Hall. Everyone is welcome.</p>
