   <p>The Turn Verein Aurora was founded on Feb. 22, 1864 (Washington's birthday) chiefly by members of the then existing Aurora Social Club.</p>
   <p>It started out with 22 members of which two still survive.</p>
   <p>At the beginning the Turn Verein held its meetings in the old Aurora Turner Hall at the corner of Milwaukee and Ohio Streets, where now stands the Concordia Hall.</p>
   <p>In June 1867, the Verein joined the North American Turner Assocation and immediately afterwards showed a great improvement.</p>
   <p>Already in 1867 the Verein could start with the building of the present Hall.</p>
   <p>The club also had its ups and downs. In 1877 it was forced to sell its hall and the number of members dwindled from 250 to 28.</p>
   <p>Those loyal 28 members reorganized the Verein again in 1878 and since then <span class="page-break">\2</span>it has been flourishing.</p>
   <p>At the present time the membership numbers 467. They are all in good standing, and the property of the Verein amounts to $15,000,00.</p>
   <p>The Turn Verein Aurora has always stood as for the principles of the North American Turn Verein and will always defend the principles of humanity and progress.</p>
