   <p>We have received the following communication from the Institution for the Feeble-minded and Epileptics in Alsterdorf, Germany: "The Red Cross sent us a donation, an original contribution by Mrs. B. Kment, and one from Mrs. Kempf of Chicago, for which we are very grateful. Our institutions in Alsterdorf were established sixty years ago. They have been dedicated to the care of the feeble-minded, epileptics and cripples, stressing education, and creating interest in an occupation in as far as individual cases permit. In promoting this work, we always had to depend upon donations. The War, and the following years played havoc with our financial condition, and, although, one notes a general monetary improvement, we are still very much dependent, upon the help of true philantropists.....</p>
   <p>Originating in a private home, where four idiotic children were cared for, the institution expanded until there are nearly one thousand inmates....We hope that the humanitarian work can continue.... May God give His blessings."</p>
