   <p>The Froebel Kindergarten Verein (Froebel Kindergarten Association) after its first year of successful and useful existence, is in a position now to enlarge its circle of activity. Those educational principles, advocated by Froebel, the unforgettable teacher and friend of youth-shall be expanded and extended to more schools and to every part of our community.</p>
   <p>The Froebel Kindergarten so far has kept up its existence through voluntary contributions, but the proposed expansion-program will make it necessary to establish a more substantial basis for the needed resources of this benevolent enterprise. A more lively membership-campaign is suggested towards that goal. Not only family-fathers, but also those citizens without children will be interested to become members of the Froebel Kindergarten Association. The annual membership dues will be $3,00,which may be paid in three months' installments. The Froebel Kindergarten is also glad and willing, to take care of children, whose parents are without means to become paying members.</p>
