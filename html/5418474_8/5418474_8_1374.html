   <p>The Calumet Gymnastic Club has acquired a piece of land, 60 x 140 feet, at the corner of 92nd Street and Chicago Avenue for the price of $7500.00 and intends to build a solid house of three floors for a bymnastic Hall, a theatre, and a dance room.</p>
   <p>The Clubs in this district welcome this undertaking with great joy, as they have been dependent in celebrating their festivals upon the hall of the Young Men's Christian Association and had to be satisfied with several injustices and limitations.</p>
