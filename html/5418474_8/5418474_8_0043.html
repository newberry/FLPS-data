   <p>The Great Picnic of the United Armed Organizations is approaching. Only a few days and the Sunday on which the much promising festival is going to take place, is here.</p>
   <p>A wonderful program is expected. Ogden Grove, one of the best suited for such purposes, will be the place of the Festival. In the course of the forenoon, there will be a large procession in which, we hope, the Workers Associations are going to participate, without exception.</p>
