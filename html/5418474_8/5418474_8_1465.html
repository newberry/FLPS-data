   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde (Turner Association) held a general meeting yesterday which was well attended. Emil Hoechster (official speaker of the Turngemeinde) called the assembly to order, and told the members that the purpose of the meeting was to consider ways and means to pay off the mortgage. [Translator's note: Please see: Answer of the Chicago Turngemeinde to the Open Letter, Illinois Staats-Zeitung, Oct. 11, 1879.]</p>
   <p>After several gentlemen had expressed their views, Max Stern made a motion to issue non-interest bearing bonds for $30,000, full bonds as well as fractional bonds. Naturally, the motion resulted in an intense debate, but met with approval, and a large majority was in favor of the measure.</p>
   <p>It was then decided to apportion the net receipts of next year, using one half for payments on the old debt, and one half to redeem the new bonds. At the annual ball of the stockholders, numbers shall be drawn to decide which of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>bonds are to be redeemed first. With respect to the redemption of the fractional bonds, no action was taken at this time; this matter will be decided later.</p>
   <p>The new series of bonds will be issued and sold under the supervision of a citizen's committee. The names of the committee members will be announced in the near future.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Hoechster and Stern, as well as Joseph Kaufmann, Wm. Kuecken, C.A.F. Hunke, Joseph Stab, and others, were in favor of the plan, and considered non-interest bearing bonds a solution for the difficulties confronting the Turnhalle (Turner Hall), and all expressed hope that the Germans in Chicago will give financial support to the Turngemeinde, so that the mortgage on the hall can be paid. Adjournment followed.</p>
   <p>The citizens' committee, the members of the executive board, and the advisory committee will hold a meeting this evening to consider the bond issue.</p>
