Although Chicago has a German population of nearly 30,000, only one paper exists, the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, and regardless of its capable staff, it becomes apparent that the paper must serve too many interests to follow a straight, definite course.</p>
   <p>German newspaper development in Michigan shows even a lower comparative percentage, i.e., ratio of inhabitants to number of papers published. In that State we have 80,000 Germans, but only two weekly publications and the semi-weekly Michigan Journal.</p>
   <p>Wisconsin is the land of German newspapers.</p>
