   <p>Frequently the wish had been uttered to unite once more the whole staff of the Festival Marshal as it functioned at the German Peace Celebration, and it had been decided to add to the reunion, homage to Mr. Greenebaum (Henry), in whose hands all threads converged for four weeks before the celebration, and through whose skill in knitting them together the festival became what it was.</p>
   <p>It was a very thoughtful idea to give the souvenir, for the man who was to be honored, the form of an iron cross. That this iron cross was of heavy, solid gold will not detract from its value. The cross has been made in the shop of Mr. Freund and is an artistic masterpiece. On the back is an inscription.</p>
   <p>The participants in the celebration - numbering about eighty - assembled at 8 o'clock in the house of Mr. Emil Dietzsch and went at about 9 o'clock in three big cars together with the whole Great Western Light Guard Band to the residence of Mr. Greenebaum, 605 Hubbard Street. After playing several patriotic tunes, and being invited into the house and the full-flowering garden, Mr. Wilhelm Vocke made the following speech: "The recognition and homage paid to the Festival Marshal comes by no means only from the officers <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of his staff; on the contrary, it is rendered to him by the whole of Chicago's Germandom. We all know how he has worked for German interests and German ideals for many years, and for this we have chosen as a gift a copy of the iron cross; just as in Germany it is regarded as a proof of the highest valor, so it may on his chest forever proclaim him the truest and most valiant of men."</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenebaum, in his answer, said among other things: "The nomination for Festival Marshal in itself was an honor far beyond my merits. I am very happy that I succeeded in all business meetings to maintain my personal relations so that the friendship that has existed between us for a long time has been preserved. Though I was very young when I came to America and though I have spent in this country two-thirds of my life, I have yet preserved my German heart. If in old age it should be granted to me to look back on a long life then it will be my pride to have remained a German and to have contributed with my little strength to the progress and the culture of humanity."</p>

   <p>Then Mr. Emil Dietzsch read, amidst Homeric laughter, his "History of the Teutons," printed sometime ago in the St. Louis Vehme, and promised to finish it sometime.</p>
   <p>Among the others who spoke were Mr. Franz Arnold who called the Peace Celebration the beginning of a new era in Chicago; Alderman Buhler, August Blum, Attorney Runyan, and R. Thien. It was long past midnight when the party dispersed in the best of moods.</p>
