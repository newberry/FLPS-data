   <p>Professor Frederick Shuman, of the University of Chicago, has returned to America from a long trip through the principal countries of Europe and lectured recently before the League of Women Voters on his observations and experiences. The professor says that, if America wants to protect herself against that pathological type of political philosophy called fascism, she will have to create economic security for her middle class citizens. Professor Shuman entertains no illusions about the fact that the fate of democracy in Europe is sealed.</p>
   <p>He declares that only twenty million of the 220,000,000 people who live in Central Europe are ruled in a democratic way. He mentions, as causes of this condition, the technique of war propaganda, the American high-pressure methods of salesmanship, and the almost religious enthusiasm for fascist principles prevailing in those countries which have adopted fascism. It may be assumed that the political parties, and obviously the fascists also, have learned something from the war propaganda, and it would be surprising if they had not imitated the methods of this propaganda to a certain extent. The same is true, perhaps, of the American salesman's irresistible approach known in this country as the "high pressure" method.</p>
   <p>And still it appears as though the professor confounds cause with effect, when he speaks of the religious enthusiasm of the fascists. Fascism did not originate from nothing. It serves as a substitute for the old liberal and democratic ideas and ideals, which had hitherto governed the nations. The nations saw that democracy had outlived itself. There were two ways open to them--one led to socialism or communism, the other to fascism, and they chose the latter.</p>
   
   <p>One need not be a born rebel to see that the old methods of government are absolutely senseless and purposeless. A short time ago, Lord Rothermere, England's most powerful and influential newspaper publisher, asked the English people to join the fascist movement of Sir Oswald Moseley. In this request he said, among other things that, if Sir Oswald Moseley and Hitler had conversed with one another for two hours, they would have accomplished more than all the European statesmen of the old school would have achieved through years of negotiation.</p>
   <p>Lord Rothermere's statement is not exaggerated by any means. Statesmen and diplomats have deliberated on disarmament for years. Preliminary discussions, committee meetings, and tiring plenary sessions followed one another; Chancellor Hitler had his demands presented, and when they were not met, he simply declared, "We shall no longer participate in negotiations"--whereupon Germany withdrew from the disarmament conference and the League of Nations. Although Hitler did not solve the problem by this procedure, he did at least clarify the situation as far as Germany is concerned. He does not dangle the Fata Morgana of a universal disarmament before the eyes of his people, as the other statesmen continue to do, because they are either cowardly or incompetent.</p>
   <p>By the way, Professor Schuman is mistaken, if he believes that fascism flourishes only in Central Europe. Just last week a purely dictatorial constitution was adopted in Esthonia, and that, not by the government of that country, but according to resolutions voted by the people in the plebiscite held last October. It was only in 1918 that Esthonia became a free and independent republic, after it had suffered for centuries under Russian rule. Now, the nation has voluntarily renounced its liberties. Fascism has made great headway also in England, and just how far the movement has already progressed is evident from the fact that it is advocated by a person as influential as Lord Rothermere.</p>
   <p>Professor Schuman says that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are the strongest bulwarks against dictatorship. It seems that they did not assert themselves in our country; for even in the United States little of democracy has remained. Just after he assumed office, the President received dictatorial powers from Congress, and apparently the people are entirely satisfied.</p>
