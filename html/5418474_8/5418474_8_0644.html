   <p>No other paper has found it so difficult (as the Staats Zeitung) to give even a sign of life after the horrible catastrophe of October 8. Because the personnel of none has been burned out so completely as that of the Staats Zeitung. One member of the editorial staff, one type-setter, and one porter, are all who have not lost all of their property. The main owner of the Staats Zeitung whose wonderful energy and elasticity we badly miss in this hard time is in Europe. The business manager and his family had not been seen since Monday morning and only this afternoon do we hear that he has brought his dear ones into safety to Indianapolis - from where he repeatedly sent us telegrams, that never reached us. No press, no types, no printing paper, no place, and no money (as long as it has not been ascertained whether all the bank safes have been preserved); under such circumstances it is difficult to resuscitate a newspaper from its ashes, and no reader will be surprised if its first beginnings appear meager.</p>
