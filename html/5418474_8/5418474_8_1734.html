   <p>Among the approved recommendations to be submitted in May to the supreme convention in Pittsburgh are the following: That the per capita tax be abolished; that an insurance up to $2,000 be allowed; and that the old age treasury pay double the amount of the paid-in assessment to the heirs of deceased members. Of the class "B" recommendations, which were approved, the most important is that a member after 20 years, should, upon request receive a certificate in which the heirs are assured, that they will receive the paid-in assessment, together with 6% interest.</p>
