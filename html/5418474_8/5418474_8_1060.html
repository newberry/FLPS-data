   <p>Mrs. Fernande (Edna Fern) Richter of St. Louis, the well-known poetess, gave a lecture last night before a large audience in Schmidt's Hall at 547 N. Clark Street. She was engaged by the Historical Society. Mrs. Richter chose as her lecture a sad chapter from the history of immigration namely that of the so-called Redemptionists and particularly the role of the Germans of that class.</p>
   <p>She demonstrated with historical proofs, that the treatment given to immigrants without means during the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century caused conditions approximating white slavery. Many died on the way shortly afterwards. Many who had means, when they started their great journey, arrived without cash, being robbed and plundered by scoundrels of captains.</p>
