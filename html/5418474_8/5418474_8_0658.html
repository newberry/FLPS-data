   <p>German publishing in the eastern part of the United States is still in the stage of reprinting and translating in so far as books are concerned.</p>
   <p>A biography of Barnum, written in German, has been offered by the New York publisher Schmidt, who has no scruples about such matters. It is an insult to Germans to believe that they will buy such trash. In the West German literature takes cognizance of progress in its diverse branches. Within the last half year many German papers have been founded; practically all excel in their liberal conceptions and their cultural standard.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung, in its Sunday issue a fortnight ago, referred again to the plan of the Hochwaechter (Watchman). It provides for a convention of German editors. We do not believe that the idea can be realized, although the scheme is beneficial and necessary. Most of the German editors, unfortunately, have not much time to travel or to leave their business even for a short period. It appears to me that lack of time and money are the principal <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>objections to this venture, rather than disinclination for agreement and peace, because if such a convention takes place, then the usual party rifts and political dissensions will be relegated to the background. It is gratifying to see that personal scandals find less prominence in the papers, and that the editors accede to the general demands of the public. Conditions would be more auspicious if the meeting were scheduled for Whitsunday. On that day the song festival will be held in Cleveland, and may we be permitted to suggest that the conditions would be productive of greater harmony?</p>
