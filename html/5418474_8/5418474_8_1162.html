   <p>Mr. Hermann Linde, the famous Shakespeare reciter, will give here next month a number of recitations. Mr. Linde does not read the dramas but recites them from memory in such a manner that the audience always listens with the deepest interest. The most eminent critics of Germany have praised his performances. A picture of Mr. Linde has been displayed at the Enderis book store, corner of Clark and Lake streets.</p>
