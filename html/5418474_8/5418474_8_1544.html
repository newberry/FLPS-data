   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde leased a lot, 101 by 160 feet, on North Clark Street, north of Melm's Garden, for a period of ten years. The lease contains a provision that the Turngemeinde may purchase the property within the specified time. The rental is $500 annually for the first five years, and $600 annually for the last five years. The Turngemeinde intends to erect a gymnasium on the lot, and the members are showing great enthusiasm for the enterprise. The Turner Company of the old Hecker Regiment has already subscribed for $645 worth of stock and sent the money in cash, promising to purchase more shares later.</p>
   <p>The building committee is very active and will immediately take all steps necessary to get construction under way, since the building is to be ready for use before winter.</p>
