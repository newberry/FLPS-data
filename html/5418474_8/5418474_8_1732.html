   <p>The demands made by destitute families upon the German Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft) of Chicago have, according to report, increased rather than diminished in the last few months. But as regards employment conditions, it seems that a remarkable change for the better has taken place, even though it may be only temporary. The number of those looking for employment fell to about 1400, of whom 120 were given work. But these, too, had to be content with temporary employment and with the prevailing low scale of wages.</p>
   <p>The main task of the Society, however, in keeping with its activities extending over seventy-one years, consisted of aiding and advising forty-two unemployable families with 135 children and nineteen single persons. Unemployed and shelterless persons were provided with 139 meals and seventy-one sleeping quarters and as long as the means lasted, women and children obtained dresses and shoes. As for the sick and the debilitated, five were placed in private hospitals, six in the County Hospital, four in the county poorhouse in Oak Forest and one in the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium. Fourteen other persons received free medical treatment, medicine, bandages, eyeglasses, etc.</p>
   <p>For all these purposes, the German Society spent $597.88.</p>
