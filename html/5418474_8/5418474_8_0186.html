   <p>The masquerade of the Chicago Turngemeinde was the greatest festival of the year so far. Its greatest attraction was the representation of the cycle of Niebelungen. Picture 1 represented Rheingold. Picture 2 represented Walkure. Picture 3 represented Siegfried. Picture 4 represented the Dawn of the gods. Picture 5 represented the apparition of Prince Carnival.</p>
   <p>The carnival procession was most successful. The wagons of the gods were magnificently decorated. The Chicago Turngemeinde can look back with pride upon last night's entertainment.</p>
