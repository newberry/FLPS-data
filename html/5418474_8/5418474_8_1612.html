   <p>The opening of the exhibition of models for the Goethe Monument, sponsored by the Monument Society, as opened at the Art Institute last night. The winning model was the one exhibited by Professor Hermann Hahn, of Munich.</p>
   <p>Lincoln Park, near Diversey Blvd., has been selected as the location for Hahn's creation, a lasting tribute to that mightiest of intellectuals the German nation has ever produced.</p>
   <p>Many models were included in the exhibition of Which Professor Hahn's was adjudged the best. The prize-wining creation was selected by a group of art judges, headed by Mr. Ferdinand von Miller, on September 17, 1919, in Berlin. The predominant feature at the opening of the exhibition was a reception, arranged by the Goethe Monument Society, with Mr. Harry Rubens as chairman. The Germans of Chicago were well represented, and the same may be said <span class="page-break">2</span>of our two leading Universities. Among the guests were: Consul Geissler, representative of the German Reich; Consul Holinger, representative of Switzerland; Professor James T. Hatfield, of the Northwestern Univeristy; and Professor Starr W. Cutting, of the University of Chicago. Two rooms in The north wing of the Art Institute have been made available for the display of nine sketches. The public interest turned approvingly to Professor Hahn's prize-winning model, and the one sketched by Professor Hugo Lederer, of Berlin, the cost of which, however was so enormous that the selection of his model was out of the question.</p>
   <p>The monument by Professor Lederer, a massive temple in its outline, resembled the monument of Theodorich in Ravenna, housed apart from the rest of the statues, because of its size. To illustrate the hugeness of that <span class="page-break">3</span>great work, one must picture the room inside the structure large enough to contain a flowing fountain and four figures, three times their normal size, representing the Drama, Philosophy, etc. Regrets have been voiced at the impossibility of the selection of Professor Lederer's work, the cost of which would be approximately $150,000. The prize-winning model of Professor Hahn also attracted much attention. It represents the figure of a handsome youth, with the facial contours of young Goethe, standing upon a pedestal of granite. The poet's foot rests upon a large block, as if rising. On his elevated knee perches an eagle, which he embraces with his right arm. The eagle's eyes are turned upward as in anticipation of a flight. The base of the statue bears Goethe's bust, which is rather obscure at close range.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the works of competing American artists, such as Hans Schuler, of Baltimore, and Albert Jaegers, of New York, were also a source of much admiration.</p>
