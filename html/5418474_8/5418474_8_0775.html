   <p>Mr. C. F. Adams, former professor of German at the University of Louisville,Kentucky, has opened here recently a school of languages and is specializing in German introduction for Colored people. He has already a class of 62 Colored pupils of both sexes for this particular language-course.</p>
   <p>Last night, Mr. Adams gave an entertainment to his Colored class at the Quinn Chapel, Wabash and 24th Street. The chapel was filled to the last seat with a Colored audience.</p>
   <p>The program opened with the "Wacht am Rhein"(Watch On The Rhine), sung by a chorus of Colored boys. Then Miss J. Ferguson, a colored girl, recited Goethe's "Erlkoenig" in German. Other German songs and various recitals followed. The entertainment proved the astonishing progress of the German language among the Colored people of Chicago under Mr. Adams' guidance.</p>
