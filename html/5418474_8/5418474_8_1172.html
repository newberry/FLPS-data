   <p>Last Saturday the Football Club Hansa celebrated its sixth anniversary (which was well attended) in the rooms of the Swiss Clubhouse. The guests began to arrive at an early hour, and soon the hall was filled. The guests kept dancing continually to the gay strains of Wolf's orchestra.</p>
   <p>President William Weyer, in a brief address, thanked all there for the good attendance and for their co-operation at last year's festival a and asked them to continue giving their support to the club and to German sports in general. The best of provision was made for food and drink so that the hours passed by quite quickly.</p>
   <p>The committee which deserves the credit for the arrangements for the successful festival was composed of President W. Weyer, Julius Arnold, Bill <span class="page-break">\2</span>Koehnke, A. Schramm, Hermann Ohm, F. Fischer, P. Stabenow, and the fest secretary Raymond Huber.</p>
