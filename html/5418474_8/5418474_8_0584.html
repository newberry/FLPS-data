   <p>It is the law of the national development, that conditions themselves produce what has followed as an urgent necessity. This law of evolution also created The Arbeiter Zeitung and later on the Fackel. The people and especially the working masses have been fooled by the mercenary and demoralized Press of Chicago. In place of representing the rights of the people, it has been a traitor to same. The time had come. The workman and the people demanded it and arose like a Jean d'Arc, a fighter for the people, a champion of the real interests of the oppressed, hence the - Chicago Arbeiter Zeitung.</p>
   <p>Though celled to life under the most difficult conditions, itself a child of privation, it had fought for its existence the more it was understood how dangerous it was to the monopolists how undaunted and energetically it entered the fight with a traitorous press and with the vampires of society and continued it successfully notwith standing all the means applied by the opposite side. Who is it who uncovers all common evils (products of the capitalistic management) in our local, State and National institutions! Is it the Illinois Staats Zeitung? Is it this heralded and patented scrap of paper or perhaps the English press? which as it is well known offers its support in the open <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>market to the money purse? No it is the Arbeiter Zeitung. Transgressions which have been withheld from the people, being to the interest of single individuals are now presented to the people. The masses are slowly awakening from a lethargic condition, recognizing the deep abyss to which they have been brought. They stop and take vengeance on the offenders. Workmen and citizens of Chicago recognize yourselves after you have been deceived lately in your electoral rights and a mercenary press not only supported and approved this fraud but also celebrated same and the results of their devilish work and shameful treason. The only way to avenge yourselves is to kill the serpent, which you have fed on your bosom all the time. Out with the "Staats Zeitung" (States Press), "Freie Presse" (Free Press), "Volksfreund" (Friend of the People), "Tribune" and "Interocean." There is only one People's Press here, that is the "Arbeiter Zeitung. Support it in its battle for right, subscribing and recommending same. Workmen and Citizens, do your duty. You owe it to yourselves, your families, and society. Help us in our fight against falsehood, deceit and treason. Subscription price for the Arbeiter Zeitung is 15 cents; with Fackel 20 cents.</p>
   <p>To the small business man we especially recommend our paper for the insertions of advertising as they just reach a reading public which is forced to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>make its purchases in small quantities. The office of the Chicago Arbeiter Zeitung is 87 Fifth Ave, 3d Floor, where orders and advertisements for the paper will be received.</p>
