   <p>The following sworn statement is sufficient to refute the lies spread by a dirty newspaper, concerning the Illinois Staats Zeitung, its business expansion, and its editors. This newspaper makes the assertion that the Illinois Staats Zeitung has only twenty-nine subscribers in the district between Ashland, 12th Street, Indiana Street, and the city limits. As proof it reprints a forged letter. The following affidavit should be sufficient to dispose of such a falsehood:</p>
   <p>"State of Illinois,</p>
   <p>"Cook County.</p>
   <p>"Washington Hesing being first duly sworn, says: that he is one of the proprietors of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, a newspapers published in the city of Chicago and as one of such proprietors he has positive knowledge of the circulation of said newspaper in the city aforesaid.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"This deponent further says that in the district in which Mr. Gehring formerly carried papers and in which Mr. Reinhart now carries, said district comprising all that portion of the West division lying between Ashland Avenue on the East and the city limits on the West and between 12th Street on the South and Indiana Street on the North, the Illinois Staats Zeitung has upon its books 240 bona fide paying subscribers. Deponent further says that of the 600 papers which Mr. Gehring did carry, 240 were copies of the Illinois Staats Zeitung; the rest being made up of English papers. And further deponent saith not.</p>
   <p>Washing Hesing.</p>
   <p>"Subscribed and sworn to before me this 5th day of May 1876.</p>
   <p>Arnold Heap, Notary Public."</p>
