It has become a source of constant dissatisfaction to note that our German-American youth is gradually being Americanized, that the German language and customs are gradually relegated to oblivion. The public school with its predominating Anglo-American attendance and the limited time which is given to German instruction, is hardly able to ameliorate the situation; neither does the home influence always suffice.</p>

Many become teachers, while others continue their studies at universities. Many prominent German families have sent their daughters to the Minerva Institute.</p>
