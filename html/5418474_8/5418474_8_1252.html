   <p>The eleventh convention of the Illinois Turnbezirk (Turner District) was held at Lincoln Turner Hall yesterday. [Translator's note: In an Abendpost article of April 27, 1919, the convention is called the twelfth.] The session was opened by the chairman, Turner John G. Blessing. The roll call revealed that all of the societies which belong to the District, with the exception of the Einigkeit (Harmony) Turnverein, were represented, and seventy delegates were accredited after examination of their credentials. Thereupon the chairman of the society which is host to the convention, Turner Hermann Wiedenhoeft, welcomed the officers and delegates. Turners Balthasar Rau and H. A. Engelken were elected temporary chairman and secretary respectively.</p>
   <p>Turner George A. Schmidt, chairman of the committee on intellectual endeavors, reported next. In a short address he stressed the necessity of mental training. He said that great care should be exercised in the selection of food for the mind. He concluded his report with the proposal that all the periodicals <span class="page-break">2</span>published in the interest of the District by individual societies, be merged into one District publication.</p>
   <p>The recording secretary read a summary of the receipts and disbursements for the past year as follows: balance at beginning of year, $490.51; receipts for the year, $1,287.53; disbursements for the year, $992.86; balance to date, $785.18.</p>
   <p>The camp committee reported and made recommendations regarding the operation of the camp at Cary during the coming summer.</p>
   <p>Then the following were elected officers of the Convention: Balthasar Rau, (Soziale Turnverein), chairman; Ernst Templin (Peoria Turnverein), vice-chariman; H. A. Engelken (Aurora Turnverein), secretary; Franz Urban (Lincoln Turnverein), assistant secretary.</p>
   <p>The committee on nominations moved that the following committees be appointed to consider the various requests and suggestions of officers, committees, and <span class="page-break">3</span>delegates, and offer pertinent recommendations: committee on district and national affairs, committee on endorsements, committee on camps, technical committee, and committee on finance. These suggestions were adopted. After a lengthy report by the committee on reconstruction, which was appointed to devise ways and means to increase the membership and further the interests of the organization, the session was adjourned at one o'clock.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon session the committee on intellectual endeavors reported, and recommended that the plan of so-called "community centers" be adopted and altered so that it is conducive to the best interests of our organization. The committee also suggested that the debates which are held in our meetings for mental relaxation be so arranged and constructed that our aims are better understood, for "our principles are of such an ideal nature that they would undoubtedly be carried out if people had a better knowledge of them". The report was adopted.....</p>
   <p>On the recommendation of the technical committee, it was decided not to arrange a pre-Turner class in camp this summer. Evidently the majority of the delegates were of the opinion that the Turner camp should be a place for <span class="page-break">4</span>amusement and recreation. Again, it was argued that the necessary apparatus for systematic instruction is lacking in camp. It was also resolved that the District spring meeting be held as soon as possible after the exhibition of gymnastics. The delegates to the National Convention were ordered to use their influence and their votes to retain the National Training School.</p>
   <p>All recommendations of the camp committee were adopted. The camp will be opened on June 22. Turner, Frank Glembow will be manager, and Alfred Wild, superintendent of the First District, will act as director. Weekly rates will be as follows: Turners, $8; non-Turners, $14; children, ages 2 to 5, $2; ages 6 to 14, $4; ages 15 to 18, $6. Single meals for Turners will be 50 cents, for non-Turners, 75 cents.</p>
   <p>After the finance committee had reported that the books, receipts, etc., of the financial secretary were in good order, the committee on national and district affairs was given the floor. On the committee's recommendation, the convention voted to send eleven delegates to the national convention in Louisville, and that each delegate should receive twenty-five dollars for expenses. In addition <span class="page-break">5</span>it was resolved to give credentials to other Turners who are willing to pay their own expenses.</p>
   <p>Twenty-one delegates will represent the District in the convention at Louisville. [List of names is given.]</p>
   <p>The delegates were instructed to cast their votes in favor of maintaining the present form of the Alliance, of moving the offices of the Alliance to Chicago, and of holding the national exhibition of gymnastics in this city if a committee elected for the purpose can collect the necessary money. It was also decided to request the Alliance to excuse the Eiche Turnverein from paying national dues from 1916 to 1919, because of the Society's adverse financial condition.</p>
   <p>The recommendations of the reconstruction committee evoked a spirited debate. The most important of these recommendations was to organize English-speaking societies for the purpose of acquiring young members. According to the <span class="page-break">6</span>advocates of this plan, these new societies could use the halls of existing German organizations, which should help them as much as possible. After a long debate the recommendation was rejected by a large vote.</p>
   <p>Turners Hartung, Kusswurm, Rau, and Willig explained at length that the German Turner societies, if they should adopt such a recommendation, would be cutting their own throats, and that the Alliance would not be strengthened as the advocates of the plan claimed, but rather, weakened. The opponents of the proposal stated that it would be contrary to the interests of the German Turner societies, which are already beset with difficulties, to create unnecessary competition, and that the German language must be maintained in the Alliance.</p>
   <p>The proposal that the societies co-operate with other German organizations, such as choral societies, etc., was accepted by the delegates. They voted to place their halls at the disposal of such societies whenever it would be possible to do so without harm to Turner interests.</p>
   <p>Election of officers had the following result: chairman; John G. Blessing, <span class="page-break">7</span>Vorwaerts Turnverein; assistant chairman, Dr. A. C. Weil, Lincoln Turnverein; secretary, Leopold Grand, Turngemeinde; assistant secretary, Henry Engelken, Aurora, Turnverein; financial secretary, George Bauer, Lincoln Turnverein; treasurer, Henry Schoelkopf, Turngemeinde; director, Alfred Weil, Eiche Turnverein; assistant director, Ernst Glass, Vorwaerts Turnverein; chairman of the committee on intellectual endeavors, George A. Schmidt. Turngemeinde; advisory committee, Moritz Schmidt, Soziale Turnverein, and Jacob Willig, Vorwaerts Turnverein.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to hold the November meeting in Grand Crossing. The chairman thanked the host of the convention. Adjournment of the eleventh convention of the Illinois Turnbezirk followed upon the singing of the impressive Turner song, "A Call Has Been Issued".</p>
