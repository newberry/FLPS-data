   <p>Before the German Club this gentleman made an impressive speech on the task of the Germans in America, "Personal Freedom in the Best Sense."</p>
   <p>The German Club is a society which is part of everything that is German or of German descent. It has created for itself the task of inculcating the ideals of our ancestors into the race mixture of this country. This purpose will be served by the speeches which will be made every Saturday evening by prominent representatives of Germans in America. The president of the club, Mr. Oscar A. Kropf, made a very happy choice by selecting Dr. Clarence Strouse as the first speaker at yesterday's meeting, and the applause which rewarded the speaker proved that his words touched the hearts of his audience.</p>
   <p>"In these times in which we live (said Mr. Strouse) here in peace, across the ocean the people to whom we in,this country are related are engaged in a murderous war. We Germans, as much as we enjoy peace, and feel sorry for <span class="page-break">\2</span>the people over there, demand absolute neutrality. We want the truth! Chicago has newspapers which tell the truth. We honor the Germans who were victorious in the last election and belong to this club, but we hope that they will do their duty in full, if not, then may God help them because the club will not."</p>
   <p>The Germans should more intensively study their history and get better acquainted with the part their people have played in this country's development. The Germans in Virginia have given the first impetus to the liberation of this country through their movement against taxation without representation in the legislature. In a most dramatic moment Muhlenberg discarded his clergyman's robe and stood before his congregation in uniform, with the words, "There is a time for praying and preaching, but also a time for fighting, which has just come." These are moments out of the Germans' history. The Germans were leaders in everything - in the founding of schools, also in the iron industry. They were the teachers in all sciences, the leaders in chemistry, and now we can observe how helpless America is on account of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>shortage of chemical preparations caused by the war. The Germans pressed the stamp of their fatherland's government upon this government. They were for liberty, freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion. All these virtues they imparted to this country, and made the ideals of their former homes actual deeds here....Those were the Germans who, in all endeavors, stood at the top. They showed the inhabitants of this country that they are Germans, descended from a race which is the first, the most progressive in all that serve to make humanity happy. Those were the Germans of the past. Those of today are different. Not beer liberty but school liberty; to acquire for the state all public works; improvement of all social conditions; introduction of measures which will bring happiness to the people - these thoughts are all of German origin.</p>
   <p>To participate in all problems of building up this wonderful country, to take active part, not to be political heroes, but to put in individually our whole strength, to share the great inheritance of our race with the nation in the formation of a whole, through the mixing of the different races that came over to this country. All this we can do only when we know what this <span class="page-break">\4</span>country owes to the Germans and if we, through our acts and deeds, lay the foundation, then the succeeding generations may be able to say of us - the Germans have done all this for the country.</p>
