   <p>The Eulenspiegel, a comic paper published by Moritz Langeloth, will appear next Saturday for the first time. We quote from the editorial:</p>
   <p>"Let it be said, once for all, that the character of private people will not be spoken of in the Eulenspiegel. As gladly as we accept for our paper communications which deal with matters of general interest, we shall assign communications of any other type to the waste basket."</p>
   <p>Only when guided by such principles will a comic paper be able to be successful.</p>
