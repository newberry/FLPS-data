   <p>The value of education for children is being more and more realized by all progressively minded people.</p>
   <p>Milwaukee and Baltimore followed the example of Chicago, which was the first city to establish a progressive Sunday school.</p>
   <p>Chicago at present has not too many of these so necessary educational institutions for our youth and therefore every possible opportunity for new foundations should be taken advantage of.</p>
   <p>The Arbeiter Bildungs Verein of the Northside decided to establish such a school on the North Side.</p>
   <p>A meeting will be held Sunday afternoon at 58 N. Clybourn Ave., in order to take the first steps towards the foundation.</p>
   <p>We call on all our friends who live on the North side to come to this meeting; especially parents with school-going children should not fail to attend.</p>
   <p>Mr. G. A. Hoehn will talk about the value of liberal-minded Sunday Schools.</p>
