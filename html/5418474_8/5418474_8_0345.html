   <p>A. Dykrenfurth and B. Kihlholz, members of the German library of this city, sent in a communication tendering to the free library their German books, on condition that the library should be kept open on Sunday, and that each year there should be an outlay for German books proportionate to the amount of taxes paid by German citizens.</p>
   <p>The decided disposition of the directors was that it was impracticable to accept and gifts under such serious conditions.</p>
   <p>The communication was, however, referred to the committee on library.</p>
