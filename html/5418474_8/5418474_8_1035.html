   <p>In the Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute, Prof. Starr Willard Cutting of the University of Chicago gave a lecture to the Germanistic Society in the English language about the earliest German students club in its relation to Germany and the United States of America. Speaker said that under the inspiring impression of the War of Independence, V. Fichte, John and Friegland and Jena students formed the first general students association at the 12th of June, 1805 at the Inn of the Fiv at Camsdorf near Jena according to the examples of the Club of Virtue, which had been dissolved December 31st, 1809 by Wilhelm III at the request of Napoleon.</p>
   <p>The change in the public in the years 1806-1813 has been caused principally by the influence of this Club of Virtue, which made the defeat of Napoleon possible. The students associations were formed on a Democratic principle. The leading elements were to do away with all narrow-minded disputes cruel and immoral influences, to work for harmony among the States of Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony, to fight for the solidarity of Germany and to prepare the students for the life of good citizenship and the coming political battles. This politics however found a great opponent in Count Mettleowich, the executive of the <span class="page-break">2</span>crooked Europeon politics. He wished to prevent an understanding of Prussia with the smaller States of Germany, fearing a danger for the Austrian sovereignty. At the celebration of the Wartburg, October 18, 1817, the students threw the writings of famous reactionaries in a bonfire to which the Grand duke Carl August had supplied the wood. In March 1819 the Jena student Karl Sand assassinated the Russian States Councillor August von Kotzebue. All students associations were suppressed. From the 6th to the 31st of August, 1819, the secret convention of ministers of the 10 greatest German towns took place, where the measure for the suppression of the students organizations were agreed upon. They were dissolved September 20 by order of the Federal diet, the liberty of the Press was restricted; the surveillance of the Universities was ordered and a Federal commission was created for an investigation of demagogical agitations. However, they could not suppress the spirit of the students. Early in 1821 part of their members formed the union of Virtue, a secret organization. The Government prosecuted the members; many were punished as traitors with imprisonment from 3 to 15 years. A number of the persecuted such as Duden, Karl, Follen, Karl Beck, Franz Lieber immigrated to the United States of America and became teachers at our Universities. Also in the thirties, many of these students came over here and acted as pioneers for culture and science. In the forties this immigration came to a conclusion.</p>
