   <p>The Catholic weekly newspaper, the only German Catholic newspaper in the state of Illinois, has on the occasion of its 70th year of existence, published a jubilee edition, which contains in words and pictures a short review on the foundation and development of the newspaper, its aims and endeavors. Special consideration is given to the cultural mission, which the newspaper has accomplished in Chicago, because it was here that the paper appeared for the first time, 70 years ago.</p>
   <p>Since Mr. F. X. Brandecker's retirement, the paper is printed in Omaha, Nebraska; but maintains an office in Chicago the same as before, and brings much news of Chicago's Catholic circles with special reference to Catholic congregations.</p>
