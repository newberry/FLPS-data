   <p>Professor Rudolf Leonhard of the University of Breslau (Germany) gave last night a lecture on German labor protection laws at the Fullerton Hall in the Art Institute.</p>
   <p>When Germany, through the after effects of the 30 years' war, was plunged into misery and poverty, systematic efforts of town and city administrations were started to help the helpers and unemployed. The various churches, more or less, gave their willing cooperation in a patriarchalistic way. When Prussia, particularly under Frederic the Great, became predominant in Germany, state laws there began to show a socialistic tendency. At the same time, the population of Germany grew rapidly. Business was flourishing, mines and industry employed millions in thickly populated small land areas. It was only natural, that the social problem soon was outgrowing local and state charity systems. When the situation reached its most acute stage, Count von Bismarck published on November 17th, 1881 his famous proclamation which promised to the German nation a new era of labor protection. This proclamation was well meant and sincere. The future gave ample proof of this unmistakable truth.</p>
   
   <p>The German Labor Insurance, sanctioned by Count von Bismarck, has 3 groups:</p>
   <table>

    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The insurance is compulsory.</p>
   <p>In the first group, all workers must be insured. The employer must pay the premiums. The insured are getting all doctor's costs, hospital expenses, medical and other treatment expenses paid, regardless of how long it takes for the patient to recover. Full wages are paid during the complete period of inability to earn.</p>
   <p>In the 2nd group, all workers are insured and are paying two thirds of the premium, which the employer is paying one third. The insured are getting free medical care and full wages during the period of inability to earn, but for not longer than thirteen weeks.</p>
   <p>In the third group, also every worker is insured. One half of the premium is paid by the employer, the other half by the worker. This insurance does not cover alone inability to work, resulting from old age, but also inability, resulting from inhaling of poisonous gases in mines and factories.</p>
   <p>These insurance protection laws have proved to be a permanent blessing for the German people.</p>
