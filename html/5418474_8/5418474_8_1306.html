   <p>P. 5- The national assembly of the Chicago Turner district, voted yesterday in favor of active participation of the Turners, at the forthcoming election. The Turner Society "Einigkeit" urged that this step be taken, and, to give support to Social Democrats, who endeavor to nominate Eugene V. Debs as presidential and Harriman as vice-presidential candidates. Of the 102 votes cast, 58 were in favor of the plan, while 44 votes cast disapproval. The long debate has brought to light, that those of the opposing group, were numerous and influential.... Resolutions have been passed, to consider and declare Turner Halls and Turner societies as educational institutions and as such, to exempt them from taxes, the same as churches.</p>
   <p>It was an entirely new routine for the Chicago National Assembly, to concern itself with the affairs of the surface line companies. They decided to support resolutions dealing with that matter, resolutions which have been submitted to the city council some time ago. Approval was also voiced for recommendation and agitation in favor of the sustenance and furtherance of German instruction and gymnastics, as well, as the upholding of liberally minded Sunday schools. Of course, as usual the resolution critizes the temporary administration....</p>
   <p>Turner Koelling's amendment, that the district should support William Jannings Bryan as presidential candidate, has not been considered a serious suggestion....</p>
   <p>Turner Wahltheich declared that to support the Debs candidacy, is to show the world that the Turners of Chicago still adhere to their principles. In consequence, the platform of the socialist labor party, is the one closest to them. Turner Kopp, of the Turner Society "Vorwaerts" pointed out that most Turners belong to the laboring class, for whom social democracy is the only salvation. The battle between capital and labor, will continue as long as the capitalistic exploitation system is not dismissed.</p>
   <p>Under the present system, the employer expects most possible work for the least wages, while the workers' demands are just the opposite. Turner Koelling and Weidemann, denounced the statement, that Furner Societies were almost exclusively labor societies. Furthermore, they held, that joining any political party, including the socialist labor party, was not recommendable. Some of the members of the Turner Society "Vorwaerts" shared their opinion, in spite of which fact, the indorsement of the afore mentioned candidates went through....</p>
   <p>A letter received from the Grand Rapids Turner Society was read to the assembly. It suggested the following: "Progress should always be the first consideration of every Turner. The official organ ought to deal with scientific as well as social-political-economical questions, and should do so far more extensively, than has been done in the past."</p>
   <p>Turner Rau of the Society "Social" submitted the following resolution, which was passed with hardly any discussion:</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch, as Turner societies are principally concerned with the education of our youth, Turner Halls ought to be considered as educational institutions. We request the national assembly, to consent to the plan of the district societies, to undertake proper steps, which would in future exempt Turner societies from taxes."</p>
   <p>It has been recommended, that the German citizens of Chicago keep in mind at the elections next spring, the preservation of their native language and the continuance of healthful gymnastics. The following resolution submitted by the Turner Society "Garfield" caused a lengthy debate:</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch, as the North American Turner Societies support the policy of the eight hour work day, and because Turner teachers at public schools, are forced to work 12 to 14 hours a day, instead of the normal working hours, the regional national assembly declares this detrimental in its effect upon the societies, the Turner teachers and also upon the schools. It is the job of school authorities, to remedy this condition. A Turner teacher employed by Turner societies should not be considered for a position in public schools.</p>
   <p>The resolution was finally passed with the amendment, giving every Turner society the right to deal with this question as it sees fit.</p>
   
   <p>Another resolution, submitted by the same Turn society, has been passed with- out a debate. It is the following:</p>
   <p>1.) "To induce the surface line monopolies to put into service such summer cars, as would permit more comfort for the passenger and the conductor alike.</p>
   <p>2.) "Request the same companies, to provide street cars, with secure brakes, and provide the motorman with ample space, needed so much in cases of emergency. One of the worst hindrances to the motorman is the passenger close at his elbows.</p>
   <p>3.) "To be instrumental in nullifying the legality of contracts, by certain surface line companies, forced upon their employees, as for instance in case of an accident, the responsibility is placed upon the motorman. The regional national assembly considers it its duty to give this move hearty support. And in accord with this move, it will endeavor to put a stop to such monopolistic actions, as directed against railroad employees. It will also insist on the improvement of transportation, which has been so sadly neglected at the cost of the public"....</p>
   <p>The recommendation, to instruct the Board of Executives, to intercede with the proper authorities, for the installation of a gymnasium in every newly erected school building, was generally approved. Turner In enthron submitted the following resolution, which was also passed:</p>
   <p>"In view of the fact, that since the last regional national meeting, our government has exhibited its desire for conquest and for unconstitutional actions, and because the attempt was made, to force 12,000,000 men, who fell victims to corrupt politics, into obedience and, considering further that conquest aspirations require a big standing army, which means still heavier taxation for our people, which in consequence will undermine the stability of our republic."</p>
   <p>"Therefore, we resolve to protest energetically against the continuation of war with the Philippine nation and demand that steps be taken immediately to establish home rule in the Philippines, under the protectorate of the United States. In consequence, our standing army should be reduced as quickly as possible to a peace time strength;-</p>
   <p>"We protest still further against the use of the army, as protection for private and industrial enterprises, thus using force on striking labor, as was the case in Idaho.</p>
   <p>"We further consider the action of the U. S. toward the citizens of Porto Rico, a repetition of the unjust measures of taxation without representation, which forced our nation to war and liberation</p>
   <p>"And finally we wish to express our utter indigantion, as to the stand taken by our government in the case of the courageous Boer nation. As the greatest of all republics, we expected, that it would at least use its influence, to save that nation from total disaster."</p>
