   <p>issued a circular, addressed to the four Milwaukee Turn Clubs, wherein the former gives a detailed account of its intended excursion to Milwaukee and of its picnic in the neighboring city. In order to avoid conflicting dates, which would interfere with other local festivities, the "Vorwaertz" Turn Verein suggested to arrange a co-operative summer excursion and requested the Milwaukee Clubs to select Delegates for the Purpose of conferring with one of the Turn-Verein Vorwaert's deputized members, who will go to Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>The delegation of five Chicago Turners arrived Sunday morning in Milwaukee, whereupon the conference was held at Franz Bader's Hall, on 4th Street. The representatives of the Milwaukee Clubs agreed to hold the picnic in conjunction with the Vorwaerts and selected July 27th, as being most suitable. The agreement provides that no expenses are incurred by the Milwaukee Associations. The delegation visited several parks and conferred with their owners. The results of their conclave will be known here, within one week, i.e. in which Milwaukee Park the picnic will be given.</p>
