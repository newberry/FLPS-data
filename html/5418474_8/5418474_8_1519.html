   <p>On account of bad weather last Sunday the festival was postponed and started to-day.</p>
   <p>The procession which started at one o'clock, brought many guests, among them also Mr. Floto, the festival speaker. At 3 o'clock he went to the stage which was erected in the banquet hall and addressed to the assembly a lenghty speech as follows:</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen!</p>
   <p>Dear friends and fellow marksmen!</p>
   <p>Already in the 13th and 14th century there existed shooters societies in Germany under the name of citizen association or guilds.</p>
   <p>Dated from the time the citizen were obliged, to protect themselves from infringement by the nobility and the league of princes...</p>
   
   <p>Among the German speaking population of the United States the oldest Shooters society was founded in Philadelphia in the year of 1846, and through their excellent example the shooters society progressed quickly among German-Americans in all States of the Union.</p>
