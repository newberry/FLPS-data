   <p>There exists in Chicago a so-called German (?) paper, better known as the "reptile" (the real name is Freie Presse), which led several attacks on our Vereins' treasury.</p>
   <p>We have decided not to advertise any more in the "reptile" because we are of the opinion that, first of all, it is only a second-hand cheese-paper and, secondly, because we know that its effect upon its very small circle of readers is demoralizing and we would not like to have a morally degenerate public attend our festivities.</p>
   <p>In spite of this Vereins' resolution, and although consequently none of us ordered any advertisements in this paper, it carried again an advertisement of our Sylvester celebration.</p>
   <p>The city circulator, who is also called the "manager" because he sweeps the office once a week and tends to all other errand-running, had the nerve to send us a bill for the advertisement.</p>

   <p>Why is he doing this? He won't get paid anyhow!</p>
   <p>Or is our Verein supposed to pay for the stupidity of young Mike or his successor who, as we are informed, is cutting out advertisements from other newspapers?</p>
   <p>Please make this protest public and oblige the whole Verein.</p>
   <p>We absolutely do not feel obligated to cover the expenses, which arose during the reptile's unsuccessful piratical expedition into the city treasury.</p>
