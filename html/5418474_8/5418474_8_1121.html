   <p>The Founders day of the Socialists of the Northside. On May 17th, the Group of Socialists of the Northside celebrates the 2nd year of their foundation, A genuine public fete is promised our comrades.</p>
   <p>The honored guests will not as was the custom at bigger festivals, be entertained by theatrical performances, but instead they will listen to the serious words of a prominent socialist speaker who understands how to enthuse and inflame the masses. Johann Most will deliver the festival address. All these who participated in the Socialist movement of the last years, will no doubt be present. The group of the Northside was the first on the basis of reorganization to be created. When Socialists meet at a festival, they exchange their reminiscences, tell about their experiences and then go, with renewed strength to secure new followers for the Communistic doctrines. Such a festival is in itself an agitation, and none of those present should neglect <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to work in the interest of socialism, so as to bring about the day break of a better future, which will frighten away the dark nights of capitalistic production methods.</p>
