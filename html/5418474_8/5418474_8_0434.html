   <p>Last evening the Verein Deutsche Presse (German Press Association) held its first party of the season in the Bismarck Hotel. In spite of the inclemency of the weather there was a really impressive number of members and guests present at the affair. Those present were greeted by Mr. Karl Freitag, who has been president of the society for many years.</p>
   <p>For the musical entertainment Mr. Hans Muenzer, conductor and solo violinist of the Chicago Theater orchestra, was secured. Mr. Muenzer opened his selections with the "Romance Melodigue," by Louis Victor Saar. The artist's playing not with such enthusiastic applause that he was compelled to play encore after encore. For this purpose he chose chiefly the works of Fritz Kreisler, which are filled with the genuine Viennese atmosphere. The masterly and technically perfect rendering of these pleasing compositions was rewarded with fresh waves of handclapping. In Esther Payne-Muenzer the artist had an equally competent and understanding accompanist.</p>
   <p>The guests of honor were the new postmaster, Mr. Ernest J. Kruetgen, and his wife.</p>

   <p>Mr. Kruetgen dwelt, in a humorous way, on the duties and pleasures of his new office. His pertinent remarks and occasional digressions into the realms of humor awakened applause and merriment among his listeners.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leopold Saltiel, who has been an active member of the Society for years, made a long report on the trip to the Hawaiian Islands which he and his wife took a short time ago. Mr. Saltiel kept his eyes open while there and was able to give an interesting account of the country and the people, their customs and ways. His lecture, which was given in an easy, conversational tone, and which was well spiced with humor, met with an enthusiastic reception from his audience.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, a real child prodigy was introduced to the audience--little Pierre Page, who celebrated his tenth birthday just yesterday. He played a whole series of numbers on the accordion, and had such command of this instrument that he aroused the astonishment and admiration of his audience. The little artist also showed surprising skill as a pianist.</p>
