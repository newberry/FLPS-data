   <p>Dear Editor,</p>
   <p>With the coming of warm weather, picnic notices from schools can be found once more in the newspapers. This seems to be the right time to say a few words against uneducational exhibitions as indulged in by some private schools last year.</p>
   <p>Neither Americans nor German-Americans can have any respect for the German school-system when they see a crowd of school boys dressed in ridiculous uniforms riding horseback, etc. Sensible Germans feel ashamed when they see such exhibitions which reminds them of circuses and carnivals. I do not remember having seen such displays in Germany.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>A. Ehrenstein, teacher</p>
