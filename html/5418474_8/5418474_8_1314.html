   <p>The German Turner system can boast of a great triumph. Our standing army, although composed of hirelings, is by far superior to the "Tommy Atkins" mercenary troops of England. West Point, the training school for American army officers, has for many years employed the well known turner teacher, Mr. Kroehler, as instructor of gymnastics. Mr. Koehler received his training, at the German Turner seminary in Milwaukee. It is to his credit, that the younger generation of army officers includes so many excellent turners and turner teachers. They in turn, teach our troops the German system of gymnastics.</p>
   <p>The fact that our army while at war with Spain, won the recognition of many European experts for its fine strategy, is partially due and attributed to this early physical training.</p>
