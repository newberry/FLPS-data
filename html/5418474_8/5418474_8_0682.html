   <p>The Gutenberg Publishing Company of Chicago has just published a German Guide to the World's Fair. The chief purpose of the guide is to direct the World's Fair visitor through the entire Fair and to save him from having to ask unnecessary questions or getting lost.</p>
   <p>For this reason the Guide is divided into three large sections, three tours. The first tour begins at the North Entrance and leads along the Court of Honor as far as the Midway. The second tour also begins at the North Entrance and leads over Northerly Island and through the buildings on the island. The third tour begins at the southern end of the Fair and leads northward along the Midway as far as Fort Dearborn.</p>
   <p>The guide is richly illustrated. Drawings and linoleum cuts show the most important buildings. Of especial value to the visitor at the Fair are the building plans, which enable one to get a general picture of the exposition more easily. The Hall of Science is so complicated, with its many ramps, <span class="page-break">2</span>wings, and dead-end passages, that scarcely anyone could find his way through it. Two plans of the building in the Guide are of great assistance. Plans are included of the Government Building, the Electrical Building, the Hall of Social Science, the Travel and Transport Building, and the whole Home Planning group with its model houses. On the last page of the guide is a very clear map of the Fair.</p>
   <p>A special section, richly illustrated, is devoted to the great art exhibit at the Art Institute. The second part of the Guide deals with Chicago, the city, its cultural centers, its German community, its buildings, and its industry. Included, also, is the popular resort not far from Chicago, the Indiana Dunes.</p>
   <p>The editors of the Guide certainly did some thorough work, for it is the most complete and the clearest of all that have been published up to this time. It should be of value and helpful not only to German visitors from other localities, but also to local Chicago Germans.</p>
   <p>The price of the guide is fifty cents. It is available at all bookstores.</p>
