   <p>Tomorrow evening a meeting of interest will take place in the Club-rooms of the Press Club; of interest because the famous lecturer, Mr. Arthur Koebner, has prepared a fine program. Part of his talk will be in Low German and part in High German.</p>
   <p>No doubt the criticism and discussions following the recital will be most interesting. Prior to the lecture, a business meeting will take place and many important subjects will be discussed. Thus the meeting as a whole should be of interest to every club member.</p>
