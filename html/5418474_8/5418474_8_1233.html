   <p>The official founding of a Protective Association of German sporting societies is a successful achievement. Chicago's German sports societies have made a great decision. Forgotten were all rivalries, Germans were sitting among Germans in a peaceful conference for the best of the sport, for the best of the German sporting ideals. The forming of a workers' union of German sports societies which repeatedly has been proposed by the Abendpost was successfully put into effect. How simple this sounds, and still what significance lies in these words. It is, as if the hour of redemption had struck for German sport in foreign countries, the hour of redemption from small subterfuges. It is possible that through this union of German sports societies, the aim will be reached of creating for German athletics in America, or better still in all countries to which we have access, a lasting and worthy home.</p>
