   <p>Before the Germanistic society and their friends, Professor Dr. Eugene Kuhlemann lectures amid great applause.</p>
   <p>AN HISTORICAL RETROSPECT.</p>
   <p>Before an exceedingly large audience, the Professor of Philosophy, Dr. Eugene Kuhlemann, of Breslau University, lectured; he gave a clear and interesting picture of German thought and culture. That just this moment should be chosen for such a theme by the famous professor for his lecture, was motivated by the remark that through a purchased press the poisoning of public opinion against Germany, on the basis of German culture, was carried on, and that it is opportune to elucidate what German thought and culture really are.</p>
   
   <p>Dr. Kuhlemann said: The world never had a better teacher for centuries than this war, and only the Reformation can be compared with it. The souls of all people are shaken by it, and one feels that a new world is born, a change of attitude toward existing conditions.</p>
   <p>Both sides of the warring nations assert that they are fighting for ideals. They plainly expressed the ideals for which Germany's enemies are fighting; to destroy Germany's commerce, to divide Austria, so that under Russia's leadership Slavism can rule Europe.</p>
   <p>Germany is fighting on the battle fields for its manhood, England for the poisoning of public opinion, through its dastardliness. German culture does not signify what English culture means; the speaker admitted the difference; the one word is written with a C the other a K; the same difference exists in the words "cant" in English and "kant" in German. Only those nations with thoughts of culture wrote their names in the world's history and are continuously living in that history. Illustrating the cultural thoughts of Greece and Rome, the entrance of Christianity up to the Middle Ages, the speaker dwelt upon Luther's fight for the peace of his soul, and finds him in the certainty that, in spite of all relapses in his efforts, humans may count on the forgiving mercy of God. In consequence of Lutheran deeds, it was undecided in 1914 whether Germany could exist any longer; only 1915 blessed its deeds. Cut off from all things external, Germany found abundance of the soul, Referring to the influence of the Reformation the speaker proved the same religious depth in the music of Sebastian Bach, of which Goethe said, "As if the eternal harmony would amuse itself." Beethoven penetrates with his music into the innermost recesses of the human heart. The same can be said of German poetry. From Kloppstock to Goethe, the development of the greatest liberty carried by the belief that human life can redeem itself everywhere by the same serious thought of the shaping of life. Everything rests on the eternal necessity of principles. Touching on history, the speaker said:</p>
   
   <p>"Another thirty years of Napoleon's power, and it is a question whether Germany and German culture would still exist." Frederick the Great opened the path to the thought that the state must become military and bureaucratic. The duty and thought of an iron discipline and self discipline was uppermost in Fichte's discourses to the German people, and awoke the consciousness of German heights. With philosophy, poetry and music, you are the hope of humanity, without them you decline and, with you, the whole of humanity. Therefore every sacrifice has to be brought for this thought; to die for it if necessary. The much abused German militarism is the idealism that every citizen is obliged to labour for the state. Of this consists the German's pride. In succession the speaker illuminated the origin of Germany since the rise of the people in 1813, up to the founding of the German Empire by Bismarck. The three basic ideas of German culture are:</p>
   
   <p>1. The state should be warlike; so strong that even the largest combination could not destroy it</p>
   <p>2. The state should be so organized economically that industry and agriculture enable it to live within its own resources.</p>
   <p>3. The German state is the unity of the people's strength and symbolizes that life is unthinkable without the state.</p>
   <p>And this war brings the thought of culture in full force to the fore. This hour is the German people's hour of birth. Up to this time there were only individuals, today the whole nation has risen. Before others, the Socialists proved they acknowledged the state was the last savior and surety. This birth can only become a fact through blood.</p>
