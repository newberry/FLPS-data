   <p>... Humboldt Park has become a real public park under the skilled management of the German landscape gardener and park director, F. W. Karnatz. It is perhaps one of the most beautiful parks of its kind. Near the lake, where the streets and avenues meet, right in the center, the Alexander Von Humboldt monument has been erected. The preparations for yesterday's festival had been well carried out, and the park commissioner, H. Weinhardt, deserves special credit and the gratitude of the whole population for the skillful dispatch with which the splendid plans were carried out. The whole affair was placed in the hands of the German Press Club, and its untiring activity was compensated by the fact, that the unveiling of the Humboldt monument was indeed an important public festival.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. C. Hesing stepped upon the speaker's platform. With his clear and far reaching voice he succeeded at once in getting the attention of the large crowd. He had taken it upon himself to convey or deliver the monument to the Humboldt Park Commission for the Press Club, and he completed his task with the following effective speech:</p>
   <p>"Honorable citizens, Ladies and Gentlemen! You are, undoubtedly, aware of the fact that our friend and fellow citizen, F. J. Dewes, has taken it upon himself, to have a life size monument made and erected in this beautiful park, in memory of the famous and eminent German, a man of learning and science, Alexander von Humboldt... The highest honor of any nation is its moral elevation, and its intellectual progress. It is reserved for great and important men only, to promote progress and lead into new intellectual fields. No one has equalled Alexander von Humboldt in uncovering to the world at large knowledge of such immense importance; and nobody understood as well as he did, how to make his knowledge clear and profitable to the people. He is justly recognized as a pearl of the century...</p>
   <p>"A monument of this kind is not only an honor for the city, but it stimulates meditation and is thought provoking. In this sense it is a gift of great importance, for which F. J. Dewes deserves full credit, and which is worthy to be added to our works of art.... A more appropriate and fitting place could not have been selected for this monument, than this beautiful park, which bears the name of the great German.</p>
   <p>"May the veil fall, and the form, as well as the face of this famous man be revealed to our view!"</p>
   <p>As the speaker finished the last sentence, the veil dropped, being released by Miss Weinhardt, the daughter of the park commissioner; and now a scene of great joy and exultation followed...</p>
   <p>The speaker, A. C. Hesing, turned to the President of the West Side Park Board, H. L. Thompson, and turned the monument over to him with the following words:</p>
   <p>"By the order and in the name of our esteemed friend, F. J. Dewes, I deliver this monument to you. Under your care it shall be an ornament to this park, and in this beautiful surrounding bring joy to many admirers of the great man, whom it represents.</p>
   
   <p>"A. Von Humboldt, a German, was a cosmopolitan in the true sense of the word. His knowledge and teachings belong to the whole world. He was a friend and benefactor of mankind. By honoring his memory and giving recognition to his moral power and intellectual importance, we honor ourselves."</p>
   <p>Mr. Thompson accepted this generous gift with a lengthy speech....</p>
