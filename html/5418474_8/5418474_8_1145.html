   <p>Last night in the Northside German Turnhall, the famous Explorer, Robert von Schlagintweit gave a lecture on "The Way of Living in India."</p>
   <p>Looked upon from a German standpoint, we Germans should be ashamed to be so little interested in the other part of the world-all in all only 100 seats were taken. Mr. Robert Schlagintweit, made his lecture very interesting by showing pictures of all the places he visited.-</p>
