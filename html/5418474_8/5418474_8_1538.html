   <p>The Sharpshooters Association (Schutzenverein) has rented two adjacent shops in the German House (entrance from Indiana Street). The one has been made the club restaurant, the other contains two shooting stands and it is open on Sundays and Wednesdays for sharpshooters and their guests. It is the intention of the Association to keep this place permanently, use it in the summer during bad weather and make it general headquarters.--The Sharpshooters Association can congratulate itself for its progress and flourishing, because it is not only free of debts but even owns considerable property.</p>
