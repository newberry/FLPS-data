   <p>The Socialist Group of the Northside held yesterday evening in the Thuringer Hall, its regular Agitation Meeting, Comrade Hoffmann presiding. The Hall was over-crowded by 8 o'clock. Comrade Matzinger from Vienna (former collaborator of the Socialist Newspaper "Zukunft") reported on the theme "The Value of Knowledge and Union." The speaker pointed in his lecture, which lasted 1-1/2 hours, to a series of historical examples, through them he proved the power of knowledge and union. The audience followed his lecture with attention and rewarded him with applause. The International Workingmen's Association possesses in Comrade Matzinger a fervent, capable and well poised Agitator, who certainly is very welcome. The Picnic Committee made its report, and requested all those who wished to participate in the parade of the decorated wagon, to announce it.</p>
