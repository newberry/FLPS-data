   <p>Mr. John Mathews Manly spoke last night at Fullerton Hall in the Art Institute before the members of the Germanistic Society of Chicago, on the impressions of an American Professor at a German University. Mr. Manly has been a Professor of English literature at the University of Chicago and had lectured last winter as an exchange Professor at the University of Goettingen (Germany), on English Literature. He told his listeners of his impressions during his 6 months stay in the small University town, where he was made very welcome. Coming into direct contact with all the spheres? of University life, he was able to form a judgment and compare conditions with those in this country. He came to the conclusion that the German Professor has a better life than his American colleague. The greatest impression made upon him, as an educational project, was not the German university but the German army and he indicated this as the most important factor from an educational standpoint of the German Empire. The service in the army not only broadens the knowledge of the individual, but furthers the understanding for a better living and awakens the interest for cooperation in public affairs. The expense of the German army is not excessive to the country. It is an excellent educational institute and days extraordinarily well. The cleanliness of the lower classes is surprising and can be accounted for by the service in the German army. The difference between the lower classes of Germany, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>England are remarkable. In Germany, the lower classes show a high degree of intelligence while in London, they make a very poor impression. The German professor is not as much responsible for his pupils as his colleagues in America. He has nothing to do with unimportant administration affairs and has a very agreeable and social position. Though the salary of the German professor is lower, he can live better as living conditions are much cheaper. Their time, however, is very much taken up by the completion of their learning. The picture given of the German professor in humorous magazines is not a true one. They have a great influence on German public life. The relationships between the pupils and the teachers are of the most hearty character.</p>
