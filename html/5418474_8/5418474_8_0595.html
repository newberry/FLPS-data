   <p>"In previous years, figures have been published on the amount of postage paid by the larger newspapers. These statistics were not without interest, since they gave some indication of a newspaper's circulation. But for that very reason, many publications whose circulation had declined...brought pressure upon the Post Office Department in Washington, and it is now difficult to obtain these figures. However, we have secured a list of postage payments covering the past six months...</p>

   <p>All Chicago papers are listed in bold type. The reader may draw his own conclusions.</p>
   <p>Our books show that the amounts quoted are correct to the last penny for the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, and so we do not doubt that the Anzeiger Des Westens obtained the information from an official and reliable source.</p>
   <p>For a better understanding of these figures, we call attention to the fact that....postage for delivery beyond the county in which a paper is published amounts to two cents a pound; within the county, no postage is paid, nor are the papers weighed. If official information were available on this latter point, the circulation of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, as compared with that of other newspapers, would appear in a still more favorable light....</p>
