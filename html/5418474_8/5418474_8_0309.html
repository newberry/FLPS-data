   <p>The Kunst und Literatur-Verein( Society of Literature and Arts) gave last night its first entertainment of the season at the new Steinway Hall at Van Buren and Michigan Avenue. The largest part of the evening was dedicated to the memory of the German poet Goethe, whose life and literary activity was described in an interesting lecture, given at this occasion by Professor Louis Schutt. The rest of the evening was filled by a few very fine solo-songs and music recitals. A lecture on "Schiller" will be given next Monday by Mr. Gauss, the noted librarian and member of the "Kunst und Literatur-Verein," which had already more than 300 members and has accomplished a lot to cultivate the interest for German arts and German literature.</p>
