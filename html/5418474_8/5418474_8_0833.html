   <p>A number of progressive clubs on the Northside decided to open a Sunday School in Rachaus Halle, corner Halsted and Lincoln on Sunday morning 10 o'clock, May 13, 1888.</p>
   <p>The lack of Sunday schools removed from the stupid influence of clerical hypocrites and conducted in a progressive and enlightened manner has been felt especially among the working class. It is a fact that all possible efforts are being made by the church Sunday schools to entice children to their institutions recognizing that by getting a hold on them in this way the growing youth will be kept out of the sphere of influence of the progressive movement.</p>
   <p>The parents, mostly working men, are glad to have their children out of their house on a Sunday morning and thereby they deliver them into the hands of these hypocrites. For these reasons the progressive elements are engaged in the establishment of their own schools.</p>
   <p>We address to all parents an urgent word of exhortation to send their children <span class="page-break">\2</span>to us. At the present we have not decided yet upon a detailed schedule as we have to know about the number of registrants.</p>
