   <p>If the German people of America do not arouse themselves and show what Germany has produced in cultural and therefore literary values, then she will miss an opportunity which will never appear so favorably as at present. This was the main content of Professor Philip Schuyler Allen's speech. He is president of the Department of German Language and Literature at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The speaker recited first from his own life. He is a descendant of General Schuyler and as such has not a drop of German blood in his veins. But he spent his youth in Germany where he learned to love the country of poets and philosophers, and he has not lost this warm feeling even today. In a humorous way he depicted his later career in America as a student and after that turned to the present times.</p>
   <p>"I always interceded for the German cause, which can be proved by my work at the University. I was often asked by other people, 'was your father a German? Or <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>your mother?' And when I laughingly denied it they showed surprised faces and said, shrugging their shoulders: 'Why then the great fervor for the German cause and language?' Now I know the value of German literature and the work done by German scientists and therefore I am a friend of the Germans. Unfortunately the war has strangled German teaching in America. In former years the classes of all German schools were well attended, and they figured that before the war, twenty percent of the youth attending schools participated in German lessons. Today there are only five-eights of one percent, but the number is steadily growing. For that reason the time has arrived when a strong propaganda for the German language in America, should be initiated. I am not speaking in the name of Germany, but am only of the opinion that America lost a great deal, when it eliminated the German language and with it German literature.</p>
   <p>But such a propaganda guided by German patriotic sentiment only can and will hurt the whole cause. Speakers, who are incessantly dinning into the ears of their audience the words. "German ideals and German culture" are causing more harm then we could believe. German literature has to convince the Americans of the German masters' proficiency. I regret to have to say that there is not one important German work which has been translated correctly into English. What is Goethe's Faust in the best English translation? A bad echo, and so it is with most of the works of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>works of the known German poets and authors. Therefore, their value to the Americans is completely lost. If there were a person who could translate Faust into good English, he would give to the English speaking world a second Goethe. The effect might be about the same that is: that Goethe would be read as when Shakespeare's excellent translation is read in Germany. In that case the world, for the first time will appreciate the full value of German literature."</p>
   <p>Stormy applause followed the speaker's words, who apparently made a great impression upon his hearers. The program was embellished through the song recitals of the well known opera singer, Kathryne Meisle, who sang several songs to great applause. The Armin F. Hand trio rendered excellent music during the banquet.</p>
