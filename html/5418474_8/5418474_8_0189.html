   <p>"To the Board of Directors of the Chicago Turngemeinde,</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"Last year you were kind enough to arrange a meeting of all the old German settlers of Chicago. The remembrance of the pleasant hours spent at this meeting prompts us to ask you to organize a similar meeting for this year. You may rely on the active support of the old settlers. We beg you not to spare any efforts in inducing all those who attended last year to come to this meeting.</p>
   <p>"We hope to be notified soon of the carrying-out of our wishes.</p>
   <p>Henry Greenebaum</p>
   <p>Conrad Seipp</p>
   <p>(and 21 other names)."</p>
