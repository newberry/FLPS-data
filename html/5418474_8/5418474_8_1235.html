   <p>Young immigrants, upon their arrival in Chicago have found that Americans, in regard to sports activities, are far behind. Their ignorance of the English language, their battle for existence, made them blind to American sport events, at least for a time. All they found was, the German Turnverein, which was, according to the standards of the immigrants in regard to physical educational institutions in Germany, antiquated. Of the grand German sports activities, they found nothing here. They were disgusted. They felt something was missing in this country.</p>
   <p>On account of lack of money and ignorance of the language, they could not join the American sports organizations - the Dutchmen would have been ridiculed any how - so what was finally left for them to do? They started a new organization, a new German sports club, to show the Americans what German sport really means, as the German Societies were too much Americanized for them already.</p>
   <p>This way of acting is understandable and can be explained. How grand would it be if a German sports organization should exist in Chicago! That would place the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>German name - as far as sport is concerned - ahead of the other organizations. But - to be a leader requires something, which in this country plays a prominent part, and this something which is missing in the large German societies, is money. Therefore German sport has to find other ways to play its part. In Chicago so far, this way has not been found. The sports events sponsored by the Abendpost may serve as a guide. They have proven, that in spite of all disadvantages, the element which is fit to play is to be found in the Turn-Vereins, and that furthermore if it is to accomplish anything, it must be directed by an experienced hand. Such is proven in swimming, and can, undoubtedly, be proven also in other sports activities. In union and in the direction of all sports activities, lies the future of German sport of Chicago, if leaders of societies would realize this and persuade their members to develop sport in the highest form, then soon would the German name march at the head in athletics.</p>
