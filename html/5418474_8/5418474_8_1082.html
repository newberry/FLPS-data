   <p>Professor Edward S. Joyner of the South Carolina State University gave last week an interesting lecture on Germany and its civilization.</p>
   <p>He pointed out the marvelous rise of Germany which only 82 years ago was a helpless shackled province of Napoleon's Empire. He praised the undaunted courage and perseverance of the German nation, which vanguished successively its military opponents and finally built an Empire which politically, commercially and socially has become the heart of Europe.</p>
   <p>German immigrants have carried German civilization to all parts of the world, particularly to the United States, which without doubt is owing its cultural rise to these immigrants.</p>
   <p>German Science in every direction is leading to-day the world. Our country is sending every year thousands of students to Germany, to acquire German knowledge of every part of Science, arts and music. To learn the German language will be more and more a necessity for every educated American for the growing benefit of both countries-Germany and America.</p>
