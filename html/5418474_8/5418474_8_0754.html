   <p>The Local Group, "Chicago", a branch of the German-National Clerk's Association, is active lately in matters pertaining to education.</p>
   <p>This evening, 7:30 to 9:30 the first lessons are to be given in English. Temporarily, the instructions are held in a room of the Northside Turnhall, at 820 N. Clark Street until a suitable class room is found. 14 scholars have applied already; this number will soon be doubled, nevertheless, it would be desirable, if a much larger assembly of clerks would participate. The fees only amount to $2.00 per month for 16 hours of tuition, Mondays and Thursdays, regularily from 7:30 to 9:30 P. M. Applications will be accepted by the representatives of the Club</p>
