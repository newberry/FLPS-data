   <p>Schwaben Athletic Club vs. Chicago Sport Club.-- The matches of these teams have always been interesting, and for the last few years they have also been the most decent one could see. It was not always like that, but fortunately both camps arrived at the conviction that more can be attained by comradeship and friendly spirit than by club fanaticism. And so this time a match was played in which every player displayed great zeal to gain victory for his own flag, remaining fair and decent withal. Neither team had enough players to put on a spectacular battle. The Sport Club was compelled to play without Tan-nert, Kroll, Boyens, and Frey. Mueller was playing with an injured hand. The Swabians had to replace such players as Jordan, Breithaupt, Teschner, Absiel, and Trimmel. The substitute men of the Swabians were superior to those of the Chicago Sport Club, and thus the Blue-and-White victory.</p>
   <p>The eleven victors deserve the praise of all. For the Chicago Sport Club, Rudel, Daiber, Mueller, Weiss, and Schmuck were the stars.</p>
