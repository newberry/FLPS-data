   <p>The battle between the shareholders of the Illinois Publishing Company, editors of the Illinois Staats Zeitung has flared up again. E. O. Raster, whose mother Margarethe holds half of the shares of the enterprise has handed to States Attorney Healy the outline of a Quo Warranto proceedings against Walter R. Michaelis and Horace L. Brandt, the proprietors of the other half of the shares. Mr. Michaelis is general manager, Brandt treasurer of the corporation. E. O. Raster declared, that they were not elected in a lawful manner and should be discharged. The States Attorney refused to proceed with the desired action, as according to his opinion the directors' meeting was competent to pass resolutions, though Raster denied this according to the by-laws of the corporation. His lawyer announced another legal action to enforce the discharge of Michaelis and Brandt. The battle between the shareholders of the "Illinois Publishing Company" dates back to the formation of the concern in the year 1901 and all actions to come to an accord have failed. Probably a lengthy court action will be the result.</p>
