   <p>The first edition of a new German weekly magazine called the National News and edited by Joseph Brucker and Paul Haedike was published yesterday. The new magazine which is very attractive in more ways than one has rather a questionable thesis, it states that the "Fatherland" can only be saved by the Republican Party. It contains many good essays and very carefully selected articles from "American" and Europeon newspapers.</p>
   <p>The "Abendpost" management wishes the editors good luck and success as they have always proved good fighters for the Germans of America.</p>
