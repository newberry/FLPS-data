   <p>The members of the Hessen-Darmstaedter Unterstuetzungsverein (Hesse-Darmstadt Benevolent Society) and some of their relatives and friends assembled last evening in a hall located at 63rd Street and Racine Avenue to observe the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Society. A harmonious spirit and an intimate relation have always prevailed among the members, and so the celebration of the anniversary assumed the form of a family gathering. The members and guests enjoyed and will long remember the dancing, recitations, and vocal and instrumental music.</p>
   <p>The Society was organized on March 14, 1894. The following men were charter members: Karl Hemold, Georg Hoffmann, Konrad Rehm, Konrad Walter, Heinrich Kamp, Henry Bueck, Valentin Delp, and Christian Vonderhald. Since its organization the Society has paid more than $5,000 in sick benefits and about $4,000 in death benefits. The number of members--only people hailing from Hessen- Darmstadt or their descendants are admitted to membership--is 179 at present. Twenty-eight members died in the course of time. The officials of the Society are: Henry Allbach, President; Franz Weinold, Vice-President; Phillip Schmitt, Recording Secretary; A. Keckmann, Financial Secretary; George Eifert, Treasurer.</p>
