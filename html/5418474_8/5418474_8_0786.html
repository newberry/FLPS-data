   <p>The new semester of I. Schutt's German-English School will commence on Monday, Sept. 5th. This excellent institution, located at 621-623 North Wells Street, enjoys a great reputation among the Germans, thanks to its capable and conscientious leadership. Its courses become more diversified and complete as attendance increases. In conformity to the requests of many of its patrons, Mr. Schutt published its annual report in pamphlet form, wherein he describes its aims, ambitions, and methods of instruction. We quote from his booklet: "The demahus which modern science and knowledge exacts, because of relentless progress, increase from year to year; and only such young people can obtain a position commensurate with their talents and abilities in business or social life, who have had a broad, fundamental education during their youth. Therefore, our principle task shall be to give our students a suitable education, they may grow, mentally and physically, into sound beings, who are able to cope with all the demands which modern life requires of the educated class. To attain this, the main essential above all, is to make the student conversant with English. Besides the official language the scholar schould also have an opportunity to gain a thorough knowledge of German; not only because it is of extreme practical <span class="page-break">2</span>value, but because a familiarity of both tongues greatly enhances one's mental development and enables our youth to peruse the treasures of German science and literature. Therefore, German instruction commences in the elementary classes, simultaneously with the English, and continues throughout all upper classes. Since instruction in arithmetic, geography, U. S. history, etc., is taught in German, the pupil has an opportunity to express himself verbally and in writing, which gives proficiency in both languages.</p>
   <p>The object of the advanced classes is to augment the material they have absorbed before and to prepare them for the higher scientific and technical institutions. Thereby, a means has been found which enables our ambitions young people to acquire the necessary preliminary education for any vocation, without becoming estranged from parental environment or fatherland during a period, when the majority is in especial need of paternal care and control.</p>
   <p>As attendance in the classes is restricted to a certain number, the instructor finds it easier to maintain the proper discipline and also to take cognizance of the individual propensities and abilities of every student. This point especially appears to us to be of great significance, as both sexes will be taught in this manner. Although we are firmly convinced that boys and girls are endowed with the <span class="page-break">3</span>same mental faculties, and that under suitable direction the reciprocal influence can only be beneficial, experience nevertheless has shown us, that particularly in the superior classes it is essential that we not only focus our attention on tuition but especially on discipline between the two sexes. Therefore, we believed it advisable to place the girls of the more advanced classes under the especial chaparonage of a woman teacher, during recess. In this manner the girls will obtain the same instruction as the boys and through this partial separation the possibly evil influence will be eliminated.</p>
   <p>The teaching method will be developmental inductive. It is our aim to teach only that, which is assimilable, in conformity with the child's age and to arouse the hidden powers of its mind, so that it can be harmoniously developed, i.e., not a one-sided education, and taking proper consideration for the physical prowess, which must not be disregarded. While studies in mathematics exercise the formative thinking, the perusal of geography, history, and natural history strengthen the memory, without cramming half understood intellectual trivialities into the cranium, it is after all imporative, that the pupil shall absorb such facts which are of importance to every cultured human being and something which is of use to him in later life, a foundation on which he can continue.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Since we call the attention of the scholars in every branch to the beautiful and sublime in history, art and nature, his phantasy will be directed into the proper channels, become animated and enriched, and in the susceptable, immature mind of the child, ideas for righteousness, honor and benevolence will be created through which only man's actions will attain that moral worth which sanctifies them.</p>
   <p>All teachers of the school have been educated in American or German seminaries, and universities from which they graduated; teaching, therefore, is their life's vocation. As the various subjects are given to those who have made it a special feature, it is evident that the separate studies are supervised in the most efficacious manner.</p>
   <p>As only that instruction can be truly fecund which is based on observation, we have gradually added pictures, maps, geometric forms for the various classes, and also a number of apparatus for chemistry and experiments in physics; besides we have obtained a collection of (sea) shells, minerals and other nature subjects. An assortment of dictionaries, encyclopedias and authentic works on science are available to the student for reference and study.</p>
   <p>The school library has a total of 331 volumes (197 German, 134 English) and contains <span class="page-break">5</span>much other matter for children and more advanced youths. The books are taken care of by a school fund, toward which each scholar pays a contribution of fifty cents at the time of matriculation.</p>
   <p>The school, situated at 621 and 623 Wells Street has seven light, well ventillated rooms, all steam heated and a large hall for recitations and singing. The Turn Hall (Athletic Hall) which contains the necessary equipment, is also used as a recreation hall during inclement weather."</p>
