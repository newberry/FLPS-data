   <p>An accredited representative of the American Federation of Labor investigated the dispute between the local Typographia No. 9 and the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, and came to the conclusion that the attitude of the Staats - Zeitung was justifiable in every respect. Typographia No. 9 belongs to the American Federation of Labor, and its president, S. Gompers, took a definite stand against boycotts at the last annual convention.</p>
   <p>The point of dispute briefly stated was as follows; Typographia No. 9 demanded of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung to declare its composing room as a union office, and to compel its composers to join the union, and to discharge those who rebel. They even went further and claimed to have the right to discharge some of the composers now employed, who have been with the company for many years, and to substitute them with others.</p>
   <p>It so happens that the Illinois Staats-Zeitung has always approved of labor unions. If properly managed and directed, labor unions become the most effective weans for improving conditions of the laboring classes economically and morally.</p>

   <p>The Staats - Zeitung met the demands of the English Typographia voluntarily; but it is also resolutely fighting for personal liberty. The Staats - Zeitung has never refused to permit the composers and other workers to join a union, but to force these workers to join a union, or to discharge some of them for protecting their own personal liberty, can never be expected of us.</p>
   <p>However, after the representative, Mr. Merten, gave the directors of the Staats-Zeitung the definite assurance that neither the German-American Typographia, nor the Federation of Labor will interfere with the rights of the Staats - Zeitung, its directors announced their willingness to accept the regulations of the German-American Typographia for their composing room. It was also agreed that it was the prerogative of the Staats- Zeitung to use its own judgment in hiring composers and that none of the present employees was expected to leave. Mr. Merten discussed the matter with the foreman and the composers with the result that they joined the German-American Typographia voluntarily. Thereupon the Staats - Zeitung signed a written agreement for one year with the representative of the American Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung carried on its battle in the interest of personal liberty and reasonable demands, and it has gained its ends.</p>
