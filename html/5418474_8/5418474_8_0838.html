   <p>The excellent English-Cerman School of Professor Lauth, 361 North Clark Street, closed yesterday with an oral examination. Many parents and friends of the school, invited for the occasion, were present. The results of the examination were highly satisfactory and showed a marvelous progress in the method of instruction. All answers, particularly from pupils of the higher grades, came promptly and clearly. All teachers of this institute, particularly Professor Lauth and Professor Schuber, deserve our praise and admiration for the achievement of their school, which is enjoying a growing popularity in Chicago.</p>
