   <p>We have received a letter from Mr. A. C. Hesing, main owner of the Staats Zeitung, dated: Salzburg in Tirol, October 10. On this day Mr. Hesing only knew from the scanty telegrams of German papers that the business section of Chicago was burnt; about the destruction of the North Side he knew nothing. Therefore his telegraphic question, "What burned?" - we had to answer with, "Everything destroyed."</p>
   <p>His letter bespeaks courage, cheerful confidence, and the resolution to gain anew what was lost, by industry and activity.</p>
