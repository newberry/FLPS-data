   <p>The Coliseum, largest hall in the city, was filled to capacity at yesterday's mass meeting. Almost 15,000 attended (the majority of them Germans) who had responded to an invitation to approve a number of resolutions recently adopted by a group of prominent citizens at a Washington conference. As far as attendance was concerned, the meeting certainly was a success, but whether the hopes and expectations expressed in this meeting can be realized is another question, to which some people replied in the negative. Obviously, the opinions on the purpose of the meeting were divided. Some believed that it was supposed to be a demonstration of German sentiment, directed against Germany's foes. Others imagined it to be a general peace rally. Since both factions argued their standpoints in no uncertain terms, opinions clashed, and the natural result was an almost universal mood of dissension.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The establishment of an American League for Neutrality had also been mentioned some time before, but during the entire afternoon this subject was never discussed. The above-mentioned resolutions were approved, but in addition to them there were also some others which were partly contradictory in spirit, and of which nobody had heard before, making it questionable whether the movement has actually helped or hampered by yesterday's meeting.</p>
   <p>One of the orators, Jeremiah O'Connor, made an extremely powerful speech against England and in a way, against the present Administration, and the sustained and stormy applause which he received clearly reflected the mood of his audience. The chairman, Pastor Jenkin Lloyd Jones, judged this to be an appeal to the prejudices of national groups, and warned that the women and children should be considered, who were left miserable and destitute by the war. Another speaker, a representative of the Swedish League for Peace, declared frankly that he was ashamed to sit on the same platform with men who made such incendiary speeches. At this, there was loud hissing in the <span class="page-break">\3</span>audience, and many left the meeting ahead of time, disgusted.</p>
   <p>It was not quite one o'clock when people began entering the Coliseum, and soon thereafter large throngs started to pour into the hall, which was filled to capacity shortly before two P.M. From a lofty balcony Ballmann's Orchestra played German and Irish patriotic songs, which were enthusiastically received, and when the St. Louis Jaegerhof [a club, association], with fife and drum corps entered the hall, playing the "Wacht am Rhein," the huge throng joined in the singing.</p>
   <p>The Flags of the German Vereine</p>
   <p>In response to the invitation, many German Vereine [clubs] brought along their standards which, displayed from the gallery above the speakers' plat-form together with numerous American flags, presented a colorful and festive picture. The flags of the following Vereine could be observed:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Grand Crossing Turn Verein, Grand Crossing Unterstuetzungs Verein, Junger Maennerchor, Deutscher Krieger Verein, Chicago Banern Verein, Oesterveidirscher Bayern Verein, Schleswig-Holsteiner Saengerbund, Schlesischer Verein, Gesang Verein Fidelia, Bayrisch-Amerikanischer Verein, Sections 6 and 3, Freier Saengerbund, Wicker Park Maennerchor, Ungarlaendischer Nationalitaten Verein, Badische Saengerrunde, Schiller Maennerchor, Arion Maennerchor der Suedseite, Germania Lodge #2 Kosmos Orden, Schoenhofen-Edelweiss Maennerchor, Irish-American Society, Stammtisch Germania, Chicago Schuetzenverein, Arion Maennerchor, Gegens. [Mutual] Unterstuetzungsverein, Schwabenverein, Landwehr-verein, Senefelder Liederkranz, Aurora Turnverein, Concordia Maennerchor, Chicago Baecker Gesangverein, Verein Deutscher Veteranen, Plattdentsde Gross-gilde, Eisenhunger Deutschungarisder Verein.</p>
   <p>Because Pastor Jenkin Lloyd Jones of the Independent Redeemer Church, who was entrusted with the chairmanship, was detained, Mr. Horace L. Brand opened the meeting. After a short address, he made a resume of all the past activities pertaining to the desired objective, namely, the arms embargo. "We <span class="page-break">\5</span>desire a kind of neutrality which recognizes neither Germany, nor England, nor Russia, nor France, just Europe. All belligerents are to be treated alike." He continued: "May our government preserve the peace and not put us in a difficult position by showing partiality and preference to one belligerent power. This gathering of Americans is motivated by the spirit of peace, humanity and neutrality."</p>
   <p>Mr. Brand then introduced Jeremiah O'Leary, president of the American Truth Society, who made a speech which did not breathe the spirit of peace, but was full of relentless hatred for England. The audience cheered wildly. The applause reached its height when O'Leary referred to the shameless activities of the Anglo-American press. The demonstrations continued for a long time.</p>
   <p>O'Leary's Speech</p>
   <p>"The neutral attitude of the United States should be in harmony with the <span class="page-break">\6</span>discovery, the history and the [political] development of this country. America was discovered by an Italian who was in the services of the Spanish [royalty]. New York was settled by the Dutch, Pennsylvania by the Germans and Swedes, New England and Virginia by the English, the Northeast [Canada] by the French, and the South and Southwest by the Spanish, while the development of the great Northwest was due to our own enterprising spirit.</p>
   <p>"The American Republic owes her existence to British tyranny. When it came to give birth to the nation, the Germans had their Steuben, the Dutch their Schuyler, the French their Lafayette, the Irish their Jack Barry, the Poles their Kosciusko, the English their Washington, but they all belonged to America. The Declaration of Independence was a cosmopolitan idea, a progressive step by all humanity. Its purpose was to outmode the doctrine of superiority of race and birth, which logically makes for the monarchical form of government. When the revolution was over, the people, in their first impulse, asked 'Who is going to be king?' But from the Constitutional Congress came the reply, 'We will not have a king, but a president.'</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>"At the outbreak of the Revolution the Colonial population was about three million, which was a little more than the number of people living in Chicago today. Up to 1820 we have no authentic figures, but the growth in population was in direct proportion with immigration. Here the Germans were leading, with the Irish a close second. Then came the Austrians and Hungarians, and finally the English and the Scotch, the French being last. It is no exaggeration to say that half of the total of the population of the United States today have German or Celtic blood in their veins.</p>
   <p>"From the standpoint of race we are not a nation. What makes us different from other nations is neither a common language nor common racial characteristics, but common principles [ideals, ideas]. Dear friends, we have dedicated ourselves to promote justice and fairness, not to gain material wealth. Our efforts are for the welfare of all races [nationalities], not just one. By bands of blood we are related to all nations and the statesman [politician] or the newspaper preaching the Anglo-Saxon doctrine, is a foe of the Declaration of Independence, a Judas Iscariot to other races [nations] whose <span class="page-break">\8</span>blood was shed once that this nation might live--not as a citadel of Anglo-Saxonism, but as a temple of justice for all. This nation can continue only by keeping faith with the principles of equality and justice as they are documented in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution.</p>
   <p>England's Policy of Conquest</p>
   <p>"Great Britain has never taken the United States seriously. Until 1865,it pursued a policy toward reconquering the lost colony, for which the wars of 1812 and 1861 (sic) give testimony. During the Civil War, the American people furnished evidence that they were capable of preserving the Union, the integrity and the inviolability of this nation. Subsequently, Great Britain changed her tactics to accomplish her objective, but only in respect to the means employed. You newspaper scribes, you 'neutral' Americans, take a look at Cecil Rhodes' testament, and you will find the methods described in detail: Absorption, education, propaganda, and colonization. Everything <span class="page-break">\9</span>that was English in the United States was to remain so, and anything that wasn't yet English had to become so. Unfortunately, I haven't the time to quote from the statements of living and deceased statesmen to corroborate my assertions.</p>
   <p>"The American people today are reaping the rewards of the conspiracies directed against their liberties. Our country has no merchant marine because Great Britain destroyed it during the Civil War. Our press is not free and independent; rather it exists by the grace of England. Our nation desires to purchase ships riding at anchor in our harbors, but Great Britain decrees 'You mustn't!' Our nation wishes to engage in peaceful commerce, but Great Britain's warships, lurking outside our harbors, refuse us this right. Our nation wants to send ships into the North Sea, but Great Britain says, 'Nothing doing!' The North Sea is closed. Our nation would like to transport passengers in American ships to neutral countries, but Great Britain decides who is to be admitted as a passenger and who is not. America would like to send her ships out on the high seas without Great Britain making them stop at <span class="page-break">\10</span>British ports, searching their cargo, taking off what she likes, and then permitting them to proceed. Although our freedom on the high seas has been trampled underfoot by Great Britain, the United States, or rather certain moneyed interests in the United States, continue to furnish her and her allies all kinds of war material, making the United States England's storehouse and arsenal in the fight against Germany and Austria-Hungary.</p>
   <p>Our Neutrality</p>
   <p>"Undoubtedly our Government has certain rights, but it does not make use of them, except once when Mr. Bryan wrote a letter of complaint which went something like this:</p>
   <p>"'Dear Johnny Bull: People over here, particularly those hyphen-Americans, are making a lot of noise, and in order to calm them down I am writing you this letter. Please don't hold it against me. It is just a letter, not a protest.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>I know you never do wrong intentionally. You are the champion of freedom of the seas and of trade rights. People over here are saying you are stepping on their toes. I hate to put you in an embarrassing situation, but if you don't mind I wish you would tell me when you intend to get off [their toes]. I know we have made a contract, according to which you could put the matter off for another year. Nevertheless, I should like to receive a satisfactory reply, so I can straighten this matter out before the next presidential election. Give my regards to Reginald, my son, and tell him to watch out for those German 42-centimeter howitzers. Best regards,</p>
   <p>'Bill.'</p>
   <p>"I believe it was in this same hall where Bryan once said that the Republican party was trying to nail the American people to a cross of gold. Now he himself tries to nail the homeland of twenty-five million Americans to a cross made of British gold. If we do have certain rights in this whole matter and make no use of them, we are nothing but miserable cowards. But if, in <span class="page-break">\12</span>order to appease England, it is our claim that we haven't any rights while in fact we do have them, we would be hypocrites, and a neutrality based on cowardice and hypocrisy is a bastard neutrality.</p>
   <p>What Germany Expects</p>
   <p>"The situation is intolerable. A great injustice is being done, and we have come together here today to protest against it solemnly. Mr. Bryan claims that this country is neutral, but he is only one man and you number thousands. If you would claim that this country was not neutral you would make a liar out of Mr. Bryan. Would you have gathered in such masses if the country were neutral? Your presence here, your protests, your cries of anguish and indignation prove that there is something definitely rotten in Washington, and that something stinks to high heaven. Our national shield of honor has been spotless so far, but our unneutral policy has soiled it. It has angered the German nation so much recently that the Koelnische Zeitung [Cologne Newspaper] wrote the other day: 'American neutrality is only a thin veil, behind which is <span class="page-break">\13</span>hidden an active and zealous appeasement of England. If America were really neutral, she would demand the right to sell war material to Germany and Austria as well as to the Allies.'</p>
   <p>"What does Germany expect of the American people? On January 22 the German crown prince declared that Germany demanded absolute justice [impartiality] in all matters. Did she get such justice? (A thundering 'No' by the whole audience was the reply).</p>
   <p>The Neutrality of Death</p>
   <p>"Let every American ask himself this question: Do the United States really treat Germany and Austria with full justice and fairness? Every American-made bullet, fired from an American-made gun, that pierces the heart of a German soldier, is also fired at the Germans here in America, at the monuments of Steuben, Siegel, and Schurz, The American manufacturers of war material undermine the peace here in America. They are an abomination before <span class="page-break">\14</span>God and men. While they are filling their coffers with gold, they are making countless enemies for this country. And what shall we say about this government which is supposed to represent you and me? Is it neutral? Is the gun neutral, or the bullet? Is the conspirator neutral, who presses the dagger into the hand of the assassin? Is the bullet neutral which pierces the heart of the soldier who fights for the liberty of his country, not against the United States, but against Great Britain, France and Russia? Shame on that kind of neutrality! Shame on a government which is a party to it! Shame on those knaves who reap a profit out of this sordid trade! Shame on all congressmen and senators who refuse to cleanse the honest name of the American people from this disgrace!"</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the chairman, Pastor Jenkin Lloyd Jones, had arrived. The spirit of hate for England which filled O'Leary's speech, and the wild acclaim of the audience, apparently were not to the pastor's liking; he is an advocate of world peace. As soon as Mr. O'Leary had finished, he took the floor and began to pour oil on the waves of excitement by pointing out that <span class="page-break">\15</span>it was easy to fan the flames of passion, but that this method certainly did not help the peace movement. He spoke about as follows:</p>
   <p>"For over forty years I have worked in this community and I have always, just as I do today, advocated international friendship. This ideal does not recognize Germans, nor Anglo-Saxons, nor Russians, nor French, nor Americans, nor Irish, but it aims to unite the descendants of all nationalities represented in this country into one loyally co-operating people who would favor international understanding. Being citizens with identical attitudes, we have to condemn the prejudices and misunderstandings which are the result of racial and national jealousies, and must work for a unification of the world in which single nations are only parts of a pattern. Selfish interests, competition for the domination of the world, and similar motives are solely to blame for the present war. Not one single nation involved could face the divine judgment seat with clean hands.</p>
   <p>"Our own nation is the product of all nations, and not just one or two. I <span class="page-break">\16</span>am a citizen of a great republic of great minds, and in a sense am also a citizen of the Germany of Goethe, Schiller, and Kant, of the France of Moliere, and of the Russia of Tolstoi, just as I am a citizen of the England of Darwin, Shakespeare, and Browning. We have not come together here to thresh out national prejudices; rather let us think of the hundreds of thousands of women and children who are facing misery and destitution in all the belligerent countries. Let us put ashes on our heads and sackcloth on our bodies, and confess with humility in our hearts that all of us are worshipping at the altar of Mars, who has ever been the enemy of liberty and has rewarded the antagonists of human progress with power and riches.</p>
   <p>"I am not appealing to one national flag, but to all national flags on behalf of which widows and orphans are now weeping, Who are we, Germans, English, Russians, French, if not children of the same God? That is reason enough to avoid anything which would cause bitterness among ourselves.</p>
   <p>"The committee which has called this mass meeting together has requested me <span class="page-break">\17</span>to speak in the name of peace, and not to say anything to incite passions. That is in conformity with the dictates of common sense. The narrow concepts of routine patriotism leaves no space for the feeling to be a member of the same great family, a feeling of which I am deeply conscious. This narrow-minded, petty patriotism has been characterized best by Dr. Johnson, who said that patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels.</p>
   <p>"The colors of the Stars and Stripes would fade if you would not grant equal respect and equal rights to all the component nationalities in this country, whether they be Irish, Scotch, English, French, or German. Only then will Old Glory be truly glorious. I appeal to this great audience of Chicagoans to open their minds to tolerance, mercy, peace, and the appreciation of the good in man, which is found in all nations and countries. I have grown up in this land of liberty as the child of an immigrant, to enjoy its blessings, but I don't belong in this meeting here if it was called to contribute to racial prejudices. I am fully aware of the gratitude I owe the Germanic <span class="page-break">\18</span>peoples, but I appreciate equally the precious heritage I have received from France, the homeland of Victor Hugo, and from Russia, which has given the world a Tolstoi. American citizenship should mean an all-embracing spirit of brotherly love. If this meeting is in favor of international sympathy, and wants a peace that would not humiliate any nation, but would let reason rule supreme, making a future catastrophe like this impossible, then I belong here. Let us be citizens of the world, not pro-German or pro-British, and let us never forget that we are the descendants of all nations."</p>
   <p>The effect of this speech was unmistakable. The audience displayed signs of uneasiness. The fact was realized that two elements, opposed to each other, were present at the meeting. One of them, motivated by a German desire to carry the fight to a victorious conclusion, advocated an arms embargo in order to reach this goal more quickly, while the other faction proposed that general efforts be made to bring about peace.</p>
   <p>The next speaker, Patrick O'Donnell, president of the Allied Irish Societies, <span class="page-break">\19</span>tried to mediate between those two conflicting opinions by pointing out that everybody, without exception, would welcome an early peace. But first, he said, a collection would have to be taken up in order to guarantee the continuance of this great movement which had just sprung into life, until the last shot had been fired on the battlefields and peace had returned to earth. This appeal to the generosity of the audience was responded to very liberally.</p>
   <p>O'Donnell's Speech</p>
   <p>"In behalf of all of us, who have sought refuge over here from oppression, I should like to state that we are taking an interest in this gigantic struggle as American citizens, and that we hereby issue a demand to the [belligerent] powers to make peace and unfurl the international peace banner. We 15,000 people assembled here demand it.</p>
   <p>"One talks about the standing armies in Europe, but we ourselves have the <span class="page-break">\20</span>largest standing army in the world here in America, namely, the unemployed, and I think it is about time that we go back to work. Of course we are not belligerents, but we have to pay war taxes nevertheless, just as the people in Europe do. We have to pay, because those people are fighting over there.</p>
   <p>"There is certainly enough misery and destitution on the other side of the ocean, but over here the number of unemployed and hungry is steadily on the increase, and it is about time for the responsible circles in Washington to stop meddling in this war, which is the cause of all this misery. America is doing everything in her power right now to prolong the war, except that we have not issued a call for volunteers yet, but otherwise co-operation [with the war effort of the Allies] is evident everywhere.</p>
   <p>"American guns and American powder are doing their devilish work in the trenches, American bullets wound and kill citizens of a friendly nation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\21</span>
   <p>"America owes it to her citizens to close every port to the shipment abroad of war material, to recall every ship loaded with munitions or arms, and to keep all the implements of death and destruction, which could be used in war, within her borders. Only by so doing can America prove that she is the friend of all nations and, as the song goes 'The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave'."</p>
   <p>The Resolutions</p>
   <p>After this address, former City Clerk J. R. McCabe read the resolutions which had been adopted at the Washington conference of Jan. 30 by prominent citizens of this country, also a number of additional resolutions which, with the exception of the few gentlemen who had drafted them, nobody was familiar with. The subsequent resolutions contain items which were not contained in the original ones, among others a protest against the dropping of bombs on open cities by airships [dirigibles]. As is the habit when resolutions are proposed, they are often adopted without much study.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\22</span>
   <p>The resolutions, including the ones adopted at Washington, are published on another page of this issue.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schvan's Address</p>
   <p>As the next speaker, the chairman introduced Mr. Gustav Schvan, a Swedish member of the League for Peace. This was the same gentleman who had said that he was ashamed to be present at such a [hate-inspired] meeting. He spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"At the time when I was holding lectures at meetings and at universities in the East, I was glad to accept Mr. Jones' invitation to come to Chicago, but I would not have come to this meeting had I known beforehand what kind of meeting it was going to be. Listening to the first two speakers, I became disgusted, and only Mr. Jones' address caused me to remain. Neither have I voted in favor of the resolutions, because they contain clauses which are likely to cause war. If you believe that world peace could be restored and <span class="page-break">\23</span>preserved as long as you put American interests above all others, you are mistaken. Unless humanity, and human values, are made the prime considerations, all the talk about justice, fairness, and impartiality is just so much eyewash. The fate of mankind must not depend on emotions, but must be guided by reason, and it can be done. The present so-called international law is ambiguous, vague, and probably not more than one hundred professors understand it thoroughly. In its stead we need new international regulations, clearly outlined and comprehensible to all."</p>
   <p>Pastor Jones' speech had caused a somewhat depressed atmosphere, but Mr. Schvan's oratory provoked open protest, and the audience hissed loudly. Many got up and left in disgust.</p>
   <p>When the last speaker, Congressman Frank Buchanan, the well-known labor leader, was introduced, there was so much commotion that he had a hard time getting started. "I don't know whether you care to listen to Mr. Buchanan," said the chairman, "but if you do, you will have to be quiet." And jokingly <span class="page-break">\24</span>he added, "He is willing to risk his life".</p>
   <p>Mr. Buchanan, in his address, defended President Wilson as well as Secretary Bryan, and declared that both were sincerely trying to preserve peace.</p>
   <p>Buchanan Defends Bryan</p>
   <p>"I am a native American. So was my father and my grandfather. Nevertheless, I can say that I am taking neutrality just as seriously as anybody born in Europe. For years I have supported the efforts of organized labor, whose interests differ only slightly in other countries of the world. Organized labor is against war because it has to bear the heaviest burden; it has to pay the greater portion of the cost. I consider it my duty, therefore, to work for peace in the national legislature, and I am in favor of every bill that would prohibit the export of submarines, airplanes, cannon, and any other devices manufactured in our factories and designed to destroy human life. Labor in all countries, in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belguim, etc., was <span class="page-break">\25</span>engaged in lively agitation against any future wars and advocated the discontinuance of the manufacture of war materials or their exports, when war suddenly broke out, and most workers had to rush to the colors to defend them in bloody battle against their fellow men.</p>
   <p>"My only hope and my only intention is now to find a way to end this war, and that can best be done by prohibiting the export of arms and munitions. For this reason I wholly agree with the resolutions made here, and I will do my best in the House of Representatives to have them adopted, and will support the Vollmer Bill by all possible means.</p>
   <p>"Of course, I have not yet studied the problem of neutrality very thoroughly and, although I grant everybody the light to criticise the national administration, I am nevertheless convinced that, in the present situation, the men at the helm of the nation (call from the audience: Billy Bryan too?)--yes, including Billy Bryan (loud, continuous hissing and booing)--are doing their best on behalf of peace."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\26</span>
   <p>Chairman Jones closed the meeting with the following words:</p>
   <p>"As we are parting now, let us ask ourselves: Have we reached a better understanding? Have we effected a compromise between conflicting opinions? Has this meeting inspired a deeper hatred against war? Or has it caused increased bitterness and farther separation, has it injured the humane way of thinking? If so, then the meeting was a failure. Permanent peace can only be built on the foundations of science and religion."</p>
   <p>Parade After the Meeting</p>
   <p>After the meeting, about 5,000 members of various Vereine formed a column outside the Coliseum and marched through the streets with bands playing, led by the Verein Stammtisch Germania. Behind the music came the standard-bearers and members of the Verein, carrying Chinese lanterns, which presented a gay picture as they were lit later on. A few signs could be seen in the parade, bearing inscriptions like "Freedom for this country and refuge for <span class="page-break">\27</span>all," "Be Neutral! Remember, we are Americans!," "Don't send any foodstuffs to Europe, and pay more for your bread over here!" "Don't export arms and munitions to prolong the war!" The parade dissolved at North Avenue, after Mr. Emil Weidner had made a final speech.</p>
