   <p>Owing to the lack of ready cash, the German Society of Chicago, during the month of May, was able to continue its blessed work, which it has carried on for seventy years among the indigent German families of Chicago, only through the benevolent financial intervention of its directors. The scarcity of ready cash is felt all the more by the Society now that the appeals for aid to meet moving costs and rent increases in the "moving" month exceed the usual number of requests.</p>
   <p>Yet, the German Society of Chicago, in spite of its difficult position, managed to give aid to forty-one families with 161 children and to sixteen single persons, among whom were four women. Furthermore, it provided the unemployed and the shelterless with ninety-three meals and sixty-six lodging quarters; it procured places for sixty-five <span class="page-break">\2</span>persons in private hospitals; for five in the County Hospitals, for three in Oak Forest, for one in the Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor, and for one at the Tuberculosis Sanitarium. It also provided free medical care and drugs to fourteen persons.</p>
   <p>For purposes of aid, the German Society of Chicago spent $624.96 in the month of May.</p>
   <p>All readers possessed of a sense of charity and humanity are requested to send money for the alleviation of want among the local German population to the business office located in Room 604, 160 North Wells Street. Money orders should be made out to "Deutsche Gesellschaft von Chicago" or "German Society of Chicago."</p>
