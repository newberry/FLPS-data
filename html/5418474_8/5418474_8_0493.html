   <p>A reader, in a letter to the Abendpost, says: "I hear many German people say that they do not care to read the Abendpost any longer, and I myself find it strange that the Abendpost, as a guide and protector of the German cause, uses such violent language against the Central Powers. Has the Abendpost been bought by English financiers and is it now trying to lead the German people into the English camp? We cannot understand your sympathy for the English. You will find out, within a very short time, that you do not have many readers left. Please give an explanation in your next letter box (under A.B.)"</p>
   <p>Letters like this are nothing new to the editor of the Abendpost. Similar complaints, insinuations, and threats have come to us before in large quantities, especially in the spring, summer, and fall of 1916 and then, again, immediately after America's entry into the war. These letters <span class="page-break">2</span>invariably contained the assertion that the Abendpost had been"bought"and the threat: we are not going to read it any more. The only difference among them was the degree of ignorance, passion, and hatred displayed.</p>
   <p>We did not make any reply to these letters, but quietly put them in the wastebasket, because we understood-we understood everything. And to understand all is to forgive all. We knew the sources of this hatred, or thought we did, and we could understand that, during times of deepest emotion and inner conflict, sensitive people let their feelings rather than their reason, be their guide; that they were looking for ulterior motives behind an attitude which they could or would not understand. This reminded us of the old proverb: "Was ich denk und tu, trau ich andern zu" (I judge others by myself) and we were aware that unfortunately it is customary to designate something that is not understood as "corruption" or a "sellout".</p>
   <p>Having an absolutely clear conscience, we were confident that every day would shed more light on this matter and would clarify the situation even for the <span class="page-break">3</span>most stubborn, so that they would recognize their position and with it their duty to the country, to themselves, and to their fellow citizens of German blood.</p>
   <p>The letter printed above shows that this has not yet dawned on all of them, and so a brief reply is necessary--not in the interest of the Abendpost--which seems to thrive on slander and the like, since the year when it had the most enemies was also its most prosperous one--but for the sake of the letter writer and those people with whom he associates himself. For they still seem not to grasp the situation and seem not to understand what is at stake in this war for America and for all good Americans; and what duties they, in particular, have to perform.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost is not a "guide and protector" of the German cause, and never was, but it endeavors to promote the cause of the German people as much as <span class="page-break">4</span>possible and considers itself duty bound to protect the interests of the American citizenry of German descent and therefore writes against the German Government, which hates the people and hates liberty.</p>
   <p>It has not been bought by British financiers, nor has anybody else ever contributed a dollar, except for business purposes; nor is its management trying to induce "German people" to become English.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost is an American newspaper, printed in German. The policy it pursues is purely American. Its ambition is to win over to pure Americanism those German people who still cannot seem to find their way in these times of apparent contradictions, and to show citizens of German origin how absolutely necessary it is for them to show not only that they are loyal, but that they are genuinely patriotic and wholly American, in this period which is not only critical for them, but also for America (for their country, of which they are a part). This is necessary for their duty's sake and for the sake of their future as well as that of all others of German blood.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Because the Abendpost is genuinely and wholly American, its sympathies can only belong to America, and not to the English. Because it is genuinely American it stands fully and completely behind the government, which is for "America, America, America" and for the democratic idea, which is to bring liberty to all peoples--including the German!--and to bring a just and lasting peace to the world.</p>
   <p>To its brothers of German blood, who found a haven in America, the Abendpost preaches strictest fulfillment of duty and vigorous and open sympathy for America and her aims of liberty and peace; efficient co-operation with necessary measures of the government--right now the Fourth Liberty Loan, for instance--because we are convinced that in this way and only in this way can the suspicion which has been felt against the German element and which always is reawakened by the attitude of people like "A.B.," finally be conquered and removed! Only in this way can we expect to see the German element of the country become, in the near future, a model for all others in its loyalty and Americanism. Only in this way will Americans of German descent find full recognition, and be praised as first-rate citizens and Americans.</p>
