   <p>Arthur F. Lorenz, former editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, began yesterday his six-month jail sentence, which he received from Judge Hugo Pam for libeling the American Legion, after his attempt to escape same through habeas Corpus proceedings, were unsuccessful. His attorneys asserted that Judge Pam erred when he sentenced Lorenz to six months in jail, and also fined him.</p>
   <p>The crime for which Lorenz was convicted, can only be punished with a jail sentence or a fine, but not both at the same time. Since Lorenz paid his fine, he is entitled to his freedom. Judge William V. Brothers, before whom the case was pending, was of the opinion, that he did not have any jurisdiction in the matter, that he could not reverse Judge Pam's decision who had the same jurisdiction, and was about to reject the Habeas Corpus appeal when it was voluntarily withdrawn by Lorenz.</p>
   <p>Through that action, the sentence of Judge Pam became in force again, and Lorenz had to begin to serve his sentence. He wrote an editorial in the year 1922, in which he called the members of the American Legion bums and tramps.</p>
