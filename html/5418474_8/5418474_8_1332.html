   <p>The International competitive match which began on June 4, and ended on September 3, was a festival of far reaching influence for our American marksmen. It was arranged and managed by the Chicago Schuetzenverein and held at Schuetzenpark in Kensington.</p>
   <p>Although the selection of this place was not so good from the financial standpoint it, nevertheless, helped to cement the bonds of friendship between the German riflemen and those from other countries. It is to be regretted that Germany sent no participants, with the exception of one representative, a Bavarian, from Munich. Switzerland, which glories in being the founder of our modern marksmenship, did not compete. There were two hundred fifty expert marksmen present. They will henceforth be known as the "Columbians." The highest attainments have been recorded at this tournament, and the "King," who finally won the medal, may indeed be proud; he may call himself, "King of the World's Marksmen."</p>
