   <p>Since the "German" Hospital must enlarge their building without having the necessary means to do so, it will be compelled to appeal to the generous "Germans" living in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We have a right to expect that our countrymen will respond willingly and gladly. One of the chief duties of the "Germans" here is to protect and promote this genuine "German" Institution.</p>
   <p>Recognizing this duty, the "German" Press Club decided at their conference yesterday to plan a grand concert at Me Vickers Theater. The net profit is going into the building fund of the hospital. The club will make extraordinary efforts to offer the very best. Undoubtedly, it can count on the active support of the "German-Americans.</p>

   <p>Another matter of importance to all "Germans" in Chicago came up for discussion, that is, the necessary preparation for the "German-week" at the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Since the German Press Club constitutes a neutral ground, where all "German" choirs, athletic clubs, lodges, societies, etc. can unite, it was decided to bring about this unification for that definite purpose mentioned.</p>
