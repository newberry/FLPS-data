   <p>About 150 persons have attended the yesterday evenings Soiree of the art and literary club in Haendels Hall to enjoy themselves by the recitations of Reuters poems. It must, however, be doubted, if the purpose has been achieved. A very desirable change in the uniform program has only been brought about, by the piano performances of Mr.Emil Lubling, who gave some of his own compositions and some other musical pieces, with great mastership. Also the performances of the two sisters Mrs.Mary Salomon-Ahlfeld and Mrs. Bertha Molihin Ahlfeld found very much approval. However, the lecture of Mr.Meiter on Reuters study period and also the latter literary portion did not come up to the real importance of the Low Serman people's poet and did not do justice to the real meaning of a Reuter soiree. The literary club must do better to keep the interest for German literature awake.</p>
   <p>For Tuesday March 31 an "Uhland evening" has been announced, at which opportunity the municipal assistant-Librarian, Mr. E.F.L.Ganss will make the principal speech. Also the violinist Karl Becker and the pianist C.E.R. Mueller have promised their cooperation.</p>
