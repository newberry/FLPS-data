   <p>A very pleasant document is the following which was signed by all the banks and for which the Germans should be grateful to Mr. Greenebaum:-</p>
   <p>The German peace celebration on Monday, May 29th, promises to become so magnifieent and impressive that it will monopolize public attention that day. As it is probable that all business will stop for the day, we, the undersigned bankers and banks, declare herewith that we will keep our offices closed during that day.</p>
   <p>Signed by all National Banks and Bankers.</p>
   <p>The Board of Trade and the Chamber of Commerce are going to resolve today, as has been promised definitely, to keep closed next Monday.</p>
