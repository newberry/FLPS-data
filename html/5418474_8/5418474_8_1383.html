   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde, the oldest and largest society of turners in the City, is considering plans for the erection of a new building and gymnasium. It has been found that the North Side Turner Hall, its present home, is not located conveniently for a majority of the members, who live for the most part north of North avenue. It is especially inconvenient for the children classes, which are attended by about four hundred pupils. This society has grown to such dimensions that its present quarters are becoming too crowded.</p>
   <p>Louis Nettelhorst, the speaker of the society has been looking around for sometime for a convenient place of ground and has found one that seems to answer all purposes. It belongs to Mr. Gulich and is located on Wells St., new Eugenie, with one hundred feet on Wells street and reaching through La Salle Ave.. A committee of five has been created to negotiate a ninety-nine year lease of the property.</p>
   <p>The North Side Turner Hall is worth about $200,000 including the ground. If possible this property will be sold which will enable the society to erect a new building at once on a grand scale.</p>
