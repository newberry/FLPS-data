   <p>Just as Goethe's works breatned love for nature, so does Schiller's express love for freedom...Schiller is indispensable for us in America. The wonderful German spirit and the beautiful family devotion which he glorified in his poem "The Glocke" ( The Bell) shall help to retain in our children the German spirit in the midst of English surroundings..."</p>
