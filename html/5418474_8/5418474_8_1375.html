   <p>The last meeting of the County School Council was an important one for all friends and lovers of gymnastics. The members of the council on the proposal of Mr. Dreyer resolved without exception to employ the gymnastic teacher, Kroh, with a salary of $1700 as chief of gymnastics in the Normal School of Cook County.</p>
   <p>This action is naturally identical with the formation of a gymnastic teacher's Seminary and herewith the spirit of the gymnastic will also be carried to the American population.</p>
