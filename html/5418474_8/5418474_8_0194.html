   <p>Whoever thought of the old settlers' picnic had a good idea. It is rumored to be the brain child of Frank Schweinfurth but this much is definite: The Turngemeinde took an interest and brought it to realization and therefore deserves full credit. The festival was an outstanding affair and is unanimously conceded to have been the greatest picnic in the history of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The weather was, of course, exceptionally favorable--street dust had been eliminated by last week's rain--and new verdure clothed the trees..... Perhaps the heavens repented having spoiled many an individual settler's picnic in former years and thus the weatherman made amends.....</p>
   <p>We do not know just when the picnic began, but at four o'clock thousands were present--not only old settlers but sons, daughters, and grandchildren <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>were well represented....At about five o'clock more than six hundred old settlers had had their names recorded.</p>
   <p>The festival committee thought of a very practical procedure: all the names of the settlers and the dates of their arrival were registered in a special book. A nice gold-fringed insignia of white silk, with the year of the settler's arrival printed on it in his presence, was given to each one.</p>
   <p>Messrs. John Boser, Max Stern and Wilhelm Dieffenbacher recorded the names, while the distributing and the printing of the insignia were taken care of by Messrs. Emil Hoechster and Robert Lehr. At five o'clock the supply of silk insignia was gone, and whoever came after that time had to do without or be content with paper strips, This happened to hundreds.</p>
   <p>We append the names of old settlers, in accordance with the registry book:</p>
   <p>Men: [Translator's note: A long list of names, covering three-quarters of a column in small type, follows. Only the earlier years are quoted in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the translation.] John Kuhl, 1837; Charles Baumgarten, 1834; John Mertes, 1840; John Schneider, 1832. Women: L. Schneitmann, 1835; Agnes Ludwig, 1835; K. Trautmann, 1836;...[Translator's note: The period from 1845 to 1855 shows the largest number of names. English and Irish names are among them, also Italian; at a rough glance I should estimate the Germans to comprise about ninety-five per cent or more.]</p>
   <p>The official arrangements provided for bowling with prizes; participants had to be residents of Chicago for more than twenty years. Gymnastics and a concert were also on the program, the latter beginning at three o'clock. Carl Sehneat, who was to direct the instrumental part, was detained by illness and therefore the Western Light Guard Band proceeded under the leadership of its own conductor, Mr. Claudius.</p>
   <p>The gymnastics naturally caused much mirth. At thirty minutes past four o'clock the old gymnasts appeared who had, over the years, acquired <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>considerable weight. To the accompaniment of music, they marched to the grove in Behring's garden. Here the exercises were performed under the leadership of Joseph Huhn. But the commander chose a younger member to demonstrate the more difficult features, since Huhn's belly protruded considerably.</p>
   <p>The arm exercises were performed fairly well but the leg movements proved to be a problem for many who had won prizes at gymnastic meetings in bygone years. Then the assembly proceeded to the opposite side of the park where the horizontal bars were mounted, and here many of the founders of gymnastics in Chicago showed such agility that the youngsters were outclassed. Ferdinand Lott and....others drew themselves up and....performed difficult feats in an admirable manner.</p>
   <p>Every successful evolution was given jubilant acclaim, but the audience's demonstrations were most vociferous when one of the gymnasts was unable to mount the bar. That predicament was shared by "Swabonian Louis" and D. Roth.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Especially praiseworthy were Messrs. Lott, Neuberger and Schweinfurth.</p>
   <p>By this time the crowd numbered thousands; it sought diversion in gymnastics, merely watching, and dancing. During this period the committee was busy learning the names of the oldest settlers, as shown in the registration book to which reference has already been made.</p>
   <p>After this information was obtained, more or less accurately, the crowd gathered at the platform in response to a trumpet call. The band played "Die Wacht Am Rhein," and then Emil Dietzsch recited the poem which he had written for this occasion.</p>
   <p>Festival Poem (by Emil Dietzsch)</p>
   <p>......No storm can erase our love for the Fatherland..... Where rye ripens and grapes thrive <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>You will hear the German song.....</p>
   <p>Be proud of your calloused hands</p>
   <p>Which cultivated strange lands....</p>
   <p>Proclaim it to the heavenly sky,</p>
   <p>Hail to the old folk!</p>
   <p>Mr. Dietzsch was often interrupted with outbursts of enthusiasm and at the end received long and grateful applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Greenebaum....was recalled to the platform and was asked to give a speech. He thanked the audience for the consideration shown him and.... declared that the Chicago Turngemeinde really deserved the credit, as they had taken an active interest....in promoting the huge picnic....</p>
   <p>The committee members, with Chairman [Henry] Greenebaum and those settlers who believed themselves entitled to the prize, congregated at Behring's house.....The examination of the various aspirants amounted to a virtual cross-examination.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>It was debated whether the prizes should be given to those who had first come to Chicago, or to those who could show longest continuous residence in Chicago. The verdict was in favor of the latter.</p>
   <p>As the time for the decision drew nearer, people mounted benches and chairs....After thorough consideration Anton Berg, who came to Chicago in May, 1834, and Mrs. Marie Malzacher were pronounced oldest settlers. Mrs. Malzacher is still very active. She came from Bremen. Germany, and settled in Chicago on March 24, 1838 [sic. The list previously alluded to gives the year as 1833.] She is now a widow, mother of four children. Two sons were present. Mrs. Malzacher lives at 403 South Clark Street.</p>
   <p>The prizes consisted of two nice medals, a gold one for gentlemen and one of silver for ladies.....[The medals were suitably engraved.]</p>
   <p>The ceremony of bestowing the prizes took place in front of the platform.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Mrs. Malzacher, escorted by J. A. Huck and John Woltz, followed the band, and a large crowd completed the parade. Anton Berg had already left the festival but this did not prevent the crowd from giving him a rousing cheer.....After Mr. Greenebaum had made a few suitable remarks before the presentation of prizes, the public demanded a speech from the recipient, but Mrs. Malzacher was overcome by emotion and could not speak. Others expressed her gratitude, and, when Greenebaum finally bestowed the medal and added a hearty kiss, the enthusiasm of the gathering proved boundless.</p>
   <p>Former and present members of the Freie Saengerbund and the Maennergesangverein came in appreciable numbers. Many of these members are some of the oldest settlers of the "Garden City".....Several selections, among them "Halloh! Brueder Reicht Die Hand Zum Bunde," "Wenn Sich Der Geist," "Auf! Brueder Auf," were sung under the leadership of Emil Rein. All were applauded. During the intermissions the singers refreshed themselves with beer, and many a toast was given to dissolved clubs and their founders....</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Among the singers was the famous Mr. Kerpen, the man with the nine-foot beard.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon and evening the bowling alley proved a lively place.....</p>
   <p>Prizes ranged from one dollar to ten dollars. The first prize winner, among old settlers, was Valentin Ruh; forty-seven pins with five balls.....</p>
   <p>It was indeed a pleasure to note the old gentlemen competing in such a serious manner and the exhilaration displayed by the victors. Of course, a fair share of the prize money was exchanged for beer.</p>
   <p>It was a delightful evening, the most pleasant of the fall; a cloudless sky, full moon, no wind. Illumination was ample, since three calcium lights <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>had been installed with sufficient brilliance to light the entire park.</p>
   <p>Everything proceeded in a strictly orderly manner. There was dancing in the afternoon....and evening....The Street Car Company had enough cars available for the return trip, and there were also many private carriages....The festival will always remain a pleasant memory.</p>
