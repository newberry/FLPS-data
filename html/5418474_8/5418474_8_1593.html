   <p>The name of Goethe Street will remain unaltered for the time being. But for how long a time, is a question. From all indications it appears that the change from Goethe Street to Boxwood Place, which the property owners who live on Goethe Street demand, will not be ordered before the April election. And the reason is very apparent. An election is pending. It would be very unwise to consider the matter in the City Council now and ask the members to vote for or against the change. There are a great number of German voters in the city, and it would be too dangerous to offend them immediately before election by changing the name of Goethe Street. On the other hand, those who hate the Germans, and to whom the name "Goethe Street" is a thorn in their side, must also be taken into consideration. So the City Council tabled the ordinace, which had been reported out of the Committee on Streets and Alleys for acceptance. Thus the ordinance will not be considered, and no one will have to take sides for or <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>against it. And the ordinance will die when the present council adjourns from its last meeting in April. But there is nothing to hinder the German-haters from bringing the matter before the next City Council.....</p>
   <p>No doubt the aldermen were persuaded to adopt this careful procedure by the strong protests of the German societies, among them the Vereinigte Maennerchoere, through its president and secretary, William Arens and August Lueders; and the Frauenverein of St. John's Evangelical Church. The Schwaben Verein, which joins all movements in the interest of the city's German population, sent a vigorous protest to each member of the City Council. Following is a copy of the protest:</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"Permit us to direct your attention to a resolution which the Schwaben <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Verein passed in its recent general meeting. In this resolution you are asked to assist in defeating the proposal to change the name of Goethe Street to Boxwood Place. You can very readily see that it is not the immortal poet's honor which would suffer from such a measure, but the feelings of a great number of people of our nationality. They have always been loyal to the community, but they must look upon the constant hatred of everything they love and esteem as a personal insult.</p>
   <p>"Five years ago, when the Goethe monument in Lincoln Park was unveiled, our mayor, our governor and the professors of many universities had naught but praise for the poet Goethe, and for those who made the erection of a monument in his honor possible. Nothing that would justify the eradication of the name 'Goethe' has happened since that time.</p>
   <p>"As far as loyal support of our government is concerned, we are a match for people of any nationality. Hundreds of our young men willingly <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>shouldered guns for this country, and during the forty years of its existence our society has contributed thousands of dollars for charitable and educational purposes. Therefore, we most earnestly request that you oppose every attempt to force upon us the status of a 'merely tolerated' element of the community. The four hundred members of the Schwaben Verein will be grateful to you.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Emanuel Gall, President."</p>
