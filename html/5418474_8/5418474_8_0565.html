   <p>The German Press Club dedicated last night its new own home, which was built at 108 Randolph Street on a vacant lot of Mr. William Jung, the great benefactor and sponsor of many broad-minded developments.</p>
   <p>The interior of the building was decorated wonderfully and soon was filled with a large crowd of members and guest-visitors. Mr. Theo Jansen, the president of the Club, greeted all these present and congratulated the young club for its prospering condition and promising future.</p>
   <p>Mr. Young, who is a wonderful singer, pleased the audience with a few pretty songs. Then followed several zither-guitar recitals by Mr. Stahl.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Hoechster and Bocks gave speeches concerning the achievements and purpose of the club, the members of which really had an enjoyable evening.</p>
