   <p>The South Turners dedicated their new building at 3143 State Street yesterday afternoon. Theodore Oehne delivered the oration of the occasion in German. He said:</p>
   <p>"With pride and joy I welcome you today in this hall which is destined as the future home of the convivial Germans of the South Side. Not until Dec. 17, 1885, were any actual plans formed. Twelve men organized a society for that purpose. Among them were Adolph Claser, Fritz Muller, Henry Wirk, Frank and George Schwienfurt. These men organized such a society. I had the honor to be the first speaker on that occasion."</p>
   <p>Mayor Carter H. Harrison followed the dedicatory speech in English.</p>
   <p>The Mannerchor sang "O, Hail, We Greet Thee". The musical program closed with the rendition of Kendelssohn's "Midsummer's Night March".</p>
