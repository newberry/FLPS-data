   <p>Mr. Rob Kiesting made a short welcome speech, which was followed by a performance of the "Schiller" Men's Chorus singing the "Vereinsgrus" (Club greeting) by Buhr. The gymnastic demonstration of the various clubs lasted two hours. The performances of young and old, male and females were excellent; they did their very best and gained a splendid and well deserved appreciation and applause.</p>
   <p>The Schiller Men's Chorus, the mixed Columbian Chorus and the song Sections of the Vorwaerts and the Grand Crossing Gymnastic Club provided in a generous manner, a splendid song and musical entertainment. Gymnast Hillenbrandt of "Eiche" (Oak) showed his mastery in club swinging.</p>
   <p>The exercises were conducted by the gynmastic teachers Cobelly and Houssen and were assisted by the Vorwaerts, Tentonia, Grand Crossing and Columbia gymnastic clubs.</p>
