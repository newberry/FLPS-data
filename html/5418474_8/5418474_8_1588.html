   <p>"The German Oak tree still remains although many storms have raged over the tree in the last eleven years, and several branches and many leaves were swept away, its strong root remained. A German who denies his German descent is like Judas, the betrayer, and deserves to be despised by all respectable people." With these words, which were accepted by the many thousands with great enthusiasm, Mr. Krutgen finished his speech in regard to the Fritz Reuter memorial celebration in Humboldt Park. It was a celebration which will be long remembered by the many thousands who were present. A parade preceded the celebration, in which the members of the different North German guilds of Chicago and surroundings marched, led by the drum and bugle corps of the Social Turner association, from Wicker Hall, to the festival place in Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>Singing societies of Chicago were represented by several hundred singers, who added to the festivities of the celebration by singing several German National songs, under the direction of Mr. Rechzeh.</p>

   <p>The oldest ex-Grand master of the guild, Mr. Charles Jorchow, recited the poem "The Oak Tree" by Fritz Reuter. The Grand Master of the guild, Mr. Max Scharlan opened the celebration with a few fitting words in which he pointed to the former custom of holding a Fritz Reuter celebration, which during the war period was abolished, but which shall from now on again be held. Mr. Scharlan then introduced the President of the West Park administration, Dr. John Dill Robertson.</p>
   <p>"I am greatly honored", said Dr. Robertson,"to welcome you, in the name of the city and the Park Administration." Every nationality, but especially the German honors its poets. The popularity of Fritz Reuter is evidence of the fact that he used in his world, a language which was understood by every one.</p>
   <p>Among those present, who listened attentively to the words of Dr. Robertson as well as to those of Mr. Krutgen was 91-year old Heinrich Butzow of Watsiki, who had come to Chicago especially to participate in the celebration.</p>

   <p>Mr. Krutgen's speech essentially consisted of the following words: "Today, on the anniversary of Fritz Reuter's death, we look across to the old homeland to which we are deeply devoted with all our hearts and whose language we cherish. Of course we are Americans in whose hearts never arises a discord, we are true to our new Fatherland just as we love the country in which our cradle stood. How could we forget the old Homeland, forget it on a day in which we have gathered to honor the memory of one of the noblest and most superb men Germany ever produced. Fritz Reuter who asked his wife if she believed that this his works would outlive him! If he could see how in America, here in this beautiful park, a magnificent monument by German admirers of art has been erected to his memory, and that his works are published in almost 3,000,000 volumes. Such honor has seldon been bestowed upon German poets."</p>
