   <p>The war of nations, which supported by lies and deceptions, is carried on against Germany and Austria Hungary, and from which the German Nationalities in America have to suffer because the prejudice against everything that is German is strengthened and increased by all possible impossible means, had the one good effort, to weave a stronger tie of Unity among Germans, German Americans and friends of Germany. The feeling of belonging to each other, awoke amidst the hateful attacks of our enemies, differences of class and race have disappeared, and those belonging to different races and local associations extended the friendly and brotherly hand to each other to work for a mutual benefit. The war united us in a strong alliance against the enemies of our home lands, and this alliance should also give us strength in our fight against our enemies in America. It concerns the extension of German cultural work in this country, and to place it in a clear light. This is a task, which must not be overlooked or neglected, much has been done to abtain recognition for this cultrual work, But the war brought us dangerous enemies, who with the help of the press destroyed all progress so far attained, and who intend to crowd the German influence into the back ground. The German-American Historical Society, has, since its formation 1900, in the first decemium edited a quarterly <span class="page-break">2</span>periodical, and since a year book, in which German activity and German culture in America was dug out from the darkness of the past, and published honestly, expertly and with clear conscience and distinction. The society's activity has in the learned profession and educational circles, and among the public in general, with the exception of those people, who intentionally agitated or where a malicious prejudice existed, met with great recognition. The activity of the society is a patriotic one, in a true German-American sense, and should certainly not be overlooked by the fire of enthusiasm appearing daily, but on the contrary should be supported zealously.</p>
