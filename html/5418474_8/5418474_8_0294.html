   <p>Prof. Eugene Kuehnemann of the University of Breslan lectured last night at Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute. He was invited by the Germanistic Society of Chicago. He established the idea of the development of the fatherland in the 4 dramas starting with Schiller's "Maid of Orleans" till the mighty appeal to the Germans in the hour of danger in "Herman's Battle" by Kleist. The expectations, that with the new formation of the German Empire a literary impetus would set in, especially with the new German drama were not realized. The only representative of the patriotic drama was Wildenbruch who died recently but could not be considered as a master with his style of festival prologues and plays. The youngest National literature of the Germans was very modern, the creature of world views of today. The poems of the fatherland have been written in times of the deepest humilation. The above 4 dramas not only give the development of German poetry but also the making of German souls.</p>
