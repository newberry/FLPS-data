   <p>p. 8.. The Paris edition of the New York Herald, in its issue of Oct. 4th, states that Mr. Henry Schmehl, the well known Chicago runner, has arrived. He went there to challenge Grandin, the Parisian pedestrian. The proposed races are: 1.) $1,000 per man, a 75 hour indoor run, 2.) A 6 day race, $2,500 per man, or 3.) A long distance contest from New York to Chicago for $5,000. Grandin was in Chicago last summer.</p>
   <p>In a later edition it is said that Mr. Grandin cannot be found and that he has not answered any telegrams or letters which were sent to him. Some time ago Grandin sent a telegram to Schmehl, saying that he would arrange a competitive meeting in Paris, but it appears now as if the Frenchman resorts to a cowardly retreat. In that event Mr. Schmehl's journey will be useless and disappointing.</p>
