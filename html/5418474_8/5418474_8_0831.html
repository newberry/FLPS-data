   <p>About eighty children attended the opening of the Sunday school last Sunday morning in the Turner Hall of the Soziale Turnverein, corner Halsted and Lincoln.</p>
   <p>Founded by destitute workingmen its beginning is surprisingly good and proves not only the necessity for such a school, but also warrants its ultimate success.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hartung was introduced as the future instructor of gymnastics and Dr. E. Kleinodt as teacher. The children ranging from 5 to 14 years of age were divided into two classes.</p>
   <p>The committees recommend the opening of similar schools in other sections of the city but are badly in need of money at the present.</p>
