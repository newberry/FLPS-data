   <p>Under the auspices of the local group of the National Flag, the Thuringian congressman Dr. R. Jobst of Jena, a member of the German Democratic Government party, gave a lecture in the upper ballroom of the Lincoln Turner Hall, on the theme "Economical and Political Conditions in Germany, or Democracy and Hitlerism." The unfavorable weather impeded the attendance at the lecture but in spite of that, a considerable number of visitors arrived to listen to Dr. Jobst's discourse.</p>
   <p>Germany of Today.</p>
   <p>Dr. Jobst referred in his interesting speech to the fact, that yesterday was the sixty-second anniversary of the German Reich's foundation, of the Reich that once was forged together by the Iron Chancellor Prince Bismarck; but it is suffering today from a serious economic distress, and is in the midst of a fight for its existence, and above all for unity within and without, also, for personal, political and spiritual freedom.</p>

   <p>Then he came to speak in a detailed manner about Hilter's influence upon today's fate of the German Reich, and criticized sharply the Fuehrer of the Nazis, his aims and purposes. He accused Hitler of pursuing only personal ends, and of aiming to become a dictator still more powerful than Mussolini.</p>
   <p>A change must come. That Hitler ever gained the powerful influence, which he exercises over a large part of the German people, Dr. Jobst attributes to the low spiritual condition which prevailed among the Germans in the post-war days. They saw their redemption in the motto "A change must come," and followed blindly a demagogue who cleverly took advantage of the situation. Dr. Jobst saw already the inevitable reaction and could assure his listeners, that Hitler and his followers have passed the culminating point of their power, and now must fight for their own existence. "The German nation," the speaker declared, is thinking matters over again and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>refuses to chase after a Fata Morgana, which through its false promises and dazzling colors would have fooled the people, but the true nature of which they finally were able to detect.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fritz Bremer presided in his usual clever manner. The hall was decorated with the American flag and also with the German National flag. The picture of the first German president, Fr. Ebert, was displayed on the stage.</p>
