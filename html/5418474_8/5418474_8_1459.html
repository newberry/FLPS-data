   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde [Turner Association] can be well satisfied with the response the Germans are giving to the recent bond issue. According to the reports of the committee, not a single German has refused a contribution; all have given in proportion to their ability in order to lift the mortgage on the Turnhalle (Turner Hall). The efforts of the citizens' committee and the committee of the Turngemeinde certainly have brought results. The gentlemen in charge of financial matters decided that collections should not be started until sufficient pledges had been received at least to meet the mortgage. If enough money can be raised to pay the second mortgage, then the Germans feel that ownership of the Turnhalle is assured and, after all, the Germans provided the money some years ago to erect the building. When the second mortgage is paid, one feels assured that the constant collections necessary in the past need not be resorted to in the future, because interest payments will be reduced. As interest diminishes, it will be obvious that outstanding bends may be redeemed within a year.</p>
   
   <p>Every businessman recognizes this, and there is not a German merchant in the city who would not gladly forgo interest payments for a few years on several hundred dollars, if our German institution, the Turnhalle, can be saved. And that is why several who bought only stock have asked for time extension so that bonds could be purchased instead. The success of the appeal, the hearty response of the people, is a credit to our Germans. We are appending a list of subscribers: J. D. Harvey, B. Loewenthal....and eight others, $100 each. Total amount so far: $4,800.</p>
   <p>The committee will provide a complete list next week. Calling upon so many people entails considerable work, but the committee feels gratified, since it has become apparent that the required money can be raised.</p>
