   <p>The seven local Freemason lodges which are using the German Language were recently ordered by the State Grand Lodge henceforth to conduct their meetings in English. Four of the lodges complied with this order, but the Germania, Lessing, and Waldeck lodges will continue, for the time being, to use German. At a meeting, held last Thursday, of the three last named lodges, preparatory steps were taken to file a protest against the order to eliminate the German language during meetings. It was decided to send a special committee to the Grand Lodge, which will convene the first Tuesday in October. The German Masons claim that the order is a world-wide order, and, therefore, of necessity, polyglot.</p>
