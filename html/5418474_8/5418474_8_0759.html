   <p>The Democratic Executive Committee published a circular today, an immense edition in the German and English language, in which full details are given about the Democratic candidate for governor, Stringer, and his Republican rival, Deneen regarding their attitude on the nauseating Edward's school law, which would give the death-thrust to the German schools. This law, also provides a punishment for children to these schools.</p>
   <p>At that time, Governor Altgeld recommended to the legislature that the law should be repealed and Mr. Stringer, chairman of the Committee, which considered it in all its phases, asked for its abolition, while the Republicans tried to save it with amendments. According to the excerpts from the legislative records, Deneen voted for the legal additions and against the unconditional withdrawal of the Edward's law. Both candidates were members of the legislature at thattime.</p>
