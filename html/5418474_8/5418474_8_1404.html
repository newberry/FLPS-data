   <p>Yesterday's festival of the Turnverein Fortschritt (Progress) was a complete success.</p>
   <p>An interesting lecture by Mr. Charles Bary, a member of the Chicago Turngemeinde who dealt on the ethics of the 8-hour-day question, furnished spirited amusement.</p>
   <p>The Turnverein, 1822-24 Milwaukee Avenue, is at present in its boom time. It has 130 members, including twenty-two active 'turners' and thirty singers.</p>
   <p>The fencing section, founded a short time ago, will give an exhibit on May 11. The children class has about 200 pupils.</p>
