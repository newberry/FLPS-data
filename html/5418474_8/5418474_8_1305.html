   <p>Yesterday's Turner exhibitions at Schoenhofen's big auditorium, was enough of an inducement for lovers of this sport, to fill the spacious hall to its capacity. The society had thus a fine opportunity to show its well-wishers who came from all parts of Chicago, accomplishments of which the society can be proud.</p>
   <p>A festive overture opened the program, after which girls of class one introduced the Turner exhibitions, so much acclaimed by the audience. Class II displayed a lovely Turner exhibition with flags. Then followed the Turner exhibitions by boys, all of which were loudly applauded. An advanced class of young ladies contributed a great deal toward the success of the evening.</p>
   <p>Of course, the center of interest, was the exhibition by active Turners. The horizontal pole exercises were simply excellent, and so were the iron bar exhibitions, performed by the organization's best team. The applause was almost endless. A ball followed the evening's regular program.</p>
