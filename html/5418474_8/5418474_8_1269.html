   <p>Anyone who has ever participated in the festivities of the Chicago Schuetzen-verein (Chicago Rifle Club) knows in advance that he is going to have the sort of good time which true huntsmen and marksmen enjoy. The untiring president of the Club, Judge George Kersten, who has been in the center of activities for years, always tries to show his club members a good time. This was also anticipated for the great ceremony of distributing prizes for accomplishments during the closing year, which was to take place yesterday in the Atlantic Hotel, but at the last moment word was received that Judge Kersten was confined in bed with a fever. This, naturally, put a damper on the festive spirit.</p>
   <p>A real riflemen's dinner was held, after which Dr. E. C. Sayre, master marksman, delivered an address to those present, encouraging them to take active <span class="page-break">2</span>part in the shooting exercises in Palos Park. Dr. Sayre had contributed a splendid silver cup, which was won by Mr. Andreas Kolar. Secretary J. W. Weccard then gave a detailed report of the activities of the club during the past year, which was received with great applause. From his comments it could be learned that 130 members of the club had joined the colors, a fact which, naturally, was reflected at the shooting exercises. As the prizes were distributed, the following marksmen came out victorious:</p>
   <p>Charles Urban: First prize, military shooting in standing position, gold medal; second prize, military shooting in sitting position; second prize, military shooting in prone position; second prize, pistol shooting. The three last-mentioned prizes are silver medals.</p>
