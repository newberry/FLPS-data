   <p>We have two societies here in Chicago whose influence upon the Germans in general are of an intellectual blessing, namely, the Historical Society and the Germanistic Society.</p>
   <p>The Germanistic Society started its 9th recital series with a musical program. Victor Saar of Cincinnati will tell about Johannes Brahms, in his songs, and Hans Schroeder will illustrate the recital with a number of Brahms' songs.</p>
   <p>In consideration of the exceptionally animated activities of the society in the interests of the German cause, the society deserves the most extended assistance from all united cultured Germans of Chicago. To become a member of the society, the German cause will be promoted, the misjudged German thought will be uplifted; every German is honor- bound to attract the attention of cultured Americanism toward the activities of the Germanistic Society; if the Americans first get to know our thoughts, they will appreciate them, as well as us, correctly.</p>
   <p>The Germanistic Society spreads this knowledge, therefore we shall and we must help this cause.</p>
