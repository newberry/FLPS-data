   <p>At the behest of many swimmers and through the mediation of one of them it was possible to obtain one of the best private swimming pools for the training of the Schutzbund men. It is the swimming hall of the Midwest A. C. on Hamlin Avenue and Madison Street. It measures sixty-two by twenty-five feet; the pool has a high and a low jumping board and all other sanitary equipment, as well. Bathing suits are provided.</p>
   <p>Swimming exercises for ladies and Gentlemen will take place for the first time tonight. Tuesday, from 8 to 10 P.M. Admission fee is, for the present, fifty cents; should there be many interested, then a considerable reduction is to be expected. A teacher of swimming for the club has offered his services free of charge.</p>
