As the unemployment situation becomes increasingly terrifying, and prices mount, more and more children implore us for shelter at Wanzleben. But how can we help them when we lack all means of support? We have no income, except contributions from friends, and therefore, beloved Germans of Chicago, help us in our sorrow so that we can clothe and feed the children at our home."</p>
   <p>Councilor Puttea, director of the Charite-Hospital in Berlin, N. W. 6, Schumannstr. 21, asks help for the tuberculosis and cancer department. "Life in Germany," he writes, "became so expensive that at one time <span class="page-break">\2</span>we contemplated discontinuing this department, but an auspicious foreign donation kept us "above water." Regardless of the difficult conditions, and the contemptible conduct of the French who dominate us, we would not like to let the reliable German middle-class perish, and so we try particularly to help children by giving them sufficient nourishment, and promoting their health. I know from first hand information and reliable hospital records, just how the middle class suffer, financially and from malnutrition. I have ample proof of their utter destitution and living conditions. If we can add your Welfare Association to the list of friends who support our cause, then allow me to express my profound thanks in the name of my poor compatriots.</p>
   <p>Ernst Grober, minister of the German Evangelical parish of Graslitz in the Bohemian Erzgebirge, (Ore-mountains) implores the German brethren <span class="page-break">\3</span>and sisters, and all who have compassion on the suffering Germans in the ceded territories. "I still believe in God," he writes, "and in German sentiment which brooks no denial when help and salvation require action." "Everyone who helps our lone youth in this mountainous district, will shower the blessings on his own progeny. For every contribution, our young folks will send Czechoslovakian and Austrian postage stamps as a memento. God be with you! In the name of our Mountain youth, I offer my ardent thanks, even for the most modest donation, and express my gratitude in advance."</p>
