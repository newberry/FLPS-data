   <p>The Summer Festival of the "Union of the German Women's Society" which, on account of bad weather, could not take place on Monday, as it was announced, took place yesterday instead, under a sunny sky. Crowds of people from the early afternoon until in the morning attended the Festival.</p>
   <p>The Orchestra, under the leadership of Prof. Nitzschke, and the "Germania Male Chorus" deserve much praise.</p>
