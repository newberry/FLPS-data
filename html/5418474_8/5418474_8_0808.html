   <p>Messrs. J. Malok, F. Sigrist and H. Capinger are the incorporators of a new German Academy for medicine and maternity with a capital of $50,000. Dr. Malok, whose office is at 764 Milwaukee Avenue, stated that the new academy will open July 17th with ten professors. Four of them speaking English will teach and speak about maternity affairs while the other professors will teach the same subjects in the German language.</p>
   <p>It is intended at a later time to build an academy near Humboldt Park, but at the beginning the necessary buildings will be rented in Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
