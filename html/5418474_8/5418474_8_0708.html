   <p>Under the title, "Karma", the excellent German-American Philosopher, Dr. Paul Carus, has published a short, but extremely clever narration that initiates the reader with a perception of Buddhism, that is, not disfigured by superstitions. Originally written in the English language this story is now published in German by the Open Court Publishing Company, 324 S. Dearborn Street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is clearly visible that the author has not forgotten to express the beauties of his mother tongue, since he became an English writer. The form fully corresponds with the contents, that is, the way of expression is just as plain as it is solid, and the book seems not to be designed only for the consumption of the learned and the thinkers. It will bring enjoyment to all who feel truly religious and who find the teachings of morals the essence of religion.</p>
