   <p>Schintz read an invitation for the peace festival (Franco-Prussian War) and moved to close the schools on the day of the celebration.</p>
   <p>Stone opposed the motion, because, as he said, there was no peace as yet in France.</p>
   <p>Walsh said it would hardly be sensible to send the children on the street for that carousal.</p>
   <p>Schintz believed one owed it to the children to let them enjoy the parade, just as one closed the schools on July 4.</p>
   <p>The motion thereupon was adopted with all against one (Stone's) vote.</p>
