   <p>In the name of the committee of a school which has just been opened, I appeal to the party friends in their own and their children's interest to select this school. It won't be long before success will manifest itself and the small sum paid for your child's education will bring good returns. The price by month for one child is 75c; for two children of the same family, $1.25; for three children, $1.50 and for four children $2.00.</p>
   <p>English is taught by Mr. Surbridge. The school opened and lessons commenced May 5th at 9 o'clock in the morning, with a considerable number of pupils present. As the expense of this new enterprise is considerable, we request every socialist who considers a good education of his child, a necessity to select this school.</p>
