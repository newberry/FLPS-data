   <p>Dr. Dubs of the Evangelical congregation, whose name has been mentioned quite often lately on account of denominational strife, made a trip to Germany after the church trial was over and has just returned. On the day before yesterday he gave a lecture on the characteristics of the German people in the old Fatherland and on German home life. He expressed himself as follows:</p>
   <p>"The German still clings to his house and his soil unless adverse conditions and serious reasons drive him away from home. It is one of the principal traits of German character to cling to memories of the old homestead, fought for by his ancestors and cherished through many generations up to the present day."</p>
   <p>Describing the interior of a simple German dwelling Dr. Dubs praised the orderliness, the thorough cleanliness, etc.</p>
