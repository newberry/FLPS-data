   <p>The very favorable reception, which had been given the first ladies' meeting and entertainment of the German press Club caused the Arrangment and Entertainment Committee of the Club to repeat the experiments as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>On account of the recent elections which kept the majority of the members busy, however, it was delayed till the present. Tonight again a jolly ladies' Evening meeting will be held in the clubrooms of Randolph Street and the entertainment Committee has arranged some pretty surprises for this occasion.</p>
