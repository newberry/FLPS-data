   <p>Yesterday's [marksmen's] festival will be remembered for years. It was the first festival of the Northwestern Marksmen's Alliance, and is scheduled to last for five days. With respect to the purposes of the Alliance, we can only repeat the statements made in the program:</p>
   <p>"The Founding of the Northwestern Marksmens' Alliance</p>
   <p>"Since marksmenship progressed in our fatherland through an affiliation of many small clubs into alliances, the marksmen who came to America also were desirous of organizing marksmen's clubs in the various cities here, and, to further the cause, associated themselves with other similar clubs.</p>
   <p>"Here in the West, the first alliance was founded in the Swiss settlement in Highland, Illinois, and was called the Riflemen's Alliance of North America.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Hard times and other circumstances affected the alliance's continuance, and dissension among the members finally resulted in its dissolution.</p>
   <p>"During the period of the war all clubs retrograded; the best members served the Country under arms, and after the hostilities, the few who returned had other problems to contend with, hence could spare no time to found a new alliance.</p>
   <p>"In the year 1872, the marksmen's clubs of the eastern states sent an appeal to the western clubs to help form a new alliance--and many of our smaller western clubs gladly consented.</p>
   <p>"The first meeting of delegates was held in August, 1872, in Philadelphia, and Baltimore was chosen as headquarters. The first festival was held two years later in the latter city, and at that time, Philadelphia was chosen as the location of the next alliance festival, which was held the year of the World's Fair in that city.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"The third festival was arranged by the New York Rifle Corps, and was held at Union Hill Marksmen's Park, New Jersey, in 1878.</p>
   <p>"During those years, only the most prosperous and proficient members attended the eastern festivals, while the less affluent members (who could not well afford to attend the distant tournaments) voiced a desire to have an alliance meeting nearer their western homes.</p>
   <p>"When the Marksmen's Club of Chicago issued an appeal to neighboring clubs, two years ago, to organize a new marksmen's alliance, many clubs favored the plan, and sent delegates [sic]. Last Summer, during the regular annual festival of the Chicago Marksmen's Club, the first convention was held, the following clubs being represented: Milwaukee Schuetzengesellschaft (Marksmen's Society), Milwaukee; Alma Schuetzenverein, (Marksmen's Club), Alma, Wisconsin; Monroe Schuetzenverein, Monroe, Wisconsin; Helvetia Schuetzengesellschaft, Highland, Illinois; Missouri Scharfschuetzenverein, (Sharpshooter's Club), St. Louis, Missouri; Excelsior Rifle Team, Davenport, Iowa; Southwest Chicago <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Schuetzenverein, and the Chicago Schuetzenverein, Chicago.</p>
   <p>"At that time, the bylaws were formulated and adopted, and it was resolved that the Chicago Schuetzenverein should select headquarters and plan for the first western tournament. All delegates, in returning to their respective clubs, felt that the good work had had an auspicious start, and they were convinced that the alliance would be in existence for a long; time to come. In order to justify the confidence of the associated clubs, the Chicago Schuetzenverein selected the most capable members as officials for the North western Marksmen's Alliance, as the new organization was named. Albert Boese is president of the Alliance; John B. Hefner, vice-president; Charles Schotte, corresponding secretary; R. Hendrich, treasurer; George Kersten and George Kuehl. "marksmen." These gentlemen immediately sent invitations to other clubs to become affiliated with the Alliance and the following clubs replied: Bloomington Schuetzenverein, Bloomington, Illinois; Joliet Schuetzenverein, Joliet, Illinois; Manhattan Rifle Club, New York; Dubuque Rifle Club, Dubuque, Iowa; Stillwater Schuetzenverein, Stillwater, Minnesota; <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Princeton Schuetzengesellschaft, Princeton, Illinois; Sheboygan Schuetzengesellschaft, Sheboygan, Wisconsin; Detroit Schuetzenbund, Detroit, Michigan; Aurora Schuetzenverein, Aurora, Illinois; Saline Schuetzenverein, Illinois; and Collinsville Schuetzenverein, Collinsville, Illinois. These clubs have 707 members who are now associated with the Alliance.</p>
   <p>"The Chicago Schuetzenverein</p>
   <p>"The Chicago Schuetzenverein made preparations for months, in collaboration with the central committee of the Northwestern Marksmen's Alliance, to promote the festival. Mr. Boese is the president of the latter organization. Thus far--that is, up to yesterday--one hundred seventy marksmen have sent applications to participate in the festival, and this number will undoubtedly be increased to two hundred before the end of the festival. The above numbers refer to active members.</p>
   <p>"Among the visitors not affiliated with the Alliance are some members of the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Manhattan Club of New York, some of whose members are accredited with being the best shots in America: Mr. Hayes, for instance, who won the first prize at the Philadelphia tournament in 1876, and Mr. Aery, one of the best "free hand" marksmen in the Country. Almost all have broken one record or another, and will undoubtedly provide keen competition. Also, excellent riflemen from Highland, St. Louis, Bloomington, and other cities are here, hence the final result is unpredictable."</p>
   <p>The Parade</p>
   <p>The high temperatures which prevailed for several days finally subsided; yesterday morning was pleasant, and a cool southwest wind prevailed when the last arrivals were met by the reception committee at the railroad stations. There was even a hint that Pluvius would send his greetings, but the weather remained pleasant throughout the day.</p>
   <p>At about nine o'clock in the morning, the marksmen gathered at their headquarters, <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>Klare's Hall, on North Clark Street. The local and visiting riflemen appeared for the parade and for the subsequent trip to the Schuetzenpark. The committee on arrangements was exceedingly busy alloting places for the participants. Festival marshal William C. Seipp and his adjutant general, Mr. Trieglaff, both on horseback, were everywhere trying to bring order out of chaos, and were ably assisted by their lieutenants who also were mounted. The county commissioners and members of the city council were present, and it was indeed a pleasant sight to observe all the riflemen and their friends bedecked with ribbons and rosettes, wearing black and white hats, carrying guns, and displaying medals. The conversation centered on events scheduled for the day.</p>
   <p>Shortly after ten o'clock, the immense parade started; more than 250 wagons were used to accommodate the throng. An honor guard of police, on horseback, rode at the head; then followed festival marshal Seipp with his staff, on their steeds, and about twenty riflemen, also mounted. The latter carried crossbows and horns; their leader wore a suit of armor and rode an Arabian horse. Then came the visiting riflemen and our local marksmen, with their flags and insignia, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>in the following order:</p>
   <p>Adjutant festival marshal Charles Kern and staff.</p>
   <p>Bandwagon.</p>
   <p>The Honorable Carter H. Harrison, mayor of the city, members of the city council and county commissioners.</p>

   <p>Chicago Schuetzenverein.</p>
   <p>The parade followed the route announced in yesterday's edition of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. [Route omitted]</p>
   <p>Many of the streets along the route were decorated. A small speaker's platform, <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>ornamented with oak leaves, was erected in front of the new Customs Building. The Great Western Light Guard Band, directed by Nietzschke, played "Hail Columbia," "Was Ist Des Deutschen Vaterland," the "Marseillaise," "Yankee Doodle," and other national songs. Mayor Harrison then mounted the platform.</p>
   <p>The American flag, as well as banners of the Schuetzenbund and other clubs, ornamented the speaker's stand.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison's Speech</p>
   <p>"....I welcome you in the name of Chicago...." [Translator's note - As Harrison is not a German only fragments of his speech are translated] Harrison has been an enthusiastic hunter since early youth. "When my father died he bequeathed me a horse and gun. When I was four years old I could manage the horse, and I longed to be able to handle the gun." Harrison told how a sugar trough served for his cradle, and how he became an enthusiastic hunter.....Then he related several amusing incidents which had occurred while hunting....Finally he expressed <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>his confidence that the marksmen will--when the need arises--make use of their skill in defending their adopted fatherland. He was roundly applauded.</p>
   <p>The long row of vehicles started moving again....and finally reached the station on Canal Street, where a train was kept in readiness to carry the assembly to Schuetzenpark.</p>
   <p>The main streets along the route of the parade were festively decorated; particularly a number of houses on the North Side near the Schuetzen headquarters displayed flags and foliage. The headquarters building, Klare's hall, was bedecked with garlands and flags, in its interior as well as on the outside. A large garland of oak leaves was stretched from the second floor across the street and bore a sign: "Welcome, Riflemen, from Near and Far." Most of the German business streets along the route of the parade were ornamented with young trees and branches. Large crowds gathered on street corners and sidewalks, and many people looked out from windows as the parade passed. At the Staats-Zeitung Building, American and German flags were displayed.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>The North Side Turnhalle was also beautifully decorated.</p>
   <p>The railroad trip required more than an hour. A large number of ladies and children boarded the train to see the tournament.....The train reached the park at two o'clock.</p>
   <p>At Schuetzenpark</p>
   <p>Near the entrance to the park, the men formed in ranks, with the Great Western Light Guard Band in the lead; amid music they marched to the club building....</p>
   <p>Speech of their President</p>
   <p>"Riflemen and friends! I bid you welcome in the name of the Northwestern Marksmen's Alliance of the United States. The validity of the proverb, 'In union there is strength' again has proved itself. I appreciate your participation in this festival, and thank all riflemen and all others who have come to the <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>festival. I see marksmen here from all the cities of the Northwest, and even many from the East. The latter fact is particularly remarkable, not because the gentlemen from the East are better marksmen, but because it shows the great unity existing between the East and the West. We organized the Northwestern Marksmen's Alliance because not every rifleman is able to go to the East every year, and because we felt that, in forming such an alliance, an opportunity would be provided for many to display their skill in a tournament. We follow the plan adopted in the East. I extend to you the thanks of the central committee of all the clubs for your support, and hope that you think, as I do, that a good beginning indicates success. Everyone who came here has come with the intention of making this first meeting a successful one."</p>
   <p>The Chicago Schuetzenverein</p>
   <p>President Hartmann welcomed the assembly in the name of the Chicago Schuetzenverein and gave the Alliance flag to Mr. Boese.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>The band then played "Heil Dir Im Siegerkranz," and, in accepting the flag, Mr. Boese lauded the purposes of sharpshooting, and gave three cheers for the new alliance. His short talk brought hearty acclaim.</p>
   <p>The Banquet</p>
   <p>Then followed the banquet; everyone enjoyed the culinary offerings of Mr. Klare, as well as his excellent wine. Conversation was not lagging, by any means, and, after the wine had done its share in limbering vocal organs, one heard many amusing hunters' stories and other humorous anecdotes.</p>
   <p>Festival Speaker Colonel Juessen</p>
   <p>At the end of the meal, Colonel Juessen delivered the festival speech:</p>
   <p>"Mr. President and members of the Northwestern Marksmen's Alliance:</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>"A German festival without a speech is something unheard of. If any of the countless German clubs goes on an outing as a diversion from the daily grind, or if the members celebrate a festival at the clubhouse during a stormy winter night, the festival speaker will be there.</p>
   <p>"The festival speech is a typical German custom, and as such it prevails in Germany,--and every other place on earth where Germans have ever settled. There is the old story about two loyal Prussians who emigrated from Germany and were shipwrecked on a lonely isle. Alternatingly, on the King's birthday, one would deliver the festival speech on their lonely reef, while the other listened.</p>
   <p>"I have every reason to doubt that story, not that I believe a German loses his enthusiasm and his urge to speak at festivities under such peculiar circumstances, but because I know that, under such conditions, much may be said, but no one is inclined to listen.</p>
   <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>
   <p>"The German who forgets his business worries and visits his club for recreation, and who knows all about the purposes for which the club was founded, does not require a speaker to explain in an eloquent manner what the club stands for; in that case the speaker cannot tell the member anything he does not already know. Life is short, and the pleasant features of our existence are shorter still; so the jovial German enters into the spirit of the festivities at the very beginning, and usually hears as little of the festival speaker's address as a church member does of the sermon. He knows that, next morning, he can read the entire speech in the papers. The German's chief concern is that the speech be short; so short that the rhetoric ceases as soon as the glasses are filled--or the youth espies his sweetheart in the crowd.</p>
   <p>"I have been a speaker on many occasions, and so recognize the facts; therefore I shall not strain the proverbial German patience.</p>
   <p>"Above all things, I must emphasize that, of all nationalities, the Germans are the only people who know how to enjoy life in a rational manner. Thousands of <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>people already here, and many more thousands who will arrive within the next few days, will celebrate a festival in true German fashion.</p>
   <p>"The German knows the serious side of life, and is as aware of it as the American. Among business people throughout the land, as well as among eminent men in other fields of endeavor, the German element is well represented and respected. The Germans, like the Anglo-Saxons, are furthering the development of the nation, materialistically as well as culturally, but business or labor does not monopolize the German's entire existence. The longing to participate in festivals is, after all, a German heritage, and, in attending festivities, the German forgets the tasks-of life, the daily grind; he finds inspiration and feels invigorated. This enables him better to meet the problems of life.</p>
   <p>"In this respect, the German is a successful crusader for culture--in a land which is ruled by money madness and greed. For years, the German idea of life proved unimpressive, but, during the past ten years or so, a legion of converts have been made, and nowadays there is hardly a German festival where Americans <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>are not present--eager to enjoy themselves in the traditional German manner.</p>
   <p>"Just as a pious person looks with elation at every new church steeple because he sees therein proof that the world is improving, so I regard with intense satisfaction every new German festival, because I know that it brings us nearer to a rational view of life and to an eventual assimilation of the various elements of this great nation. Now, in as far as this organization is concerned, I can give no better or shorter description than is contained in the constitution of the Northwestern Marksmen's Alliance, which states: 'The purpose of the Alliance is: A closer co-operation of all riflemen and advocates of marksmanship, the attainment of perfection in the use of firearms, and the training of young men to become proficient so that they can defend this nation,'</p>
   <p>"Well-chosen, patriotic words indeed: Become proficient so that they can defend this nation.' Not the kind of proficiency that enables them to shoot at defenseless women and children, or to raise a red flag in a republic in the <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>cause of a fantastic Utopia which advocates, first of all, the destruction of the existing order without producing something better; not the proficiency which lets one forget that we are a free people who can change conditions, at will through the power of the ballot. The words of the Alliance's constitution surely do not refer to the blind fury which regards the weapons of the marksman as tools with which to commit murder. The words I quoted mean that our organization develops true riflemen, capable defenders who respect the law and the authorities elected by the ballot, men who will use their rifles when the nation is actually endangered, when liberty is at stake, just as they fought in the Civil War when the existence of the Republic was threatened--the Republic which, regardless of its shortcomings, is still the freest land on earth.</p>
   <p>"And now, my friends, just a few words about matters which are of greatest interest to the rifleman--hunting of game. If I, in my enthusiasm as a marksman and a hunter, speak somewhat at length, I feel sure you will understand.</p>
   <p>"More than thirty years ago, when I was still a youngster, I hunted in the <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>primeval forests of the West. Those were the days. At that time the country was a hunter's paradise. The dream of the Indians, their conception of the 'happy hunting grounds' in the hereafter, could hardly exceed the actual conditions which prevailed in America years ago. The forests and plains had a most bountiful supply of game of all kinds, and, at that time, I spent fully two years carrying either a shotgun or rifle. Mental attainments did not attract me much during that period. Since that time, I have been a staunch adherent of St. Hubertus, and no business cares could persuade me to stay away from a hunting trip. I love nature--rain or shine.</p>
   <p>"Other people seeking relaxation from the daily grind may go to fashionable bathing places and wear dress suits; I, however, am attracted by nature. I find recreation in the shade of the forest, on the flower-covered prairie, on the bank of a river; gun in hand, a dog trotting by my side--and that animal shows more intelligence than many a man wearing kid gloves. The out-of-doors is a delight to me for which the artifices of the world can offer no substitute.</p>
   <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>
   <p>"Another thing I learned as I hunted in the woods and on the plains, at a time when the work of man had brought neither culture nor destruction to the environment. I found that man is never nearer to the mysterious creative forces of the universe, the divine cosmic spirit, than when he is alone, surrounded only by nature with its impressive magnificence. I realize that a person of true religious sentiment cannot find a better temple than the dark, primeval forest, or the rolling plains with their myriads of flowers-- plains untouched by the plow--or the crystal-clear lake with its pine-covered shore, waters which never were roiled by a ship. And so I shall have the same attitude until my final hour; I'll always be a hunter, for I have had that enthusiasm for unsullied nature since I was a child.</p>
   <p>"And when the time comes--as it does for all of us--when our body is less elastic, when it is a serious effort to climb a fence, and even the highest rubber boots cannot give protection against rheumatism, when we cannot truly judge the flight of birds any more nor recognize a wild duck from a mud hen at thirty paces, and a meadow lark appears to be quail--when that period <a name="p22" class="page-break">22</a>approaches, then I shall find consolation in oiling up my old shotgun occasionally, and the trusty weapon will become an emblem, a remembrance of experiences during the years when I was still blessed with the strength of exuberant youth.</p>
   <p>"And now, my friends, since I have given you a true insight into my past, I hope you will realize that the committee has not given you a "Sunday hunter" as speaker. You will therefore believe me when I did you welcome and earnestly hope that you will be blessed, to your last days, with the gifts most prized by marksmen and hunters: vigor, health, unerring aim, and a steady hand."</p>
   <p>Mr. Juessen's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause. At the end of his address many of the marksmen went to the rifle range, whose fourteen targets had been mounted. The men shot until dark.</p>
   <a name="p23" class="page-break">23</a>
   <p>A special target range was provided for the ladies. Crossbows were used. Patronage was considerable. The children's playgrounds had swings of various kinds. The bowling alleys drew a good crowd. There were also stands where balls and rings were thrown, knives of all kinds being the prizes. Wine and beer were, of course, available. The Great Western Light Guard Band played popular melodies, and the people enjoyed themselves thoroughly.</p>
   <p>Every marksmen's club provided a prize, as shown in the following list:</p>
   <p>Value (sic)</p>
   <p>Chicago Schuetzenverein ........................ $125.00</p>

   <p>First Prizes</p>
   <p>Martin Grau, master marksman of the Chicago Schuetzenverein, made the first one hundred bull's eyes, and received the silver festival medal and the medal of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>William Hayes of the Manhattan Rifle Club, New York, received the second silver medal; he shot one hundred bull's eyes after Mr. Grau had completed his score.</p>
   <a name="p26" class="page-break">26</a>
   <p>Both marksmen were led through the park, with the band playing, and upon reaching the president's stand were greeted with a few appropriate remarks, and then given their prizes. The marksmen gave speeches expressing their thanks.</p>
   <p>Various Items</p>
   <p>William Boehmer of the Chicago Schuetzenverein shot the first leaf from the revolving target.</p>
   <p>Nicholas Gerber of Monroe, Wisconsin, shot the second leaf from the same target.</p>
   <p>Today, and throughout the entire week, trains will leave Canal and Clinton Streets at 8:40 A.M. and 10 A.M; return trip from Schuetzenpark at 7:20 P.M. The round trip costs only fifty cents.</p>
   <a name="p27" class="page-break">27</a>
   <p>In addition to concerts, given by Nietzschke's orchestra, various attractions are offered on the festival grounds: bowling for prizes, shooting with crossbows, merry-go-rounds, ring-pitching games, and so on. The park is well provided with natural scenic beauty, and during the festival period all--rich and poor, small and large--can enjoy the very best entertainment.</p>
