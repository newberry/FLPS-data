   <p>Yesterday, at the Bismarck Hotel, the German-American Dental College held its closing festivities under the leadership of Dr.Mueller. Dr.Huxmann, deacon of the institute gave the address which was received with much acclaim. In his speech he mentioned amongst other items, the proposed changes in the exterior of the school. As is generally known on the 1st of May it will occupy its new premises at 758-762 N.Park Ave. which for the present, gives sufficient room for 100 students. The College building contains: waiting room for patients of the clinic and the contiguous clinic which is large enough to accomodate 16 operating chairs; a technical laboratory with 5 large double windows, where 40 students may work at one time, and there is enough space for the erection of the necessary apparatus, baking ovens, rolling mill, presses, etc.; a bacteriological laboratory, an auditorium with a minimum of 100 seats; places for the Professors etc. In an adjoining building the students have their living rooms and on the second floor is a restaurant. 15-20 Collegians may live there, and, aside from the healthy location of these quarters, they have the advantage of being very reasonable in price. The ground area permits the enlarging of school and living rooms, when required. For the rest said the speaker, the institute will <span class="page-break">\2</span>guard its traditional and excellent reputation. Diplomas, first and second prizes were then awarded to the students in their respective fields, theory, operation, technicians. From the list of names appended, all who graduated had German names.</p>
