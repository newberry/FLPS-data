   <p>The lively interest in the Ueberbrettlabend ["over-the-little-board-evening," a sort of vaudeville performance, but more in the nature of a farce. In Germany this form of entertainment is usually given in the open, especially in beer gardens. Trans.] which is being planned by the German Press Club for February 22, presages a large attendance. The great success of a similar venture, given several years ago, is still well remembered and the committee in charge assures us that the present program will eclipse the previous one. Aside from the farce "A Little hour in the Editorial Department," there will be a lecture by Professor X Reh (X Dear, the ruminant) entitled "My excavations in the Garden of Eden." Other attractions will be "Modernized Historic Greek Dances," a trio; "Hu is Hu" in the Press Club [Huhu, the call of the owl, often alluded to in literature and specifically, in poetry. Transl.]; living pictures, "Scenes from Paradise" [Living pictures in this sense usually <span class="page-break">2</span>refers to pantomine, not movies]; and several first-class musical, vocal, and dramatic offerings. Almost all presentations are the work of local journalists, and have not been produced previously; in fact, there are good prospects that these literary creations will furnish excellent material for a future challenge to the Hastern newspaper writers' clubs. The Ueberbrettlabend has been scheduled for Washington's birthday. The two upper halls in the Bismark Hotel have been procured for the occasion. Personal friends of members will be admitted free.</p>
