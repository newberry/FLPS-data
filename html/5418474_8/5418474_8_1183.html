   <p>The Illinois Turn District submitted three resolutions to the proper personalities and authorities taking a decisive attitude to a number of important questions of the day.</p>
   <p>In the two first resolutions, they are protesting against the curtailing of education, against an attempted reduction of teachers' salaries, against over-crowding of schoolrooms and in general against the ever greater usurpation of power by the authorities, especially of the city schools by self-appointed citizens, committees, and similar organizations.</p>
   <p>The third resolution recommends Mr. Ernst J. Kruetgen for the important position of Chicago's postmaster.</p>
