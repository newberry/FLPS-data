   <p>In the Nov. 11th issue of Leslie's Weekly we find a verse written by an American writer, Miss Minna Irving, which was translated for our paper by Mrs. M. Sakowski, relating to the hardships of Poland, the result of war; it reads as follows:</p>
   <p>A Plea For Poland</p>
   <p>The snow that over Poland lies</p>
   <p>Is darkly stained with red.</p>
   <p>The winds that over Poland sighs</p>
   <p>Brings broken cries for bread.</p>
   <p>Where Paderewski's music rose</p>
   <p>And our Kosciuszko fell</p>
   <p>Are beggars waiting in the snow</p>
   <p>A piteous tale to tell.</p>
   <p>Her homes are ground to dust beneath</p>
   <p>The conqueror's iron heel.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The wolf of famine bares his teeth</p>
   <p>Beside the naked steel;</p>
   <p>She cradles on her wasted breast</p>
   <p>A babe too weak to feed.</p>
   <p>Arise! Empire of the West,</p>
   <p>And help her in her need.</p>
   <p>The love of Freedom in the blood</p>
   <p>Of Poland every runs,</p>
   <p>And links her o'er the briny flood</p>
   <p>To freedom's favored sons.</p>
   <p>So from the plenty we command,</p>
   <p>O, let us now display</p>
   <p>The spirit of the open hand</p>
   <p>And smooth her troubled way.</p>
