   <p>Of recent days, on the northwest side of Chicago, a new Polish financial institution has been established. The founders are persons who daily come across problems that require immediate assistance, but these honest people have no other form of security than their good character.</p>

   <p>This new financial institution is called the "Chicago Industrial Finance Corporation." The offices of this company will be found in the Milwaukee Avenue neighborhood, Division and Ashland Avenue.
