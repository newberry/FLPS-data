   <p>More than a hundred volunteers left yesterday to swell the ranks of the Polish Army. Recruiting is steadily increasing, for our boys have seen their duty to Poland and are enlisting in the Polish Army in ever-increasing numbers, knowing that the Polish Army must be made as large as possible.</p>
   <p>The Polish Army is necessary not alone as a fighting force; it must also show that we are banding together in defense of our homeland. When the war is ended, it will take over our Poland, torn from the grasp of the Prussians. The Polish Army has great political significance, for the greater that army becomes, the more will we show the world that we love freedom, that we want Poland to be independent, that we want to perpetuate democracy throughout the whole world, and that we join with the Allies in crushing German militarism, which in itself will bring peace to the entire world.</p>
   <p>Thus, it is the sacred duty of every Pole to enlist in the ranks of the Polish <span class="page-break">\2</span>Army, an autonomous army fighting under Polish command, under the White Eagle, in the defense of Poland. Although it is at present fighting in France, the Polish Army will move on into Poland after the Germans have been finally defeated, in order to be on hand, should the necessity arise, to protect Poland against the Prussian hordes. So, do not delay! Do not wait until tomorrow, but support this able army by enlisting now, for soon it may be too late to enlist as a volunteer: You will be drafted! Do not wait for the draft but enlist now as volunteers, as good, patriotic Poles.</p>
   <p>The volunteers from the communities under the jurisdiction of the Polish Army Recruiting Center II began to gather in front of the Center very early in the morning. From other parts of the city, volunteers arrived accompanied by their recruiting sergeants. After the roll was called and after other formalities were taken care of, a parade was formed with the St. Hedwig Parish citizens committee at its head. The parade marched to St. Hedwig's Parish, where a farewell program had been arranged for the departing volunteers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Upon arrival at St. Hedwig's Church, where the Reverend John Obyrtacz is pastor, solemn High Mass was celebrated. The Reverend P. Solczak officiated, assisted by the Reverends T. Szypkowski as deacon and B. Cieslak as subdeacon. Father Obyrtacz delivered the sermon, bidding farewell to the recruits and giving them his wholehearted blessing that they march to victory and win the independence of Poland.</p>
   <p>After the ceremony in church, a parade through the streets of St. Hedwig's Parish was staged to whet appetites for the dinner the women of the parish had prepared. The parade ended at the parish hall, where the tables were already amply laden with food. Father Obyrtacz, the local pastor, saw to it that the recruits and guests were all seated to everyone's comfort. Despite the fact that it was a fast day [Friday], the dinner was a splendid one. Nothing was lacking, and the recruits could eat as much as they wished. In addition, they were given food to eat on the train, as well as cigarettes and cigars.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>At the conclusion of the dinner, Father Obyrtacz delivered the first address. He spoke earnestly, predicting a quick victory and speedy recovery of Poland from under the German iron heel. His address was followed by the singing of several beautiful Polish national anthems by the parish school children, who then danced a Krakowiak [Cracovian dance]. It must be admitted that the able Sisters, whose task it is to educate these children, are really working to keep awake the Polish spirit in their charges.</p>
   <p>After the songs and the dance, Father Obyrtacz introduced Lieutenant Jurkowski, of the Polish army in Russia under General Dowbor-Masnicki. The lieutenant has been in America for several weeks on a mission of great importance to the Poles. He was greeted enthusiastically by the gathering, and in return, he expressed his thanks, bidding the volunteers farewell and wishing them success. At the same time, he greeted them as soldiers.</p>
   <p>Father Obyrtacz then called upon two volunteers, John Dziobek and Sebastian Pelc, <span class="page-break">\5</span>members of Group 1776, Polish National Alliance, and presented each with a wrist watch on behalf of their Alliance group. Group 1776 should serve as an example to others. It has given proof that it recognizes the patriotism of its members by offering keepsakes. Volunteer Dziobek expressed thanks for the gift on his own and his friend's behalf. He then presented Volunteer Anthony Rapacz with a White Eagle signet ring, offered by his sister.</p>
   <p>The speakers who followed included N. L. Piotrowski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; Mrs. V. Jozwiakowski; Leon Nowak, secretary of the Central Citizens Committee; T. Blachowski; and John Przyprawa, inspector for the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the volunteers expressed, by rising,their thanks to Father Obyrtacz, to the local citizens committee, and to the women who prepared the dinner. The gathering then sang "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland].</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Before the volunteers left the hall, Inspector Przyprawa disposed of the remaining formalities with them and turned them over to Lieutenant Szwalkiewicz, an officer from the training camp. It should be mentioned here that the music during the dinner was supplied by the Kipkowski Brothers orchestra.</p>
   <p>After leaving the hall, the volunteers posed for a photograph in front of St. Hedwig's Church, the well-known Rozanski brothers, whose photographic establishment is located on Milwaukee Avenue, taking the picture. They then boarded streetcars, and, upon reaching the Loop, formed a parade that marched through the downtown streets to the railroad station. During the parade as well as at the station, our volunteers were thunderously applauded. Americans, regularly seeing our parades to the railroad station, are convinced that the Poles are energetically pursuing the fight for the common cause.</p>
   <p>At the station, there was, as usual, much weeping during the farewells that <span class="page-break">\7</span>lasted until the train started. The music of the Kipkowski Brothers orchestra played steadily to drown out the laments of mothers, sisters, and fiancee's. Each soldier was given cigarettes and other necessities....before he boarded the train.</p>
   <p>To the music of the orchestra and amid the cheers of the crowd for the Polish Army, the train pulled out, carrying those faithful sons of Poland to the training camp, where they will receive their first training. Soon they will be sent to France to swell the ranks of the constantly growing Polish Army.</p>
