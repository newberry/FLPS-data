   <p>A recruiting rally was held for the Polish army yesterday evening at the St. Hedwig Parish Hall, at which there gathered almost fifteen hundred people, both men and women. The hall presented a very striking picture, decorated as it was with Polish and American colors; the more striking in that it was filled to capacity with Polish people--those people upon whom our poets and great leaders rested the future of Poland.</p>
   <p>Before the rally opened, the St. Hedwig Band, under the direction of Boleslaus Tesmer, played several musical numbers, for which it received enthusiastic and well-deserved applause.</p>
   <p>It was eight o'clock in the evening when the pastor of the parish, the Reverend John Obyrtacz, opened the rally with a short prayer for the success of this meeting and for the success of the Polish army. He then expressed his pleasure at seeing so large a gathering in the hall, saying that he took this as a very <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>hopeful sign; namely, that the people are concerned with this sacred cause, the cause which is dear to the heart of every Pole--the cause of Polish independence. The Reverend Obyrtacz went on to explain that this rally was called at the request of the Polish army commission, and arranged by the local citizens' committee, which is to aid the commission in recruiting work to the best of its ability.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Obyrtacz then read the names of those citizens who comprise the committee. The committee consists of fifteen persons, as follows:</p>
   <p>The Reverend John Obyrtacz, president; Theophilus Jablonski, first vice-president; John Sakwinski, second vice-president; Ignace Wroblewski, recording secretary; Michael Adamczyk, financial secretary; Francis Poklacki, treasurer; J. Janusz, advisor; Florian Polasik, advisor; A. Orlof, advisor; Anthony Zielinski, advisor; Matthew Jurewicz, treasurer; S. Pruszynski, treasurer; Stanislaus Iwanski, treasurer; Joseph Jilka, treasurer; and Andrew Mikrut, vicepresident.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>All of these citizens are not only to assist the recruiting officer, but are to collect contributions for the Polish army, so that the members of St. Hedwig's Parish can say with pride that they, too, worked for the cause so dear to us all, and that they did not do less than others.</p>
   <p>The recruiting station in St. Hedwig's Parish is located at 2131 North Hoyne Avenue and the duties of recruiting officer have been entrusted to Lieutenant Miller, who so ably performed his task as recruiting officer in Town of Lake.</p>
   <p>Father Obyrtacz expressed a certain disappointment that his parish had been forgotten until this time, for had the recruiting started here when it started in other parishes, who knows but that by now, the members of St. Hedwig's Parish would be able to say with pride that their community supplied a considerable number of volunteers to the Polish. army?</p>
   <p>After this address, which was often interrupted by applause, Father Obyrtacz named as secretary Ignace Wroblewski, secretary-general of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>

   <p>The program, though arranged hurriedly, was a beautiful one. It opened with the rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" by the St. Hedwig Band, while the audience rose to sing this beautiful anthem. The second number on the program was a group recitation by the school children. In all, there were three recitations by three groups of children, each consisting of three boys and three girls. This performance left nothing to be desired, and the audience was not sparing with its applause.</p>
   <p>The parish choir, directed by the local organist, Emil Wiedeman, who has been with the parish for twenty-eight years, then sang "Song of My Country" and, as an encore, "When on the Shores of our Homeland". The public was generous in its applause for both of these numbers.</p>
   <p>The chairman then presented the representatives of the Polish army to the audience; namely, Lieutenant A. Wolski, chief recruiting officer for the Chicago area; W. Rozycki, organizer of the Polish army for the State of Illinois; Alexis Miller, recruiting sergeant, formerly stationed in Town of Lake; and <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Sigmund Wisniewski, a veteran of the Spanish-American War, who had hastened to enlist at the first news that a Polish army was being organized. The audience greeted these representatives with bursts of applause. The Reverend Obyrtacz assured the officers that his parish would not only supply soldiers to the Polish army, but would furnish a beautiful standard as well. This statement was greeted by a storm of applause, as was the assurance that the priests of the parish would lend every effort in order that the greatest possible number of men would enlist in the Polish army, and if words do not bring the necessary results, would organize all the women in the parish to send their husbands, brothers, and fiances to the war.</p>
   <p>The band then played "Z Dymem Pozarow" (With the Smoke of the Conflagration), the audience standing.</p>
   <p>During the whole course of the rally, the Polish flag was held on the platform by S. Balinski, recruiting sergeant from Station 3, Bridgeport. The inscription on the flag, "Free, united, and independent Poland," kept the audience in mind <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of the purpose of the meeting and of our duties in regard to our homeland, oppressed and in slavery for more than a hundred years.</p>
   <p>Before Lieutenant A. Wolski delivered his address, Father Obyrtacz spoke again, jokingly saying that the first recruit from St. Hedwig's Parish to enlist this evening in the Polish army will be so well equipped for the war that he will lack nothing for the next two years.</p>
   <p>Wolski then spoke of camp life among the Polish soldiers, their enthusiasm, ability, heroism, and willingness to sacrifice. The speaker was thunderously applauded.</p>
   <p>The next number on the program was a recitation, delivered beautifully and with feeling by Miss Valerie Poklacki, well known to the public from previous appearances,....followed by two beautiful Polish songs sung by the parish choir.....</p>
   <p>A fiery and patriotic speech was then delivered by W. F. Rozycki, representative <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>of the Polish army. Greeted by sustained applause, he first read the words to Paderewski's battle hymn, upon which he based an hour-long speech that brought tears to many eyes. He presented such a vivid, terrifying picture of the ruin in Poland and of the awful misery, that the audience listened to the entire speech with bated breath. When this brilliant address was over, it seemed there would be no end to the applause.</p>
   <p>The parish band next played a few numbers while a collection was taken up for the Polish army. The collection netted $153.85.</p>
   <p>The recruiting, however, was unsuccessful; for despite the fiery speeches and the encouragement of Father Obyrtacz, only one young Pole enlisted, Bernard Niemczewski by name. There is hope, however, that recruiting in this parish will bring good results; for the Citizens' Committee and the pastor have promised to break all records set by other parishes in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The rally ended shortly before eleven o'clock with the singing of the [Polish] national anthem "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
