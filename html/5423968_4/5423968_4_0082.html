   <p>Politics is the worst kind of two-edged weapon. Every politician, big or small, states, and sometimes even believes, that he works for the good of all humanity, his country, nation, city and even for his own community. Sometimes, a politician will admit that he actually works--for the good of his party, his class or his own interests. In such cases, however, he will not fail to add that on him depends the good of the whole nation, and even humanity. In the false pretensions of such politicians there is a very strong tendency to justify that old saying, "The end justifies the means". Some of these men, big and small, will try to persuade the people to believe that their object of going into politics is for the good of humanity or of the nation. He will say: "How can I be bound by such trifles as, the life of the individual, the right of ownership of this or that group of society or any other idealistic nonsense."</p>
   <p>Such men will sink deeper and deeper into the bog of corrupt means, which, in his eyes were intended to serve a good purpose, but in reality he harms not only himself, but also his whole nation. Such a man, if strong enough, might lower the morality of all humanity. Lowering of this standard causes a great harm to all of us, and especially to those in whose favor it was lowered.</p>
