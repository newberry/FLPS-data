   <p>Recently, Polish dentists have formed the Polish Dentist's Association, for the purpose of more effectively cultivating the science of dentistry.</p>
   <p>The newly formed association received from the Secretary of State the Certificate of Incorporation, in which the following appear as incorporators: Dr. K. B. Zielinski, Dr. W. Z. Rybstadt, and Dr. W. A. Gorny.</p>
   <p>The Poles are proving anew that they are capable, and can form their own professional societies which will enable them to work profitably and independent of other nationalities, in mutual cooperation, for the benefit of the numerous Polish residents in Chicago. We have not as yet formed a Polish Editors and Literary Association.</p>
