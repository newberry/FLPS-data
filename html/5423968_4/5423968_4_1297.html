   <p>On Saturday, November 25, about one hundred people gathered in the Warsaw restaurant ball, at 779 Milwaukee Avenue, to hear reports from Mr. Lubienski, S. F. A. Satalecki, and Majewski about their trip to Nebraska for the purpose of choosing an appropriate spot for colonization purposes.</p>
   <p>Mr. Henry Lubienski presided and Mr. K. Sawicki was secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lubienski discussed at length the various projects submitted to the delegates for Polish colonization purposes. In a fertile locality in eastern Nebraska close to a railroad track and only two stations away from an existing sugar factory, a syndicate of citizens of this county has offered 2,800 acres near the city for a factory, with the stipulation that the factory must be completed in 1895. Additional land was reserved to increase acreage, that is, to be planted in sugar beets. We cannot divulge the name of this locality because we want to be sure that we will be able to buy this additional acreage at fifteen to twenty dollars an acre. The delegates made a formal agreement that they would take the chance of locating additional capital with which to build a sugar factory, providing a sufficient number of farmers would assure a greater crop of beets. At present they offer each one forty acres on terms of payment at the rate of twenty dollars per acre of beets for six years.</p>
   <p>Possession may be had March 1, and as soon as a sufficient number volunteer, a committee of these future farmers will travel to the spot to convince themselves of conditions and to make proper plans for settling down.</p>
   <p>Mr. Satalecki and Mr. Michael Majewski confirmed the statements made by Mr. Lubienski and, describing their impressions, said they were certain that our colonists would find it worth while and profitable in this new industrial and farming business.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Ignacy Machnikowski said the future company should help the Polish colonists to build their own homes and to get properly settled on the free and purchased lands.</p>
   <p>Messrs. K. Sawicki and Jablowski insisted that the free lands be given in proportion to the number of acres purchased by those actually farming.</p>
   <p>Mr. Broel disagreed with them, stating that the free land was granted providing a factory was built, and not to the colonists directly, who can, if they wish, become stockholders in the factory. Receiving 2,800 free acres will help in the purchase by cash of a larger acreage for sugar beets.</p>
   <p>The payments for the land of five dollars per ton of beets are very reasonable. At least one hundred and fifty families should visit the chosen spot. Planting beets on only one fourth of the farm, or on ten acres, they could easily earn six hundred dollars, and after paying one hundred fifty dollars annually in payment for the land, they still would have four hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
   <p>Mr. Panek mentioned that the colonists ought to be protected so that they could make their payments in cash and not with beets, in case the factory was not built or was closed.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Gerzkiewicz, Ciesielski, and Lacki explained that from their own experience they know that planting of sugar beets near a factory, and using the waste from the beets as food for their own cattle, is of considerable help to the farmer and enriches him quickly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lubienski then closed the meeting by advising future colonists to sign up with Mr. Michael Majewski at once. Details of the agreement with the colonists will be announced in the press.</p>
