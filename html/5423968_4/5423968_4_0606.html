   <p>The United States, our beloved and dear, even if only adopted fatherland, is in danger. Most any day will come the call: To Arms! Most any day will come a summons, to place on the altar of that Free and Great Republic, that what is dearest to us - our property and life. In the name of the oppressed nations, in the name of people's rights, so terribly abused, and against one of the worst, eternal enemies, against Germany! Great moments are passing, the Starry Standard calls, the army of Kosciuszko is already organizing.</p>
   <p>Poles, let us be ready!!! In the name of sacred watchwords, in the name of our oppressed Fatherland, for our liberty and that of oppressed nations, there falls to us a part in an honorable struggle.</p>
   <p>Let us be prepared! Polish wanderer, emigrant, Polish youth and you beloved rustic Polish man, you descendant of Kosciuszko, who fought for the liberty of two worlds, be ready!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Be prepared!!! Get in position and train - the Starry Standard calls, behind which, yonder in the distance, is the White Eagle!</p>
