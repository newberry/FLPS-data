   <p>Sunday, September 13, at Julius Slowacki Hall, 48th and Paulina Streets in the district called Town of Lake, a nationalistic mass meeting was arranged by Commune 39 of the Polish National Alliance. Not as many people attended as were expected, because of the matters to be discussed.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened shortly before 3 P. M. owing to the fact that many societies had scheduled their own meetings for that day.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the meeting was Mr. Stanley Jankowski, the secretary, Mr. Edward Bradel. Mr. Jankowski, having opened the meeting, explained the reason for calling it and declared that, in view of the events taking place in Europe, this is not the time for deliberations over the way we should conduct ourselves, but the time for action, the time for bringing aid to our brothers. A million of them are now fighting, not for the Polish cause, but for a foreign cause. He then introduced Mr. Casimir <span class="page-break">\2</span>Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, as the first speaker.</p>
   <p>The speaker mentioned the bloody drama of Sarajevo, emphasizing the fact that at that time no one expected the incident to become the cause of a European war. No one supposed that in three months the most horrible drama of humanity would be taking place on Polish soil. Outlining the picture of the indescribable poverty of our unfortunates in the homeland, he called upon the assemblage to hurry to the aid of these unfortunate people, to open their hearts and pockets to them.</p>
   <p>He next asked the question, whom should we Poles join, and asserted that we should not join any of our enemies, because they have perpetrated never-to-be-forgotten wrongs against our nation. With the appeal "bread for the poor, hungry countrymen," Mr. Zychlinski ended his speech.</p>
   <p>Mr. John F. Smulski, president of the Polish Bank, delivered the next <span class="page-break">\3</span>address. The speaker said at the outset that, judging by the number of people gathered, it was doubtful whether all Poles understood the importance of the times: if all had understood, the Hall would have been crowded. "The events now taking place on Polish soil," said the speaker, "should make us consider whether we Poles can enter into an armed conflict with our enemies." The speaker concluded that in the present circumstances the Polish nation could not even dream of entering into an armed conflict. He recalled that for the past 150 years it has been said that whenever a European war should break out, Poland could regain her independence. He continued, saying the time has come; since we cannot fight independently we should join one of the belligerents, Russia, on whose side the entire civilized world stands--England, France and Belgium; these countries will demand that Russia keep the promises she has given to the Poles.</p>
   <p>Finally, the speaker turned to the members of the Alliance, urging them not to lose confidence in this the greatest Polish organization, the <span class="page-break">\4</span>Polish National Alliance, which has already done a great deal of good here for us immigrants. The assemblage listened attentively to Mr. J. F. Smulski's speech and rewarded him with frequent applause.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Smulski's address, three ladies took up a collection, which yielded $37.89. This sum will be sent to the Department of Independence of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The third and last address was delivered by Mr. John Przyprawa, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy. At the outset, he mentioned the great Polish demonstration at the last mass meeting of the Falcons in Buffalo. He mentioned the speech of Mr. Glynn, Governor of the state of New York, who said to a crowd of several thousand Poles that Poland must be free. Then with sadness he mentioned that relatively so few people had come to yesterday's mass meeting. He observed that the Poles in that district have a relatively large church, and are building an expensive new one, but for Poland's <span class="page-break">\5</span>cause, for the cause of reconstructing the homeland, they do not contribute. In his speech he mentioned the present unfortunate creation of Polish legions in Galicia and the impossibility of Austria's being victorious. However, he affirmed that through this action we shall be recognized as combatants and Poland, therefore, will be granted an appropriate place at the future congress.</p>
   <p>For us remaining in a foreign land, a country which preserves neutrality in the present conflict, the speaker pointed out two duties: namely, to unite and be trained in the ranks of the Falcons and to contribute money to the cause of freeing Poland.</p>
   <p>After the address, Secretary E. Bradel read the following resolution, which was unanimously accepted.</p>
   <p>Resolution</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Whereas, In the present European conflict the fates of monarchs are being weighed and bloody battles are being fought on Polish soil--soil to which our nation has the first right of ownership--and the present war will undoubtedly change the map of Europe;</p>
   <p>Whereas, The present war is the result of Prussian intrigue, which pushed Austria into a war with the Slavs;</p>
   <p>Whereas, A Prussian victory would bring about even greater persecutions of our brothers living under Prussian domination; while the victory of the Slavs, France, and England would bring about the unity of our homeland, now torn into three parts, and would unite our nation for further battle for its rights and for the freedom and independence of Poland;</p>
   <p>Whereas, We Poles living in the free land of Washington under the Star-Spangled Banner are in heart and soul with our brothers in the homeland; we feel with them the terrible predicament of our country, which in the <span class="page-break">\7</span>present conflict is sacrificing her bravest sons for the cause of her enemies; and more than a million Poles are serving in enemy armies against their will and many are killed each day for the greater glory of our enemies; therefore</p>
   <p>We Poles, men and women of the District of Town of Lake, gathered together this thirteenth day of August, 1894. [Translator's note: This is the date given but the author must mean September 13, 1914.], at Julius Slowacki Hall, resolve and declare to the entire world including the countries now at war:</p>
   <p>1. That not for a moment will our nation of 25,000,000 relinquish its right to Polish lands or to the freedom of its nation.</p>
   <p>2. That we condemn the military system with which the Prussians rule because it has forced other countries to arm in order to defend their borders against Prussian rapacity and to end the audacity of the Prussians, who declared war against almost the entire world, confident of their own military strength.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>3. That we wish, with all our hearts, success and great victory to those countries which have taken up the sword against the brutal Prussian in order to humble him.</p>
   <p>4. That we express our sincere sympathy to our brothers in the homeland, who are most affected by this bloody war.</p>
   <p>5. That we solemnly swear to support the Independence Fund to the best of our ability and strength.</p>
   <p>Long live the Slavs and France, England, and Belgium! Long live free and independent Poland!</p>
   <p>After passing the resolution and singing the national anthem, "God Save Poland," the chairman adjourned the mass meeting and the Falcons present at the gathering sang "Sleepy and Lazy."</p>
