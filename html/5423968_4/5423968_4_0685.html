   <p>Last week was marked as a week of disaster and ruin for speculators in the New York Stock Exchange who sought quick and easy wealth without work. It was only a sample, however, a preview of the catastrophe that may come any day, bringing financial ruin to a great many people.</p>
   <p>The prospect of peace, resulting from the German proposals and intensified by President Wilson's enigmatical note, precipitated an unusual and dangerous decline of prices in the stock market. To American speculators, peace means the end of war profits, the stoppage of the flow of gold, that manna of which only crumbs fall to the masses, while a favored few gather in almost everything. Peace also means financial ruin to stock market speculators, who form a numerous group here in America.</p>
   <p>A swift drop in stock quotations began then, because there was a prospect of <span class="page-break">2</span>peace in the offing. And when Secretary of State Lansing began to interpret Wilson's note as a war threat, the possibility of American entrance into the World War arose again. Still greater confusion reigned on the Stock Exchange, and the drop in stock prices was still more sudden.</p>
   <p>The first explanation by Lansing of Wilson's note was understood to mean that Wilson, in his note, warned that the danger of war seriously menaced the United States. Whoever speculated in stocks sold his shares at any price. On the following day, a new explanation from Lansing steadied the stock market again, and speculators hoping to recoup their losses of the day before, tried frantically to buy back the shares they had sold at a loss. The resulting confusion on the Exchange was such as had not been seen for a long time. There were no blacker days for speculators since the Lusitania disaster.</p>
   <p>It is a curious and striking circumstance that the stock market is thrown into a panic both at the prospect of peace and at the prospect of war. In either case, the speculators are guided by blind instincts of self-preservation; they do not <span class="page-break">3</span>stop to consider the most probable consequences[of their actions]. In such cases, the natural instincts for speculation, their ability to link cause and effect deludes these people, and no amount of experience, no matter how recent, helps them.</p>
   <p>At the present time, the American stock market is steady again, and the possibility of American entrance into the war is less and less discussed. But, nevertheless, the above-mentioned incidents bring to light the unwholesome conditions existing in American stock markets. During the past few years, as the European war has drawn itself out, these conditions have become proportionately worse. War industry has grown and prospered, crushing beneath its abnormal growth the legitimate industry upon which our economic life is founded--the industry that satisfies a society's peacetime needs, primarily internal needs.</p>
   <p>The war profits of financial and industrial speculators cannot even in the smallest measure make up for the enormous economic losses suffered at the <span class="page-break">4</span>present time by the whole mass of American society. Our American economic situation would be a great deal healthier if the United States were actually engaged in the war on one side or the other. At least the return to normal conditions on conclusion of the war would be less painful.</p>
   <p>As things now stand, peace in Europe will mean economic disaster for the United States. It will be, however, an inescapable evil, something in the nature of an unpleasant, difficult, but very necessary operation.</p>
