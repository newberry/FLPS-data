   <p>During the last few weeks, the Polish clergy of Chicago, the citizens, and numerous members of Polish parishes have shown a great political maturity on the one hand and a real sense of duty to Poland on the other. The idea was that the heart of American Polonia--Chicago--should begin a great new movement, the one hope of the Polish cause: a general Polish national tax levy, collected regularly every month not only by all organizations but in all parishes. Chicago has fulfilled this task and a regular monthly tax is flowing in from forty Polish parishes in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact, which has given new luster to the Polish name, that we have become one of the Allies, as was confirmed before the whole world at Versailles on June 3 by the Allied High Command in an act signed by the <span class="page-break">2</span>premiers of the Allied nations setting forth that one of the conditions for peace is the creation of a free, independent, and united Poland with an outlet to the sea. The Allies were compelled to make this declaration by the Polish Army in France, which today is already on the battle front. Thus we have accomplished the cardinal purpose of our co-operation with the Allies.</p>
   <p>It is still a long way, however, to the end of the war and to the coming peace conference. The Germans, unable to save themselves by force of arms, will use every means at their disposal to take away land from Poland by treachery, by discrediting the Polish cause with the Allies so that the latter will support Poland only partially. The Germans know how to persevere, and in cases such as this they will spare no effort; they will mobilize all of their writers, diplomats, and historians to prove to the world that the Polish demands are unjust and that they are burdensome, costly, and of no benefit to the Allies.</p>
   <p>The closer the Germans come to final defeat on the field of battle, the greater <span class="page-break">3</span>will be their Machiavellian campaign against the Poles. People are only human. If there is a mass of proof, arguments, and conclusions on one side, while there is complete silence on the other--if the lies and misinterpretations are not disproved by fact--then even those most favorably disposed toward our cause will weaken and will agree to a partial settlement of our demands, which will signify defeat for us and victory for the Germans.</p>
   <p>We must answer the German campaign with a campaign of our own, conducted through the newspapers of all of the Allied countries. We must organize a strong influence in diplomatic circles, so that we will have agents and defenders every where. We must continue to build our Polish Army, so that in case of Allied intervention in Russia, we can send a million men there. We must act both in Eastern and Western Europe, we must attack the German strongholds, while here in the United States we must support the movement the leader of which is the great President Wilson himself.</p>
   <p>In order to do this, we need money, a great amount of money. We need money not <span class="page-break">4</span>for just one or two years but for many years, in order to keep victory in our hands. The Allies will help us support the Polish Army in the field, but they will not give us money for political activity. For this we must have a steady supply from among ourselves, and we can only secure this supply by paying a regular, general national tax.</p>
