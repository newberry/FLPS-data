   <p>A large meeting, attended by more than three hundred Polish women, was held yesterday in the St. Joseph Parish Hall for the purpose of organizing to carry aid to Polish soldiers and thus help them achieve victory on the field of battle.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Milasiewicz was chairman of the gathering and Mrs. Kowalewski secretary. The speakers were Reverends L. Grudzinski and Cholewinski, and Mrs. M. Sakowski.</p>
   <p>After considerable discussion, the women decided to create the "Polish Women's Red Cross Society" for the Polish Army. The Reverend Grudzinski promised to send five women, at his own expense, to the American Red Cross to learn how to make bandages.</p>
   <p>A collection, taken up in the hall, netted forty dollars. This money will be used to purchase wool, of which the women will immediately begin to make warm sweaters, gloves, and socks for the soldiers of the Polish Army.</p>
   
   <p>The officers elected to head the newly organized society are as follows: Mrs. Milasiewicz, president; Mrs. E. Kowalewski, secretary; and Mrs. Wlodarski, treasurer. The press committee consists of Mesdames M. Szymanski, J. Skwarczynski, and M. Lopacinski.</p>
