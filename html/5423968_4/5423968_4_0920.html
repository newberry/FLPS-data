   <p>Despite great difficulties in gaining entrance, a Dziennik Zwiazkowy reporter visited the Chicago Juvenile Detention Home on Gilpin Street yesterday, with the purpose of investigating conditions and determining whether the unsavory rumors that have been circulating are true. He was given permission to visit all the rooms and departments in which the children are kept.</p>
   <p>Rumors of scandalously poor conditions in the Detention Home that have been circulated continuously in recent times, as well as rumors that there are a great many Polish children detained at the institution who are not receiving the proper care, caused Dziennik Zwiazkowy, which always stands ready to guard the interests of the Polish people, to send its representative to investigate the matter at first hand, and to share the results of his investigation with the readers of this paper.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Gaining entrance to the Detention Home was not exactly a simple matter, for its superintendent, Mrs. June Curchiel, objects on principle to any visitors, especially representatives of the press, to this sole Children's home of its kind in the city of Chicago, and so all kinds of means had to be adopted in order to enter.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Juvenile Detention Home is located near Halsted and Polk Streets, in a part of the city inhabited mostly by Greeks, Italians, Negroes, and a few other nationalities. It can be distinguished from afar because of its dominating appearance. The three-story red brick building cannot fail to be noticed by passers-by.</p>
   <p>"Upon entrance into a small vestibule, I noticed the iron bars all around me. Even the door to the office of the superintendent, Mrs. Guild, [sic] is nothing more than an iron grillwork, opened by pushing an electric switch.</p>
   <p>"Mrs. Guild gives the impression of being an old maid. When I told her the <span class="page-break">3</span>object of my visit, she received me courteously and agreed to give me the information I desired, and to conduct me through the building.</p>
   <p>"'To begin with,' she said, 'the account published in the Herald and Examiner is basically false. The reporter was here only a few minutes and did not have time to go through the building.'</p>
   <p>"Mrs. Guild answered my questions with more or less willingness.</p>
   <p>"'We always have plenty of children here,' she said. 'The actual number changes often. At present, we have 118, but there have been days when we had 140 and more children.'</p>
   <p>"'I would like to know something about the Polish children here,' said I, 'for it is they who concern me most. How many of them are there here, what are their ages, and what are their offenses?'</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"'I do not know exactly how many Polish children we have. From previous experience, however, I know that a third of the children here are Polish. We have children here who are two years old and younger, and we have seventeen-year-olds. The children here are divided into two groups--those who have been arrested by the police for various offenses, often criminal, and those who are here through the fault of their parents. The parents may be separated, or suing for divorce, or are in some way misconducting themselves so that the law deems it proper to place their children in our custody. Their stay here may be anywhere from two hours or less to two months.'</p>
   <p>"Upon instruction from the superintendent, the 'housekeeper,' Mrs. W. Celuir, a woman of enormous proportions, and about fifty years old....conducted me through the building. I was taken through the dormitories, the washrooms, the dining halls, the kitchen, the gymnasium, the chapel--everywhere, with the exception of the ward set aside for children ill with contagious diseases. The building is divided into two sections, one for boys and one for girls.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Each of these is again divided, segregating the children who are guilty of misconduct from those who have been deprived of parental care. These latter as I noticed, have more freedom than the others, and can gather in larger groups to play together, and thus pass the time more pleasantly.</p>
   <p>"In one section I noticed a larger group of children, all under the age of twelve. Boys and girls sat together, listening to a teacher who talked to them in English. As we approached, the teacher stopped talking to her group and joined us. The children, who rarely see any visitors, stared at me with curiosity. After a while, they gathered around me so that I was able to observe their sad, pale faces, red-eyed, evidently, from crying.</p>
   <p>"It was a pitiful sight. There on the outside, it is spring. Everything breathes new life, everything is joyful. On the streets and in the parks other children are playing. They are happy and fortunate, knowing that loving parents await them at home. How different here in the Detention Home! Here the children are prisoners, forced to remain in small rooms for whole <span class="page-break">6</span>days on end with nothing but bare walls to look at.</p>
   <p>"'Which of you understand Polish?' I asked. Four boys and two girls stepped out of the group.</p>
   <p>"'Do you like it here?' I asked further. 'Do you like this place? Are you happy?' At these words, the children sadly lowered their heads, and in voices that told of long suffering, they answered: 'No! No! No! We do not like this place, we are unhappy here. We don't want to stay here any longer!'</p>
   <p>"Visiting the section where the older children are kept, those who have been arrested for criminal offenses, is not exactly a pleasant experience. You see scowling faces, faces that have lost all traces of the finer instincts. At the sight of visitors, the faces of these youthful offenders take on an expression that seems to say, 'What did you come here for?' The girls lower their heads and hide in corners, not daring to look into a person's eyes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>They feel their degradation keenly.</p>
   <p>"It would be difficult to describe everything to be seen there. It would be difficult to describe the unpleasant impression that involuntarily arises in one's mind.</p>
   <p>"Despite the cleanliness of the establishment, there is something repellent about it. The sight of the youthful prisoners, carefully guarded and surrounded by iron bars, fills one with dread.</p>
   <p>"Those who have criticized the Detention Home are right in many respects. The place should be used to accommodate not more than eighty children. Accommodation of more than eighty makes the sanitary conditions positively dangerous. Children who are ill come in contact with healthy children, often using the same equipment and utensils, as a result of which the state of health at the institution is low. This last, as a matter of fact, was confirmed by medical men.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>"There is no adequate accommodation for children ill with contagious diseases. The isolation ward on the third floor contains nothing but bare walls. It is easy to imagine what torture a child must suffer, lying there for whole days with no toys to play with, nothing to occupy his time.</p>
   <p>"According to Superintendent Guild's statement, a third of the children are Polish, placed there principally because of lack of parental care. But what sort of care is given these Polish children? Is there anyone there who can speak to them in Polish? There is no one! Polish children who do not understand English are, really unfortunate there. No one understands them and they understand nobody. The teacher talks in English and a majority of the children speak English, while our children wander about almost as if deaf and dumb. Can this be called care? The Polish citizens of Chicago ought to demand that a special section be set apart for Polish children at the Detention Home, and Polish teachers and nurses placed in charge of it."</p>
   <p>Countrymen! Do not tolerate conditions that will permit your children to <span class="page-break">9</span>forget their Polish language at various "charitable" institutions. Fight for your rights, and whenever the occasion to speak arises, do so as a large group, harmonious and capable.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Juvenile Detention Home needs a great many fundamental changes and improvements. One such change, indispensable to us Poles, is the provision of proper care for Polish children.</p>
