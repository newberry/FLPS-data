   <p>Adalbert J. Danisch was born in Chicago in 1879. He received his elementary education in St. Adalbert's parish; later he attended St. Ignatius College. His first employment after finishing his schooling was that of post-office clerk. He held this job for nine years, later serving in the water bureau, in the city hall. Some time later Mr. Brady, the State auditor, appointed him auditor of building and loan associations, a position which he held only a short time, resigning to assume the management of a badge and emblem shop which had been under the direction of his mother-in-law since the death of her husband. In 1917 he bought this business of his mother-in-law, Mrs. Slominska, which he conducted to the present time with great success.</p>

   <p>Several years ago Mr. Danisch was a candidate for the State legislature but was defeated.</p>
   <p>Mr. Danisch is widely known for his efficient work on behalf of the Polish community. He is president of the Citizens' Committee and of the local branch of the Polish National Committee in St. Wenceslaus' parish. He is a member of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish National Alliance, the Knights of Columbus, and, of many other social, political, and patriotic organizations. His greatest interest is in the education and the success of the younger generation of Polish descent, the hope of the Polish community, He never misses an opportunity to encourage our young people to pursue higher studies because, as he says, only through education can Poles attain to the position which is now held by the Irish and the Germans. His services as secretary of the Students' Aid Society are well known, and they are the best evidence of his zealous endeavors to uplift the Polish Catholic youth.</p>
