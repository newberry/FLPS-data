   <p>We should not deceive ourselves in thinking that the war will be over soon, as many people wish and hope.</p>
   <p>The end of this war, the fire of which is spreading farther and farther, can come only when the enemy of humanity lies vanquished at the feet of the victorious champions of right and civilization.</p>
   <p>But we have a long and tedious road to travel before this time comes. Therefore, we should not delude ourselves, but prepare in advance for the war to continue for quite some time. We have just heard that the most competent men in England have warned the people that many more sacrifices and efforts will be necessary before the power of the Teutons is completely crushed.</p>
   <p>We should view the situation objectively and understand it thoroughly in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>order to overcome all obstacles and be able to apply all our means and efforts to whatever requirements we may be called upon to face.</p>
   <p>The power of the Teutons is still great. Germany still has three dissolute partners--Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria--and the sympathy and support, more or less open, of some small neutral countries, where the influence of all sorts of little princes, issuing from the German harem of rulers, runs rampant.</p>
   <p>Germany still constitutes a solid block, strong in the number of military units and in the organization of industry for military purposes. Germany still produces about one and a half million tons of steel per month--enough to make millions of bullets and explosives for many cannons, machine guns, aerial bombs, and torpedoes. Germany still has several million soldiers at her disposal, and the mobilization of the civilian population, which was carried through before time in order to keep the war work running smoothly, has given her millions of men and women for farm work, coal and iron mines, railroads, and inland waterways.</p>

   <p>We are convinced that despite the loud echoes of the Russian revolution, Pan-Germanism still stands squarely behind the Hohenzollern dynasty, behind its degenerate Kaiser, behind its Hindenburgs, Ludendorffs, Mackensens, and other members of this military gang.</p>
   <p>Germany still represents a powerful military machine mounted rather securely in the very heart of Europe and, perhaps, even the world. And a machine such as this cannot be so easily destroyed in the next few months.</p>
   <p>Besides, this war is completely different from all previous wars. Formerly only the armies fought in open fields. Now whole nations, which constitute two completely different and hostile worlds, are fighting. Armed and unarmed nations are fighting or are being drawn into this war. Neutrality is becoming daily more and more of an illusion. And all this by its very nature must extend the war both as to time and area. The war is lengthening and spreading.</p>
   <p>Today the United States, provoked by the submarine campaign, has raised its <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>punitive mailed fist against Germany. New gold, new blood, and new genius will strengthen the assets of those who vowed a sacred alliance for the destruction of German barbarism.</p>
   <p>At any rate, the entry of the United States into the Great War constitutes a guarantee of victory for the cause of the Allies and will bring punishment to the guilty parties and freedom and justice to all.</p>
   <p>With the entry of the United States into the conflict, the character of the war becomes clear and its aims gain the desired strength.</p>
   <p>First of all, we must joyfully welcome the fact that the United States has finally tossed the musty Monroe Doctrine to the four winds. Breaking once and for all his isolationism in politics and in the humanitarian solidarity of civilization, Uncle Sam has proclaimed himself, through the mouth of President Wilson, a free and equal citizen of the world.</p>
   <p>It was high time that this were done!</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The United States was born a century and a half ago out of a revolution, out of a great upheaval of human consciences. It became a democratic nation, a nation whose people, free and equal before the law, found material and moral welfare through autonomy. Now when a number of equally democratic European nations are struggling against barbarism and slavery and in defense of the ideals of justice, peace and independence, united action for self-preservation and self-defense on the part of both the United States and Europe is imperative.</p>
   <p>The one hundred million people of America have risen against German imperialism, against the militarism of the Prussian Hohenzollerns, against the international fraud of German social democracy. Uncle Sam has thrown on the scales the weight of his titanic war supplies, his army and fleet, his commerce and industry, his bread and gold.</p>
   <p>In this duel between humanity and barbarism, the Polish arms, too, must resound, and they must resound at the decisive moment. Therefore, it is well that the Poles in the United States be able to preserve their strength, that they be <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>able to conserve their energy, so that the decisive moment may not find them exhausted or weary, for the time is now at hand when we will be able to make our greatest sacrifice for our cause most effectively.</p>
