   <p>The Fifty-first Congress of the United States ended its session last week. It lasted two years, during which time it passed many laws that will undoubtedly bring a great benefit to the country, and also some harm. However, we must admit that most of the laws which have been passed are beneficial to the Nation, and on that account Congress deserves much credit.</p>
   <p>The first session lasted ten months; it began in December 1889 and ended in October 1890. The second session was shorter, from Dec. 1, 1890, to Mar. 4, 1891.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it is too late now to give a detailed account of the activities of this National Council, but since the public is greatly interested in its activities, we will discuss some of the most important laws enacted during the first session.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>One of these laws is the McKinley Act, or Protective Tariff Bill, which calls for a high duty on goods imported from other countries. The purpose of this Bill, according to the Republicans, is to protect our trade and to help the development of our industry. According to the Democrats, the purpose of the Bill is to enable the rich industrialists to raise the prices of all commodities at the expense of the poor consumers and the working class. This Bill, however, contains a very practical clause, because it authorizes our Government to make reciprocal trade agreements with other countries in respect to certain tariff concessions.</p>
   <p>This Congress has also passed the Sherman Act, which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to buy silver bullion to the amount of 4,500,000 ounces a month (not an insensible Bill), the Anti-trust Bill and the Lottery Bill. A resolution to move the Meteorological Bureau from the War Department to the Department of Agriculture was passed. Congress also agreed to accept the territories of Wyoming and Idaho into the Union as new states. Finally it passed a Bill authorizing a Chicago Columbian Exposition in 1893, and another raising the veterans' pensions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>These are the most important Bills and they were passed during the first session of Congress, and are now in force.</p>
   <p>The second session, though short, also passed many good measures.</p>
   <p>During this session Congress debated on the Silver Bill, the Election Bill, and the Nicaragua Canal Bill, but fortunately these bills were rejected.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the bills passed are of great importance because they constitute new laws, we will devote a few words to each one of them.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Mar. 9, 1891.</p>
   <p>The country has been divided into nine voting districts, according to the census of 1890. This is a logical division, provided the census is correct, and Congress deserves credit for that.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Another measure is directed to lessen the work of the Supreme Court. This measure provides for nine Circuit Courts, each consisting of several states, and each allotted to one of the nine justices of the Supreme Court. This will create a new position for a Circuit Court judge in every circuit. These judges will be appointed for their whole lives by the President. If Mr. Harrison desires to be just, he should appoint not only Republicans, but men of ability. In the future the Circuit Court will be next in rank to the United States Supreme Court, and will constitute the nine Courts of Appeal. These courts will handle patent, murder, tariff, and marine cases. This is a good measure for which Congress deserves much praise.</p>
   <p>Uncle Sam will have his own penal institutions. There will be three of them in different parts of the country. This is necessary and practical.</p>
   <p>The new Immigration Measure cannot be considered blind nationalism. The famous proposal of Mr. Oates has been rejected in Congress by a majority vote.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Only criminals, the insane and real paupers will not be admitted. Even those immigrants who cannot pay for their passage will be allowed to come if they are able to work and not bound by a contract. The new immigration law specifies very clearly that the paragraph referring to contract labor does not include clergymen, artists, physicians, professors, lawyers, and so forth.</p>
   <p>The Cattle Inspection Regulation forbids shipments of diseased cattle into foreign countries. This eliminates the pretext of foreign countries for not buying American cattle, and if the prohibition of such shipments will not be discontinued, the President has a right to retaliate by adopting similar measures.</p>
   <p>Another legislative act provides a subvention for mail steamboats.</p>
   <p>Although the foregoing measures deserve praise and credit, there are others that do not. To the latter belongs the unheard of extravagance of the last Congress at the budget session.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>On account of this extravagance, a large deficit was created in the Federal Treasury, which had been in a fine condition so far.</p>
   <p>It was not necessary to enact a measure providing for the return to the States of Civil War taxes amounting to $16,000,000. This proposition had already been passed by both Houses during Cleveland's administration, but he vetoed it in spite of the fact that there was a surplus in the treasury.</p>
   <p>A copyright measure was also enacted which forbids reprinting of works in which the author has reserved the right of reprinting in America. This measure is of no benefit to authors because it also forbids the importation of such works and states that if the author desires to sell his works in America, he must publish them here on American paper and by American printers; in other words, he must publish them as if they were original.</p>
