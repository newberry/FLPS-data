   <p>Recently there has sprung up a strong movement, not only in labor circles, but also in employer and Government circles, toward the granting of pensions to workers who have served well and who have reached a certain specified age, in order to assure them a peaceful old age, so that after long years of hard work for society they will not be beggars.</p>
   <p>Each side, hoever, views the problem of pensioning laborers from a different angle. The Government, through the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. MacVeagh, proposes only the pensioning of clerks working in Government offices, and says noting about the other employees of the Government outside the offices. This makes it appear, as if the office clerks were made of finer clay than the workers in the arsenals, mints, shipyards, and other places where labor is utilized by the Government.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The Government, if it really is seriously concerned about the welfare of laborers, and wants to set n example, should pension all Government employees, without exception. Soldiers and sailors who have never even smelled gunpowder in battle receive pensions; pensions are granted to all sorts of Government officials and dignitaries; therefore, pensions should also be grnted to the ordinary laborers, who are the foundation of every society.</p>
   <p>The question of pensioning Government employees will come up for discussion at the next session of Congress, and is to be introduced by Secretary of the Treasury MacVeagh. Therefore, you workers, especially those of you who are organized, and you middle-class citizens who live on good terms with the laborers, should begin beforehand to influence and to urge your congressmen to pass a law stipulating that every Government employee, without exception, must be pensioned with he reaches a certain age.</p>
   <p>Seing how strong the movement is to assure a peaceful old age to the deserving veterans of the hammer and sickle, large railroad, packing, and mining companies, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>etc., are introducing pension systems into their plants in various ways. The system, however, is always purely capitalistic, because three to five per cent is deducted from the workers' earnings to establish a pension fund. Besides this, the specified age at which the laborer is to stop working and receive his pension is simply ridiculous.</p>
   <p>Some of these railroad companies, such as the Rock Island and the Burlington, establish sixty-five to seventy years as the age after which the employee has the right to a pension, if he has worked continuously for twenty or even twenty-five years for the company in question. At the same time, the employee does not receive a pension equal to his salary, but only half, or even less, of that amount.</p>
   <p>As we can see, this is no great favor on the part of the "very generous" employers; it is not they who are paying the deserving veteran laborers a pension. It is the co-workers of the laborers, the younger ones, who are taxed for the purpose. The laborers themselves would know how to establish and to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>operate a fund of this sort, without favors from anybody, and they might even devise simpler requirements for payment of the pension.</p>
   <p>The large packing house of Armour and Company, in Chicago, has introduced a better pension system for its workers. The first donated a million dollars as a start, and pensions will be paid workers when they have reached the age of fifty-seven and have worked continuously for this firm for twenty years. Women workers will be pensioned when they have reached the age of fifty years. Nevertheless, this company, too, deducts three per cent from every worker's pay to keep up the pension fund.</p>
   <p>Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, an organization of about two million workers, who is trying to introduce the pension system which is use din England, demands that the employer contribute two-thirds of the fund and the laborers one-third. He asserts, justifiably that the employers make tremendous profits from the hard work of the laborer, and actualy exploit <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>him; therefore, let them, in a manner, return to the worker some of the fruits of his hard labor. Gompers declares further, not without reason, that paying workers a pension only after they have reached the age of sixty-five or seventy is unfair, because only a very small percentage of workers attain that age, and those who do attain it will not enjoy their pensions very long. A laborer born out with hard physical labor becomes unfit for strenuous work by the time he has reached the age of fifty; besides, a person who has worked hard for society for thirty-five years deserves a rest, and should cede his place to a younger and stronger person.</p>
   <p>The injustice on the part of the employers, which Gompers brings to our attention, is illustrated by the fact that the companies which have adopted the pension system refuse to hire laborers who have reached the age of forty, even though they are strong and healthy. The railroad companies will not hire men over thirty-five, which is villanous, because one cannot sentence a laborer of this age to poverty and death from starvation. This will be the issue between labor and capital, and we trust that organized laborers will know how to defend their rights and will not suffer their fellow workers to be mistreated.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The matter of adopting a pension in the entire country is widely discussed among labor groups, and sooner or later this project must become an actuality. Organized labor will surely look after its business in Washington, and see to it that no injustice is perpetrated against Government employees in any branch of service.</p>
