   <p>St. Casimir's Parish held a great celebration yesterday on the occasion of the consecration and unfurling of two service flags, Polish and American. The entire community was decorated for the occasion, and almost every house on the streets through which the parade was scheduled to pass was decorated with Polish and American flags. Both of the service flags that were consecrated by the pastor of the parish, Reverend Wojciech [Albert] Furman, are very beautifully made, especially the Polish flag, which is a masterpiece and is undoubtedly the first of its kind in this country.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the prearranged program, members of local societies and the Citizens Committee began to meet in front of St. Casimir's Church, 22nd and Whipple Streets, at about two-thirty in the afternoon, and formed ranks for the parade. Despite the terrific heat, Whipple Street between 22nd and 23rd Streets <span class="page-break">\2</span>was so crowded at three o'clock that it was almost impossible to pass through. The marshal of the parade, Joseph Hojnacki, recruiting officer for St. Casimir's Parish, did much to form the parade; he was assisted by the local [parish] Citizens Committee.</p>
   <p>Promptly at three-thirty, the order to march was given, and the parade moved forward in the following order: A troop of mounted police; a drum and bugle corps of veterans of the Spanish-American War; a company of soldiers of the regular American Army, consisting of eighty regulars and a quartermaster's corps under Sergeant Edward Major; and the Polish and American flags. Behind the flags marched the figures of "Uncle Sam" and "Liberty," portrayed by W. Cichon and Miss Helen Herman, following whom five young women dressed in American costumes carried an American service flag containing 521 stars, signifying that St. Casimir's Parish has given 521 young men to the American Army. Close behind the service flag there marched about a hundred mothers and fathers of soldiers.</p>

   <p>Then came the orchestra, followed by a uniformed company from Circuit II of the Polish Falcons' Alliance, at the head of which were John Rybicki, president, and W. Lubicz, vice-president. Following the Falcons came our able Polish nurses, with E. Misiewicz, of the Central Citizens Committee, and five young women in Polish costumes carrying the beautiful Polish service flag, upon which were 104 Polish eagles, signifying that St. Casimir's Parish has given 104 young men, now either in training or in France, to the Polish Army. Following the Polish service flag marched the Polish Army officers John Przyprawa, S. Krzywonos, J. Kostecki, and B. Zub, and the recruiting sergeants Wlosinski, Zbroniec, Kuzminski, Hojnacki, and Deplewski, followed by a considerable group of new Polish Army volunteers, who will leave tomorrow for the training camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake in Canada. Following the volunteers came about forty members of the Citizens Committees from St. Casimir's Parish and Brighton Park, and the representatives of the press, followed by an orchestra conducted by E. Rendak. The following local societies brought up the rear: the White <span class="page-break">\4</span>Eagle Dramatic Society, with its own service flag containing fourteen stars; St. Isidore Oracz Society, Group 406, P.N.A. (Polish National Alliannce); St. Stanislaus Society, Group 747, P.R.C.U.

   <p>Starting in front of St. Casimir's Church, the procession moved down Whipple to <span class="page-break">\5</span>22nd Street, then to Sacramento, to 25th Street, to Albany Avenue, to 26th Street, to Kedzie, down Kedzie to 22nd Street, then to Albany, to 24th Street, to Whipple, and back to the Church, where a triumphal arch had been erected, upon which waved the flags of all the Allied nations. Beside it, a speakers' platform had been set up.</p>
   <p>In Front of the Church</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the parade, the people gathered in front of the Church around the speakers' platform that had been built for the occasion. First of all, the Reverend Furman, pastor of St. Casimir's Church, performed the ceremony of consecration of the service flags, with the assistance of the Reverends L. Sychowski and J. Zelezinski. The American service flag, as mentioned before, contains 521 stars, while the Polish flag has 104 eagles. At the conclusion of this ceremony, and after the singing of Polish and American national anthems, <span class="page-break">\6</span>the flags were unfurled on a specially built arch, upon which waved the flags of all of the Allied nations fighting for the world's cause.</p>
   <p>Leon Sliwa, president of the local Citizens Committee, then opened the program with a short address, after which he called, as the first speaker, S. Krzywonos, organizer for the Polish Army. The speaker thanked the company of soldiers of the American Army for their participation in so significant a celebration. The next speaker was Mr. Skaags, well-known friend of the Poles, who has written several books about Poles. He is familiar not only with the history of Poland, but with the history of all nations. In addition, he is an excellent speaker. He based his statements upon facts, proving conclusively that Germany must be defeated. Since he is, as we mentioned above, an authoritative historian and a friend of the Poles, he gave Poland full credit for its sacrifices, not only at present, but at all times, and not only for its own people, but for the people of all oppressed nations. Several times he referred to the bravery of <span class="page-break">\7</span>Kosciuszko and Pulaski, who fought for the freedom of the United States. He spoke also of the patriotism and loyalty of the Poles in this country, who, he said, are the most capable citizens in the United States. It is a great pity that we cannot give his address in its entirety.</p>
   <p>Just as Mr. Skaags finished his address, a terrific wind arose and rain started coming down in torrents. Everyone took shelter wherever he could to avoid getting wet. As the rain continued, it was decided to resume the program in the old church, where the recruiting station for St. Casimir's Parish is located. The hall was filled to capacity with those who wanted to hear the rest of the program. According to the prearranged program, Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, was scheduled as the next speaker, and so Chairman Sliwa called upon him to make the first speech in the hall.</p>
   <p>Address by Zychlinski in Summary</p>
   <p>"I am sorry that I was not here to address you at the unfurling of the flags.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>When the Huns took our women and children and placed them in labor camps; when they called to their aid not only the Austrians and Bulgars, but the Turks as well, to permit these hordes to destroy our country while their own bestial soldiers ravished our women and murdered our children, we did not believe that we would ever be in a position to avenge all our wrongs: we thought that Poland was lost. But fortunately, things turned out differently.</p>
   <p>"America entered this World War and immediately declared that Poland must be free and united. The other Allied nations followed America's example, making the same declaration. Then came the time when France permitted the formation of a Polish Army, which is now fighting. Poles from all over the world have enlisted and are continuing to enlist in this army, but the greatest enlistment is from America. Thousands of these American Poles are now in the Polish Army, and more thousands are to be found in Uncle Sam's army. Daily we see the American Army casualty lists in the newspapers, and always there are many Polish <span class="page-break">\9</span>names included, which proves that there are many Poles on the battle front. But this is not yet the end; many more will go, for it takes a great many soldiers to destroy the Huns.</p>
   <p>"France, Italy, England, and Belgium are exhausted after years of war, but America still has many young men who are impatient to go forth to crush the Germans. Today, Poland is one of the Allies, and, like other nations, we have our own government in Paris. We had the honor, not long ago, of entertaining Dr. M. Seyda, a member of that government, the so-called Polish National Committee.</p>
   <p>"Hail to your community for those who you have sent to fight in a sacred cause! And when they have given the Germans the final blow, they will march on to Berlin, and from there to the Wawel, to Poznan, and to the capital of Poland, Warsaw, there to plant the banner with the White Eagle!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Other Addresses</p>
   <p>The next speaker was the Reverend John Mard, priest-patriot of Whiting, Indiana.</p>
   <p>[Address by the Reverend Mard, omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The last speaker was John Rybicki, president of Circuit II, Polish Falcons' Alliance of America, following which Chairman Sliwa, president of the local Citizens Committee, thanked the gathering for its participation, and the guests and speakers for coming.</p>

   <p>vice-president.</p>
   <p>With the conclusion of the program at the parish hall, the representatives of the organizations, the recruiting officers, the nurses, the representatives of the press, and other invited guests proceeded to Rafinski's Hall, 23rd and Whipple Streets, where the local Citizens Committee, under the leadership of the Reverend A. Furman, had arranged a banquet. The food was prepared by wives of the members of the Citizens' Committee.</p>
