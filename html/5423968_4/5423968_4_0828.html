   <p>May God not reproach us for this, but Poles were born politicians. Were every Pole allowed to govern according to his ideas, and to fabricate his own political theories, we would have at least twenty-five million governments and twenty-five million systems of government, with as many countries, monarchies, and republics.</p>
   <p>Every Pole is capable of compounding his own individual plan for the redemption of the homeland, and every editor is capable of at least twelve such plans, depending on the month in which the idea of conjuring political combinations comes to him.</p>
   <p>This is no longer a fault but a curse that hovers over our community.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>At times so terribly important as the present, at times of general mental concentration, every now and then some "wise" man appears on the scene, who, having grabbed the political spoon, stirs up the vat of national harmony and unity.</p>
   <p>A shining example of this sort of political stirring up, brought actually to the point of insolence, is the fact that the Poles who wish the Germans' defeat are called Moscowphiles.</p>
   <p>Let us ignore the fact that the Prussian and Muscovite are made up of the same clay, only painted a different color; let us ignore the historical fact that the Muscovite kills the Polish body and the Prussian the Polish soul; in a word, let us ignore all leanings to one or the other side, because, first, we do not have any leanings and, second, a dispute of this sort is utterly worthless. But we do want to consider coldly the accusation of Moscowphiles.</p>
   <p>Since this accusation can also be applied to us, because we desire the destruction <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of the Germans with all our heart and soul, we must look at it under the prism of the present political situation and ordinary common sense.</p>
   <p>What do politics tell us? This, that in this war two worlds will be opposed: the Slavic and the Germanic, or the world of the always oppressed against the world of the always oppressing.</p>
   <p>Let us forget that the Muscovites are also Slavs, and let us ask ourselves who should be closer to us Poles, us Slavs: a Slav or a German. Who should be closer to us--the descendants of those who fought under the flag of Jagiello or Witold or the descendents of the Grand Masters and leaders of the Teutonic Knights of the Cross?</p>
   <p>An uneducated peasant would answer this: Certainly, the Slav is closer, though the czar is a devil. But this one or that under the sign of Don Quixote, this or that gentleman editor of daily lies, gossip, and false accusations, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>will execute a deep bow before the German bruiser and will wish all the Frenchmen, Belgians, Serbs, and Russians eternal annihilation.</p>
   <p>We have the same answer to this question as our peasant has, because we see in the defeat of the Germans the defeat of our everlasting oppressors, the defeat of monarchism and, by the same token, the defeat of Russian czarism, which, although it will emerge victorious from the war with the Germans, will be weakened and will pave the way toward revolution!</p>
   <p>All sorts of would-be politicians can call this by the name of "Moscowphilism" or something even worse, but it will not in the least turn us towards the side of the Germans, the worst and the most dangerous enemies of the Polish name.</p>
   <p>It seems that those who in the years of 1905 and 1906 took part in the revolution of the Kingdom of Poland and faced death for the Polish as well as the Russian masses are most prone to use the name of Moscowphile.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Truly, they have a short memory, or else the American sky has dimmed their power of reasoning.</p>
   <p>What right have they and their imitators to call those who wish the Russian masses victory Moscowphiles, when they themselves fought for the benefit of these same masses.</p>
   <p>The present is not concerned with the czar. We do not wish the czar victory, but we wish victory to the Russian people, who, just as we, are threatened by the German hydra.</p>
   <p>Since fate has ordained that we have mutual interests with the Russian muzhiks [peasants], then let us not condemn those who wish these interests success, who wish the Germans annihilation.</p>
   <p>The present war is being conducted by the Germans against the rest of the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>European countries. In their blindness they are even apt to call out the powers of Mars to do bloody battle.</p>
   <p>If Russia wins, then the division of the conquered territory will not depend solely on her, but on England, France, Italy, and all the allied countries, and so Russia will be under control.</p>
   <p>If, on the other hand, the Germans win, no one will control them. They themselves will dictate the conditions which their German audacity and fury dictate to them.</p>
   <p>Then these considerations also speak for our wishing the Slavs victory in this war.</p>
   <p>The Poles, as the nation having the highest culture among the Slavs, will not perish in the black, dark sea, but on the contrary, will stand in evidence.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>And after all, who will prevent us from taking up arms against weak Russia, bowed by the terrible war, when after the war, the time for revolution and socic-national disturbances comes?</p>
   <p>We personally believe that after the Germans are crushed Poland will arise through diplomatic means as a neutral country, dividing the German sphere from the Russian.</p>
   <p>Who of you would not agree to this? Perhaps only he who stirs up the waters for his own personal gains, who looks for black on white, who is the enemy of harmony and singleness of purpose.</p>
   <p>Continue to call the enemies of Germanism Moscowphiles, earn the honorable title of Germanophile, but do not disturb the waters, because now we need harmony, because now we need money for the future battle, the future fight of the unfortunate nation with postwar hunger and poverty.</p>
