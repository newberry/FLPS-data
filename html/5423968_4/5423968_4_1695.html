   <p>It is certain that a great many of our countrymen do not know that there is a large Polish store selling medical instruments and orthopedic apparatus in Chicago. This establishment is further proof that Polish business in Chicago has been developing in recent years in every field, and that its future is good.</p>
   <p>If the reader has ever walked down Milwaukee Avenue near Robey Street, he will have noticed the large building at the address 1562, with a sign on the door reading, "A. Dziadul and Company." Perhaps to has seen the display of medical and orthopedic apparatus in the window. It is a Polish store, and it is our purpose to devote some space in today's issue to acquaint our readers with it.</p>
   <p>Our reporter called yesterday at the above-mentioned store, where A. Dziadul gave him the necessary information, and where he saw the instruments and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>apparatus manufactured by Dziadul.</p>
   <p>It should be mentioned here that Dziadul has always been an active worker in nationalistic affairs, and especially as a member of the Polish Falcons' Alliance, serving for some time as secretary-general of that organization. Our countrymen will probably remember him from a number of Falcon and Polish National Alliance conventions, for he was also a member of the board of directors of the Polish National Alliance. Whenever it was necessary to carry aid to the hungry and unfortunate, Dziadul was always among the first to contribute. At present, Dziadul works in the store, aided by his two sons.</p>
   <p>A. Dziadul and Company is the only establishment of its kind on the Northwest side of the city. It has no competition, therefore, and is developing splendidly.</p>
   <p>According to the information supplied by Dziadul, the firm was established in 1902. After many experiences which we will not take space to describe, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>it assured itself of its existence by selling good material at the lowest possible prices. Employed in the shop are Dziadul's two sons, two women to serve feminine clientele, a bookkeeper, and a boy.</p>
   <p>The first thing one notices upon entering the store is its exemplary neatness and order. There is a long row of glass showcases on each side, in which one sees orthopedic apparatus of every description....much of which could be identified and described only by a specialist. In back of the store is the shop in which the above-mentioned articles are made. Several people are employed there. At the sides are two rooms, one for men and one for women, in which measurements are taken and necessary examinations made. Next to one of these rooms is the office of the bookkeeper and stenographer. As far as the reporter could see, the books are kept in exemplary order according to the latest system of accounting.</p>
   <p>"And how's your store in the matter of customers?" asked our reporter. "Do you get much support from the Polish people?"</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"I cannot complain," answered Dziadul, "although I must admit that if not for the support of others than Poles, my store could not exist. I do not know why, but the majority of Polish physicians do not support me, while physicians of other nationalities, including Germans and Jews, are steady customers. Did you know that over six hundred non-Polish physicians scattered all over the city trade here regularly, and send us all their patients, while a great many Polish physicians patronize Jewish-owned establishments downtown? The same can be said of hospitals. Non-Polish hospitals buy their equipment here, but unfortunately, the same cannot be said of our Polish hospital. I cannot remember that the Polish hospital [St. Mary's] has ever given us an order. In general, however, we are satisfied with our Polish trade, and it is with pleasure that we see it increase with each month.</p>
   <p>"Business is good, which fact I owe first of all to my own hard work and my experience in this field. I have been engaged in this kind of work for many years, and I would not trade my experience for the experience of anyone <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>else in the business."</p>
   <p>Dziadul then described the financial condition of the firm. Its monthly turnover amounts to two thousand dollars, while the estimated value of the establishment exceeds ten thousand. It should be added here that the store is growing each year.</p>
   <p>Much could yet be said about A. Dziadul and Company, but lack of space forces us to limit our remarks. Dziadul himself will give further information to anyone who desires it.</p>
   <p>Polish physicians, druggists, and midwives who are supported solely by Polish people and who advertise, "Patronize your own countrymen," ought to support this enterprise and recommend it to their patients. If they do not do this, how can they hold it against Poles who do not support them?</p>
