   <p>The United States has made erroneous and unwise steps on several occasions ever since the very beginning of the present conflict in Europe. Such conduct is, in fact, very dangerous. Some of the diplomatic statements contain traces of a partisan and self-centered kind of politics, betraying lack of knowledge of world conditions. Some, again, seem to imply that America can dictate to the whole world and guide its politics. All this indicates that Americans are good businessmen but provincial politicians, unable to grasp the broader political horizons. Our efforts finally terminate in a fiasca because the foreign powers pay no attention to all our threatening notes and protests.</p>
   <p>Moreover, in recent times the strong influence of the local Germans upon the American Government can be distinguished. This may have unpleasant repercussions in the future relationships between America and Europe. It is a known fact that wherever Germans settle, they become a detriment to their environment, exploiting it for the benefit of their fatherland, even though their attitude redounds to the detriment of the country that which has hospitably received them. Congressman Berchtold of Missouri has declared that all American Germans, even to the third generation of immigrants, will fight for the preservation of their fatherland. That would be very well if they wanted to go to Europe to fight and could manage somehow to arrive there. But evidently they want to fight on American soil, exposing the United States to harm.</p>
   <p>All their former efforts to inveigle the United States into the conflict by exploding Canadian bridges and torpedoing or sinking with bombs English and French steamers in American ports have availed them nothing. They are now making strenuous efforts, using (one should say abusing) their whole influence upon the politics of this Government to maneuver the United States into an unpleasant position with respect to the allied nations. This they hope to accomplish by the use of diplomatic notes.</p>
   <p>When the European war burst out, our politicians called it savagery. The only conclusion that they drew from it was that it was possible to make great profits out of this barbarism. The prices of foodstuffs have been raised to impossible proportions, regardless of unemployment and the hard times. And so began the process of business promotion and exploitation at the expense of our own citizens and of barbarian Europe, which was compelled to pay any price without so much as a murmur of complaint. However, not all Europe was fortunate enough to buy food for its weight in gold from the American speculators. The Germans and the Austrians were deprived of this boon. England calculated that to crush the military power of Germany, which is its aim in the war, it is necessary to employ something more than armed force. The dispersion and annihilation of a German army well provided with food and ammunition would require many years of war and great loss of life, not to mention the destruction of nations. England has therefore decided to make use of the supremacy of the Anglo-French navy over that of Germany and to block importation into Germany. Every other nation would do the same if it had so powerful a trump in its hand, and such procedure is sanctioned by international law.</p>
   <p>This step taken by England has created a strong impression upon Germany. The first feeling of depression has been transformed into uncontrollable rage. As a result of this the Germans began a piratical warfare with their submarines, not sparing the ships even of neutral nations. They hoped that by so doing they would cause the neutral nations to protest against England and so to abandon the plan of blockading Germany.</p>
   <p>Events, nevertheless, have taken a different turn. England received these practical attacks calmly, since the Germans had previously attempted them. Then, again, the sinking of a few small ships could not harm England very much. In reply to such tactics England intends to blockade the German ports as tightly as possible and to carry out this plan to the very limit, even if she be compelled to employ the same tactics of warfare which are now used by the Germans, that is, the use of treacherous floating mines, spread by submarines along the enemy's shores. The neutral nations, however, which dread the very thought of the victory of aggressive Germany for fear of losing their own identity, have sent their protests not to England but to Berlin.</p>
   <p>The United States alone cannot understand the situation and protests with childish stubborness, as if it thought that because the interests of a few American speculators are endangered, all Europe should sacrifice what is most vital to it. The United States thinks that England, for the benefit of a few greedy American exploiters, should lose the war which it is fighting for its own existence and power. This is peculiar logic, but it remains a fact. At present the American ambassador to Germany, Mr. Gerard, evidently a great friend of the Germans, is again importuning Washington for new protests and notes, apparently in defense of American trade, exposed to the danger of a blockade of Germany. The American ambassador promises that he can persuade Germany to abandon its terrible blockade if the United States Government, by threatening to withold the transportation of food to England and France, will compel these nations to allow the passage of food transports into Germany, under the condition that the food shall be used for civilians and not for the army.</p>
   <p>Only an insane person would believe in German assurances. Every one knows that in Belgium the Germans are stealing food and money sent there by relief committees for the hungry noncombatants. It would therefore be silly to believe that they would not do likewise in their own country, where no one can control them. Either Mr. Gerard is very naive, or he pretends to be and is playing a farce, lowering the dignity of the United States in the eyes of the world. England would be very unwise if it consented to anything like that, and it is certain that she will not agree to Mr. Gerard's plan, even if the United States were really to put the embargo on transportation into effect. It is very doubtful whether such drastic action ever will be taken. Most probably the entire affair will terminate in a fiasco, as have all the other notes and protests. This undoubtedly will embitter many of the German-Americans, who are accustomed to dictate to the whole world, but whom very few nations fear. There is little hope that in order to please them, America will jeopardize her diplomatic relationships in times so dangerous.</p>
