   <p>Fifty years have elapsed since a great lover of liberty and equality, Abraham Lincoln, delivered his Gettysburg address, containing those famous words defining his ideal of the government: "The government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." He added sadly: "The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here."</p>
   <p>Had this great emancipator and friend of the people an anticipation of the present condition? Half a century has passed and conditions have changed. Instead of Washington and Lincoln we now have Morgans and Carnegies; instead of freedom-loving, satisfied people we have dissatisfied, depressed, and exploited masses. This great country which gave us Lincoln has now become an Eden for capitalist exploiters and a hell for the common people whom the great Lincoln loved so much.</p>
   <p>Today we cannot quote his words without blushing with shame, because they sound like a painful reproach from our conscience. Today we can say that we have the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>government of the money, by the money, for the money. It is a sad and undeniable fact, that America has dropped her beautiful mottos, and adopted a base, filthy principle of lucre, based only on greed.</p>
