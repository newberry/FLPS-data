   <p>It would seem that after recent events in Poland, that is, after the final settling of differences as to the position [on Polish affairs] to be taken by Poles everywhere--a position clearly defined by the memorable decisions of the Kolo Sejmowe, in Krakow, where the Galician National Committee's program was finally liquidated and the Polish cause placed upon its sole and proper course, there would not be any Pole, especially here in America, who would continue to adhere to the old point of view, or who would wish to work for the good of Teutonism.</p>
   <p>To tell the truth, we witnessed the "about-face" executed by the K. O. N. [Komitet Obrony Narodowej: Committee for National Defense (Polish)] immediately after the declaration of war by the United States. From fear of the punishment that might fall upon them, all of the newspapers of this organization proclaimed their loyalty, while, in the course of twenty-four hours, the leaders of K. O. N. transformed themselves from puppets of the Kaiser to defenders of the Stars and Stripes. They even began to cry out to the world at large that, today, the Germans are the sole enemies of Poland, for that was the proper attitude to take for the benefit of the government agents, who turned a more watchful eye upon their activities.</p>
   <p>But these gentlemen changed their tone only for appearance's sake. In the depths of their hearts, they remained faithful to their original idea and after feeling themselves freer when the United States Government, in the face of resolutions adopted at the K. O. N. Congress, could not call to account the more obvious sympathizers of the Kaiser, continued to work their pro-German politics and to spread venom in the hearts of their followers.</p>
   <p>In truth, they are doing this cautiously, under cover, and thus the more subversively, but steadily. After all, the goal of German propaganda in the United States was to have been the maintenance of the general opinion that nothing threatened the United states from the side of the Germans, and that consequently the United States ought to remain neutral and not mix into the war.</p>
   <p>Similar propaganda is conducted here in America by certain newspapers, such as the New York Telegraf Codzienny [Daily Telegraph], the Detroit Dziennik Polski, and others. These ridicule all the efforts of the Polish element in America to help Poland by organizing its forces and gathering itself together into a single unit, so as to be in a position to create a Polish armed force that will stand in defense of its own flag at the side of the Allied nations. The latter have acknowledged Poland as their ally and have permitted the formation of a Polish army as a symbol that Poland is already a free and independent nation.</p>
   <p>How carefully these "narrow gauge" newspapers, until recently supported financially by the Prussian consuls, reprint all news items and communiques that tend to destroy, in the Polish element here, faith in the idea that a Polish army can be created; how carefully they seize upon every little word dropped by injudicious and flippant agitators for the Polish Falcon's Alliance of America who, the sooner they are recalled, the better; what far-reaching conclusions and foolish logic based, after all, merely upon a lightning effect upon the reader, these servants of the Kaiser arrive at, purely for the purpose of defaming and ridiculing the whole task of the Polish element in America consolidated under the [Polish] National Department, so as to destroy the issue entirely, or at least postpone it for a long time to come.</p>
   <p>For proof, we do not have far to look. We do not want to cite them here, since that would accord them more honor than they deserve. We would like to call attention to only one thing, namely, to the fact that former-declared K. O. N. newspapers are again rearing their heads and spreading dissention, attempting to deprave the spirits of the weaker by robbing them of their enthusiasm and desire to serve the cause for which the United States has entered the war.</p>
   
   <p>We are stating the matter clearly if we say that the great majority of Poles in America are grouped under the standards of the Polish Central Relief Committee and the National Department, and are lending every effort to elevate the Polish name, and are working to the extent of their power for the freedom of all Poland from Prussia's grasp, at the side of the Allies, especially the United States. On the other hand, the other came, grouped under K. O. N., is doing everything in its power to obstruct this work, that is, it tends to weaken enthusiasm for the cause, thereby affecting indirectly the interests of the United States by playing the role of "slackers," about whom Root and Russell have so aptly expressed themselves.</p>
   <p>That which is being done for the good of the Kaiser and Germany by Prussian newspapers published in the United States is being done by the K. O. N. newspapers, published in the Polish language, which shield themselves behind the Polish cause by taking as a basis for their stand the German "November Acts" concerning Poland, while in reality they are working against the Polish cause and against the Allied cause in general, being rather a hidden spring in the ingenious and well-oiled Austro-German propaganda machine.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to believe in the reformation of these bare-faced sinners and in the sincerity of their efforts, induced by fear. People of their sort are usually hypocrites who, for the public eye, beat their chest and profess their patriotism, while in the depths of their hearts they remain unchanged. That this is true in the case of our people needs no proof. Attention needs to be called to the situation, however, that they should not become more harmful, and that the public should know that here it has to deal, not with lambs, but with wolves in sheep's clothing.</p>
