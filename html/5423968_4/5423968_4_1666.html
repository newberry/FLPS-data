   <p>After the last great effort to regain national independence in 1863, the Poles have been wandering about the wide world. The United States received the largest number of these emigrants.</p>
   <p>Life on foreign soil was difficult for these wanderers. They did not know the customs, language, or laws of this country, and so the history of our immigrants is marked by our growth in business, industry, and social life. Our fathers established small shops, grocery stores, or saloons because they did not know how to conduct larger enterprises.</p>
   <p>Our younger generation, born here and educated in the local schools, often goes on to higher institutions of learning, and upon graduation from these the young Poles already play an important part in our life here on American soil. Providers' Life Insurance Company is [a result of] the work of these young Poles; it is an institution that has competed successfully with the largest institutions of this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>kind in America. Today, a similar institution has arisen in the fire insurance field, the Pioneer Fire Insurance Company of America, with its main office located at 29 South La Salle Street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>After settling all the required formalities and depositing the required bond in the state treasury, this company was licensed to sell fire insurance in the state of Illinois. Poles can now insure their real and personal property with a Polish firm. The officers of this company are Peter Czaja, president, a pharmacist by profession, well known in St. Casimir's Parish; J. M. Justus, secretary; Peter Niemira, assistant secretary; and J. B. Brenza, treasurer.</p>
