   <p>In the Chicago City Council, the Republican friends of monopolies and other wise speculators are not <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>Here is a sample of their cleverness.</p>
   <p>According to Mr. Peter <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, an ordinance has been introduced in the Chicago City Council which, if passed, would cause a lot of uneasiness to our Polish coal dealers. This ordinance, which <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for the payment of fifty dollars <span class="gap">[gap]</span> as license fee, has been referred to the Law Committee of the City Council.</p>
   <p>It is evidently a threat directed against the owners of small coal yards, who find it difficult to earn a more subsistence. It wants to take away this small profit and give it to the large <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and monopolies.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>For that reason this ordinance should be fought by all honest citizens.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbassa informed us that he is opposed to this ordinance and will fight it energetically.</p>
   <p>Perhaps our Polish coal dealers will want to help him in this fight. A petition should be prepared and submitted to the City Council, etc. Those interested in this matter would do well to get in touch with Mr. Kiolbassa.</p>
   <p>At any rate, we are bringing this to the attention of our Polish coal dealers.</p>
