   <p>The die is cast. The chief of our grand Republic, President Wilson, has declared war on the German government, in the belief that peace cannot reign with the present German government; that the democracy of the world is threatened.</p>
   <p>In the history of the United States a memorable day shall be written. The men of the nation prepare for the defense of their rights, in defense of their liberty, in the hope of a speedy realization of their objects of peace throughout the world.</p>
   <p>You Poles! In this vital moment stand behind the President of the United States, gather under the Star Spangled Banner, our adopted flag, the flag that represents liberty, so dear to our hearts.</p>
   <p>Kosciuszko fought, and Pulaski fell for this grand cause, hundreds of our men fought in the civil war - today we will find thousands of sons of Poland in the various arms of service. All are eager to for feit the last drop of blood for the flag, the flag of freedom, the flag of our adoption for these United States.</p>
   <p>We shall respect the flag of this Republic still more in this hour of strife and call upon all our fellow countrymen to be loyal, to fulfill all duties which they may be called upon to perform for this country's sake.</p>
   <p>With the slogan for "your and our liberty" we will gather under the Star Spangled Banner, singing the song of our adopted country:</p>
   <p>"And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave</p>
   <p>"O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."</p>
