   <p>Officers Submit Reports</p>
   <p>President Zychlinski gave a short report of his activities since he took office after the resignation of the Committee's former president, M. J. Perlowski.</p>
   <p>The auditing of the books, which took place last week, showed the accounts to be in good order with the exception of two minor items which cannot be checked until the parties concerned return to the city.</p>
   <p>Financial Secretary Wedda presented an unusually detailed financial report. His report, covering the period from the time of the Committee's organization, August 24, 1917, to January 24, 1918, follows:</p>

   <p>The detailed reports of members of the Executive Committee showed that twenty-four national manifestations had been arranged, at a total cost of $2,046.67. Setting aside moral benefits derived from these manifestations, the material profits were great, for collections were taken up each time. Receptions were held for the Polish-French Commission in Humboldt Park and at the Polish Press Club. Administrative expenses were unusually small, for they amounted to only $273.63 for a period of five months.</p>
   <p>The largest expense was incurred in recruiting activities, but much good was done. In many cases, the families of volunteers were given financial aid, volunteers from out-of-town and those passing through Chicago were hospitably received, street car farces were returned, barracks were set up at the railroad station, and beds, blankets, and pillows were purchased; in addition to this, each volunteer was given $1.50 as spending money for the trip. Later this was reduced to $1.55. Hotel bills were also paid for those volunteers for whom there was not space enough at the barracks. The volunteers were given knapsacks and a great many other things connected with recruiting and with sending volunteers to the training camp.</p>
   <p>Recruiting Officer Wiechecki gave a short military report. His report showed that there were 1,649 volunteers from Chicago; Town of Lake led all of the other Polish communities, supplying five hundred men. All reports were accepted.</p>
   <p>Following these reports, the new regulations for the Citizens' Committees for the Polish Army in France were read and accepted. Because of the incomplete attendance--all of the organizations not being represented--the elections to be held under the new regulations were postponed until the next meeting, which will be held on February 4 at the Polish National Alliance Hall at 7:30 in the evening.</p>
   <p>It was decided to issue invitations to all Polish pastors and to all organizations to send their delegates, properly supplied with written credentials, to this meeting. The invitations will be published in all Polish newspapers sympathetic to the Polish cause. An announcement of this sort, addressed to the organizations belonging to Recruiting Center II, will appear within the next few days.</p>
   <p>With this decision, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>W. Brzozowski,</p>
   <p>temporary secretary of the Citizens' Committee</p>
