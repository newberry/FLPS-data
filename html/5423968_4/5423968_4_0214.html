   <p>Chicago again sent a hundred volunteers to the Polish Army training camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake yesterday--soldiers, who after being adequately trained will go to France to avenge all the wrongs done not only to Poland but to all humanity.</p>
   <p>Even before nine o'clock in the morning, volunteers from all parts of the Northwest Side had begun to arrive at the recruiting headquarters at Milwaukee Avenue and Augusta Street with their families, friends, or recruiting sergeants. Volunteers from the South Side gathered at Pulaski Hall, 18th Street and Ashland Avenue, under the leadership of their recruiting sergeants. Shortly before ten o'clock the volunteers boarded streetcars and rode to 18th Street and South Robey, where they were joined by the Southside volunteers. The entire group then went on to St. Anne's Church on 18th and South Leavitt Streets.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Upon arrival at St. Anne's Church and after Captain Kleczkowski and other officers had taken their places, the Reverend John Mencikowski, vicar of St. Anne's Church, celebrated mass; he was assisted by the Reverends Stanislaus Child as deacon and Aloysius Szczerkowski as subdeacon. The sermon was delivered by the Reverend Casimir Slominski, pastor of St. Anne's Parish. In his long and beautiful sermon the Reverend Slominski spoke of how we should love our motherland, which has given us everything, and of how we, as faithful sons of Poland, should rescue her from the clutches of the Prussians. In conclusion, Father Slominski bade farewell to the volunteers with the words, "Till we meet again," firm in the belief that they will crush the enemy and return to their homes soon. He then gave the volunteers his benediction.</p>
   <p>The local St. Cecilia Choir, led by the parish organist S. Bystrzynski, sang beautifully during the course of the services. The solo parts were sung by Miss Z. Bystrzynski.</p>
   <p>When the ceremony in church was concluded, the volunteers, the citizens <span class="page-break">\3</span>committee, the priests and officers, and the friends and relatives of the volunteers went to the large and beautifully decorated Chopin Hall, on 19th and Leavitt Streets, where the local citizens committee had prepared an ample dinner.</p>
   <p>At Chopin Hall</p>
   <p>When everyone was seated at the amply supplied tables, the Kipkowski Brothers orchestra took its place on the platform and entertained the volunteers with music. Before the dinner began, Miss Z. Zientek, daughter of the president of the local citizens committee, sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" very beautifully; she was accompanied on the piano by Miss Wanda Urbanski. The Reverend Child then said the prayer. The food for the banquet was prepared by the wives of local citizens.</p>
   <p>At the main table we noticed the Reverends Child, Mencikowski and Szczekowski;</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Captain P. Kleczkowski; Inspector John Przyprawa; Leon Nowak, secretary of the citizens committee; Miss Helene Wolf and Miss S. Jaworski, secretaries at Recruiting Center II; recruiting officer Roskosz; Lieutenants Edward Jerchen and A. Chmielewski; Polish Army organizer W. Rozycki; recruiting sergeants J. Juszczak, S. Deplewski, and J. Kozminski; the local citizens committee...; the representatives of the press: Gorzynski for Dziennik Chicagoski, Hinca for Dziennik Narodowy, and W. Skwarzinski for Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <p>The first after-dinner address was delivered by Joseph Zientek, president of the local citizens committee. He greeted the volunteers and guests on behalf of St. Anne's Parish and named as toastmaster the Reverend Stanislaus Child, Chaplain of the local citizens committee. The toastmaster delivered a rather long patriotic address in which he urged the volunteers to persevere in the fight against the base Prussians.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Mencikowski spoke next in the name of St. Anne's Parish and the <span class="page-break">\5</span>Reverend Pastor Slominski, who was not able to be present. The speaker called upon everyone to enlist in the Polish Army out of love for Poland. In concluding his beautiful address, he wished the volunteers the best of luck and a safe return. During the course of his speech, Paul Gardino, a volunteer in the Polish Army, placed twenty dollars in the hands of the toastmaster, for which contribution the gathering rewarded him with thunderous applause. At the conclusion of the Reverend Mencikowski's address, the toastmaster called upon S. Tyrakowski, young and able worker in the nationalistic field, to perform the duties of secretary at this occasion, after which he asked Captain P. Kleczkowski of the Polish Army to speak. The Captain spoke with his usual vigor, not as an officer to subordinates but as a Pole to his fellow Poles. In his speech, he recalled a few historical facts from the Polish insurrection of 1863, when our fathers tried to free our homeland from the hands of her enemies. Later, when the insurrection was crushed, the Russian government took its revenge,hanging and executing the heroes and exiling them to Siberia. "I am the son of an exile," said the Captain, "and so the blood in my veins <span class="page-break">\6</span>is Polish. I am willing to give every drop of it for Poland." The speaker concluded by giving the volunteers instructions on how they are to conduct themselves in camp and on the field of battle in France in order to bring honor to the Polish name. He finished his address with the cheer: "Long live the Polish Army!" Warm applause followed, and the volunteers repeated the cheer three times.</p>
   <p>One could see more than one tearful eye during the course of the Captain's fraternal address. After he had finished, volunteer Ignace Migdalski appeared with a violin, and Walter Lawdanski with an accordian of enormous proportions. They played a few numbers, among them the Polish national anthem and the "Marseillaise".</p>
   <p>The last man to speak was J. Przyprawa, inspector for the Polish Army, who for lack of time only gave the volunteers a few instructions. He then introduced Lieutenants E. Jerchen and A. Chmielewicz, under whose command they <span class="page-break">\7</span>will entrain for Camp Kosciuszko. Przyprawa then thanked the local citizens committee, the clergy, and the women of the parish for the splendid banquet they had prepared for the volunteers.</p>
   <p>After necessary formalities had been attended to by the officers, and a photograph of the volunteers had been taken by the well-known photographer W.Rozanski, ranks were formed and the parade marched through the streets of St. Anne's and St. Adalbert's Parishes for almost an hour and a half.</p>
   <p>The Parade</p>
   <p>At the head of the parade marched chief recruiting officer Roskosz followed by the standard-bearers carrying the Polish and American flags. They were followed by the citizens committee, led by L. Nowak and J. Zientek; the Reverends Child and Mencikowski; the representatives of the press; and the Kipkowski Brothers orchestra. Then came the officers of the Polish Army--J. Przyprawa, S. Krzywonos, E. Jerchen, and A. Chmielewicz--and the volunteers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Families of the volunteers and friends brought up the rear, while along the sidewalks there moved hundreds of children and adults.</p>
   <p>The parade started at Chopin Hall and moved along the following route: Leavitt Street to 18th, 18th to Robey, Robey to 17th, 17th to Ashland, Ashland back to 18th, 18th to Robey, Robey to 18th Place, 18th place to Western, Western to 19th, 19th to Laflin, Laflin to 21st Place 21st Place to Blue Island, and Blue Island to 22nd and Ashland, where chartered street cars were waiting to take the volunteers to the railroad station at Dearborn and Polk.</p>
   <p>On arrival at the railroad station, the volunteers said their final farewells to their families and friends, and boarded the train while the orchestra played a few selections. Soon the train started, carrying with it these able sons of Poland who have gone to fight for our homeland's freedom and to avenge the wrongs that the base Germans have done Poland, to return later as heroes covered with glory.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Go, and do not forget that you are Polish soldiers. Fight the base Prussian! And when you have cut off the Prussian hydra's head, go on to Poland and plant the white-eagled standard on the walls of Warsaw, Poznan, Krakow, and Danzig.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, it must be added that St. Anne's Parish aroused the admiration of everyone who attended the reception. Thanks are due to the local citizens committee....,and to the women who prepared the delicious dinner.....</p>
   <p>Long live St. Anne's Parish!</p>
