   <p>The fourth of June will mark the first anniversary of the movement to organize a Polish army in France. On June 4, 1917, a decree of President Poincare of France, after having been discussed and approved in both houses of the French Parliament, announced to the world that, in recognition of the right of Poland to independent political existence and in recognition of the efforts of the Poles fighting valiantly at the side of the allies, France agrees to allow a Polish army to be formed on her soil as a symbol of the Polish struggle for freedom, independence, and a rightful place among the nations of the civilized world, as an expression of the realization of polish ideals, and as a tribute to the glory of Polish soldiers.</p>
   <p>This news travelled with the speed of lightning to the farthest corners of the world, and echoed in the hearts of Poles with a great enthusiasm wherever <span class="page-break">\2</span>Poles were to be found. It made its impression in Berlin too, where the enthusiasm of Poles was well known, and it created a fear that the mere news of the rising of a Polish army in France would spread the flame of insurrection throughout Poland and thus create a storm at the German rear which could wreck German plans in Russia. As a result, German oppression in Poland was lifted somewhat, and Germany even agreed to far-reaching concessions, including a limited degree of autonomy.</p>
   <p>This was the first triumph of the Polish army in France, though it is not yet thoroughly appreciated as such. Others followed. On the twelfth of August of the same year, the United States government recognized the Polish Army after it had already been recognized by the British and Italian governments and by the other Allied governments. With this moment, the work of recruiting men for the Polish Army began on a large scale, with the full approbation of all the Allied countries in which Poles were to be found. Since there are more Poles in North and South America than in other Allied nations, the greatest field for recruiting was in the Americas, in Canada, Brazil and the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Simultaneously with the growth of the Polish army movement, the Polish question assumed international significance, and was so tied up with the Allied war aims that when Poland was again wronged by the Brest Litovsk peace conference, England announced to the Germans without hesitation that the Allies did not recognize the boundaries of Poland as stipulated in that treaty and that the Allies themselves would establish Poland's boundaries. The Germans offered no active opposition when Poland occupied the Chelm territory that had been given to Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>Such was the great political significance of the forming of a Polish army in France, although at the times mentioned above, the Polish Army consisted of scarcely more than a few battalions of Poles transferred from the French service. What will its significance be in a year's time, at the coming peace conferences. That significance will be decided by the Poles themselves, for a hundred thousand or more Polish bayonets on the Western front, covered with glory, will be a voice so great that even the satanic cleverness of the diplomats of the Central Powers will not be able to minimize it. And so the fourth of June <span class="page-break">\4</span>ought to be our equivalent to the American Fourth of July, for it is from this is day, one can say, that actual Polish independence will date.</p>
   <p>We here in Chicago, in order to celebrate that day the better, have advanced it to Sunday, June 2, but on this day we will really be celebrating the fourth.</p>
   <p>Let Chicago [Polonia] turn out in a worthy manner. Let the news go out to the world that in the greatest Polish city in America the emergence of the Polish Army was properly commemorated. Let Polish communities be literally covered with flags, and may everyone turn out for the parade to the monument of the hero of two worlds!.</p>
