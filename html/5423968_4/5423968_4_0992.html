   <p>The courts are finally beginning to prosecute one of the most unscrupulous trusts in the Country - the Meat Trust.</p>
   <p>We are informed by telegram that the National Packing Co. of New Jersey is being tried for holding meats in cold storage for unusually long periods of time,creating thereby a scarcity for the purpose of obtaining high prices; and for selling poisonous and contaminated meats.</p>
   <p>They are, however, not charged with the violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust law.This Corporation is charged with the violation of an old English law, according to which, if two or more persons enter into criminal conspiracy, although the actual crime be committed by only one of the parties involved, both are equally guilty.</p>
   <p>During the grand jury hearing, a turkey that has been in storage for seven years, was presented as evidence. The frozen bird, appeared to the naked eye to be good; experts, however, claim that upon thawing, it would be plainly visible that the meat is in an advanced state of decomposition, and that it is positively unfit for human consumption. It was further proved that the National Packing Co. withheld meats from the market until the prices were forced up, and only then released the meats gradually from cold storage thereby keeping the price up; also that the directors of the Company received reports of the market prices from the Management Department, four times weekly, and regulated the release of meats from cold storage accordingly.</p>
   <p>If this case is dealt with according to the laws of the State of Illinois, the Governor will experience much difficulty in preventing extradition of those guilty of price manipulation, and sale of poisonous and contaminated food.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the magnates will employ all the political influence at their command to obstruct justice. Public opinion should, however, give full support to the presiding judges in New Jersey City: it should demand, that each and every one of the guilty parties be brought to trial and punished.</p>
