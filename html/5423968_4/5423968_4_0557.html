   <p>The president of the Polish National Alliance, Casimir Zychlinski, and the president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Peter Rostenkowski, as the heads of the largest Polish organizations in America, on the motion of one of the aldermen were appointed to the reception committee which is to receive Field Marshal Joffre, of France, and Minister of Justice Balfour, of England, who came to America for an important war council, and who are at present in Washington.</p>
   <p>In spite of the opposition of Mayor Thompson who, in order to gain the favor of the Germans, would not agree to receive these great men of the Allied countries, the City Council and the most prominent citizens of our city succeeded in upsetting the plans of our fanatic mayor by passing over his protests <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and inviting to Chicago the emissaries of the countries which are now allied with the United States.</p>
   <p>Therefore, they will come to Chicago, and will be heartily welcomed here. The honor of receiving them has fallen upon the Poles, as we justly deserve, and, therefore, the presidents of the two largest Polish organizations, Mr. Zychlinski and Mr. Rostenkowski, will not only represent these organizations but the four hundred thousand Poles in Chicago as well. The Polish people, through these two representatives, will greet the emissaries of the countries which will restore our homeland, free and united.</p>
