   <p>Telegrams from New York informed us yesterday that, after an hour and a half deliberation by a jury, the owners of the ladies' blouse factory known as the Triangle Waist Company were acquitted of a charge of manslaughter. This factory burned down on March 25 of this year. One hundred and forty-seven women, as well as several men, were burned to death in this trap or were killed after jumping out of windows on the fifth and sixth floors.</p>
   <p>People concerned with the safety of their fellow-men are of the opinion that the owners of the factory are to blame for this catastrophe. Investigation has proved that the factory lacked even the most primitive safety devices to protect the people against fire, so that when this one broke out it was impossible to save the unfortunate workers, who were locked up like weak birds in a strong cage.</p>
   <p>The prosecuting attorney proved to the court, through more than a hundred witnesses, that the factory owners were responsible for this catastrophe because <span class="page-break">\2</span>they did not follow municipal regulations. There were not enough fire escapes to enable the workers to climb down to safety. The only fire escape, which was in the rear of the factory, was broken and cluttered with trash, so that it was impossible to climb down it. The doors leading to this escape and other exits to inside stairs were securely locked, so that the unfortunate workers found themselves in the midst of the conflagration without any means of escape and had either to burn to death of to kill themselves on the street below.</p>
   <p>This catastrophe, which shocked the entire country, set the horrified working masses in action and brought on a storm of public opinion against the employers, who, through greediness or criminal neglect, did not equip the building with fire prevention devices, thus being responsible for the death of so many workers.</p>
   <p>It was, therefore, generally supposed that the employers responsible for this catastrophe would be declared guilty and punished. But not a single hair on their heads was harmed. The jury, composed of twelve men who also are the heads of families and should therefore understand the grief, despair, and misfortune of those who lost their loved ones in this catastrophe, after short deliberation, announced cold-bloodedly that the employers were not responsible for this misfortune.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Well, then who is responsible? The unfortunate victims who were being burned alive or who were killing themselves on the street below? Perhaps the poor people who lost their daughters, sisters, or wives are to blame. Truly, this is a sentence the like of which not even wise Solomon could have devised!</p>
   <p>Since the court decreed that the employers were not responsible for this catastrophe, it should prosecute the municipal officials, especially the building inspectors, who did not see to it that everything in the building was in order and according to the written law. But, as with the owners, the arms of the law will not reach them either, and they will be declared not guilty, with the result that in the end the blame will be laid on the dead, murdered victims--on these poor women and men who, in their search for bread, were forced to work in such a dangerous and criminally neglected place.</p>
   <p>The justice of American courts is truly remarkable!</p>
   <p>And this is certainly not an unusual occurrence. Many <span class="gap">[gap]</span> such as this occur daily in factories, mines, and railroads. Although it is only seldom <span class="page-break">\4</span>that the number of innocent victims killed at one time is so large, the great number of accidents resulting from the carelessness and greediness of the employers is increasing every day. The courts, nevertheless, generally acquit the employers or at most order them to pay the family of the dead worker a small compensation.</p>
   <p>This laxity is the cause of the negligence that results in the death of many workers in all kinds of employment. The employers, fearing no punishment, do not order the safety devices necessary for safeguarding the health and lives of the workers.</p>
   <p>Some time this week it will be eight years since the Iroquois Theater in Chicago burned. In this conflagration six hundred people lost their lives also as a result of negligence and greed on the part of the owners of the theater. The courts, however, neither punished the owners nor held the building inspectors responsible.</p>
   <p>It is not surprising, therefore, if the families of the victims shower curses upon the "justice" of the American courts, which treat in this way these ordinary <span class="page-break">\5</span>crimes committed by the owners of factories and other enterprises.</p>
   <p>A member of the family of one of the girls who perished in the Triangle Waist Company fire in New York, upon hearing the verdict that acquitted the owners of all responsibility for the catastrophe, burst into tears, fell on the floor, and, with a voice strangled by emotion, uttered only one terrible word, "Murderers!" This word embodies more than the severest denunciation ever hurled at justice in this country.</p>
