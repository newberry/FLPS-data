   <p>Through the efforts of the St. Casimir's Parish Citizens Committee, a great rally for the benefit of the Polish Army was held yesterday afternoon in St. Casimir's Parish. It was a success in every respect, despite the intense heat that prevailed throughout the day. The people of this Community, who are working as hard as they can for the Polish Army, have proved again that they are greatly concerned not only with providing recruits to the Army but with supporting it financially to the extent of their means.</p>
   <p>The parade began at 1:30 P.M. in front of the parish hall on 22nd Street in the following order: the standard bearers, followed by the Polish Unit Band of St. Adalbert's Parish; four Polish Army nurses; Citizens Committee of St. Casimir's Parish; Polish Army volunteers, numbering about twenty-five, led by Organizer S. Krzywonos and Recruiting Sergeant Joseph Hojnacki of Center VIII; Society of Pulaski Volunteers, Group 418, Polish National Alliance; Society of St. Francis Xavery Foresters; Bar Confederacy Society; St. Casimir's <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Society; Holy Cross Society; and New Poland Society, Group 177, Polish National Alliance. The parade moved down 22nd Street to Albany, then over to 24th Street as far as Whipple, down Whipple to 25th Street, then to Washtenaw, then back to 24th Street to Harrison High School.</p>
   <p>It was about three o'clock in the afternoon before everyone who had participated in the parade entered the hall, which seats about four thousand people. The hall was practically filled to capacity, which means that several thousand persons participated in the parade.</p>
   <p>The platform was occupied by the standard-bearers, who carried the Polish and American flags; the Polish Army nurses; Polish Army volunteers; officers of the various societies; and the scheduled speakers.</p>
   <p>Before the exercises opened, the band played the American national anthem, at which everyone rose to his feet. The exercises were formally opened by [J.] Sliwa, president of the local Citizens Committee, who called upon the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Reverend J. Kozlowski to preside, and upon M. Drzewiecki, secretary of the Citizens Committee to perform the duties of secretary.</p>
   <p>The Reverend J. Kozlowski, assistant at St. Casimir's Church, delivered a very good address, taking the Polish Army as his subject. He quoted President Wilson, who said that Poland must be an independent nation. He added that if we desire freedom, we must fight for it, for it can never be attained without sacrifice on our part. He spoke to the Polish youth, urging them to enlist in the Polish Army in the greatest possible numbers, for we need that army not only to fight for our own rights but for justice for the whole world. The reverend speaker's address was frequently interrupted with stormy applause.</p>
   <p>The Halka [Women's Chorus] then sang under the direction of Professor Kujawski and was forced to return for an encore.</p>
   <p>The next number was an address by the Polish Army organizer, S. Krzywonos, who <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>spoke in his usual spirited manner. He pointed out that the Polish people, deprived of freedom, had come to America to better their economic condition. But in reality, he said, they are slaves, for beyond their daily labor and their meager earnings, they are gaining nothing for themselves and will remain slaves until this great world war, this world drama, produces a free and independent Poland. He spoke of the Polish Army, which is going to fight, he said, not for itself, but for the cause, for all of us. He called upon the Polish youth to enlist and upon those who will stay behind to contribute financially to the Army's support. One volunteer, Joseph Haranek, came to the platform as a result of his appeal.</p>
   <p>The next number was a recitation by Miss. F. Gorski, who was rewarded with generous applause.</p>
   <p>The chairman then asked the band to play a few selections while a collection was taken up by four Polish army nurses and two other young women. The band played a medley of Polish songs, at the conclusion of which the chairman <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>announced that the St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Society of St. Casimir's Parish had donated fifteen dollars to the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>The next number was a song by a quartet from the Kurpinski Choir, directed by Herek. The quartet sang so well that it was forced by applause to give two encores. The collection netted $95.90, which, added to the St. Stanislaus Society's donation of $15, made a total of $105.90 for the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>Organizer Krzywonos then spoke again, followed by Recruiting Sergeant Hojnacki. Both called upon the youth to enlist and upon the general public for support.</p>
   <p>Before the conclusion of the rally, L. Jaglowski came to the platform. Mixing a few chemical preparations, he represented the partition of Poland, the eviction of the enemy hordes, the destruction of the Kaiser, and the rebirth of Poland. As the enemy overran our country, the preparation became blood red, and with the enemy's defeat turned to a clear white again. The final colors were red and white, the national colors of Poland.</p>

   <p>In conclusion, the Polish national anthem, "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland], was sung.</p>
