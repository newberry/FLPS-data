   <p>Without informing the Diet, without consulting the groups, without any authorization, the central body of the Polish National Alliance has signed over the entire organization to the Ligi Wolnosci, or Liberty League, and the "Powszechnego Kongresu Republikanskiego," Universal or General Republican Congress. All the groups were enthusiastically informed of this transaction by the central office. Further discussion was not permitted. Congratulations!</p>
   <p>The central body can perform another unusual act by informing its members of a detailed description of these facts.</p>
