   <p>A continuous wave of catastrophies seems to have hit America in rapid succession. These calamities are felt especially by the poor people since it is they who are plainly being murdered. Not so long ago, we were moved greatly by two street car accidents, in which eighty people were killed and a score seriously injured. Hardly had this incident come to pass when we were again confronted by news of another catastrophy, caused by the elements. An uncontrollable forest fire in Minnesota and Canada completely demolished fourteen settlements and caused the loss of many lives. The survivors were deprived of all their property and left destitute. On the tracks of this misfortune there came another. A coal mine, located at Starkville, Illinois, exploded because of an accumulation of gas. This fatal accident not only destroyed the structure of the mine but, what is most important of all, more than fifty miners met death beneath the avalanche.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Some were killed instantly.</p>
   <p>Extricating the dead from the mine is very slow because of the stagnant air in the depths, which hinders any assistance that might be given by the emergency groups. To make matters worse, the explosion completely demolished the tunnels and covered them with debris to such an extent that it will require several days and the work of several hundred people to reach the point where the accident trapped the unfortunate miners.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that approximately twenty-six Poles were on the casualty list. Of these, several were members of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>America, and particularly the United States, is a veritable hell for the working man--his class is slaughtered en masse. Despite all these catastrophies, nothing is being done to insure the health and life of the poor people while they are occupied at their perilous tasks. The heartless capitalists care less for <span class="page-break">\3</span>the life of a "foreign" employee than they do for a mule in the mines, because they have to pay for the latter, whereas they obtain a worker at no cost whatsoever.</p>
