   <p>In this country, a corrupt politician is very seldom punished for graft, bribery or other misconduct while in office, providing he is rich, clever and has a strong influence; an example of which has only recently come to the fore, when, in Chicago, a number of politicians were charged with graft, which amounted to robbery because public funds were loaned to contractors for which graft was collected in return. In spite of the evidence and costly investigations, not one of these grafters and squanderers of public money was either convicted or punished. It is true that several of the higher officials have resigned from their positions, but as soon as they learned that nothing unpleasant had resulted, they demanded that they be reinstated, pleading innocence on the strength of being victims of intrigues. This condition exists in every state where senators and other officials can be bribed.</p>
   <p>All varieties of scandals, big and little, noted almost every day in the newspapers, give us the impression that every public official is, to say the least, a grafter if not a thief. It appears that our courts are unwilling to punish such individuals who regard our laws as insignificant, to be trifled with, and interpreted by the press to suit individual requirements. There are, however, exceptions, when dishonest politicians are severly punished; this, of course happens only about once in ten years.</p>

   <p>A few Pittsburgh aldermen were recently given long prison sentences for graft. The American public was surprised too, to hear that the courts of California sentenced Mr. Abraham Ruef, who was a very powerful political boss, to fourteen years in prison for graft. The surprise was even greater because Mr. Ruef was very rich, and had many influential friends. The case was pending four years, and it appeared that he would be acquitted like thousands of others; but he was tried in several courts, he lost, and now, dressed in a striped uniform and hair closely shorn he must work in a prison factory. This is an exceptional case and will most probably, be recorded in history. The courts of California are evidently more just than some of our U. S. Senators.</p>
