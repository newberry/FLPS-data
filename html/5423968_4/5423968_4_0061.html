   <p>From time to time we find that the periodical press publishes facts from the social life of this nation. It is almost impossible to believe that such things as those described could happen in a nation where every child attends school, nearly every resident attends a temple or a church, and every citizen has access to the polls, where he can express his will, and by means of which his will is brought into the open, that it may become law.</p>
   <p>The people of this country are endowed with privileges for which other nations are continually striving, even unto death. Those less fortunate are convinced that their position would be better if for the price of their blood they could gain at least half of the freedom and the rights that our whole nation has enjoyed for more than a century.</p>
   <p>A young man of wealthy family was recently freed by a jury in Rockford, Illinois. He had been charged with twelve felonies. The jury's reason for finding this individual not guilty was that he was a victim of a so-called kleptomania and hence was mentally ill. The state prosecutor was so enraged at this verdict that he ordered an immediate dismissal of sixteen prisoners charged with felonies and robberies, and awaiting sentence. "If a wealthy person can be ill with a robbing mania," said the prosecutor, "the poor can suffer from the same disease."</p>
   <p>It can be expected, therefore, that all these sick people--one wealthy and sixteen poor--will eventually pay a call to the neighboring big city of Chicago. Once here they will begin to practice their illness on a larger scale then they have thus far.</p>
   <p>Something is decidely out of order in the judicial department of the city of Rockford when such things can happen there.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, a certain Brown was prosecuted for the second time during the past several weeks. He was accused of bribing representatives to the state legislature. The jury freed Brown, but the city prosecutor charged Brown's attorney, Erbstein, with bribing the jury. Erbstein reciprocated by accusing the prosecutor, Wayman, of committing a like transgression when he (Wayman) was an ordinary practicing attorney. Wayman then filed a suit against Erbstein and charged him with conspiracy with intent to slander.</p>
   <p>All these attacks and countercharges were investigated by a grand jury. It decided they were all well founded, with the exception of Erbstein's against Wayman. And so there will be new criminal processes, new ravings of attorneys lasting for hours on end, new decisions, and new suspicions. A second process grows from the first, a third from the second; and, for all these, society pays huge sums of money, and in addition it has this satisfaction, that the courts have neither time nor strength to be occupied in judging thieves and scoundrels roaming about the city. It is difficult to counteract the impression that, in these legal actions of attorneys against prosecutors, and vice versa, we have ordinary personal fights. We should prefer that these people satisfy their accounts between themselves in some other manner. They should not burden the courts with cases (and the people with expenses) on things that may or may not have happened. Naturally, if Mr. Erbstein really bribed the jury, he deserves punishment. But, under such circumstances, a greater punishment should be meted out to the members of the jury who allowed themselves to be bribed. But, for some reason, nothing is heard of the prosecutor holding responsible the two members of the jury who betrayed Mr. Erbstein. The same can be applied to Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ayman. If Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> has known for several years that Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ayman guilty and if his civic conscience no longer permits him to keep it a secret, then why did he keep it a secret until he came to personal differences with Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ayman?</p>
   <p>In France, such personal conflicts would be settled with the aid of two swords, two gentlemen in top hats, one physician, and a dozen bottles of champagne. This entire procedure would cost both sides several hundred francs. The parties profiting would be the physician, the cabdrivers, and the wine dealer; and the public would have no expenses. In Russia, there would be face-slapping and probably some slight mention of it to the local police. In Germany, several beer steins would be smashed upon the heads of the interested parties, who would later pay a five of five marks each for "Grober Unfug," that is, for behavior unbefitting cultured people. In England, a pair of eyes would be blackened. That would also occur in this free America if two laborers or businessmen of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> means had personal difficulties.</p>
   <p>We repeat: if such serious crimes as bribing of jurymen really did occur here, the only thing that can be done is to have the courts judge and let them really punish the guilty persons. But if these gentlemen drag each other to court merely to increase their mutual irritation and to even their accounts, it is shameful to spend people's money for such court processes.</p>
   <p>The characteristic part of these arguments is that the two people arguing do not accuse each other of lack of knowledge or ability, again other arguments. They do not condemn each other for professing some unproved principle or theory. They do not argue about who serves the people better. They use only one type of argument. "You did so and so for money," <span class="gap">[gap]</span> one. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> it was you who took money for this and that," <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the other. Everywhere and every time, the only concern is money which was taken by someone from someone, or was given contrary to the contrary to the precepts of criminal law. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>oney has so possessed society that no one can see anything beyond the dollar. People argue for the dollar; they fight for the dollar and take an <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for it.</p>
   <p>Poles also argue and, at times, rather seriously, and their arguments often overstep the boundaries of decency. Our people, however, manifest an idealism that is inborn with the Polish people. In our group, the clergy thunders against the nationalist, and the nationalist, in turn, condemns every type of foe of patriotism. A progressive figuratively murders a reactionary, and a conservative curses any type of progress. But at least these are arguments on principles in which everyone believes and on the basis of which everyone expects the salvation of our motherland. They argue and call each other names until their din reaches high heaven, but at least they do not call each other thieves and bribers. True, there was a certain group of scoundrels even in our midst, who attempted to combat their opponents by bringing charges of bribery against any who would not acquiesce in their wishes. Fortunately, our people proved themselves to be sound by contemptuously expelling from among them the false charges and the liars.</p>
