   <p>The [Administrative] Department of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America, in view of the general confusion brought about by the present European war, in which at any moment it may become our duty to take active part, has ordered that all the Falcon groups establish registration bureaus where volunteers can enlist, regardless of whether they are Falcons or not. The purpose of this order is to avoid having a large number of our young men enlist at other bureaus, which would mean the irrevocable loss to our national cause of many enthusiastic young men capable of bearing arms. Besides, we want the men who join the ranks of the Falcons voluntarily to receive training in the use of arms before they are called to leave with us for the battlefield.</p>
   <p>All groups should give, as soon as possible, detailed information as to the location of their bureaus and the hours during which they are open for enlistment.</p>

   <p>I remind all the members who have already entered their names on the list of volunteers, as well as those who are intending to do so, that under no circumstances should they enlist as volunteers at any bureaus other than those belonging to the Alliance of Polish Falcons. At the appropriate time, men enlisted at these bureaus will receive from the Falcons' General Headquarters their orders to appear at a meeting place.</p>
   <p>(Signed) J.S. Rybicki,</p>
   <p>President of Circuit II of the Alliance</p>
   <p>of Polish Falcons in America</p>
