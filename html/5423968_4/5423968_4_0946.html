   <p>We are in need of some kind of a law, which cannot be changed so easily. The present judicial system is only enlarging the existing abyss between the law and the courts, and it undermines the confidence of the people.</p>
   <p>We were waiting for some kind of a suggestion from the lawyer's convention at Montreal, but so far nothing has been heard.</p>
   <p>We think that this system, or rather lack of system, is very suitable for our lawyers, but common people, who unwillingly go to court with their difficulties because of the high cost and uncertainty, are losing confidence in courts and causing an increase of crime. Many are settling their differences out of court.</p>
