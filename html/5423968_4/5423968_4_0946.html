   <p>It occurs very often that a law passed in the State Legislature is held as unconstitutional by the Courts. This happens very often and indicates that there is something wrong with either the legislature or the courts, where the opinion of a judge depends on his own fancy. Lately, so many new state laws were attacked by the courts, that we came to the conclusion that the new judicial system of our state is out of date.</p>
   <p>Recently the Illinois Legislature adopted a bill which permits Municipal Courts to sentence guilty persons to jail without regular jury trial, despite the fact that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says very plainly: .."Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law."</p>
   <p>True, the judges have promised not to make use of this law, and because of this promise the Governor signed the bill. But it is only logical, how would personal liberty fare in this state if a case was to be left to the discretion of a judge who is nothing but human?</p>

   <p>We are in need of some kind of a law, which cannot be changed so easily. The present judicial system is only enlarging the existing abyss between the law and the courts, and it undermines the confidence of the people.</p>
   <p>We were waiting for some kind of a suggestion from the lawyer's convention at Montreal, but so far nothing has been heard.</p>
   <p>We think that this system, or rather lack of system, is very suitable for our lawyers, but common people, who unwillingly go to court with their difficulties because of the high cost and uncertainty, are losing confidence in courts and causing an increase of crime. Many are settling their differences out of court.</p>
