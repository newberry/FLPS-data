   <p>A terrific war is approaching; perhaps at the very moment when these words are being written it has already broken out.</p>
   <p>This war is not a war between two or more kings--it is a war of races, a war of nations, a war of humanity against militarism, which has been for many years oppressing the people and drawing out the very essence of life from the masses, obstructing their development.</p>
   <p>In this war races will fight each other. Just as once on the fields of Grunwald the Slavic world, under the leadership of Poland, fought a battle for life or death with Germanism, so now will the Slavs stand together as a barrier before Germanism and will cry out, "Kill or die!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Even not taking the Poles into consideration, who although descended from the Slavs have a Western culture and are not inferior in any respect to the Teutonic or any other races, Germanism is the avowed enemy of everything even remotely Slavic.</p>
   <p>Justice, which civilization promises to spread, had commanded that the Poles be saved, because they were the first and the only ones to break with the Byzantine East; they were the first to raise Christ's banner high and to carry the words of brotherly love and the fear of God into the dark masses of their peoples. Unfortunately, this justice turned out to be our hangman, and civilization, our stepmother.</p>
   <p>We were betrayed, robbed, and, after the final blow was dealt us, we were ridiculed.</p>
   <p>Among the proud ranks of the victors of Grunwald, there were traitors and vipers <span class="page-break">3</span>who thirsted after our blood, wanting to throw our inert bodies under the feet of the trampling Germans.</p>
   <p>And so two enemies opposed us--those who paid homage to us at Grunwald and swore eternal subjection, and those for whom we, by the strength of our muscles and the power of our spirit, assured freedom from German slavery.</p>
   <p>Fate decreed that the leadership of the battle of Grunwald should go into other hands--into the hands of one of our three oppressors, Russia.</p>
   <p>Russia has now at its disposal the greatest military power of all the Slavic nations, and, possessing it, she can and should, in the name of the Slavs, give battle to the German hordes. All the Slavic nations, with the exception of Poland and Slovakia, have declared themselves on her side.</p>
   <p>The former, for political reasons, the latter, because of a lack of knowledge of <span class="page-break">4</span>Socio-political conditions, have refrained from taking sides.</p>
   <p>One of our enemies is to lead the Slavs in the battle against Germanism.</p>
   <p>Just as we wish the Slavs victory and the Germans absolute political annihilation, so do we wish that Russia, in gaining the victory, become so weak as to give us a chance to settle our score with her. With a weak and enfeebled Russia, we will be able to settle our account easily, the more so since, after an eventual successful war, Russia will become the debtor of the Slavic nations, contracting obligations which she will not be able to circumvent so shamelessly as she did with us more than a hundred years ago.</p>
   <p>We should, then, wish Russia that, having crushed the Germans, she might break her teeth on them and accept us as her dentists. We will know how to extract her old and crumbling roots and, in setting in new teeth, we will set them in such a manner that she will not be able to bite us with them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>While writing the above words, we thought of the prophecies uttered some fifteen years ago by Dr. Simon Aszkenazy, professor of the University of Lwow.</p>
   <p>This historian, a very learned man, maintained that after the next European war Poland would have to arise; that she must arise as a neutral nation dividing the West and the East.</p>
   <p>These theories are now taking on a great deal of reasonableness and actuality.</p>
   <p>The Poles, as a Slavic nation, are related to the East, but, through their civilization, belong to the West. Therefore, if Europe, after a European war, wants to assure itself peace, it must separate the Eastern sphere from that of the West, and it can do this only by resurrecting Poland.</p>
   <p>Fifteen years ago we listened to these words of Aszkenazy as a mere hypothesis, and we felt a desire that they would some day come true. Now our hearts beat <span class="page-break">6</span>faster at the very thought that this hypothesis may become an actuality, that Poland will regain her freedom.</p>
   <p>Would that the Poles might act at the right time and not spoil the eventual accomplishment by too great superficiality.</p>
   <p>We have nothing to lose. If the words of Dr. Aszkenazy come true, good; if they do not, then we will speak up for Poland's deserved rights with the muscular strength of the millions of our people--we will be speaking up to those who have been weakened and bowed by war.</p>
