   <p>Through the efforts of the local citizens' committee of St. Casimir's Parish, of which the Reverend W. Furman is pastor, a great rally was held yesterday at Troy Hall, 23rd and Troy Streets, for the benefit of the Polish Army. Despite the bad weather, the hall was filled to capacity with young and old. Among the audience, a number of women were to be seen.</p>
   <p>The Reverend W. Furman was chairman of the rally and J. Drzewiecki acted as secretary. J. Nowosielski's band played during the rally, rendering mostly Polish songs. Father Furman opened the rally with a short address, after which the program followed. The first number was a beautiful vocal solo by Raczynski, to the piano accompaniment of his sister, Clara Raczynski, for which he was rewarded with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was the Reverend J. Maro, pastor of the Polish parish in Whiting, Indiana. He outlined the history of Poland, pointing out that for <span class="page-break">\2</span>centuries Poland was the bulwark of Christianity, that on the west they were forced to defend themselves against the Germans, while on the east they defended all Christianity against the Tartar and Turkish hordes. Reverend Maro then spoke of the present times, encouraging young men to enlist in the Polish Army in the greatest possible numbers, for the Polish army will fight not only for the freedom of Poland but for the rights of all humanity. His patriotic address was rewarded with semingly unceasing applause.</p>
   <p>The next number was a patriotic recitation by Miss Mary Brozda, which was also liberally applauded.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant [A.] Wolski, Chief recruiting officer for Center II, then spoke with his usual ease. He concluded his address by reading a letter from one of the Polish volunteers in France. Following this address, Miss F. Brodzinski rendered a piano solo.</p>
   <p>Victor Pijanowski, a member of the local citizens' committee, then presented <span class="page-break">\3</span>M. Grzegorek, the first volunteer to the Polish Army from this community, with ten dollars, which he donated out of his own pocket.</p>
   <p>Miss Emily Napieralski, secretary general of the Polish Women's Alliance in America, next delivered a beautiful and patriotic address, after which she presented L. Borowski, the second volunteer to the Polish Army, with a gold watch, donated by Father Furman.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Joseph Chojnacki, recruiting officer for St. Casimir's Parish, spoke next, urging enlistment in the Polish Army. There was one volunteer, Andrew Manka, who will also be rewarded with a gold watch, to be donated by Mr. Daniel.</p>
   <p>Many others then offered donations; the Reverend Zelezinski, vicar of St. Casimir's Parish, gave a gold watch; M. Drzewiecki, a pair of field glasses, so that the soldier who gets them may see the Germans while they are still far away; and Mrs. Jezierna, a gold watch.</p>

   <p>After these declarations, Father Furman appointed a committee to take up a collection. The collection netted $50.15, of which five dollars was set aside for each of three volunteers to the Polish Army from Good Shepherd Parish who were present in the hall. After the singing of "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland), the rally came to an end. At the conclusion of the rally, the Reverend Furman invited the speakers and the representatives of the press to his home for a little reception.</p>
   <p>The local citizens' committee wishes to thank all those who co-operated in making the rally a success, and especially J. J. Nowosielski, who supplied the music free of charge.</p>
   <p>The citizens' committee of St. Casimir's Parish consists of: The Reverend W. Furman, honorary president; John Sliwa, president; John Tenerowicz, vice-president; M. Drzewiecki, recording secretary; F. Opila, financial secretary; and W. Pijanowski, treasurer.</p>
