   <p>Our colleague, John Przyprawa, who has worked for Dziennik Zwiazkowy for a number of years as associate editor and has given it a great deal of his energy, resigned his post last Saturday because of his enlistment in the Polish Army. He has been called to active service and at present is connected with the recruiting office. His task will be to travel to various cities and agitate for recruits to the Polish Army, after which he will go into active service in France. Not by words, but by deed, then, our colleague has shown his desire to serve Poland.</p>
   <p>We take this occasion to thank him for service to Dziennik Zwiazkowy, and in bidding him farewell, we express the hope that he will earn himself a commission in the Polish Army and will accompany its victorious regiments under the White Eagle to a free, independent, and united Poland.</p>
