   <p>All nations, whether they have been friends or enemies of the United States, are to be helped by our government if they desire it, says President Wilson, and the American Red Cross is fully in accord with this policy.</p>
   <p>As rapidly as the restauration of peace and order permits, the American Red Cross will help the nations of Europe to regain their normal lives.</p>
   <p>Its representatives will be found everywhere relieving starvation, sickness and sorrow as far as its funds will allow. The relief work now going on in France, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Serbia, Armenia, Syria, Palestine, Siberia, and elsewhere, will be continued and as soon as conditions present and opening, the same service will be given to the Czecho-Slovaks, Jugoslavs, Rumanians, Russians, Poles and other nationalities in need and desiring our aid. The American people will share their abundance with those who are suffering and thereby prove that their generosity did not depend upon the excitement of war, but can respond as freely to the demands of peace.</p>
   <p>According to reports reaching Red Cross National Headquarters, the suffering in Europe will be unprecedented unless relief on a large scale is given, and to meet this situation promptly, the American Red Cross will need continued financial support from the American people.</p>
   <p>The week before Christmas, December 16-23, has been set aside for this purpose. It will be known as the Red Cross Christmas Roll Call. During this week it is hoped that the entire American people will enroll as members of the American Red Cross so that the message can go out to the world on Christmas Eve. The nation is in sympathy with this Red Cross policy.</p>
   <p>What finer Christmas gift can be conceived? Our own soldiers and sailors, as well as those of our Allies, who will be under arms for many months yet, will be cheered by such an announcement knowing that the attention of the Red Cross, which they have learned to value highly, will be continued.</p>
   <p>Victims of the war, in all countries, will be equally encouraged by a unanimous enrollment in the Red Cross. Such approval of its relief work by the American people will be an antidote to the pessimism which might take possession of these sufferers when they survey the wreckage of the last four years.</p>
   <p>The chief aim of the Red Cross Christmas Roll Call is to enroll members at one dollar a year, a sum so modest, virtually every one can afford to join. Membership in the Red Cross will enable men and women to register his or her approval of the Red Cross spirit, and in the aggregate, a general response to the Roll Call will furnish millions of dollars for the maintenance of relief work this winter.</p>
   <p>The more generously we respond to the Red Cross Christmas Roll Call, the sooner will devastated Europe be rebuilt and the sooner will the nightmare of war be banished. Let every one answer "Here.." when the roll is called.</p>
