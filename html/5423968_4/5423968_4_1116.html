   <p>The date of February 12 is equally dear to Americans and to our own people who, cast upon these shores by fate, yearn for our native land. It is the birthday of two men whose fame has extended throughout the wide world, awakening admiration and respect, binding together the most beautiful recollections of Poland and America into a strong tie of sympathy. One was Thaddeus Kosciusko, the hero of two hemispheres; the other the great Abraham Lincoln, the emancipator of the slaves, a man who placed America upon a new plane of human ideals.</p>
   <p>One and the same powerful motive ruled the spirits of these two great men: a boundless love of freedom. Lincoln the scion of Pennsylvania Quakers, an ordinary farmhand in his youth, later a shopkeeper, a self-educated man who became a lawyer and then President--and Kosciusko, fostered by the Jesuit priests, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the product of a military academy, a titled nobleman--these two men who grew up in environments entirely different arrived at the same notion, that only a free and enlightened people can be a strong foundation for a nation.</p>
   <p>In conformity with this great ideal, the lives of these two were patterned. Kosciusko led the Polish people to battle, confident in their strength and determination. His faith, increasing in the hearts of the people, has endured to the present day. His boundless love of freedom was not restricted to his own country. When Washington fought for freedom, oceans and lands could not hold back Kosciusko. He was one of the first to stand at Washington's side, proving by his action not for the first time in our history that a Pole is always willing to fight for the freedom of all nations. The thought of Kosciusko, together with other pleasant memories of America, shaded somewhat by the banal pursuit of business and gold, is now being revived in all its strength in the hearts of the citizens of the United States, under the influence of the horrible struggle now raging for the rights and the freedom of nations.</p>

   <p>It should seen that Kosciusko, as if moved by a prophetic spirit, anticipated Lincoln's ideal. Kosciusko gave freedom to those negroes who belonged to the estates granted to him by America in recognition of his services rendered. Forty years later the brotherly spirit of Kosciusko appeared in the person of Abraham Lincoln, standing defense of the same ideal. He was not deterred by a fratricidal war. His purpose was to check the brutal greediness of the South and to erase from the face of America the shameful blemish of slavery.</p>
   <p>Today every child in Europe knows who Abraham Lincoln was, and every child in the United States honors the name of the nation's defender, Thaddeus Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>The time is near when an indissoluble bond of mutual sympathy between the rejuvenated American people and a free national Poland will be formed, based upon the two fraternal spirits of these two defenders of freedom. There can be no doubt that when the United States fought for freedom the Polish people were in sympathy with the American cause, giving to this country Kosciusko and Pulaski; and so now, when Polish blood is being shed for the freedom of Poland, the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>heart and the sympathy of every true American will be completely with us and at our side. Great ideals bring nations together. Great maxims unite them to work in harmony for humanity's progress. Great men are the heralds who go into the world preaching the ideal and searching for brotherly spirits. They, again, are followed by entire nations, who gather under the banner of the noble brotherhood.</p>
   <p>Such heralds were Thaddeus Kosciusko and Abraham Lincoln, of both of whom today is the birthday. These two, although not contemporaries, were beautifully alike in spirit.</p>
