   <p>The states of New York, Wisconsin and New Jersey, should be congratulated for adopting laws, intended for the sole purpose of protecting minors engaged in industry. There has been nothing done, however, by any other state in the union, toward the protection of those young people who were victims of accidents while engaged at work. It is deplorable, that in this democratic country, only three states have compensation laws to reimburse employees who are mere children, and who have become crippled or maimed while employed; the rest of the states do not concern themselves with employees.</p>
   <p>One of a group of sixteen states, where minors are employed illegally is the state of Pennsylvania; here these employees have no legal protection against injuries received while engaged in this illegal occupation. Bearing this in mind, we must remember that Pennsylvania holds second place in the ranks of unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. We wish to call your attention to the following example of the liability assumed by employers in the state of Pennsylvania: As a result of one accident, which cost the life of two employees who were minors, the firm was brought before the court charged with gross negligence, and fined twenty-dollars and court costs amounting to ten dollars and sixty cents.</p>

   <p>In another case, three boys, ages ranging from thirteen, to fifteen, two of which suffered severe injuries, while the third, a fifteen year old chap lost his life. In this case the employer was fined fifteen dollars. Therefore, if existing compensation laws do not include the liability for accidents, which cause injury, or the death of minors, they are of no avail.</p>
   <p>All states, in the United States save five, (Arkansas, Florida, North and South Carolina and Mississipi), have compensation laws which protect adult employees against injury or death, while engaged at work. This type of law certainly is necessary for the protection of employees who are minors and have more at stake, principally a longer life. Let us assume, that a fifteen-year old boy is crippled; he receives compensation for ten years, or until he is twenty-five, then payments cease and he is without either, the means or ability to earn a livelihood. We were of the opinion, in the past, that the law was in favor of decisions upholding cases involving the extent of liability. This is somewhat contrary to the following example.</p>
   <p>In one of the factories in Connecticut a fifteen-year old boy, lost both arms in an accident which was the result of gross negligence on the part of his supervisor. For a period of ten years he received a compensation of six dollars and fifty cents a week, which was equivalent to one half of his salary, and as required by law. But in a few months even this small compensation will cease, and he will be, for the rest of his life a ward of charity.</p>
