   <p>Some interesting lady has been agitating against employing Negroes. She is free to broadcast this idea if she wishes, as long as she refrains from abusing the name of one of the most prominent organizations of Polish women in America, the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>This "sincere" follower of Bleas, the former governor of South Carolina, goes from store to store on the northwest side of our city and maintains that she is a representative and an investigator of the Polish Women's Alliance. She then orders businessmen to refuse to employ Negroes in their concerns, and threatens that the Polish Women's Alliance will boycott the owners of those stores which do employ Negroes.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that the Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy, knew of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>more important decisions of the Polish Women's Alliance, but had never heard of this one, one of its reporters went to the general secretary of that organization, Miss E. Napieralski. She expressed her indignation over the use of this organization's firm and prominent position to support an agitation that has never been approved by the organization.</p>
   <p>As we have stated previously, this lady may agitate all she wants and as much as the authorities permit her, but she cannot do her nefarious work under the guise of being a representative of the Polish Women's Alliance.</p>
   <p>In view of this fact, we request all businessmen, in the event of this lady's accosting any of them to agitate against Negroes, to detain her and communicate immediately with the general secretary of the Polish Women's Alliance or with the Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
