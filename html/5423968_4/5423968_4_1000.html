   <p>Postal savings banks are a current topic of conversation and discussion. Favoring their establishment are many senators who, not so long ago, opposed them. This movement is strongly supported by President Taft and the majority of our congressmen. The founding of postal savings banks was a very prominent issue in the last national election campaign. The Republican party adopted the measure as a plank in the party platform, and now this obligation must be fulfilled.</p>
   <p>The public demand for postal savings banks is due to unsound conditions and the continual failures of banks throughout the country. The men at the head of these banks receive light sentences, and are released after a short stay in prison. Two of these wrongdoers, Stensland and Herring, have just been liberated. Such conditions have opened the eyes of those who heretofore most vehemently opposed the creation of the postal savings banks.</p>
