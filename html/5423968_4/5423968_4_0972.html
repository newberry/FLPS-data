   <p>One of the most important legal questions in the present development of great enterprise is the question of an employer's paying compensation in the event of the death or permanent bodily injury of an employee, sustained in the course of his work.</p>
   <p>In principle the law acknowledges the right of a worker or his family to compensation. In practice, however, the law is so full of difficulties and technicalities that the wronged worker is obliged to take legal action against his employer. The lamentable thine is that there is little possibility that the court will decide in the employee's favor. One of the worst technicalities--a condition that is to the worker's detriment--is that he has no right to compensation if an accident occurs through his own fault or even through the fault of another worker. Because of this rule a wide field is open to attorneys of both parties, and regardless of what turn the case takes, be that in favor <span class="page-break">2</span>of the plaintiff or the defendant, the attorneys always receive their fees.</p>
   <p>Statistics prove that in the United States thirty thousand to forty-five thousand workers are killed annually in line of duty, and two million receive injuries of varying degree. That is a war record, not a peacetime one. Only a war between two large nations could result in so many killed and wounded.</p>
   <p>Now, here is a question: How many of that number of wronged have a right to compensation and how many obtain nothing? One state law offers a certain type of excuse for the employer, and another has something else, and in every one the company attorney knows how to discover something not favorable to the worker.</p>
   <p>In the meantime we find that as far back as two thousand years ago Roman law, which is today the most judicious law in the world, found a logical and just answer to this problem.</p>
   <p>According to the wording of the Roman law (Actio Negorum Gestorum) whoever <span class="page-break">3</span>performs an act, either for remuneration or gratis, in the course of services which bring material gain to another, and sustains injury in the performance of this activity, has a right to a reasonable compensation. The judge is only to ascertain whether the plaintiff actually sustained any injury--from soiling an apron to loss of life--and whether he sustained it at the time he was performing activity having a financial value for another person. An exception is made only in instances when a worker maliciously desires to wrong his employer by an intentional destruction of machinery or production, and himself becomes injured during malicious activity. An employee's incompetence in operating a machine or tools does not excuse an employer, because it is the employer's business to notice that a man is incompetent and to remove him from that activity. Every case, therefore, of so-called carelessness, thoughtlessness, or unnecessary taking of chances, of the worker belongs to the general category of incompetence. The carelessness or maliciousness of another employee is always credited to the employer. The law looks upon a worker as an extended arm of the manufacturer himself If, therefore, a worker, becomes intoxicated, for example, and fractures a co-worker's skull, while in the line of duty, the Roman Law looks upon this from the standpoint of civil injustice and holds <span class="page-break">4</span>that the employer himself has committed the act.</p>
   <p>Why, then, should other ways and means be sought when wise Romans, masters of civil law, have already solved this question so adequately? Moreover, the trade of ancient Rome did not suffer in the least because of this law. True, steam machinery was unknown at that time, but huge buildings were being erected, metal was being poured and moulded, stones being cut, and trade had been established with the entire known world.</p>
   <p>Laws governing workers' compensation for injuries sustained during employment should be uniform throughout the United States, and, hence, a law should be enacted by Congress. Moreover, it should be based on the principles of the old Roman law, which are wise and just. Thirdly, the legal procedure of compensation cases should be simple, brief, and inexpensive. A competent judge, especially designated for just such cases, should have the power, upon being informed of an accident, to go to the place, examine the particulars, hear the witnesses, and issue an immediate vordict.</p>
   <p>Employers as well as employees would profit by such laws and procedure. A fear <span class="page-break">5</span>of expenses would compel them to take every precautionary step, and this would always result in benefit to themselves.</p>
   <p>An example of the inadequacy of existing compensation laws can be seen in the following instance. A certain worker was employed at a stone quarry. A section foreman came too close to a piece of stone and carelessly shoved it down. The falling stone seriously injured an employee working below.</p>
   <p>After leaving the hospital, the worker, who was incapable of being further employed presented his plight to an attorney. Luckily for him, he came upon an honest lawyer, who imparted truthful information to the wronged man.</p>
   <p>"You have no chance," said the attorney. "The stone that injured you was shoved by your fellow worker. In our state, an employer is not liable for injuries sustained by an employee as a result of the carelessness of another employee."</p>
   <p>"But I called to him above to be careful because the stone was loose," the <span class="page-break">6</span>injured man further explained.</p>
   <p>"So much the worse," replied the lawyer. "What means that you yourself noticed the danger and did not move in time. Consequently, you yourself were guilty of carelessness and have no right to compensation."</p>
   <p>"But I could not move from my post because I would lose my job."</p>
   <p>"That does not interest anyone. You took a risk willingly and you must bear the results of your risk."</p>
   <p>An unscrupulous lawyer would have robbed the poor man blind, if one may use the vernacular. He would have sued the company and, naturally, lost the case.</p>
