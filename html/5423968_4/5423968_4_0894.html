   <p>Yesterday an important meeting of the committee which is planning a mass meeting relative to a sympathetic demonstration for the Cuban insurrectionists was held in the afternoon. The results of this session indicate that the proposed demonstration at the Central Music Hall will attract a capacity crowd of sympathizers.</p>
   <p>In order to accomodate all who may wish to attend, it has been decided to hold a similar demonstration at the Association Hall. The only difference between these two affairs will be that different officers will preside.</p>
   <p>Reservations may be had only in the loge section, and these will be available at the ticket office before the meeting.</p>
   <p>Committees of different nationalities have been chosen to further the interest of this cause. These committees will co-operate with the central committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Three such groups have been chosen: namely, Armenian, Irish and Polish.</p>
   <p>Members of the Polish committee are: E. Z. Brodowski, Casimir Zychlinski, Peter Kiolbassa, Max L. Kaczmarek [also Kasmar], M. J. Szameit, A. Blaszczski, Sigmund Schmidt, F. H. Jablonski, and Joseph Napieralski.</p>
