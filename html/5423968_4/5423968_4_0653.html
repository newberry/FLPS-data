   <p>Never in the entire history of the United States have there been so many unpatriotic political acts on the part of influential men, even senators and representatives, as at present, when terrific agitation to prevent America's going to war with the Teutons has spread throughout the country.</p>
   <p>We are witnessing an inexpressibly tragic sight when a Democratic chairman of the Senatorial Commission on Foreign Affairs unmasks himself publicly as an ardent pacifist, and when the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, the notorious Mr. Mann of Illinois, together with Stone and Pennsylvania's J. Hampton Moore, make speeches which would sound much better if they were delivered at the Reichstag in Berlin.</p>
   <p>Completely unmindful of the most authentic revelations of American correspondents <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>about the German convention which undermines the public life of the United States and which here supports the whole pacifist action for the benefit of the Central Powers, such men as Moore have cast aspersions at the patriotic section of the American press, trying to create the suspicion that it is defending the honor and interests of this country against Teutonic provocations purely for the benefit of the ammunition potentates and in the service of the Allies. Mann again, at the time of granting credit for the navy of the United States, succeeded in placing an obstacle in the Administration's path, and this at a time when the Government of the United States, threatened by a great war, wants, before the whole world, to defend intelligently all the rights belonging to the United States, rights which the German government is brutally attacking.</p>
   <p>In cowardly fear of war, members of Congress have the courage, less worthy and manly, to scold the Administration, which allegedly is consciously heading toward armed conflict with the Germans. Therefore official circles in Washington have reason to suppose that the eventual war may have a healthful <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>effect on political conditions in this country, a country which was able to send such representatives to Congress. If official representatives of the American people, paralyze with their cowardice the energy of the Government, which at a time like this needs absolute support, then justly all Europe will look upon the United States as a nation of cowards, deserving to be treated as such by nations which did not retreat before sacrifice and hardship when it was a matter of defending their honor and rights, of defending the liberty and the common welfare of all civilized peoples.</p>
   <p>It is only now that one can begin to understand why the Government at Washington has made so many mistakes in the past few years, and what the real reason for Wilson's vacillation and lack of determination was in the endless diplomatic disputes with the Germans. It finally comes to light that when in this dangerous game American interests and American rights on the seas and lands are included, when the highest stake in this game is the honor and future of this country, Congress, with its pacifistic <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Democrats, Republicans, and one Socialist for show, definitely opposes the White House. It is disclosed that, when the[United]States needs a strong army and a powerful fleet to look after its threatened rights and to defend itself against an always possible attack, the pacifistic members of Congress oppose armed preparedness.</p>
   <p>The pacifistic apostles of national cowardice advocate the biblical turning of a shameless cheek for more slaps, more insults, and more invectives. They announce that one should rather be meek in the face of the external and internal enemy, to bear in silence all robbery and endure all injustices rather than strengthen the President's protest outside the country by a united, manly, and honorable action, and thus assure success to the future war actions of the United States.</p>
   <p>It was exactly this situation which kept President Wilson from sending his long-awaited war measures to Congress right now, but instead he had Secretary of State Lansing request Congress in his[the President's]name to grant the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>President the authority to undertake all actions which might eventually be necessary, including even the use of armed force, for the purpose of defending the rights and obligations of the United States, in accordance with international treaties and agreements, and in absolute accordance with international law--in other words, to grant the President the power to declare war.</p>
   <p>Being unable at the moment to overcome the inanimateness of the pacifists in Congress, who, having a cowardly fear of war, are opposed to the [United] States' having a large army and fleet, the President has taken a half step instead of a whole step forward.</p>
   <p>The[United]States can now no longer avoid war, and if Congress does not want to be responsible in history for an eventual catastrophe, it will have to complete the whole step just as soon as possible, which it will doubtlessly be forced to do anyway by future developments, and the circumstance governing the next phase of the situation.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>By granting the President the authority to defend American rights, Congress will also grant Wilson the authority to use armed force for this purpose--in effect, to wage war. In order to conduct a war a powerful army will be indispensable, and the pacifists in Congress will eventually have to give their consent, as otherwise they will be committing a crime against their own people. The[United]States today does not have a modern army capable of conducting a successful war, and a volunteer system will not create the sort of army that America will need. The pacifists will therefore at any price have to use all means in order to equip the nation with the necessary war materials, and also to consent to a law governing the universal military training of all American citizens. This will be equal to compulsory military service for the duration of the war.</p>
   <p>The United States today finds itself on the threshold of war. Therefore it is high time to prepare for war. At any rate it is the least appropriate time for any sort of pacifistic agitation. Pacificism in defense of the political situation in the[United]States must be an antipatriotic gesture, <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>and the action of an enemy of America, since it can only benefit the Teutons, who today are the natural enemies of this country. He who today cries for peace in this country, and who mouths against war, is working either consciously or unconsciously toward the weakening and perhaps even the defeat of this country.</p>
   <p>Madmen are those who naively demand a universal vote or referendum on the question of war or peace. War is like a contagious disease or an elemental disaster: it descends of its own accord with irresistible force and no referendum can turn it away or stop it, just as a general vote is incapable of protecting us against disease or floods.</p>
   <p>In view of the definitely approaching war, all sincere lovers of peace should keep silent, because if war does come it will come because it was absolutely inevitable, and it will undoubtedly bring after it a better, more real peace, because it will be a more lasting one. The revolutionary elements, on the other hand, which with their suspicious pacifistic agitation only <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>bring about dangerous confusion of public opinion, by this means only increase the scorn and arrogance of the Prussians, encouraging them to even more brutal violations of America's rights. All protests against war at this time must create the unfortunate impression outside the country that the American people in cowardly fear of war will not support their President in defense of American rights, and that therefore anyone can take whatever liberties he likes with a people of this sort.</p>
