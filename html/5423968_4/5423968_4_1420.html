   <p>Chicago's Polonia can again boast of a new physician, Dr. Bernard J. Bolka. After completing his course in medicine and serving the prescribed interneship, he has decided to open his office in St. Hedwig's Parish.</p>
   <p>Dr. Bolka was born in Michigan City, Indiana, and attended high school at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Academy [Chicago], where he became known as an exemplary student. He participated in literary and student activities, and was a member of the Academy orchestra. He completed his medical course with honors at the University of Illinois College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Bolka served fifteen months' interneship at the St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital, 1120 North Leavitt Street, performing his duties conscientiously and to the complete satisfaction of his superiors.</p>
   <p>Dr. Bolka will take over the practice of Dr. H. H. Slominski, who has enlisted as a physician in the Navy, with the rank of lieutenant. Dr. Bolka will <span class="page-break">\2</span>conduct his practice in the same office that has been occupied by Dr. Slominski, in the newly erected building owned by the Szostkowski's at 2048 North Robey Street, in St. Hedwig's Parish.</p>
   <p>Because he is a physician and surgeon of extraordinary merit, and is a conscientious and energetic man, Dr. Bolka deserves the support of Polonia.</p>
