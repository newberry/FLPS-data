   <p>Appearing before his honor Judge Charles Neiley, Mr. Koralewski, a Polish lawyer, won the case for his client, Mr. Botliszewski, against the Union Traction Company.</p>
   <p>Mr. Koralewski was opposed by three of the best lawyers in the city, representing the Traction Company, but he fought so strongly against their made up stories that the case was transferred twice. Besides appearing before Judge Neiley, they appeared before Judge Bailey and Judge Williams, but it always ended the same way, a victory for Mr. Koralewski.</p>
   <p>The trial has been going on since Monday; the story which lead to the trial is as follows:</p>
   <p>In December of 1899, Mr. Botiszewski, working near the N. M. P. Anielskiej Church, boarded a North Avenue street car at Clark Street, <span class="page-break">\2</span>bound for home. At the corner of Sedgwick and North Avenue, the street car collided with a wagon, which caused Mr. Botiszewski to strike his head against a window. At first it caused a dizziness and he did not think it was bad enough to cause any serious results. In the evening he felt dizzy, had a high fever, and a continual weak sensation in the legs and stomach.</p>
   <p>He summoned a doctor who confined him to bed for a few weeks; and from this he was never in normal health, because his nerves were shattered.</p>
   <p>He turned his case over to a Polish lawyer, Mr. Koralewski, who in turn brought suit against the Street Car Company.</p>
   <p>The first day of trial, one of the company's lawyers asked Mr. Koralewski if he intended to win this trial, if he had any assistants; to this the Polish lawyer replied. "I have great hopes that the company's lawyers will be of the greatest assistance and help to me."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>After one hour of cross examination and answering foolish questions for the company's three lawyers, Mr. Koralewski told his story in his own words, and then cross examined the opposing three lawyers and his client Mr. Botliszewski.</p>
   <p>After three hours in the jury room; the jury returned a verdict in favor of Mr. Koralewski and his client was awarded $5,000 damages.</p>
   <p>This was the first time a Polish lawyer unassisted, won a grand jury case against the more prominent lawyers of the Union Traction Company.</p>
