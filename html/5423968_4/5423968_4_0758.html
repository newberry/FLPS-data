   <p>Practically all of the delegates came to yesterday's meeting (September 23) in a very serious mood, since they were still under the influence of the telegram received by Mr. John F. Smulski, president of the Polish Bank, from the leaders of the Polish emigrants in France.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adam Majewski, commissioner of the Polish National Alliance, was invited to occupy the seat on the stage next to the president, Joseph P. Szymanski. [Translator's note: Here follows the regular business of the meeting.]</p>
   <p>The most important point of the discussion was the matter of Poland's independence. The board of directors, after long and serious deliberation drew up the following resolution:</p>
   <p>Whereas, on September 22, Mr. John F. Smulski received a telegram from Bordeaux, <span class="page-break">2</span>the present seat of the French Government, asking the Poles in America to send 20,000 compatriots to fight Poland's oppressors; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the telegram informs us that the Poles in France have already joined the colors, urges us to show ourselves worthy of Kosciusko and Pulaski, and ends with the words, "We are counting on you! The sacred cause of the homeland calls you!"</p>
   <p>Whereas, this time the most worthy and deserving men, prominent compatriots who are universally respected, signed the appeal to us: namely, the sage leader of the Polish emigrants in France, Colonel Joseph Galenzowski; Ignace Paderewski, who at his own expense erected a monument in Cracow on the anniversary of the pogrom of the Teutonic Knights in the battle of Grunwald, which was won by Jagiello and his brave cohorts; Jan Styka, famous painter and sculptor; and Fortunat Strowski; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, this appeal makes it imperative that we begin action at once, that we <span class="page-break">3</span>no longer put off helping the homeland; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, even the most indifferent of our countrymen have said that when the time came, when we received the call from responsible people, they would sacrifice everything and open their hearts; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, It is the especially sacred duty of all groups belonging to our commune not to delay a minute longer, but by making the greatest offer possible at once, to rouse their organization and members from lethorgy--to rouse the Polish multitude of four million persons in the United States from their attitude of waiting; be it therefore</p>
   <p>Resolved, By Commune Three of Holy Trinity Parish, that the delegates shall arrange a special meeting of the groups or societies by the end of the present week or the beginning of the next, and arrange for appreciable contributions for the cause of the homeland, and that every member of the Polish National Alliance residing within the boundaries of our Commune ought to pledge to pay a voluntary tax.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It is the duty of the delegates to push this matter forward with zeal and enthusiasm and to inform the directors of the Commune at once, through the secretary, Dr. J. K. Orlowski, 1747 West Division Street, of motions passed at the meetings of their respective groups.</p>
   <p>The delegates should call the attention of their groups and societies to the fact that if we neglect our sacred duty now, we shall be weakening the honor and dignity of the Polish emigrants in the United States.</p>
   <p>All money collected for the cause of the homeland should be sent to the chief collector of the Commune, Mr. Peter S. Latwis, 2322 N. Avers Avenue, or directly to Mr. Joseph Magdziarz, treasurer of the Independence Fund of the Polish National Alliance at the Alliance building.</p>
   <p>In addition to the resolution the following statement was drawn up: "Mr. John F. Smulski received on September 5, a telegram from Warsaw, appealing for help to the homeland and signed by Witold Fuchs, American vice-consul at Warsaw.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>President Smulski turned at once to the most prominent wealthy Americans, who agreed to make steady and generous contributions. One of these, Mr. Crane, offered one thousand dollars a month for the duration of the European war. The Commune expresses its gratitude to Mr. John F. Smulski for the civic zeal and energy manifested in handling this matter."</p>
   <p>In the discussions, the old matter of lack of confidence because of rivalry with the K. O. N. [Committee on National Defense] and the unpleasant experiences, which had resulted from the collection of contributions by various groups at various times, were brought up again. Commissioner Majewski, President Szymanski, Mr. John F. Singer, Mr. Stanley Markowski, Mr. Anthony Plucinski, Mr. Misiewicz, and Dr. J. K. Orlowski explained that at a time of such great importance to the homeland, it is the sacred duty of the Alliance members to obey the commands of the central board of directors and to believe the assurances of the advisory board and the censor that not a single penny of the contributions and donations will be used for any purpose other than aiding the homeland. The importance of events and the truly epochal nature of the times which we are now <span class="page-break">6</span>experiencing demand the greatest sacrifice. Groups belonging to Commune Three, the largest in respect to the number both of societies and of members, should set the example.</p>
   <p>Delegate Milewska seconded this motion with great earnestness and recommended that full confidence be given the censor and the president of the Polish National Alliance. They cannot tell the whole story but must appeal for contributions because all of former Poland has been turned into a bloody battlefield and is calling to us for fraternal sympathy, help, and immediate, generous contributions.</p>
   <p>The opponents of the motion, Messrs. Anielewski, Hinkelman, and Baranowski, tried to take advantage of every argument to justify their lack of confidence. But even they had to stress the importance of doing our duty for the homeland, which, as members of the Alliance, we cannot fulfill except by loyally following the suggestions of the administrators of the Alliance and doing our sacred duty toward our countrymen, toward the most vital interests of the nation, and toward the homeland, without lengthy discussions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>He who loves this homeland, as President Szymanski expressed it, must join the ranks at once and set the example of love and sacrifice for our Poland. The motion was passed by 152 votes against the three votes of delegates Anielewski, Hinkelman, and Baranowski, the first of whom had earlier in the meeting made a pledge to the K. O. N.</p>
   <p>The contributions were as follows: [Translators note: here follows an itemized account of how much each group contributed.] The total, not including the voluntary regular tax of the members, came to $3,496.65.</p>
   <p>This sum will be greatly increased at next week's meetings and the societies and groups of our Commune will lead in contributions.</p>
   <p>As to an educational program, it was decided to conduct regular lectures during the fall and winter seasons and to invite recognized specialists to deliver them. We shall write a separate communication on the subject of these lecturers.</p>
