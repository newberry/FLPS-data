   <p>The war debts of the allied European nations to the United States have been computed at 22,400,000,000 gold marks. This figure was originally larger, but the United States agreed upon making certain remissions to its allies during the World War.</p>
   <p>At present propositions have been made in the countries of the former allies to liquidate the debt in a single payment. The plan of settling the debt by yearly instalments, as already agreed upon, is not favored any longer, and payment in a lump sum is proposed instead.</p>
   <p>The United States should accept with enthusiasm this offer from the European Nations, which for the past ten years have not even paid the interest on the debt.</p>
   <p>Enthusiasm, however, is not evident here, and the reason why this is <span class="page-break">2</span>so is that the debtors want to have a further cut of at least 50 per cent in their debt as conditional to paying in a lump sum.</p>
   <p>As a result of this, the United States would receive 11,200,000,000, this is one half of the 22,400,000,000 gold marks owed her. The 11,200,000,000 gold marks loss would have to be borne by American interests. Were the proposal to be accepted, the American people would have to pay the debts of France, England, Italy, and Belgium to the American Government. No matter what form of reinbursement is used, the Americans will have to stand a big loss. That is why the proposal of the European nations does not awaken any enthusiasm in Washington.</p>
   <p>The governments of the debtor countries are considering the following method:</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Germany owes the United States enormous sums for reparations; in fact steps are being taken with Gilbert of Germany for the collection of the debt. If Germany agrees to pay 1,500,000,000 gold marks every year for 62 years, the German debt, plus interest at 5%, will amount to 20,000,000,000 gold marks. Therefore, the German Government should establish a 20 billion gold mark obligation sanctioned by the United States Government, and the obligation purchased by the American public in the form of bonds (American capital is the most stable in the world today). There would be immediately 20 billion gold marks on hand, from which the United States Government could get 11,200,000,000 gold marks, and the rest would be disposed of in a suitable manner.</p>
   <p>Germany would be relieved instantly of the paralyzing reparation debt to the Allied nations; the economical crisis would be ended, and there would be only the debt due to private American capital for the bond issue, which would be eventually paid over the 62 year period.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Allied nations would also be relieved of debt; there would be about 9 billion left for rebuilding of destroyed territory. France would take 7 billion; Belgium, 2,400 million.</p>
   <p>This, as a matter of fact, is too small a sum for reparation. By right the German payments should be increased yearly, as much as the financial position of Germany allows, but this type of procedure would bring about additional problems in the settling of reparations. To avoid this, certain allowances have to be made.</p>
   <p>This is now the former Entente Powers view the situation. They understand that a plan such as the one proposed does not appeal to the American Government, since half of the total debt kept by the Entente countries would have to be paid by the American people. The plan, therefore, will be of benefit to the European powers alone, which will not pay their full share if it is adopted. Therefore, the American <span class="page-break">5</span>attitude towards Germany is not as stern as would be expected.</p>
   <p>Although the attitude toward this settlement is antagonistic from the popular viewpoint, the press is commenting a great deal on the statement by Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury, who said, "Economic peace in Europe is worth ten times more than all our credit." Therefore, the project under which the Entente Powers are working has as its aim the fulfillment of peace.</p>
   <p>Nothing more, assert the heads of Europe, could be added to favor peace than the removal of the burden of reparation. Upon this foundation the French press entertains the hope that the United States will finally agree upon the 20 billion transaction, undoubtedly the greatest in the history of the world.</p>
   <p>There is no question that the United States is the sole creditor and profit-maker in the world conflict.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>During the war the world admired the Americans' idealism and uninterested part in the conflict; today it admires their talent and intelligence in making a profit out of it.</p>
   <p>During the one hundred years after the Napoleonic wars, the House of Rothschild in France grew into a power of financial might. The prominence of the Jews in the financial world rose from the ruins of war and revolution. The World War brought up not only one family to financial dictatorship in the world, but also the entire race. Sombart, the German economist, claims that the psychical origin of American capitalism has been greatly influenced by the spirit of the Jews.</p>
