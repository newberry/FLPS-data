   <p>As we have described in previous issues of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, the Poles are represented in many different kinds of business and industrial enterprise in Chicago. Polish firms with a monthly turnover of several thousand or even several tens of thousands of dollars are no longer rare in Chicago. In every Polish community one finds a great many Polish business enterprises that did not exist ten or fifteen years ago.</p>
   <p>One such Polish firm, dating from the year 1911, is the Chicago Upholstered Furniture Company, located in a large brick building at 406-12 North Leavitt Street. It is a factory district, as can be seen from the large masses of black smoke. In order to acquaint the readers of Dziennik Zwiazkowy with this Polish furniture factory, our reporter paid it a visit, and thanks to the courtesy of one of the stockholders, he was able to tour the entire building and to see how the work there is done.</p>

   <p>The place hums with activity from morning until night. About forty-two people are employed in the factory. We shall not attempt to give the details of furniture manufacture here, for anyone who is sufficiently interested can visit the factory during working hours and see for himself how the furniture is made, painted, and upholstered, and the machines that are used in this work. The factory occupies two floors of the building in which it is located.</p>
   <p>In answer to our reporter's question as to the number of Polish customers, S. S. Lesner, treasurer of the firm, replied:</p>
   <p>"We cannot claim a large number of Polish customers. For all the large number of Poles in Chicago and, if I am not mistaken, the more than twenty large Polish furniture stores, only two or three Polish firms buy from us."</p>
   <p>"How do you explain this seeming indifference of Polish furniture dealers to your firm?" asked the reporter. "Perhaps your prices are higher, or the work is not as well done as elsewhere."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Without a moment's hesitation, Lesner replied: "Our prices are certainly not higher than those of other firms, and our work is not inferior. In my own opinion, our prices are lower, as a matter of fact, and our work is in every respect superior to others. I attribute the lack of support to an inherent indifference of Poles to mutual co-operation. There is a sort of jealousy toward the man who is a little better off, and then there is the popular misconception that a Jew can always sell things more cheaply. As far as our firm is concerned, I must confess that, if not for the support of non-Poles, we would have to shut down and seek our fortunes in other fields. The largest furniture stores in Chicago are among our best customers, which proves that our work is well done and our prices are right. Otherwise, the large dealers would have nothing to do with us."</p>
   <p>"Business has suffered since the United States declared war on Germany," continued Lesner. "Our firm too is not so well off as before the war. The furniture business is best when many young people are getting married, and since Uncle Sam began calling all men into the army there are not many <span class="page-break">4</span>marriages, nor are many new homes being established.</p>
   <p>"But despite various difficulties, we cannot complain of bad business. We have steady customers in almost every part of the city."</p>
   <p>From further conversation with Lesner, our reporter learned a few facts concerning the financial condition of the firm. The Chicago Upholstered Furniture Company was incorporated in accordance with state law for $10,000 in 1911. Since that time, it has been slowly but steadily progressing, competing against Jewish-owned firms, the concern of which it is to keep Polish business from developing. Today the firm has assets totalling at least $30,000. During the present year, there has been no appreciable change in its sales volume.</p>
   <p>The stockholders are: August Bibott, president; S. S. Lesner, treasurer; and Mrs. Frances Simon, cashier. Each of them takes active part in the firm's administration.</p>

   <p>The factory does not take orders from retail customers; it deals only with furniture dealers, on a wholesale basis. Among its Polish customers are Perlowski Brothers [Union Liberty Furniture Company] and W. Szymanski.</p>
