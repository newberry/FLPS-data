   <p>Dr. Garrot, Commissioner of Health of Chicago, whose concern about the health of Chicagoans is well known to everyone, requests us to inform the Polish public that an outbreak of smallpox has been discovered in St. Hedwig Parish. It is especially serious on North Armitage and West Ashland Avenues. Dr. Garrot wishes to impress upon the people's minds that they should take precautionary measures in order to avert a spread of the disease. After all, this concerns their health and well-being.</p>
   <p>The Board of Health, with the aid of the police, during the past two months has uncovered Many cases of smallpox. Some of these cases were discovered only after the death of the victim. In other cases the victim had been ill with smallpox for over two or three weeks before it was known. Such incidents only spread the disease and make it impossible to check the epidemic. Conditions would not have become so bad had the doctors reported such cases immediately after their first visit. Had they done so, patients could have <span class="page-break">\2</span>been removed to a Catholic hospital, and their homes could have been disinfected while they were away. In this way their neighbors could have been safeguarded and at the same time the spread of the disease could have been checked. Also many persons could have been spared the experience of infection and perhaps even danger to their lives.</p>
   <p>That is why Dr. Garrot is making a sincere appeal to all persons residing in St. Hedwig Parish not to keep secret any new outbreaks of smallpox, for by doing so they endanger themselves and all others who come in contact with them. All Polish doctors are also requested to report any and all cases coming to their attention.</p>
   <p>Only in the hospital for Contagious Diseases can smalipox be properly treated, and by such confinement the family of the patient can be safeguarded.</p>
   <p>This hospital is located at 26th street and California Avenue. It is under <span class="page-break">\3</span>the supervision of Catholic nuns. The patients are given the best of care. Mothers can also be confined with their children, for there is enough room. At the present time, thanks to the Lord, there are only a few cases.</p>
   <p>We are familiar with a number of Poles whose children have been treated and cured at this hospital. Therefore, there is no need to avoid hospitalization at this Catholic institution.</p>
   <p>Dr. Garrot states that the best medium through which to gain immunity from smallpox is vaccination. Therefore those who wish to protect themselves against this disease should be vaccinated. There is no charge for this service. Through the efforts of the Board of Health the local doctors have been inoculating persons during the past week and this week at Hager's hall, 1163 North Leavitt Street. This service is between the hours of 10 A. M. and 11 A. M. One and all are entitled to this service.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Dr. Carrot invites all Polish mothers to have their children inoculated. Last year a similar epidemic was barely averted in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. At that time vaccinations were administered at the Polish Hall and later at the offices of Dr. Edward Czerniewski. The Poles of that vicinity headed the pleas of Dr. Garrot, who appealed to them through Dziennik Chicagoski. Thus the epidemic was averted.</p>
   <p>We express hope that the Poles in St. Hedwig Parish will take similar steps, for Dr. Carrot's only aim is to protect the health of the people.</p>
   <p>To further substantiate the claims and value of the smallpox hospital service, we are publishing a letter received from Simon Piasecki, a reputable resident of St. Hedwig Parish. It reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Aug. 3, 1895.</p>
   <p>"The undersigned, Simon Piasecki, extends sincere thanks to Commissioner <span class="page-break">\5</span>of Health Dr. Carrot for the gracious care he has given my family and for his sending my wife and children to the smallpox hospital.</p>
   <p>"Three of my children were afflicted with this disease. I sorrowfully admit that at the beginning I had little confidence in the healing value of this hospital and that at first I tried to prevent the confinement of my children there. But now I am fully convinced of its value, and I wish to announce publicly that the care given children in this hospital is not only the best but that it protects the health of the children and the adults in the home of the patient. Had I known the meticulous care tendered the patients at this institution I never would have objected to it, but instead would have immediately reported the case to the health authorities and had the children sent to the hospital.</p>
   <p>"At the present time I wish to urge all persons who have one of their immediate family of friends suffering from smallpox to have them sent to the smallpox hospital at once. In this way their lives as well as the lives <span class="page-break">\6</span>of others will be protected.</p>
   <p>Simon Piasecki,</p>
   <p>1181 North Leavitt Street"</p>
   <p>The readers and skeptics are requested to take note of this letter. Those who do not wish to place their trust in the words of Dr. Carrot must heed the words of Mr. Piasecki. If they wish to talk with him personally they may do so and be thoroughly convinced.</p>
