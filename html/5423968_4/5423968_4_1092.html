   <p>The life of Lincoln should be an inspiration to everyone. Not having the advantages of a formal education, he studied in his spare time beside a fireplace. He studied and practiced law a number of years. In 1850 he was elected President of the United States. At the beginning of his presidency, eleven states seceded. This was followed by four years of civil war and the victory of the Union for which Lincoln had stood unalterably.</p>
   <p>His famous Gettysburg address from which we quote should be studied.</p>
   <p>"Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal....we here highly resolve that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth."</p>
   <p>Lincoln kept the states united. Washington won our independence. Both were <span class="page-break">2</span>honest, industrious, and law-abiding. They loved the United States, respected its flag, and supported its Constitution. We should do our share to keep it the land of the free and the home of the brave.</p>
