   <p>Recently many articles appeared in the American press against so-called "foreigners" who are not wanted here. In those articles some congressmen accuse the foreigners of creating unemployment. All accusations are based only on hatred and not on facts. Those accusations are not rational for had it not been for the foreigners our commercial growth would not have reached such proportions.</p>
   <p>THE IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH OF THE COUNTRY</p>
   <p>Due to sound thinking immigrants who were our pioneers in the last century, this country is the most prosperous in the world. The Poles also have contributed to the wealth and success of this country. Everywhere one meets Poles who are energetic in business and interested in the progress of the country.</p>
   <p>Let us take the So. Chicago Poles, for example. Disregarding thousands of working men, who are employed in the steel mills, we take under consideration only those individuals who have made unusual progress and distinguished themselves in industry or commerce.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>One of those prominent men is undoubtedly Stefan Michalowski, owner of a large bakery known as the Gold Cup Bakery, and who certainly deserves special recognition.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stefan Michalewski was born in Poland and came to the United States in 1913 as a baker. The next year he married, he decided to go into bakery business. After five years of work and thrift, he went into the bakery business, buying in 1918 Mr. Kocinski's bakery, 8324 Buffalo Avenue, where Mr. Kockinski died. After three years he was able to buy another bakery which was Mr. Kukulski's bakery shop.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michalowski, after a short time, remodelled and improved that by installing modern machinery, so that today it is the biggest bakery in South Chicago.</p>
   <p>After a few years of good management, the Gold Cup Bakery developed so much trade that today (1936) Mr. Michalowski employs fifty-three bakers, who bake 12,000 loaves of bread daily, not taking into consideration other delicacies such as cakes, doughnuts, sweet rolls, cookies and other baked goods.</p>
   <p>Eighteen bakery wagons distribute his bakery goods to different stores, also to private families. His business is expanding so rapidly that it will be necessary to enlarge the shop and install more machinery.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Last year Mr. Michalowski bought another bakery in Momence, Illinois, known as the Conrad Bakery, for $30,000, and which has been appraised at $130,000.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michalowski operates that bakery shop with Mr. Litoborski as his partner. They employ around thirty men and bake 9,000 loaves of bread daily.</p>
   <p>The bakery in Momence, Illinois, is wonderfully equipped and has the appearance of a modern factory rather than that of a bakery shop conducted by two able Poles.</p>
   <p>MR. MICHALOWSKI A POPULAR MAN</p>
   <p>Mr. Michalowski, not only works energetically in his bakery shops, he also finds time for social and national affairs. He is very much interested in Polish welfare. He belongs to several Polish societies, and takes an active part in national projects, particularly when donations are necessary. He contributed to the development of Polish business in South Chicago by giving the Polish business men good advice.</p>
   <p>This demonstrates that a poor Polish immigrant is capable of creating great things; that many others are not able to accomplish because they lack the perseverance of the Polish immigrant.</p>
   <p>(But not all Poles possess that quality. Sherby).</p>
