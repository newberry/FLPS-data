   <p>On the same day, although not in the same year, two great men were born; each fought for truth and justice, and although they were from different nations, their characters were similar. They were the American Abraham Lincoln and the Pole Thaddeus Kosciusko. The names of both of these men are well known to the world--every schoolchild in Europe and in America knows them.</p>
   <p>Kosciusko was the first to come into the world, for he was born on February 12, 1746, in Mereczowszcyzna in Poland. Linclon was born on February 12, 1809, in Harding County in the State of Kentucky, in the United States. And yet the spirits of these men, living in different hemispheres, were alike, for they both loved freedom and they both worked for justice for the oppressed.</p>
   <p>Thaddeus Kosciusko was the leader and dictator of the Polish nation at a time <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>when it was attacked by three hostile neighbors and had to fight for its freedom and for its very existence.</p>
   <p>Lincoln was the sixteenth president of the young American republic, and he, too, had to fight a civil war, for the freedom of the slaves in the South and to preserve the Union.</p>
   <p>Upon his death, Kosciusko willed the great grants of land given him by the American government in reward for his services in the struggle for independence to be used in buying freedom for slaves in America, or at least in making their lives easier. Kosciusko's executor was supposed to have been Jefferson, but actually, it was Abraham Lincoln, for it was he who rescued the Negroes from slavery, although it was necessary to spill blood to do so.</p>
   <p>They were kindred souls, these great men, and their modern prototype in President Wilson, for he, too, is struggling for the freedom of oppressed humanity.</p>

   <p>While the characters, principles, and virtues of Lincoln and Kosciusko were alike, the conditions under which they lived and acted were immensely different. Kosciusko came at a time when Poland was already torn apart into three sections, when the hostile deluge had already poured destructively over the age-old Polish lands, when Poland no longer had an army of any size, when the enemy had taken or destroyed everything, while the Polish nation was torn by internal dissension. Under such conditions it was difficult to fight and to win, especially since there were three powerful enemies to fight against.</p>
   <p>Lincoln, however, found himself in a much better position when, as president of the United States, he had to take up the bitter struggle to abolish slavery. He ruled over a free, unoppressed country, he had money and numerical force with which to enter the struggle for justice and the preservation of the union. Had the kings of Poland, with the people back of them, turned in this way to the great nobles and landlords of Poland just as Lincoln did to the greater planters of the South, they would surely have saved Poland from destruction and slavery. And in the United States, who can predict what would have happened had not <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Lincoln cut off the hydra head of secession as soon as it showed itself.</p>
   <p>Our Polish hero came a little too late to save what was lost, and his opponents were too powerful. He fought ably for Poland as long as he could, however, and he fought also for the freedom of America, which has accepted the immigrant Poles so hospitably. When Kosciusko died, far from his homeland, in 1817, he left a Poland that was torn into three parts and bound in slavery and oppression by her conquerors.</p>
   <p>When Lincoln died, in 1865, he left a free, powerful, united, and wealthy nation which was no longer threatened by any dangers. He had the good fortune to see the good results of his efforts, while our Polish hero saw only the slavery and oppression of his people, for whom he wept tears of blood.</p>
   <p>All honor to the memories of these two great men, so like each other in character and deeds.</p>

   <p>Today, President Wilson and many other able statesmen are serving their country faithfully. And the Poles are faithfully serving both their true homeland and this adopted one, for they know that under the Stars and Stripes they will find justice, aid, and moral support, and under the flags of Poland and the United States we shall fight the common enemy of democracy and humanity. Poland will now soon place its own army under its own flag in the field as one of the Allies, united, free, and independent, which is what President Wilson and all lovers of freedom and justice for all the nations of the world desire.</p>
