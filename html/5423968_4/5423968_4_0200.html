   <p>St. Hedwig's Parish held the unusual ceremony yesterday of consecrating its service flag, that is, a flag that contains 462 stars, signifying that this number of men of St. Hedwig's Parish have enlisted in either the American or the Polish Army. The manifestation was of an unusually solemn character because of its high significance.</p>
   <p>Despite the fact that at present there are 462 stars on the service flag, 519 men have enlisted from St. Redwig's Parish to fight the Germans. This is the best proof that Polish youth is answering the call, and is willing to go where it is needed, where it can give service to its homeland, Poland, and its adopted homeland, America. Our youth has understood that only by force of arms can the Prussian be brought to reason, and only when he is finally and definitely beaten will he abandon the idea of ruling the world. Our youth is going to fight in defense of humanity and the democracy of the world, to <span class="page-break">\2</span>safeguard equal rights for everyone, winning in this way the freedom and independence of Poland, with an outlet to the sea, as was promised us by the Allies.</p>
   <p>The present war, like every other war, demands a sacrifice of human life. To date, many Poles of Chicago who served in the American army have died on the battlefields of France. Soon we will be hearing of the losses in the Polish Army, which is already at the battle front and which at any moment may be given the order to attack. Naturally, there will be losses, but let this not frighten parents, sisters, brothers, or friends, for even should you receive the news that a dear one has been killed in action, you may be proud of the fact that he died a hero, in defense of the rights of humanity, in defense of civilization, against the vicious and savage Germans, who, like the worst criminals, have committed and are committing terrible crimes on our mothers, sisters fathers, and brothers in our poor, devastated, depopulated Poland. They are fighting in defense, not only of those in Europe, but of those in America as well, for if the Germans are not crushed in Europe, they will do the same thing here.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>So, do not weep, but rejoice that they are dying for a sacred cause, for our cause and your cause.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's manifestation will long remain in the memories of those who were there and saw it. Since a great many people participated in the parade and manifestation, we can only suppose that the whole parish participated as one man to observe this unusual ceremony and to honor those who either are already fighting or are being trained.</p>
   <p>The flag was consecrated in St. Hedwig's Church at two o'clock in the afternoon, after which the banner was carried out by young women, who also carried it during the parade. The parade formed as follows:</p>

   <p>Automobiles brought up the rear.</p>
   <p>After forming as above, the parade moved along the following route: Webster to Lincoln, Lincoln to Wabansia, Wabansia to Hoyne, Hoyne to Armitage, Armitage to Milwaukee, Milwaukee to Maplewood, Maplewood to Logan Boulevard, Logan Boulevard to Fullerton, Fullerton to Leavitt, Leavitt to Frankfort, Frankfort to Robey, Robey to Webster and to the parish hall at Hamilton and Lyndale Streets.</p>
   <p>Upon arrival at the hall, which was too small to hold all of the people who participated in the parade, the program of the manifestation was concluded as follows: To begin with, the Reverend John Obyrtacz, pastor of St. Hedwig's Parish, gave the invocation, and then called upon J. M. Nowicki to preside and Ignace Wroblewski <span class="page-break">\6</span>to act as secretary. The local parish choir then sang the American national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner," under the direction of the local organist, E. Wiedeman, after which the children's choir sang, "Hark, 'Tis the Signal".</p>
   <p>Captain Kleczkowski of the Polish Military Commission in France then spoke. He spoke very well, as usual, and there is no doubt that his words reached the hearts of all those present, the best proof of which was the unending applause. The parish choir then sang "Flag of Our Country," after which followed an address by Major J. Barzynski of the American Army.</p>
   <p>The school children followed with the presentation of a Red Cross exhibition. It was an exhibition such as one rarely sees, and the nuns deserve credit for having schooled the children so well. The recitations and the songs of the children proved to be equally fine, even extraordinarily fine. It can definitely be said that for children it was a rare performance. The two tableaux formed by the children were also splendidly executed. They presented the sick <span class="page-break">\7</span>and wounded soldiers to whom the doctors and nurses of the Red Cross carry aid and hope.</p>
   <p>Edward J. Litsinger, a member of the Board of Review, then spoke. He was followed by Thomas Orzada, who played a violin solo very well. He in turn was followed by the parish choir singing "Pod Sztandary" (Beneath the Banners). Then Clayton Smith, City Treasurer, J. Haas, Recorder of Deeds, Alderman Max Adamowski, and Alderman Harry Littler each delivered a five-minute speech.</p>
   <p>A Polish national dance, "Bialy Mazur" (White Mazur), was performed by the girls of the eighth grade, and at its conclusion, the program was brought to an end with the singing of "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>All those who were present at the manifestation went home with the greatest faith in the future and in the final victory that will crush the Germans completely and bring about the restoration of a united, free, and independent Poland with an outlet to the sea.</p>
