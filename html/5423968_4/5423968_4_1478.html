   <p>One of the important enterprises in South Chicago is a Polish firm, the Manhattan Lumber Company, which occupies a large tract of land at 83rd street and Commercial avenue.</p>
   <p>The company was organized in 1905 by a group of Polish businessmen, and was incorporated with a capital of $250,000. During its existence it always stood at the top because its directors and managers understood their business very well. Another contributing factor to its rapid development is the fact that they sold a first-class material.</p>
   <p>There were many changes in its management during its long existence, but always for the better. The present management is in the hands of a very competent man. They are: C. A. Hanson, president; Viotor J. Wyszynski, vice-president; William J. Pieczynski, auditor; Walenty Mularski, yard foreman; Andrew Wozniak, shop foreman; Kaz. Golkowski and John Stagenber, directors.</p>
