   <p>There are only a few days left before an important election. The citizen who lives among other people, who is perfectly able and qualified to vote and yet neglects to fulfill his obligation of casting his ballot on election day, commits a sin against society.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy wishes to take this opportunity to remind the citizens of what it has written previously relative to the corrupt conditions in the state legislature of Illinois. From all indications, conditions are no better in the county and municipal administrations. Votes should be cast in favor of candidates known for their honesty and sincerity, and most important, in behalf of candidates of Polish origin.</p>
