   <p>The Citizens of Chicago elected 37 alderman last Tuesday. At present we have 70 alderman representing the City Council, 2 from each Ward; 45 Democrats, 21 Republicans and 4 Progressives. It is not very important which party dominates the City Council, but what type of men we send there, to whom we entrust our funds, the safety and welfare of over 3 million people.</p>
   <p>The City Council is to the city what Congress is to the Nation, and the Legislature is to the State.</p>
   <p>Chicago is a great city with a budget equivalent to that of a small country in Europe. Many millions of dollars flow into the city treasury; crooked politicians are, therefore, tempted to enrich themselves at the cost of tax payers. The taxes we pay are intended not only for salaries of city employees, but for the welfare of the population of the city. We expect, therefore, protection for our life and property; an adequate supply of fresh, wholesome water; streets to be paved, thoroughfares and alleys cleaned of the carcasses of dead horses, dogs and cats. We demand playgrounds for our children in every Ward; that the streets be properly lighted and patrolled by police.</p>
   
   <p>They consume the largest proportion of our exceedingly high taxes, but fail to do their duty in the event of an accident or robbery; the only place in which policemen can then readily be found is in a drinking establishment. We also demand more and better schools, a more efficient fire department, a larger selection of books in our public libraries and many similar essentials so necessary for the welfare of the people of this Great City. We further demand that the City Council be more careful in letting contracts. How often they proved to be a loss to the city treasury, but a gain to the individual. That the City Council and the mayor do not permit the people of Chicago to be exploited by gas, electric, telephone and street-car utility companies; we further demand that the City Council be obliged to enforce all ordinances which are of a beneficial nature; and that they force the street car company to give better service to the public, and discontinue the beastly and most unfriendly attitude of street car company employees toward passengers.</p>
   <p>However, the most important duty of the mayor and the City Council is to prevent corruption in the police department, as well as intoxication.</p>
   
   <p>There is no other city in the entire Country in which the police is as brutal, savage and morally rotten as in the City of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Whether the present City Council intends fulfilling its obligations to the voters and tax payers, time will tell. We shall, however, continue to remind them of their pledges and about the performance of their duties.</p>
