   <p>From our native Polish fields, hamlets, and cities, comes the joyful news that Poland's resurrection is not far off and that she is pushing aside the tombstone which for more than a hundred years has been a barrier to our freedom. The moment of release is approaching, which all true sons and daughters of unfortunate Poland desire so ardently.</p>
   <p>Freedom is coming!</p>
   <p>These words are whispered by the mysterious gray waters--so dear to us--of the Vistula, the Wilia, the Niemen, the Bug, and the Notecia, and by the rustling forests, sad for so many years. These magic words can be heard in the whisper of the wind and the songs of the birds. These happy tidings are wafted over plains and meadows, are echoed by the voices of the church bells and by the prayers of our people assembled in the temples of the Lord, where from the hearts of the Poles, so long oppressed, comes a sigh, quiet but full of hope, and from their lips the silent prayer: "Grant, Oh Lord, the return of our country's freedom."</p>
   <p>Freedom is coming!</p>
   <p>This strong voice has flown beyond forests, hills, and seas, and has reached all of the Polish wanderers in foreign lands, filling their hearts with hope and gladness. All of our people have been stirred by the news of a general European war, because only such a war, though horrible and bloody, can bring us release--the freedom so ardently desired by every one of us.</p>
   <p>Today rivers of blood are shed by the nations fighting each other for hegemony, for the rule of the world, for their own existence, and to this blood is added Polish blood, which covers our land of ceaseless battles, incendiarism, despair, hunger, and destitution. We must fight under foreign flags, in the ranks of our enemies. Brother must go against brother, each burying his bayonet in the other's chest, because thus we are commanded by horrible historical reality. We must fight for a cause foreign and inimical to us, but it may be that, out of this sowing of Polish blood, freedom will blossom for our country, so long and so barbarously oppressed. The world is advancing. Nations and their histories are changing. Those who only yesterday suffered indignities and were oppressed can be honored tomorrow, if they strive for this and live their own lives as a part of a nationalistic whole.</p>
   <p>The past few days have brought us news from the battlefields that those who tore us apart and subjugated us, now that they are in the heat of battle, are themselves bringing up the question of Poland and promising us freedom. They see that they cannot ignore a nation of twenty-five million, because this nation, in spite of oppression, lives its own life through its own literature and culture. Our enemies see that it is impossible for them to make Russians or Germans out of our people, despite all of the means they have used--even ridicule. Therefore, it is not their sincere intention nor their idea of justice which bids them stretch out their hands to the Poles, promising them freedom; it is practical necessity and our unbowed stand which force them to do this.</p>
   <p>Ours is the merit, that we have preserved our strength and courage of spirit; that we have not lost, in spite of severe subjection and terrible oppression, our national traits, our language, customs, and traditions; that we have preserved irreproachable love for our country and loyalty to it, persevering in the great hope that this unfortunate though unbowed Poland must regain its freedom.</p>
   <p>Today as a nation, although deprived of political rights, we are greater in number and stronger in spirit than we were before the partitions. Our enemies see this, and for this reason, in their moments of crisis, turn to us, asking us at least to be loyal to them. In exchange for our loyalty they promise to give us our freedom: they want to give us autonomy and to recognize us as a nation which has every right to be free.</p>
   <p>But let us not allow ourselves to be carried away by these promises or to become overly enthusiastic before they are put into effect. Let the Tsar's promise that he will free Poland be drawn up as a formal document and certified and guaranteed by such countries as England and France and presented to us. Then we shall believe these promises because they will have been put into action.</p>
   <p>We ourselves feel that when the map of Europe is reconstructed the Polish question will be taken up by the reconstructors, who will not be able to ignore and set aside without consideration such a mass of nationally conscious people and such a large area of land as ours.</p>
   <p>Whether they want to or not, the powers will have to reconstruct Poland as a buffer between Germanic and Slavic worlds--as a neutral strip of land, the borders of which neither side would be allowed to cross, because Poland would rise to her own defense, another Belgium.</p>
   <p>Therefore, from one direction or another freedom is coming, and after this war we certainly will be no worse off than we have been up to the present.</p>
   
   <p>As we listen to the echoes of this titanic battle of nations, we should keep repeating to ourselves, "Poland is not lost so long as we live."</p>
   <p>Let us believe in the rebirth of our homeland. Let us concentrate our power by making peace among the factions, stopping mutual attacks and quarrels, and collecting contributions and amassing capital for our national needs. Let us work tirelessly to do all of these things for the new Polish Government which must soon become a reality.</p>
