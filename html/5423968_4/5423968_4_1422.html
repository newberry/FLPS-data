   <p>Chicago's Polonia can now boast of a new architect in the person of Joseph A. Slupkowski, who recently completed his studies with honors and was granted a diploma.</p>
   <p>Slupkowski was born in Chicago on November 19, 1884, to Fabian and Mary Anne Slupkowski. He received his elementary schooling at the Holy Trinity parochial school, going on to public schools, after which he attended the Art institute, the Armour Institute, and the Association Institute.</p>
   <p>Slupkowski is a member of the Chicago Society, group 1450, Polish National Alliance, one of the most active Alliance groups, consisting exclusively of Polish-American youth. He is also a member of the board of directors of the Alliance Building and Loan Association of Holy Trinity Parish.</p>
   <p>Slupkowski took his examination at the University of Illinois in Urbana last April, and his state examination in May, following which he was granted a license to practice. He is skilled in his profession, for he has worked with some of the best architects for the last twelve years, making plans for buildings of various sizes and of most modern construction.</p>
   <p>At present, Slupkowski is connected with the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad as an architect and engineer. He resides with his parents at 2312 Iowa Street, in St. Helen's Parish.</p>
   <p>We extend our best wishes for the success of this young architect and fellow Alliance member.</p>
