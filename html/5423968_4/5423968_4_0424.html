   <p>Now is your opportunity to accentuate the characteristic traits of your nation:- those of gratitude, sincere friendship and loyalty -- the Cause is common. Your national existance is at stake. The freedom of the world is at stake. Yes even your own personal freedom. America through its illustrious President had spoken practically the first powerful word, in behalf of oppressed Poland and this word she has backed by all her resources on land and sea. Can you imagine poland's fate! Should it be left to the tender mercies of a victorious barbarian, the Prussian who a century and a half ago perpetrated the criminal partition of your country? Can you expect anything from a viper who flogged your children, some to death, for saying their prayers in Polish - a most despicable thief who forcibly expropriated Polish lands. No! most emphatically no! Our salvation lies with America, with the Allies. The duty is plain. Ourboys have freely volunteered by the thousands, many tens of hundred were drafted, and thousand of those not subject to draft have made a supreme sacrifice for their country, (many being older and men with families) by enlisting in the ranks of the Polish Army in France now being organized in America. Are you doing your share?</p>

   <p>You can if you will. Let not sacrifices of those who lay down their lives on the altar of patriotism be in vain. To help America win the war and insure the safety of future generations, the great mass of the workers must do their part loyally, efficiently and unselfishly at home. You must realize what you owe to America - your adopted father country. America safeguards your life and property, the law prohibits any one to harm you, and guards your hard earned money. The hospital and asylums maintained by the state or municipalities are open to you in case of need. Your children are given every opportunity for education and advancement. You may want to know how you could show your gratitude toward the United States we will advise you. WORK! Do not waste time. Every body who is working hard is just as useful to the U. S. as the soldiers in trenches in France. Advise the authorities concerning plotters. If you know of hear of plotters who try to hamper the government or who try to spread discouragement amongst your neighbors, advise without delay the proper authorities, SAVE MONEY - The expense of carrying on this war is tremendous, especially as we must not only pay our own expenses but also assist our Allies. Helping the government you will also help yourself, as money invested in Liberty Bonds or War Saving Stumps (W.S.S.) accustom you to thrift and will provide for you future. SAVE FUEL. Always turn off electricity or gas if it is not absolutely needed. Heat only the part of the house, in which <span class="page-break">\3</span>you live. Above all save coal, and if you can,use wood as fuel. The coal is indespensable in winning the war. SAVE FOOD. Eat, do not stint yourself but do not waste. Substitute rye and corn for wheat. Eat more nourishing vegetables such as; beans, potatoes, carrots, which are equally nourishing but cheaper than meat. Meat and wheat are indispensable for our soldiers in Europe and our Allies. Be 100% loyal and do not forget that "Americans Cause is the cause of freedom and freedom is the cause of Poland."</p>
