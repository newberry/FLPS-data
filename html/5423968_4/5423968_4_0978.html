   <p>A perfect example of law enforcement in England, as compared to that in the United States, was manifested in the recent murder trial of Hawley H. Crippen, who was accused of murdering his wife. After slaying his wife in London, the perpetrator of the crime fled for Canada. Soon after this hideous murder was discovered by the officials and the murderer's flight became known, the authorities tracked down their quarry and had the accused extradited to London. The subsequent course of events was comparatively rapid. The Canadian authorities surrendered Crippen and his young woman associate with no unnecessary difficulty. They were both returned to London, where the prosecutor had already compiled his material evidence that Crippen was the actual murderer. Within a spare of only a few weeks the prosecution was thoroughly prepared for trial.</p>
   <p>This procedure was entirely different from that, for example, in the United States.</p>

   <p>Here, in America, a case of comparatively lesser importance requires whole weeks and even months of time, and devours enormous sums of money from the county or state funds. The mere selection of a jury is a veritable comedy, at times lasting for several weeks, because the attorneys for the defense and the prosecution occupy themselves in the playful antics of questioning the candidates for the jury. They argue and postpone selections until, finally, out of about three hundred or more people, twelve are selected, who perhaps are not better or worse than those hundreds of citizens who were previously questioned and rejected. The subsequent arguments of the defense and those of the prosecutors, and the testimony or witnesses, are prolonged indefinitely. There are several postponements of the case so that the attorneys may have time....to extract the last of the money from the victim. Finally the jury retires, and the members of the jury argue among themselves for several hours. Frequently they cannot agree upon a unanimous verdict, hence, the judge releases them from their duty and allows them to go to their homes. The prosecution comedy is then renewed, garnished with all the afore-mentioned formalities, and quite often, after a verdict has been given, it is proved that <span class="page-break">3</span>the courts have "erred" and convicted an innocent man.</p>
   <p>The procedure is entirely different in England. There are no such formalities and comedies at the selection of jurors. The arguments of the defense and those of the prosecution do not last for days on end; the case is not continually being postponed; the jury orients itself rapidly and gives a verdict speedily and decisively. In Crippen's prosecution, although it pertained to a matter of an unusual criminal offense, the entire legal procedure was allowed to go along at an even tempo. The jury was selected in less than three days; it heard the testimony of numerous witness, examined the indictment and proofs of guilt, heard the arguments of the prosecution and of the defense, as well as the explanation of the accused, and....issued a verdict. The jury needed less than thirty minutes of time to issue a verdict finding Dr. Crippen guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree. This verdict sentenced the criminal to death by hanging. There will be no comedy of new trials, appeals, and requests to free the condemned on the principle of habeas corpus, as practiced in the United States. The only thing left for Crippen to do is to appeal to the <span class="page-break">4</span>Secretary of State, who can commute the sentence. But this, however, rarely happens in such cases.</p>
   <p>In elasticity, judiciousness, and justice, the police as well as the judges and attorneys, of England far exceed our American jurists and guardians of public safety. The court procedure there is conducted diligently, rapidly, decisively, and justly. This is beneficial to the citizens, since it relieves them from paying a group of court spendthrifts out of the general funds, so that they can play the unnecessary comedy role of prolonging the trial purposely, or repeating it, in order to be able to amass more money from the county treasury. In the American courts the trial of such a person as Lee Brown, accused of political graft, has cost the state treasury five, or perhaps ten, times more than the very important trial of the murderer Crippen cost England. The American judiciary is weak, and is in desperate need of basic reform. Such legal authorities as Roosevelt, Taft, Hughes, and others have spoken on the topic of such reforms in no uncertain terms. The prosecution of Crippen should teach the Americans how legal procedure should really be conducted.</p>
