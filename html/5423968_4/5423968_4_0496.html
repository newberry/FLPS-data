   <p>Countrymen!</p>
   <p>A French delegation, consisting of representatives of the French government and army, and officers and delegates from the Polish army created by the French President Poincare's decree, will arrive in Chicago on Sunday afternoon, October 14. A great mass meeting to receive them will be held at the Stock Yards Pavilion, 43rd and Halsted Streets. The delegation will be presented with the flags made by the Polish women of our large organizations.</p>
   <p>The entire Polish clergy has been asked to attend and to consecrate these banners and those who, like the confederates of Bar and the soldiers of Kosciusko and of the subsequent insurrections, will go to sacrifice their lives, if need be, in the bloody battle to wrest the White Eagle from the grasp of the double-headed Black, to enter mortal combat for the sacred right of national freedom and independence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Not all of us can take up arms in this struggle, but with heart and soul we can lend our aid, and by sacrifice we must have a part in the great task of resurrecting Poland.</p>
   <p>Brethren! We must faithfully stand by the watchwords of Kosciusko, who said that "Poland must be reborn through the blood and heroism of Poles". We must take up arms, as have all other freedom-loving nations, following the example set by the United States.</p>
   <p>We cannot depend upon the promises of the powers now occupying Poland, and we cannot expect an entirely free and independent Poland from the Germans, who have vowed ere this to annihilate the Polish nation and who have not changed today for all their empty promises.</p>
   <p>Our future, the rebirth and rebuilding of Poland, requires that we ourselves take up arms to settle our own problems, that we shall not find it necessary <span class="page-break">3</span>to beg favors of those who are now fighting what is, in great part, our cause, but that we might stand up for our rights as one of the allied nations.</p>
   <p>Let the fire of patriotism awaken in your hearts, countrymen, and let those who are often indolent and hall-hearted become sincere and whole-hearted Poles, generous and ready for any sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Poland will arise if everyone of us does his part. Countrymen, ask of your own consciences how much you have thus far sacrificed, and what you have done for Poland. Let us all consider this together at the manifestation on Sunday.</p>
   <p>The delegation is coming here as our guest and we must show our age-old solidarity with the enthusiasm of the patriotic knights of old. Countrymen! There will be soon enough for all of you at the great Stock Yards Pavilion, and you must attend to the very last man. Come early. Come with your societies and organizations, with your badges and banners. Uniformed societies should appear in uniform.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>And let the Polish women appear in a never ending column, for it is from them that the Polish Army will receive its flag and it is they who will give it spirit and enthusiasm. Let everyone who attends maintain a dignity worthy of the occasion, worthy of the freedom we so desire.</p>
   <p>Brethren, we shall await you at the Stock Yards Pavilion on Sunday, October 14. We shall greet the delegates from France with a solemn gathering of exile. Let our presence tell them that "Poland is not yet lost," that it is being reborn, resurrected.</p>
   <p>The one hundredth anniversary of the death of Thaddeus Kosciusko will also be observed in connection with Sunday's manifestation.</p>
   <p>The parade of organizations will be conducted from Sherman Park in Town of Lake to the Stock Yards Pavilion.</p>
