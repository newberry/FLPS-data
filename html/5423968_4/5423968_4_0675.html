   <p>It would be useless to go on at length on the tremendous importance, for the most noble progress of all humanity in general and for the liberation of our homeland in particular, of the memorable act of the President of the United States. By his address Wilson turned a new page in the history of mankind. He placed the cornerstone of a new epoch in the history of humanity. And humanity in time will gradually have to come to the building of this magnificent structure of a better future for all.</p>
   <p>That which for the past few hundred years has been going on in the minds of pioneers of human progress like a golden thread weaving in and out of their thoughts and ideas, opening wider, brighter paths to the civilized life of nations and hurling anathemas at thrones and autocratic governments, has now been openly proclaimed. That which was ridiculed, laughed at as the utopian <span class="page-break">\2</span>wanderings of incorrigible dreamers, was for the first time pointed out to humanity, dripping with blood and misfortune, as the only real and rational road leading out of the vicious circle of endless wars, which otherwise must produce only new crimes and new suffering. The great French Revolution, through its Declaration of the Rights of Man, bringing individual freedom or rather release of the individual from the bonds of the Middle Ages, opened an entirely new era to humanity. Wilson's address at Washington, having behind it the authority of the highest representative and spokesman of the greatest republic in the world, can justly be considered an equally epochal declaration of the rights of nations, a declaration which heralds liberty, independence, unity and equality of rights of all civilized nations.</p>
   <p>The fact that at the same time Poland was called upon to serve as an example of the only means by which the causes of wars could be removed, by which the crimes and injustices of the past could be remedied not for sentimental reasons, not for the sake of somebody's "beautiful eyes," but in the actual interests of the future of all countries and peoples, serves as a partial compensation to <span class="page-break">\3</span>us for the horrors we have suffered in the past, and a down payment for and a reliable surety of a better future.</p>
   <p>The blood of our heroes was not and will not have been shed in vain, this blood of the best sons of Mother Poland, who on both hemispheres of the globe have, withtheir widely scattered bones, made the soil fertile for the seeds of liberty, not some sort of abstract liberty, but a realistic liberty without which--as Wilson justly said--there can be no talk of a lasting peace, and with-out which, if peace were to be concluded, it would be only another crime demanding its own overthrow and a new even more horrible war.</p>
   <p>For the Polish immigrant group in the United States, broken up by the suppurative activities of political loudmouths who blindly and erroneously follow the examples and commands which issue from Berlin or Vienna, the part of Wilson's address which places the matter of a united, independent, and autonomous Poland as a most vital condition of the future peace treaty must at long last serve them as the only true political guide post. For those who doubt, hesitate, are <span class="page-break">\4</span>confused, or look to others for some sort of diplomatic concession, President Wilson's energetic, open, absolute, and decided assurance that "statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united, independent, and autonomous Poland, and that henceforth inviolable security of life, worship, and industrial and social development should be guaranteed to all peoples who have lived hitherto under the power of governments devoted to a faith and purpose hostile to their own" should suffice.</p>
   <p>If the most honored statesman of the American republic, as though speaking in the name of all statesmen, openly places before the whole world in his program the solution of the Polish question as a condition sine qua non of the future peace, surely not a single Polish statesman, either in Poland or America, can hesitate, for any reasons whatsoever, to accept all these postulates in their entirety.</p>
   <p>This thought was voiced decidedly and unequivocally by the most important nationalistic Polish immigrant organizations in the recently published telegram <span class="page-break">\5</span>of the Central Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance to President Wilson, in which the Central Board expressed its gratitude for his noble and unbiased defense of the postulates of a united, independent, and autonomous Poland. It would be an insult to our national honor, it would be an unforgivable apostasy and abnegation, if anyone here were still to yield any one of these postulates. Casting aside all biased considerations, we should exert all our strength and resources in a united effort to demand as much as possible, to demand everything, to relinquish nothing, to hold nothing back, in order to gain at the end of the war all the rights due the Polish nation.</p>
   <p>Wilson has spoken in the name of all Poland!</p>
   <p>He himself has said: "Perhaps I am the only person in high authority among all the peoples of the world who is at liberty to speak and hold nothing back. I am speaking as an individual, and yet I am speaking also, of course, as the responsible head of a great government, and I feel confident that I have said <span class="page-break">\6</span>what the people of the United States would wish me to say. May I not add that I hope and believe that I am in effect speaking for liberals and friends of humanity in every nation and for every program of liberty? I would fain believe that I an speaking for the silent masses of mankind everywhere who have as yet had no place or opportunity to speak their real hearts out concerning the death and ruin which they have seen come already upon the persons and homes they hold most dear."</p>
   <p>A singular honor has been bestowed upon us, which, nevertheless, places upon us certain grave responsibilities. From this all Polish-Americans can draw only one conclusion, one and only one line of direction for their national program, not taking away one iota from Wilson's condition for peace of a united, independent, and autonomous Poland.</p>
   <p>Wilson's assurance that "statesmen everywhere have agreed" to the above plan for solving the Polish question opens wide horizons for our most cherished hopes. He made this statement with all the gravity befitting the responsible <span class="page-break">\7</span>head of the Government of the United States. Furthermore, he stated only those things which up to now, for diplomatic and strategic reasons, responsible statesmen of western Europe did not as yet dare express.</p>
   <p>We wish to remind you that in this very space only about a month ago, we printed an outstanding article on the Polish question by M. Leblond, French journalist and statesman. Motivated by the protests and complaints of the Poles in Paris, embittered by the undecided stand of the Allies in regard to the Polish question after the Austro-German proclamation in Warsaw, and demanding the complete independence of a reunited Poland, M. Leblond appealed to us, Polish-Americans. He pointed to Wilson, adding that today Washington can do everything in this matter, and that only later, much later, will the Poles learn how much they are indebted in this matter to French diplomacy, especially to Briand, and also to England's erstwhile premier, Asquith.</p>
   <p>President Wilson's statements on the Polish question will be the touchstone for the patriotism of this handful of Polish immigrants, fortunately not very large, <span class="page-break">\8</span>which has allowed itself to be taken in by the scheming and clever whisperings of the corrupters of our people, grouped about the so-called K.O.N. [Committee of National Defense]. Members of this committee, with complete shamelessness, have now torn off their masks, revealing faces stamped with the ignominy of national betrayal. Brash and blown up with their own self-importance, they decided suddenly and rashly to take advantage of the address to further their own Prussphile interests. Gathered together at their hangout in New York, they sent an "address," that is, a telegram, to President Wilson, in which they maintained absolute silence on the subject of the reuniting of independent Poland as a condition for peace, as definitely set forth by Wilson, and requested only the recognition of an "independent Congress district." [Translator's note: A small section of Poland ratified by the Congress of Vienna as an independent state, but never actually granted this independence.] They did this because the recognition of the "independence" of such a tiny Polish state could be only to the advantage of the Teutons. For this action they were deservedly commended by the Pole-eating Staats-Zeitung, which at the same time rebuked President Wilson for not first learning from the leaders of the K.O.N. what sort of Poland Austro-Germany wants to have after the war.</p>
