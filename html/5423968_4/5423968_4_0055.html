   <p>At present, we have a very active political campaign in Chicago. Many candidates are seeking the nomination for office of mayor, treasurer and various city offices. Candidates from all parties are represented. Since the selection of good candidates is difficult, it is essential that citizens be very careful for whom they vote. Promises and beautiful slogans do not mean a thing; officials should be honest, energetic and efficient. A dishonest official will forget his promises and pervert all slogans no matter how beautiful, and will care only for his personal interest which will be to the detriment of the public.</p>
   <p>It is quite true that we, as editors of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, are not engaged in politics, and that we are not interested in the election fights of the candidates, yet, as citizens of this country, and editors of a newspaper, we deem it our duty to express our opinion on certain political issues, and warn the public against corrupt politicians who seek office not for the purpose of serving the public honestly, but expressly for personal gains from city, county or state treasury, and also for eliciting graft from corporations for aiding to in enacting laws suitable to their individual needs but harmful to the general public. Another reason why we should take active part in city politics is that more than 300,000 Poles live here, and thousands of them are citizens of this country who vote and pay taxes.</p>

   <p>We are interested not only in the welfare of the general public and the management of the city, but also in the welfare of the Poles, who constitute such a large percentage of this city's population. Not to take an active part in politics, would mean that we have surrendered ourselves completely to unscrupulous politicians, grafters, drones, imbeciles and quite often thieves. It has been disclosed and proved that many of our public officials are dishonest and wicked, for which reason we have a city administiation that brings blushes to every honest citizen living in Chicago. It is because of this condition that we must express our opinion about the candidates who are running for the highest city offices, that our citizens and readers may be enlightened sufficiently to form their own opinion in the selection of conscientious and efficient officials to administer the government of the city.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to know that Chicago has more inhabitants than many small countries in Europe or South America; its financial turnover is also larger. The school budget alone amounted to the colossal sum of fifteen million dollars last year. The city budget, including the public works, is more than forty-nine million dollars. In other words, we spend more than sixty-five million dollars a year for the upkeep of the city. Now if we take into consideration the financial and industrial turnover we will be surprised that it amounts to billions of dollars a year.</p>

   <p>In a city like Chicago, the center of so much wealth and humanity, it is essential that we have an energetic and honest adminstration and it is the duty of every citizen to see that we have such an adminstration. If we permit grafters in the city hall to manage the city, public funds will surely be misappropriated; which is a disadvantage to the public. Some of the officials will buy with this ill gotten money beautiful homes, and will also deposit money in the bank for a rainy day. It is time to put an end to this practice. Every political party has both, job hunters and honest men. We should, therefore, choose honest men for our officials, men whose character is beyond reproach.</p>
