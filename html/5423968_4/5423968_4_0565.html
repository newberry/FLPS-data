   <p>Yesterday the first group of Polish recruits in Uncle Sam's army left from the recruiting bureau in the Polish Roman Catholic Union Building, Milwaukee Avenue and Augusta Street. This group consisted of one hundred and twenty men who, preceded by the American flag and a drum and bugle corps, marched to the main recruiting station in the Loop, where they had dinner. Provided with food rations they left in the evening by train for St. Louis, where they will be placed in a camp. They will constitute an all-Polish company in the regiment.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's parade was led by officers of the Alliance of Polish Military Societies. The men carried a sign which read: "Polish Boys for U. S. Army."</p>
   <p>Before the parade started, a picture was taken of our brave young men. We wish them the best of luck and that they return as victors with decorations for bravery.</p>
