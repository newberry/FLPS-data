   <p>Another Monday has passed and local Polonia has had another opportunity to witness the departure of volunteers to the Polish Army training camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake, these future Polish knights who have enlisted in the Polish Army in order that, when the proper time arrives, that army will be large enough to be a real help in the final crushing of German despotism, if it cannot do it alone.</p>
   <p>The volunteers began to gather at Recruiting Center II with their recruiting officers and local citizens committees at about eight o'clock in the morning. At about ten o'clock, after certain formalities had been taken care of, the volunteers, the recruiting officers, and inspector [John] Przy-prawa proceeded to St. John Cantius Church, Chicago Avenue and Carpenter Street, where solemn High Mass was celebrated and the soldiers received their blessing for a successful journey to victory.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In Church</p>
   <p>Upon arrival at St. John Cantius Church, where services have already been held several times for departing volunteers, the Reverend Siatka, pastor, performed the ceremony, and the Reverend Falenski, vicar, delivered a very heartfelt sermon.</p>
   <p>Following the church cermony, the volunteers proceeded to the parish hall, where the women of the parish had prepared a dinner for them. Dinner was delayed for a short while in order to give the Polish Army Band, which had been playing on Sunday in Milwaukee, time to arrive. Everyone sat down to well-provided tables when the members of the band reached the hall. At the main table sat the Reverends Filipski and Fulinski, Mrs. M. Milewski, director of the Polish National Alliance, R. Kowalski, Doctor Pietrzykowski, J. Sobota, W. Misiewicz, Alderman Stanley Adamkiewicz, M. Ratajczyk, Inspector Przyprawa, Lieutenant Roskosz, Lieutant Sulewski, and others.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the dinner, the Reverend Filipski, as toastmaster, <span class="page-break">\3</span>addressed a few words to the volunteers and then called upon Alderman Adamkiewicz as the first speaker. In his address, Adamkiewicz encouraged the volunteers to fight the Prussians and to restore a free, independent and united Poland, assuring them that Chicago Polonia would remember the able sons of Poland who go forth to shed their blood for their homeland. Following Adamkiewicz, the Reverend Kmiecik spoke, as he was followed in turn by Mrs. Milewski, who said among other things:</p>
   <p>"We are bidding you farewell with this feast today, but we will give you a far greater feast after you have marched over German bodies through Berlin to our Poland. Poles are not cowards; when their homeland calls, they are ready to stand in her defense, and if it ever becomes necessary, we women will be ready to take up arms."</p>
   <p>Other speakers were R. Kowalewski, Lieutenant Sulewski, Dr. Pietrzykowski, Inspector Przyprawa, and Dr. Kosik, a volunteer who will soon leave for the training camp. The banquet ended with the singing of "Boze Cos Polske"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>[God Save Poland].</p>
   <p>The parish priests then passed out medalions to the volunteers as remembrances, while the citizens committee gave them cigars and cigarettes. There were plenty of these, since Alderman Adamkiewicz had taken up a collection for this purpose among the local businessmen and parishioners. [List of contributors omitted in translation.] Thanks are due all of these contributors, to the local clergy, and to the women who prepared the banquet.</p>
   <p>Parade to Railroad Station</p>
   <p>After certain formalities had been taken care of, and the volunteers had been photographed in front of the church by Rozanski, Brothers, photographers, the volunteers "fell in" and paraded to the Loop. The parade stopped in front of the City Hall, where, on a motion by Adamkiewicz, the City Council had recessed for a few minutes in order to see our able volunteers and to hear the music of the Polish army Band. The city's alderman, together with <span class="page-break">\5</span>Mayor Thompson, gathered on the balconies and applauded our volunteers, giving cheers for the band as it played the "The Star-Spangled Banner". When the band finished playing, thunderous applause burst forth and cheers were given for the volunteers and for the Polish Army. Our volunteers gave three cheers for America and for President Wilson. The parade then moved on through the principal streets of the downtown section to the Dearborn Street station, where there were final farewells, final handclasps with brothers, or sons, or fiancees.</p>
   <p>A moment before the train started, Mrs. Zarnowiecki, Mrs. Vlanowski, and Mrs. Brzozowski presented the volunteers with books, cigarettes, and other necessary articles. The ladies of the American Red Cross were also present, and they too gave our soldiers various articles.</p>
   <p>A moment later, the train started taking away those true sons of Poland who will soon find themselves in France, there to unite with the constantly growing Polish army, which is now awaiting the moment when it will strike at the <span class="page-break">\6</span>Prussians and avenge the wrongs that have been done us and our forefathers for many years.</p>
