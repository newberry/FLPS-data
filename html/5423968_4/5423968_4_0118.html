   <p>All Polish national organizations have combined with the aim of selecting a program to greet our friend and military genius, Marshal Foch of France, an honor that should not be neglected by any one of us.</p>
   <p>Marshal Foch is coming to America at the request of the World War Veterans' organizations. He will be their guest during his entire stay.</p>
   <p>It is our ambition to make this glorious fete in honor of this very dear friend a never-to-be-forgotten occasion.</p>
