   <p>Polish chiropractors, of whom there are about fifteen in Chicago, have formed a professional association, for which seven members signed up at once.</p>
   <p>An organization meeting was held yeaterday in the building at 20 N. Ashland Blvd. called together through the initiative of doctors of Chiropractic, Messrs. Ignatius T. Fleming and Edward J. Dulak. At that address will be the main headquarters of the association.</p>
   <p>Dr. Fleming was the chairman of the organization meeting and Dr. Dulak the secretary. The official name adopted is: Association of Polish Chiropractors.</p>
   <p>A resolution was also adopted unanimously to donate ten dollars toward the campaign fund of Judge Jarecki, so as to support such an important matter for the Poles.</p>

   <p>This move should be given recognition. At the earliest opportunity, we will write about Chiropractic, which constitutes an important branch of knowledge in treating human ailments without surgery or medicine.</p>
