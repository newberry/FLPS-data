   <p>Mr. Leo J. Winiecki was born in Chicago, April 24, 1876, in St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish. His elementary education was received in the parish school, but when his father died as a result of an unfortunate accident, young Leo had to look for work to help his mother support five small children, all his juniors. He was successful in finding employment in one of the larger print shops downtown, where he continued to work for fourteen years.</p>
   <p>In 1906 he bought a half interest in the print shop of Wirmich and Dean, which thus became Wirmich and Winiecki. In 1918 he bought the rest of the stock of the company, and the firm, now under the name of the Security Printing Company, belongs only to him and is solely under his management. Thanks to the energy and the enterprise of Mr. Winiecki the business increases daily, patronized widely by Poles as well as by people of other nationalities.</p>

   <p>In civic and social life Mr. Winiecki is also very active. He is president of the Holy Name of Jesus Society in St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr's parish in Cragin, a trustee of the High Court of the order of Catholic Foresters, and a member of many years' standing of the Polish Alma Mater, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the St. Casimir Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish, the Knights of Columbus (fourth degree), the Ladislas Jaglello Citizens Club of Cragin, and the Oriental Circle. Mr. Winiecki is president of the North Side Printers Association, president of the Polish Gold Star Mothers' and Fathers' Association, treasurer of Lodge Number 1020, Order of Catholic Foresters, and a director of the Fullerton State Bank.</p>
   <p>In March, 1911, Mr. Winiecki was a candidate for alderman, but because he was not widely known, he suffered defeat. In 1914 he was appointed a member of the Labor Arbitration Board by Governor Dunne. In this capacity he was able to render valuable services to the workingmen, who gained better working conditions and better wages. The best proof of his <span class="page-break">3</span>popularity was his re-election as a trustee of the High Court of Foresters, in which, though there are only eighteen Polish delegates, he has always held fourth place among thirteen candidates for the office. During the Liberty Loan campaign he was very active, with the result that the Polish Foresters bought more than $50,000 worth of bonds.</p>
   <p>On August 30, 1898, Mr. Winiecki married Miss Ottilia Szymanska in St. Josaphat's Church. The marriage was blessed with five children, of whom only three are alive. Their nineteen-year-old son Edward gave his life on the field of glory in the war against the Prussians.</p>
   <p>Mr. Winiecki and his family are members of St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr's parish in Cragin. He lives at 4421 Altgeld Street, and his business is located at 2140 and 2142 Clybourn Avenue.</p>
