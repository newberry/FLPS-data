   <p>Tomorrow, Tuesday, November 7, the people of the city of Chicago will elect eleven judges: ten to the Superior Court and one to the Circuit Court.</p>
   <p>Experience has taught us that the elections of judges belong to the so-called quiet elections. It is true that there is some agitation, but this occurs almost exclusively in the press, and is generally very dignified and decent. There are no meetings at ward halls, no golden-voiced orators, who for a substantial consideration elevate certain candidates to the very skies, and cast others to the lowest depths of hell. There are no arguments and fights in the taverns. In a word, there is no "politics" in the truly American sense of the word.</p>
   <p>As a result, on election day there are also no voters at the polls. Generally, only those people go to cast their votes who realize that a judge is an important <span class="page-break">2</span>official, a more important public servant than an alderman, commissioner, or even the mayor himself. Granted that frequently people also go to the polls who are not at all concerned with who is going to judge them, because they know that once they appear before a judge, every judge must mete out justice in accordance with their just desserts.</p>
   <p>We all read in the Saturday papers how our election commissioner, Anthony Czarnecki, examined a certain Swenton, manager of the Hotel Manhattan. Several hundred "citizens" registered from this little hotel, as permanent residents, such as those who will elect judges for Chicago on Tuesday. As a test, two hundred registered letters were mailed in order to make certain that these voters actually live there, or that they actually exist on this earth. The post office actually delivered about twenty letters to the people addressed, the rest were returned because the addressees could not be found. Therefore, the manager was questioned, because at the time of their registration, he had established the identity of his guests under oath.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"Do you know Mr. Michael Hunt?" Commissioner Czarnecki asked him.</p>
   <p>"Yes, indeed, I know him very well. He is dark, short, heavy set, about forty years old, with a small moustache."</p>
   <p>"Do you know Joseph Busse?"</p>
   <p>"Who does not know him?" was the reply.</p>
   <p>"Well, then, you know people whom God has not yet created," asserted the Commissioner; "your omniscience is so phenomenal that it will have to be explained before a jury." So the manager was arrested and placed under bond, because the Commissioner, in naming people who did exist, mentioned a few purely fictitious names.</p>
   <p>It is horrible to think that things like this occur in a country of freedom, <span class="page-break">4</span>enlightenment, and civilization. Certain politicians, before elections, pack cheap little hotels with thousands of tramps, tell them to register under oath, and then during the election, these same people, or others using their names, vote at a half a dollar per head, in any way they are told to by those who pay them.</p>
   <p>This is called politics, and it is such politics that, if the courts do not banish it at once from the face of this earth, and do not put its perpetrators in permanent and well-guarded places, will cause the people themselves to take up sturdy brooms and put their own houses in order. Politics of this sort is not perpetrated by the poor and ignorant immigrants, not by people who work hard from morning until night, but by people whose families have been Americans for many generations, who are wealthy and enlightened by compulsory education in the schools of this country.</p>
   <p>Polish voters should keep in mind the fact that tomorrow, as always, many bad <span class="page-break">5</span>people will vote for the worst candidates. In order to equalize these bad votes, to overcome them, tomorrow every honest voter should perform his duty as a citizen. The bad ones will all come; therefore, if the honest voters stay at home, the result of the election will not be such as the people have the right to wish for and demand.</p>
   <p>In electing judges, one should pay even less attention to parties than at any other time. What concern can it possibly be of ours whether a judge belongs to one party or another? He does not make new laws, but merely adapts already existing laws to specific cases. An honest judge is above parties; he really should not even know that parties exist in this world, and if he does know about them, and belongs to this or that one, he does this not as a judge, but as a private citizen, whom one cannot deny what is granted to everyone else.</p>
   <p>Therefore, everyone should go to the polls, but he should not vote for the entire ticket of his political party. He should choose carefully and conscientiously from among all the tickets those people he knows are more worthy than the others of this high honor of judging their peers.</p>
