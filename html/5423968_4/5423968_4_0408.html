   <p>On the occasion of last Sunday's consecration and presentation of the new standard for the Fourth Regiment of the Polish Army in France by the Polish Young Men's Alliance in the Land of Washington, the Citizens' Committee of Town of Lake sponsored a reception and supper, commonly referred to as a banquet, for the guests. It must be admitted, however, that although the food was prepared by the wives of local citizens and not by professional cooks from downtown, it tasted better than the food at so-called large banquets, from which one often returns hungrier than before attending.</p>
   <p>[List of local women who prepared supper omitted by translator].</p>
   <p>After the clergy, the speakers, the local Citizens' Committee, and the invited <span class="page-break">\2</span>guests had taken their places, the Reverend Stanislaus Nawrocki, pastor of Immaculate Conception Parish, led the gathering in prayer, following which everyone turned his attention to the food. Tables were waited on by young and pretty [women] members of the Polish Young Men's Alliance [originally a men's organization for purposes of military training, it later admitted women, with-out changing its name] dressed in uniforms.....</p>
   <p>[List of young ladies who waited on tables omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>After the supper, at which there was no lack of ice cream, pastries, and other delicacies, was concluded, B. F. Kowalewski, well-known owner of the Polish Bank in Town of Lake, and president of the local Citizens' Committee, arose and named as toastmaster, the Reverend Anthony A. Klowo, assistant pastor of Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish. After greeting the guests and expressing his thanks for the honor conferred upon him, the toastmaster delivered a short address, in which he acknowledged the efforts of the local Citizens' Committee, and especially of <span class="page-break">\3</span>its president. He then spoke of the leaders such as every nation needs. One of these, he said, is Paderewski, who is at present directing our efforts. Another such leader who is a sincere worker in the nationalistic field, he added, is John F. Smulski, whom he called upon to speak.</p>
   <p>Smulski stated modestly that he does not consider himself any molder of public opinion, but merely a worker in the national cause,remaining just that, with no desire for titles. Smulski then spoke of present times, during which we Poles have an opportunity of emerging victorious from the war and regaining our homeland. No nation which does not lose sight of its aims and does not forsake the faith of its ancestors can ever be lost, the speaker said. Such a nation must regain its freedom and independence. Our worst enemy has always been the cruel Prussian, with whom Poland always has had to struggle, and were it not that Poland is partitioned, there would be no war today; for Poland, once the bulwark of Christianity, defending all Europe from the Tartars and Turks, would not have permitted the German to cross its boundaries and begin this war were it a single, united nation. "The Great statesmen of Europe know this," <span class="page-break">\4</span>continued Smulski, "and so one of the Allied aims is to create an independent Poland which will be a bulwark from sea to sea against Prussian aggression. If such a Poland does not arise, the Germans will rule the world."</p>
   <p>The speaker then lauded the fruitful labor of the Polish clergy in America, who go hand in hand with the people and are able sons of Poland. He also praised the work of Paderewski who, through his influence, did much good in this country. If it were not for him, we would not have had such a day as was February 5 of this year. [Speaker probably has reference to March 3, on which a great manifestation was held at the Coliseum. Nothing of note happened on February 5.] Smulski then condemned the spies and those who work hand in hand with the enemies of this country by agitation against the Polish Army. These people are traitors to this country, he said. He concluded his address with the words that Poland must be free and independent after this great war is over. He was rewarded by the thunderous applause of the audience.</p>
   <p>Following Smulski's address, F. Malinowski, organist of St. John of God Church, <span class="page-break">\5</span>played with great artistry a piano solo, a medley of Polish songs. The storm of applause following his rendition forced him to return for an encore. The toastmaster then called upon Municipal Judge I. J. Sullivan, a Polish sympathizer, to address the gathering. Judge Sullivan's entire speech was devoted to acknowledgment of the services of Poles in this country who, as loyal citizens and good soldiers, have faithfully stood by The Star-Spangled Banner. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that Poland, as well as other oppressed nations, may regain its freedom.</p>
   <p>Following Judge Sullivan's address was a violin solo by F. Krol, to the piano accompaniment of Malinowski. The young violinist enchanted the audience with his music, and he was forced to return for an encore.</p>
   <p>The last address on the program was delivered by the Reverend L. Grudzinski, well-known preacher and sincere worker in the nationalistic field. Locally, he is called the guardian of the children, widows, and orphans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The Reverend Grudzinski protested that the qualities attributed to him by the toastmaster are not his at all and that, if he works for the cause or for society, he does not do so for praise or honors but from a sense of duty and from force of habit, for he hates indolence. The speaker pointed out how lazy American Poles were in working for our sacred national cause.</p>
   <p>"If we do not awaken," the speaker said, "if we do not all stand by Paderewski, we will sink to the level of those who have not grown up sufficiently to accomplish anything. If we want to be Poles, let us say so; let us either be of steel--or of butter."</p>
   <p>"In his own parish, continued the Reverend Grudzinski, he took up the work on a broad scale, designating collectors who will regularly call upon the parishioners for contributions to the Polish cause, and he is certain that St. John of God Parish will be first, in proportion to its population,among the parishes and communities. Systematic collection of a nationalistic tax is so generally accepted in St. John of God Parish that even the school children donate pennies,and <span class="page-break">\7</span>have thus far made a very creditable showing. It now remains to be seen what sort of a showing the public will make. In continuing his speech, Father Grudzinski called upon every one to contribute money, for money is necessary to purchase cannon, ammunition and other things, not argumentation, which leads nowhere.</p>
   <p>"If we cannot work together," he said, "let us drop everything. And if we really desire a free and independent Poland, let us give everything we have and show that we are real Poles, not only in name but in deeds as well."</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Father Grudzinski urged the young men to enlist in the Polish army, and the older people to work and contribute for the Polish cause. His closing words were: "Then, we will either win or lose, but I think we must win and regain our homeland, Poland. May God grant it be so."</p>
   <p>The toastmaster then thanked everyone for participation in the program, the Citizens' Committee for its efforts, the women's committee and the gathered public.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The evening was concluded with a general singing of "America" and "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>We noticed a great many prominent persons at the banquet. At the main table sat the Reverends S. Nawrocki, L. Grudzinski, E. Kowalewski, A. A. Klowo, and F. Kachnowski; Miss E. Napieralski, secretary-general of the Polish Women's Alliance, Judge Sullivan, Recruiting Officer A. Wolski, J. F. Smulski, and B. Kowalewski.</p>
   <p>The press was represented by E. Kolakowski, editor of Dziennik Narodowy, and W. Skwarczynski, of Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
