   <p>The Polish Palatine Corporation has completed all the necessary transactions in the purchase of a large building occupying two corner lots in the heart of the Polish business district in the Town of Lake section, at 47th and South Paulina Streets. After the necessary alterations are completed, the corporation will open its own department stores. It might be mentioned here that in the purchase of this building the corporation has paid cash, so that there is no mortgage on the property.</p>
   <p>This is a great step forward in the progress of this corporation. Hardly a year has elapsed since it opened its first store on Milwaukee Avenue, and today it has more than two thousand shareholders in its fold and owns its building. The officials state that if the corporation continues to progress as it has heretofore, by next year they hope to open five such Polish department stores.</p>
