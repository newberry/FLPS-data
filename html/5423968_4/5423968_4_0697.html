   <p>Continuing a series of articles exposing Austro-Hungarian activities against munition manufacturers and kindred propaganda, the Zgoda, (a Polish daily), and official organ of the Polish National Alliance, gives details of how the Austrian secret agents, Hausner and Mlynarski, installed and maintained a national polyglot press agency and subsidy. Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Scranton, and Toledo were the centers of this pernicious propaganda in the middle West. New York, and Chicago were the fountainheads of it, and the Austrian embassy in Washington, through the secret agents Hausner and Mlynarski, its directing genius, says the Polish Daily Zgoda.</p>
   <p>The time of its birth was the arrival in the United States of the agents Hausner and Mlynarski. Its spread was marked in an unvarying course by an itinerary of these men about the country, and its effects are seen in controversies of both clerical and lay character in the section referred to by Dr. Dumba in his now famous strike proposal to Foreign Minister Burian in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Vienna.</p>
   <p>Among the newspapers which either have been subsidized outright or have been eager servants of the Austrian representatives and agents in this little known phase of Dr. Dumba's pernicious career, are the following:</p>
   <p>The daily Szabodsag (Liberty), in Cleveland. Its editor and later New York representative, Martin Dienes, alias William Warm, drafted the middle West strike plans seized on Captain Archibald.</p>
   <p>The daily Amerikai Magyar Nepsava (The American Hungarian Exponent), in New York. Its editor, G. D. Berko, formerly David Bercovitz, figures in investigations, now under way, having to do with passport matters.</p>
   <p>Kuryer Codzienny (Daily Courier), in Cleveland. Casimir Gluchowski, the editor, was supported by Dr. Bogacki and Dr. Ernest Ludwig, Austrian consul in Cleveland.</p>
