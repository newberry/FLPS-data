   <p>The American newspaper, the Chicago Daily News, in its issue of February 15, 1915, printed a rather lengthy article entitled "The Hope of Poland". The article is written in favor of the Polish cause, and we reprint a few excerpts below.</p>
   <p>"From April 25, 1795," writes the Daily News, "when King Stanislaw August unwillingly abdicated from the throne of the kingdom of Poland and left for St. Petersburg to spend the remainder of his life, freedom has been the sole dream of the Poles, that great people. The Pole's devotion to freedom and the magnificent pages of the history of their nation have made of them romantic figures in every country. Poles have fought and died for the cause of freedom under various flags. In the minds of Americans the names of Kosciusko and Pulaski are synonyms of freedom. Because of this friendship that unites this country with the Poles the fate which awaits the dismembered but still living Poland at the conclusion of the present war greatly interests the people of the United States.</p>

   <p>"After a hundred and forty years under the yoke of slavery laid upon the nation by her present rulers, Russia, Austria, and Germany, which [divided and] annexed the Polish kingdom, the dream of resurrecting Poland will eventually be realized. Each of these three aggressors has made promises to the Poles.... Austria-Hungary--as rumors have it--is to have a Polish king enthroned in Cracow, the historic capital and seat of Polish education. The dual monarchy has always treated its Polish subjects relatively well. At present it anticipates that by creating a nominal Polish kingdom in these times, it will be more easily able to take over that part of Poland which is now held by Russia. It seems that Austria, in her plans, wishes to outmaneuver her ally, Germany.</p>
   <p>"At the time of Prussia's big drive on Warsaw," says F. McCullagh, the Daily News correspondent, "The Sass prince accompanied the German army for the purpose of occupying the Polish throne if the German army entered Warsaw, the capital of Poland."</p>
   <p>Here the Daily News mentions that there were two kings of that dynasty who ruled Poland, but it is in error when it says that the last Polish king, Stanislaw August, was also of the Sass line.)</p>

   <p>"It must be remembered that a hundred years ago promises were given to Poland when Poles fought and died by the thousand for Napoleon because he promised to recreate their kingdom for them. He gave them the Duchy of Warsaw, a mere shadow of independence. At presence the Poles have Russia's promise of a united autonomous Polish kingdom if the Allies are victorious in the present war. At the same time Austria and Germany also make promises to the Polish people, wishing to gain their favor.</p>
   <p>"At the present time a middle class of people, which has made famous nations wealthy, has appeared and is developing in Poland. It is this strong middle class which forms the care of present-day society. If Poland should emerge out of this cataclysm of war a free and united nation, her people will know how to use their freedom..."</p>
