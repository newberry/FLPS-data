   <p>Five Polish girls, who came to this country from Poland not very long ago, were the first to register in the women's employment office at the Chicago Herald and Examiner. When they applied at the office of the manager for jobs left vacant by men, they specified they wanted "patriotic jobs" in order to help America and Poland "beat the Kaiser". One of them could not speak a word of English; the others spoke in broken English, but were able to explain what they wanted and describe what kind of work they had done in the country of their birth.</p>
   <p>Since from their previous experience and their physical appearance it looked as if they could do men's work, they were promised jobs in airplane factories.</p>
   <p>The names of these patriotic girls are: Alice Myszkowski, Camilla Jarocki, Stella Glochowalski, W. Jorzak, and Julia Zurawiecki.</p>
