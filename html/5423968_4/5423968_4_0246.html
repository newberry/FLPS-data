   <p>Yesterday afternoon, a great mass meeting was held at Pulaski Hall under the auspices of the united Ukrainian societies of Chicago. A parade from Oakley Boulevard to the hall, in which thousnads of persons dressed in colorful national costumes participated, preceded the mass meeting. The Ukrainians gave proof of two things yesterday: that their national spirit has not died, and that, together with other Slavs, they are working for independence and the defeat of the Prussians and Austrians, who not only started the present war but sowed dissension among the Slavs in order to profit by their disunion. They [the Prussians and Austrians] always have known and know now that a union of Slavs would bring certain ruin upon them. Knowing this, they have always used every effort to prevent the Slavs from reaching an understanding, for while the Slavs quarrelled among themselves, the Germans and Austrians took <span class="page-break">\2</span>advantage of the situation. This was easily done in the past, but today it will no longer be possible, for the Slavic nations have matured and are convinced of the traitorous intentions of the tyrants who have already betrayed the Poles and other Slavs once. The united Slavic nations would make an unconquerable power, the very thought of which makes the Germans and Austrians tremble with fear of vengeance for their cruelties, their oppression, and their betrayal.</p>
   <p>The mass meeting opened at about three o'clock in the afternoon, before a hall filled to capacity, with the singing of "The Star Spangled Banner". The first speaker was the chairman of the meeting, Doctor W. Sieminowicz, who was followed by the Reverend N. J. Strutynski. Other Ukrainian speakers were Dr. H. Hryniewiecki, P. Tkalz, the Reverend N. Kuzma, F. Stefankiw, the Reverend G. Homitski, S. Jandwicz, and H. Krykoniaz.</p>
   <p>Nearly all of the speakers spoke on the same subject. Since the principal <span class="page-break">\3</span>purpose of yesterday's meeting was to help bring about a union of the Slavic nations, the speakers adhered closely to this subject, saying that the time has come for an understanding among the Slavs and for a general Slavic union. There was not one speaker who did not insist that this is no time for dissension, or for revenge for past occurrences, which, after all, are attributable to the Germans; that the Slavs should work hand in hand for the defeat of their common enemies, the Germans and the Austrians. The speakers also laid emphasis on the fact that the Polish-Ukrainian question must be settled by those two nations and that the Germans and Austrians have no right to interfere. Everyone of the speakers closed with the cry: "Long live free Poland'. Long live free Ukrainia!" A resolution to this effect was approved and sent to Washington.</p>
   <p>A very good address was delivered in English by Congressman M. McCormick who said that America will not lay down her arms until the small countries of <span class="page-break">\4</span>Europe have been avenged and until the Huns are defeated. Among other things, he mentioned that such able soldiers as Kosciusko and Pulaski had fought at Washington's side for the freedom of America, and that for this reason America is obligated to fight for the freedom of oppressed nations until the Germans beg for peace on bended knee.</p>
   <p>The well-known Polish lawyer, M. Kaczmarek, also spoke in English and was thunderously applauded for his splendid address.</p>
   <p>John F. Smulski spoke in Polish in behalf of the Poles. His appearance upon the platform brought forth a storm of applause. Smulaski spoke very well, pointing out that the Poles are very anxious to see Ukrainia a free country on an equal basis with free Poland, and that at present the sole aim of the Slavic nations should be to unite strongly in order to crush the Prussian <span class="page-break">\5</span>hydra. He said also that any misunderstandings between the Poles and the Ukrainians were the result of German and Austrian propagnda, which seeks to keep the Slavic nations in discord, because of the fear of the power that would result from their union. He concluded with the words: "Long live Ukrainia! Long live Poland and every other Slavic nation!" Seemingly unending applause followed.</p>
   <p>Other speakers were: J. Stephina, in behalf of the Czechs; Dr. A. Biankini, in behalf of the Croatians; J. Palandech, in behalf of the Serbs; and J. Zuzek, in behalf of the Slovaks. All of them spoke on the same subject, namely, Slavic union, a very important matter. They did not neglect to use the occasion to express their hopes that the base Prussians and Austrians would be defeated as soon as possible. One of the least desirable speakers at a moment of such importance was the Reverend N. Pakalnis, a Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's mass meeting was a Ukrainian meeting having for its purpose the <span class="page-break">\6</span>union of Slavs and a general improvement in their mutual relations. The Reverend Pakalnis, since he had attended the meeting at all, should have controlled himself, despite his hatred of the Poles and of Slavs in general. Surely he must have noticed the prevailing sentiment and the general desire for unity; thus, as a speaker, and, in addition, as a non-Slav--as a Lithuanian who hates Slavs--he ought to have held his peace and not touched upon irrelevant and irritable matters. After all, it was known to the Reverend Pakalnis that the purpose of the meeting was to unite the Slavs and not incite them one against the other. The Reverend Pakalnis said in his address:".... our enemy, Poland, took Lithuania and Ukrainia by force; and when Poland was conquered, it dragged Lithuania and Ukrainia into Slavery with it." What sort of history has the Reverend Pakalnis been reading that he could say such absurdities? He merely incurred the displeasure of those present who knew their history, who knew that this was not so. Our Lithuanian friends should never forget that Poland does not desire to force its authority upon anyone; the Poles are a freedom-loving nation, which is fighting for freedom at present, <span class="page-break">\7</span>and which desires freedom not only for themselves, not only for all Slavs, but for all nations. The fears of the Lithuanians are unfounded, for Poland wants, and is fighting for, only that which is rightfully Polish; Poland does not seek to take under her wing those who are now slandering her.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's meeting was, in general, a success, for the desire for unity among the Slavs was a sincere one. May that unity come as soon as possible, for then Slavic power would forever destroy German pretensions!</p>
