   <p>The mass meeting announced by the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance, for the purpose of organizing a society to help the Red Cross in humanitarian work in the event that the United States should enter the war, and to train its members in nursing, brought together a rather large number of patriotic Polish women. This was an excellent example of the fact that in really important matters Polish women, regardless of what their organizational affiliations are, can unite in co-operative work for a common cause.</p>
   <p>It was indeed gratifying to see Polish women affiliated with the Polish National Alliance, sitting beside members of the Polish Women's Alliance, Polish Roman Catholic Union, and the Polish Alma Mater, in order to discuss together what can be done to help in the present situation and how to go about it.</p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Mary Sakowski, president of the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance, presided at the meeting, which was opened at about 3 P.M. She called upon the city editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy to take down the minutes of the meeting. The chairman frequently voiced her opinion in important disputes and called upon the ladies present to deliver addresses.</p>
   <p>The first speaker on the program was Dr. A. [Anna] Wyczolkowski, [Ph.D.], who in a rather lengthy speech not only indicated the need of the women's organizing for war work, but also, in a scholarly manner, expressed her idea of what war is, what its causes are, and what influence women have on it. We regret that we cannot, for lack of space, summarize the speaker's instructive lecture.</p>
   <p>Relating to women's becoming organized for war work, Dr. Wyczolkowski stated that the character of the organization should be humanitarian, that the purpose of the women's society should be to bring aid to those who might need it and not to encourage war hysteria.</p>
   
   <p>Elementary training in hygiene and nursing are, in the opinion of the speaker, one of the most important needs of our community, regardless of whether we enter the war or not. The speaker had contacted, in the matter of arranging appropriate courses, the following Polish doctors: Dr. [L.] Tabenski, Dr. [Mary O.] Kaczorowski, and others. They all declared that if a sufficient number of women and girls, eager to learn and having a sense of duty, get together, they would be glad to offer their services. They advised, however, that before taking any definite steps an appropriate commission be delegated to contact the Polish Medical Society for the purpose of working out definite plans.</p>
   <p>Mrs. [Casimira] Obarski, honorary vice-president of the Polish National Alliance, gave a touching expression, in her speech, to the fact that the country which accepted us wanderers and permitted us to enjoy the liberty which was torn away from us in our own country deserves the gratitude of the Polish women.</p>
   <p>Dr. [Mary O.] Kaczorowski, [M.D.], who spoke next, supported the idea of the Polish women's organizing for the purpose of bringing help to those who need it. She placed particular emphasis on the fact that the work of the Polish women should take on a cosmopolitan character, because "one should do good to everybody." She also called attention to the great need of a knowledge of hygiene. "Women," she said, "who acquire a knowledge of hygiene will be able to work effectively for the country, and for their families and neighbors as well. Such women will leave behind them the memory that they did not live in vain." The speaker, in conclusion, suggested that the plans of the Polish women be published in both the Polish and English languages.</p>
   <p>Mrs. [Mary] Osuch, called upon to speak, declared that she wholly agreed with the ideas of the preceding speakers.</p>
   <p>Mrs. [Anna] Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance, declared in the next speech that the idea suggested by the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance meets with the support of her organization; that in her organization Polish women also are considering how best to help those who are fighting to defend America's honor. The Polish Women's Alliance--in the words of the speaker--will work together with the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Mrs. M. [Magdalene] Milewski delivered an inspiring address. Her words, full of patriotic zeal, encouraged immediate action to aid our adopted country.</p>
   <p>"We do not want war," said the speaker, "but when war is inevitable, when humanity's greatest enemy, who has oppressed Poland for more than a century, reaches out for this country, where we have found freedom and protection, it is our duty to pay our debt of gratitude."</p>
   <p>At Mrs. Milewski's suggestion, a resolution committee was appointed, composed of the following: Dr. Wyczolkowski, Miss [Emily] Napieralski, Mrs. M. Milewski, Osuch, K. Obarski.</p>
   <p>After a discussion of less important matters, the business of electing officers was taken up. Mrs. M. Sakowski received the first nomination for president, which nomination was seconded unanimously. Mrs. Sakowski, nevertheless, refused to run for the office, stating that she wished that this office be given to one of the ladies from one of the other organizations, in order to bring about greater interorganizational co-operation. Therefore, Miss E. Napieralski, secretary of the Polish Women's Alliance, was unanimously elected. The results of the elections for other offices were as follows--vice-presidents: Mrs. M. Milewski, of the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance; Mrs. Osuch, of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; and Mrs. Baranowski, of the Polish Alma Mater; secretaries: Mrs. K. Obarski; (recording) and M. Sakowski; (financial); treasurer: Mrs. Neuman, president of the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The following were appointed to the auxiliary committee: Bucholc, Zebal, Delatur, Mucha, M. Kuflewski, H. Jezierski, and Misses W. Chodzinski, Palasz, Czuj, J. Wroblewski, M. Mysliwiec, L. Dworzycki, and Ulatowski.</p>
   <p>The subject of an appropriate name for the organization and the matter of dues called forth a rather lengthy discussion. The final results achieved were as follows:</p>
   <p>The society will be called The League of Polish Women Co-operating With the Red Cross. The dues for members are insignificant, amounting only to five cents per month. Such small dues were decided upon for the purpose of getting as many members as possible. Nevertheless, each member can give as much as she sees fit.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Neuman and Mrs. Milewski set the example by stating that they would each contribute one dollar per month.</p>
   <p>After a few more matters had been attended to, the meeting was adjourned with the singing of national anthems.</p>
   <p>The Society of Polish women, having the above-mentioned aims, is now an established fact. Members who have joined this society have vowed to work in accordance with their strength and ability, counting on the support of all the Polish women in Chicago. It is therefore the duty of all Polish women who have not yet done so to join at once the League of Polish Women Co-operating With the Red Cross. All Polish women whom circumstances prevent from joining the organization should remember that they can do a great deal of good by giving the members of the League their financial and moral support. The Polish press, which leads in the support of patriotic activities of the Polish-Americans, is asked to asked to support the work and noble aims of the League of Polish Women.</p>
   <p>At the mass meeting called together by the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance and representatives of other Polish organizations of Chicago, it was decided that all Polish women, regardless of what organization, if any, they belong to, and in general all Polish women remaining outside of our Polish organizations, should unite at the present time in order to prepare for the proper fulfillment of their civic and humanitarian duties in the event that we should be involved in the war.</p>
   
   <p>Since for work of this sort willingness, a great deal of good will, generosity, and sacrifice are absolutely necessary, it has been decided that a permanent women's organization be formed under name of The League of Polish Women, whose purpose will be to try to train groups of Polish women, who could help not only at home but on the battlefields, as circumstances may demand.</p>
   <p>It has also been decided to contact our most influential Polish immigrants and physicians in order to ask them for theoretical and practical advice in all branches of first aid and trained hospital assistance.</p>
   <p>By proceeding thus, we serve the cause of society, show the United States our fidelity and loyalty, and the President of the greatest and most noble republic our gratitude for his support of the Polish cause, and by uniting with all American citizens we express a community of ideas and aims, as well as love for the United States.</p>
   
   <p>We declare in the name of all those present at the meeting that whatever happens we Polish women will loyally stand behind the decisions of our leader and President and will go along with our President and the American people as becomes citizens of the United States.</p>
