   <p>The meeting of the newly organized League of Polish Women Co-operating with the Red Cross, held yesterday evening at the Polish Women's Alliance Building, gave new evidence that the patriotic work of Polish women continues to progress and has aroused the interest of all the Polish women in Chicago. All the members of the League were present, as well as those women who wanted to join the League. As a result the hall was crowded.</p>
   <p>At the invitation of the officers of the League, Dr. A. Kuflewski, president of the Polish Medical Society, explained to the women assembled that the work which they are undertaking to serve the country is not a pleasant pastime but hard, tedious work. Therefore it must be treated seriously. Dr. Kuflewski submitted a very carefully worked out plan of courses for which the members may enroll in order to gain an elementary knowledge of hygiene and surgery.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kuflewski proposed:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>1) That the presidents of all the Polish organizations be sponsors of the League. This would give the League an assurance of its development and effectual work;</p>
   <p>2) That the League be incorporated in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois;</p>
   <p>3) That the Polish organizations grant the League regular financial support to cover its indispensable expenditures for equipment, uniforms, etc.;</p>
   <p>4) That the women and girls, upon completion of the hygiene-surgery course, all wear the same type of nurse's uniform.</p>
   <p>The most important basic principles of surgery and hygiene will be explained at the lectures. The student will also be given an elementary course in contagious diseases and hospital organization.</p>
   <p>The course will last six months, with four classes a week. Upon completion <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the course each student will be given a diploma which will entitle her to work at hospitals or base hospitals, that is, hospitals behind the lines.</p>
   <p>The courses are to begin on March 1. All Polish nurses should be invited to attend and the students should work with them.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kuflewski's proposals, one after the other, were turned into motions which were passed almost unanimously. It was therefore decided that (1) the officers of the League would see to its incorporation; (2) that the League will invite the presidents of all Polish organizations to be its sponsors; (3) that one type of uniform will be used. A committee on uniforms, consisting of Mmes. Koralewski, Roda, and Sluzinski, will bring swatches to the next meeting.</p>
   <p>All the other proposals of Dr. Kuflewski were accepted, with the exception of the one requesting regular financial support from Polish organizations. This matter was left for future discussion. In further discussions with Dr. Kuflewski, the League decided the following:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The lectures will be held at the large hall of the Polish Women's Alliance Building. There will be afternoon and evening lectures. Lectures will be given in both the Polish and English languages. Only Polish physicians will give the lectures, for which they will receive no financial remuneration. All healthy women and girls may enroll for the courses regardless of age.</p>
   <p>The lecture hall will be open to all women, regardless of whether they are members of the League or not. Therefore, every woman may attend lectures on hygiene and surgery.</p>
   <p>In conclusion it was decided that the treasurer of the League post a $500 bond.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the League will be held next Friday, promptly at 8 P. M., at the Polish Women's Alliance Building. All women and girls are invited to attend.</p>
