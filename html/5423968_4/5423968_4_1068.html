   <p>Count Tadeusz Dzieduszyeki, who recently came to the United States, explained in a press interview that the purpose of his visit here is to find out what is the secret of the American success, and of the powerful influence the United States exerts over the entire world.</p>
   <p>He would like, as he said, to learn that secret and take it to Poland, in order to utilize it for his country's benefit and prosperity.</p>
   <p>We do not claim to be able to solve important economic, or social problems, but perhaps some of our modest remarks will help Count Dzieduszyeki to discover that "secret of success" for which he is searching.</p>
   <p>The basic principle of the superb growth of our beautiful country has been freedom and equality of its citizens. All, who had been persecuted because of their religious, social or political convictions, found here a harbor of justice, where they could express themselves in accordance <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>with their conscience.</p>
   <p>Thanks to this spirit the great family of citizens of the United States grew very rapidly.</p>
   <p>Freedom and justice for everyone brings about love and attachment to the country, and helps to develop the creative faculties of a man.</p>
   <p>That is why anyone who has been in the United States for a certain period of time, becomes attached to this country, and even if he goes back to his native land he always longs for America.</p>
   <p>Although the United States is a conglomeration of various races and nations, everyone here cherishes love for the new fatherland, and probably there is no other country in the world where patriotism of its citizens can equal that of the people of the United States.</p>
   <p>Freedom and justice for everyone is the source of true brotherhood, regardless of religious or political differences.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>That brotherly relationship does not exist in Poland, nor in any other country where the Roman-Catholic faith predominates. This church is the sower of hatred. It throws anathemas on all those who withdraw from the papal servitude. It poisons the minds and the souls of children by teaching them that whoever does not believe in the Roman-Catholic Church is a person of lower rank, and as such should be avoided like contagion.</p>
   <p>Of course, citizens thus brought up, infected with hatred and intolerance, cannot be expected to create a mutually understanding family, nor can they be expected to contribute much to the development of their country.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, there is not and there will not be anything of that kind in America. Because here, thank God, the papal paganism does not have much to say.</p>
   <p>The noble forefathers of this country based the foundations of our happy republic on the true Christian principles of freedom, justice and love.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>And this is the foremost reason for the magnificent growth of our beautiful country, the harbor of all persecuted peoples in the world.</p>
