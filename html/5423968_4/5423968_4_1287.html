   <p>Today the first group of Polish people are migrating to the states of Washington and Oregon. They will receive free, tracts of land which they are to cultivate and live on. The reason for this migration is; the working man cannot make a living in the over populated city, there is a lack of work, and the wages were cut.</p>
   <p>The Polish people were raised on farms, therefore they are more adapted to farm life. Many more are following their example.</p>
   <p>A group of Poles will leave every month for Washington and Oregon, to start small town or communities best suited for themselves. In charge of this migration movement are Mr. Ossowski and Mr. Bednarek.</p>
