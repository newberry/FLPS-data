   <p>The Milwaukee Kuryer Polski (Polish Courier), a weekly paper, has received the following information, dated December 27, from Omaha, Nebraska:</p>
   <p>"After two weeks of parleys between Count Lubienski and the Commercial Club, an agreement has been finally reached whereby a sugar refinery is to be built here next year. Count Lubienski has guaranteed to build the factory and the Commercial Club has agreed to subscribe for $100,000 worth of shares. Lubienski intends to settle two hundred Polish families here. In the Elkhorn Valley another sugar refinery will be built."</p>
   <p>(Translator's note: The Poles in Chicago were vitally interested in thie colonization project.)</p>
