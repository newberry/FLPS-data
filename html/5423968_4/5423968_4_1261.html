   <p>I wish to announce that a new society, to be known as Zorza Poranna (Sunrise) Ladies' Society, was organized here yesterday.</p>
   <p>The object of the society is to promote education among its members and provide sick benefit payments. The Zorza Poranna Society will arrange entertainments, recitals, concerts, theatrical performances, and national celebrations; in short, everything that will serve to awaken the national spirit and help elevate the moral and mental outlook of its members. At present there are thirty-nine Polish women entered on the membership roll.</p>
   <p>At the first meeting, which was held on Sunday, January 12, in a hall at 8247 Superior Avenue, the following officers were elected. Mrs. M. Zagorski, <span class="page-break">\2</span>president; Mrs. Chmielewski, vice-president; Mrs. K. Obarski, secretary; Miss M. Czerwinski, recording secretary; Miss Follmer, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held on Sunday, January 29, at the home of the president.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that this society of Polish women is necessary, and we sincerely hope that our ladies will join in the greatest possible number.</p>
