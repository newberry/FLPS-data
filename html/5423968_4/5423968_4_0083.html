   <p>Alderman Stanley H. Kunz of the sixteenth ward has served five odius terms in the city council. He is now seeking re-election.</p>
   <p>Alderman Kunz voted the wrong way whenever he had the chance. He has worked against the interests of the city, and consequently against the interests of his ward. He has betrayed his city and his ward and thereby caused them damage.</p>
   <p>He has no conception of the duties of his office. He looks upon re-election merely as a new ticket of admission to a happy grafting ground. He is shameless. He goes up and down his ward boasting of his bad record, and asking votes on the strength of it.</p>
   <p>The decent and respectable elements of the ward are united in the support of his opponent K. B. Czarnecki, whose qualities give promise that he will be a useful and valuable member of the city council and a credit to his ward.</p>
   <p>The voters of the Sixteenth ward have a double reason for voting for Mr. Czarnecki. One is to get our Czarnecki in. The other is to get Mr. Kunz out.</p>
