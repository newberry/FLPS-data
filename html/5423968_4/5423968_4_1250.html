   <p>Women suffragists assembled in Springfield, Illinois today with the aim of demanding from the State legislature, the right to vote. The affair has created a great bustle, even though the members of the State legislature endeavor to make a joke of this whole affair. It is evident that they are dismayed about giving a decision on this matter, brought about by the suffragettes.</p>
   <p>Aside from the right to vote the suffragists also demand a complete equalization, political and social, with the men. Their demands were formulated on a roll of paper to which was appended a vast amount of signatures. This lengthy roll of paper measures a hundred and fifty yards.</p>
   <p>The delegation consists of the following women:</p>
   <p>Ella Stewart, President of the Illinois Equal Voters Club: Minnie Watkins, President of the Illinois Womens' Alliance Club; Mary Kuhl, President of the W. C. T. U.; L. Ducanson, President of the Chiocago's Equal Rights Political <span class="page-break">2</span>League; Ada Cracker, President of the Northern Voters' League; H. Sloate, President of the Evanston Political Equal Rights League; Dr. R. Wistine of the Womens' Czechs Club; and Catherine McCulloch.</p>
   <p>Their petition had already been presented to their representative, Sheldon, before the delegation arrived here, to be present and witness their own committees' discussions, selected specially for this meeting.</p>
   <p>In this way Chicago's women have been the first in America to form a serious organization to claim the rights and power which has been prohibited them.</p>
   <p>The "mighty" would desire and hope to see them as inanimated dolls and playthings, designed for pleasure</p>
