   <p>Tomorrow is the last day for subscribing to the Liberty Loan and for purchasing government bonds. At twelve o'clock noon the books will be closed to subscribers and no one will have further opportunity of having the honor of being listed as one of Uncle Sam's creditors.</p>
   <p>Today the Germans look toward America with fear, asking whether the citizens of the United States will fulfill their duty to their country and, by tomorrow, subscribe the entire two-billion-dollar loan. Up to this morning, 342 millions were still lacking; this quota must be filled within the next twenty-four hours.</p>
   <p>Thus far, Chicago has not filled its quota. Until yesterday evening, Chicago had subscribed $217,826,000, while the government estimated that Chicago would subscribe at least $260,000,000, and perhaps as high as $350,000,000. If, then, the residents of Chicago are to fulfill their duty, they must <span class="page-break">2</span>subscribe $4,000,000 every hour to meet the minimum quota.</p>
   <p>Enthusiasm for the cause is growing steadily, and the banks are sure that the residents of Chicago will not prove themselves worse than others, and that they will do their duty properly.</p>
   <p>Bonds can be purchased on payments as low as two dollars weekly. Only two per cent need be paid at the time of subscription. If, for example, you are buying a hundred-dollar bond, you need to pay only two dollars down. You can pay the rest in weekly payments!</p>
   <p>It is as if you were taking money to the bank and saving it. In no time at all, after a few months, you will find that you have a hundred dollars or more, for in possessing a government bond you have the equivalent of the same amount of cash, and it will bring you three and a half per cent interest annually.</p>

   <p>This is our last appeal to you, countrymen. If you have not yet subscribed to the Liberty Loan, if you are still hesitating, make up your mind today and hasten to the bank in the last few hours, so that you, too, can find yourself on the list of those who, although they cannot fight in the trenches for freedom, have contributed their money to the cause, and have thus given their aid toward the victory of right over injustice.</p>
   <p>Remember that every dollar contributed to the struggle against Teutonism brings nearer the moment of our victory, and spares the blood of our brethren who are fighting, and will continue to fight, in many different armies.</p>
   <p>Today is American Flag Day!</p>
   <p>Display the flag of freedom in your window and let it wave over your home until noon tomorrow. In the meantime, go to the nearest bank and enter your name on the list of subscribers to the Liberty Loan. Subscribe as much as your means permit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Do this immediately, without looking around at others. Do your duty!</p>
