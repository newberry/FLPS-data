   <p>When, in view of the present situation, the censor and the president of the Polish National Alliance, acting in the name of the Advisory Board and the Central Board of Directors, respectively, sent their brethren in the organization, and all people of good will, an appeal emphasizing two things that Poland needs today, that is, more money in her treasury and an army, they believed sincerely that their plea would not go unanswered and that their brethren in the Alliance would not refuse to co-operate at a moment so extraordinary and full of hope for us.</p>
   <p>They were not disappointed. Unusual activity is seen everywhere. The fever of 1912 has taken possession again of everyone's mind, and the strain of waiting for the dreamed-of moment that is imminent redoubles the energy of our people.</p>
   <p>The old and exhausted plowmen of the national field, who now can scarcely hold <span class="page-break">2</span>the plow in their toilworn hands and on whose eyelids the tears of grief have already dried, have taken up action again and, with renewed energy, are beginning to collect funds for the national fund to free Poland, which we despaired of seeing free again.</p>
   <p>The young people who have inherited this plowshare from their fathers, and have likewise become plowmen in the national field, will hurry enthusiastically after them. The idea of fighting and spilling their blood for the freedom of the homeland lends extraordinary strength to their muscles and goads them to action. The time for action will now arrive sooner than they had expected.</p>
   <p>The Polish women, who have also joined the ranks as workers, have vowed that they will work from morning till night if by so doing they can add one little brick to the great structure. With the aid of a map and information gathered from the newspapers, they point out to their children the location and names of the Polish cities and the places famous for miracles that the Prussians are taking, indicating to them where Poland used to extend, and on whose lands <span class="page-break">3</span>the enemies are now fighting. They exult at the thought that the cities, towns, and fields of Poland, now trampled upon and sacked by the enemy, soon will become Poland's indivisible possession.</p>
   <p>The people have begun action. The masses, generous and freedom-loving, numbering millions, want to offer their hard-earned contributions, to thus helping in the building of a great edifice in which all may sit down, the free with the free and the equal with the equal, at the same festive board, in order to shed the last tear of hardship and eat the last crust of bread gained in slavery.</p>
   <p>That these masses work for their beloved country and not for their own fame, gain, government posts, or sinecures is illustrated by the following letter from an anonymous writer, who did not want to sign his name lest it appear that he was acting in the hope of getting himself praised and admired by the people for his truly civic deed, worthy of emulation.</p>
   <p>This letter, written to Mr. J. Magdziarz, cashier of the Polish National Alliance, reads as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"Chicago, Illinois, August 5, 1914.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir: "Foreseeing that, as a result of the present terrible European war, in which our eternal enemies are now murdering each other, the dawn of free Poland is beginning to break, I, a Polish laborer, feeling that Poland, our mother, will soon be needing our help in armed men as well as in material things, consider it my duty to offer material aid on the altar of the homeland. For the present I will contribute two dollars out of my weekly earnings for an unlimited time, which sum I will double or triple as soon as my living expenses permit.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully,</p>
   <p>"A. W. F.</p>
   <p>"P. S. The attached sum, as you know, should be forwarded to the Department of Independence.</p>
   <p>"Long live democratic Poland, free and independent!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>This letter, simple and sincere, brings tears to the eyes. This man grasping the meaning of the appeal and understanding our present position, hurries, regardless of the sacrifice, to send us two dollars weekly as a regular contribution for the military fund, promising to contribute more just as soon as he regulates his domestic needs.</p>
   <p>Such are the sons of Poland, and there are millions of them! It is impossible to imagine a single Pole who, at such a time as this, would not lay his offerings on the altar of the homeland. May this anonymous letter serve as an example of how we should work for Poland--quietly, efficiently, and without seeking applause. May it, at the same time, be a stimulus for those who, perhaps, have been assailed by a momentary doubt.</p>
   <p>We believe implicitly that today there is not a single Pole who would shirk the work of collecting contributions; not a single one of them, man or woman, who would mind making any sacrifices for the two things which Poland needs most--money in her treasury and an army.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance, having now its own Department of Independence, which is in charge of collecting contributions and donations, assures all contributors that the money donated by them will not be used for political purposes, but will go into the hands of those who are struggling for the freedom and independence of Poland.</p>
   <p>Therefore, to work, countrymen!</p>
