   <p>An area on the northwest side, in the vicinity of Division Street, Chicago and North Avenues, and Robey Street, is in greater need of a suitable, children's playgrounds than any other community in Chicago. The people living here are mostly Polish.</p>
   <p>There is a building on every available plot of land in the neighborhood; and children are compelled to play in the streets, the sidewalks, or in filthy, foul-smelling alleys, because other places are not to be had. It is true, however, that there are playgrounds further west, but for the children of this congested area, they are not conveniently located and are unquestionably too far away.</p>

   <p>Due to these conditions, many children each year are injured, maimed, or killed. This street and alley environment is certainly not a healthful one for our youth. It is useless for the folks of this community to provide good schools for their children because their minds and morals are moulded by the environment of the streets and alleys. Children will be children, they must play in order to exercise their growing bodies. It is impossible to keep them at home all the time. The fathers and mothers of this community are almost helpless in coping with this problem.</p>
   <p>Mischief, destruction of property and minor thievery, are the only objects of diversion these children can find, because of the lack of playground facilities. They congregate in dark hallways, basements and dark corners, where they cannot very easily be observed, and all sorts of crime and immorality is perpetrated. Playgrounds, however, would keep the children in the open, and athletic games and sports would keep them occupied all the time.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, the duty of the community to change these conditions by providing decent, wholesome places of amusement, where our youth may gather and play.</p>

   <p>It is true, that it will require money to do this, but if it will save our children, it will be money well spent. Isn't the welfare of our children worth this investment? It will be necessary to raze a few buildings, but this should not stand in the way of providing clean and wholesome environment for our youth.</p>
   <p>Let us, therefore, all get together, business men, the press, teachers, and clergy, as well as fathers and mothers, and demand this necessary improvement. We can get it. We are entitled to it just as are other communities in the city. The Juvenile Protective Association will gladly back this movement.</p>
