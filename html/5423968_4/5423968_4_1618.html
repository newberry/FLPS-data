   <p>The members of the Associated Polish Traders' and Importers' Corporation, gathered on August 19, 1918, in the Polish Women's Alliance Hall at 1209 North Ashland Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, upon a motion made by Mr. M. Golinowski, do adopt the following resolution:</p>
   <p>Whereas, The Poles of Chicago are predominantly of the hard-working class and are burdened with large families; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, This same Polish populace is obliged to purchase its food at a price that is one-third higher than it would be in organized business; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, In spite of the fact that this Polish populace pays higher prices, Polish business is unable to rise, since it does not possess its own enterprises or wholesale houses; and</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Whereas, Polish businessmen, not having Polish wholesale houses, are obliged to purchase goods from people of non-Polish nationality and pay higher prices and by so doing are compelled to retail at a higher price; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Such conditions prevail because many Polish businessmen fail to recognize the benefits that might arise of such co-operative enterprises, which would prove to their advantage as well as to that of the purchasers; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Because of such failure to recognize the benefits [of such an enterprise] businessmen abstain from co-operating with any such movement to better the business conditions of Polish retailers; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Such lack of good will of failure to understand what is for the general good annually causes to our people enormous financial losses; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, It is high time that our people contemplate serious action to create bigger and stronger Polish trade and commerce; therefore, be it</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Resolved, That we offer recognition and words of encouragement to those who understand this need, and who have given active support to create such Polish co-operative enterprises, and that we call upon our Polish people and urge them to support such Polish enterprises and all those Polish people who by the mere fact that they even think of co-operative trade and are not motivated merely the thought of personal gain are deserving of the support of our buyers, since they create a better name for the Polish people among other nationalities; and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved. That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to and spread upon every Polish newspaper in Chicago.</p>
