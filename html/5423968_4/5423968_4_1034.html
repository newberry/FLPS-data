   <p>The local Record is carrying on an energetic crusade against the immoral houses along Milwaukee Avenue and all over the West Side of Chicago; such places have a demoralizing influence upon our youth. Yesterday, Chief of Police Badenoch, and his assistant, Mr. Ross, visited a dozen concert halls and suspicious places in the vicinity. They should certainly find some way to curb these debauchers of our youth.</p>
   <p>In addition, a great mass meeting will be held on Sunday, at three o'clock in the afternoon, in the large parish hall on Bradley Street, where the residents of this ward will be given an opportunity to protest against these immoral houses and to condemn them.</p>
   <p>Many well-known men of Polish and other nationalities will speak. There will probably be many citizens of other nationalities present; we are not the only <span class="page-break">2</span>ones concerned in this matter. In any event, as many Poles as possible should attend, and protest strongly against the wave of immorality that is threatening to engulf us.</p>
