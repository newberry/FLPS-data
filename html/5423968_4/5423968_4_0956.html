   <p>Recently a law was passed in the State of Illinois granting pensions to those mothers who are burdened with large families, and who, due to various circumstances, find themselves in abject poverty, unable to support themselves, their children, or their sick or crippled husbands. These pensions are for the most part granted to poor widows with many children, who otherwise would have to suffer indescribable poverty and would have to beg for human pity.</p>
   <p>As a start, pensions are now being paid indigent mothers in Cook County, in which Chicago is located. Here at last there were brought to light the terrible poverty of the laboring class and the number of poor families needing aid. The County Agent, who pays out these pensions in accordance with the law, announces that in Cook County alone there are 30,000 families who would have to be aided in accordance with the new law, and that between fifty and one hundred indigent mothers apply to him daily for pensions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Agent, himself well-fed, well-dressed, and receiving a large salary, is filled with indignation toward the new law, asserting that if it continues in effect, Cook County will go bankrupt. He estimates that at least five million dollars annually will be necessary for pensions for indigent mothers. He therefore calls the new law "socialistic" and would like to see it repealed as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>We are utterly indifferent to the name anyone may choose to call this just law, because we say it is humane, deserving of support, and even worthy of being broadened. Just think of it! In order to avoid having Cook County spend five million dollars, thirty thousand poor, abandoned families must suffer poverty and must beg help elsewhere--help which they will not always find. But where millions of dollars overflow in abundance, where gold flows in streams for the excesses and luxuries of the wealthy, five million dollars is such a trifle that no one should be concerned about it, least of all the County Agent, from whose pocket this sum certainly will not come, and who, in addition, will himself probably benefit by the expenditure.</p>
   <p>The five million dollars for the pension fund for poor families could be <span class="page-break">\3</span>subscribed by the meat packers' trust alone, which exploits these unfortunate people and makes millions out of them. It would be worth while, then, to pass a law placing a permanent tax on various corporations; this tax would be destined for this pension fund, and would, therefore, not strain the county treasury, into which poor people pay taxes--taxes which rich people always know how to avoid.</p>
   <p>After all, the pensions granted large poverty-stricken families are not very big, since they reach a maximum of twenty dollars a month for families where there are many children. It is hard to support a family on this; yet, it is of some help, and it will keep many unfortunates from starving to death. There are some poor people with such pride that they will not hold out their palms for charity from various welfare societies,or appeal to the County Agent; but they will accept a pension provided by law, and thus lighten their painful lot to some extent.</p>
   <p>It is even the duty of society to take care of these unfortunate people who are the victims of circumstances not of their own making--people who <span class="page-break">\4</span>because of the present social system find themselves in abject poverty. Millions of dollars are spent for the luxuries and the tinsel of the privileged class. Why should not money be found for easing the heavy lot of the disinherited class? Why must the latter suffer unjustly for the greed and inhumanity of the former?</p>
   <p>In Chicago, deaths from starvation and suicides caused by poverty occur frequently; and people in general merely accept them and take them in their stride without in any way trying to remedy this abnormal situation. The American press mentions these occurrences only incidentally, in brief news items, treating them as ordinary daily happenings. On the other hand entire columns and pages are reserved for descriptions of matrimonial scandals and divorces in the "higher spheres;" they describe in the most minute detail all sorts of crimes; they write at great length about banquets and balls, describing the gown, the jewelry, and even the shoes worn by this or that millionaire's wife. But they will not descend into the small and damp basements; they will not look into the attics where the poor families of laborers live so humbly, where poverty reigns supreme.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>This law which provides pensions for indigent mothers burdened with large families we consider entirely fair and just, and we will defend it with all our might. This is the first great step on the part of society in the direction of taking a greater interest in those who are suffering from misfortune and poverty. And certainly, in a country so rich and abounding in all the gifts of nature, there should be no poverty. Laborers exhausted by work and disease will not die of starvation in this country, if all of society, guided by humanity and justice, desires to prevent this calamity.</p>
   <p>The state of Illinois may well be proud of the fact that it has taken this step--the enactment of the pension law. Let us hope that it will go even further in this direction and will ease the poverty which torments our brave sons of labor.</p>
