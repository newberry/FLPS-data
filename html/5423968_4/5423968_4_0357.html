   <p>St. Casimir's Parish, where the Reverend Albert Furman is pastor, held its first Polish Army mass meeting yesterday. Actually, this meeting was called for the purpose of discussing a national tax, but under pressure of public opinion, the Reverend Furman consented to allow Polish Army agitation. Delegated to this task as speakers, by Recruiting Center II, were J. Wedda, Treasurer of the [Central] Citizens' Committee, and H. Lokanski, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy. Profiting by his stay of a few hours in Chicago, Dr. A. Kasparek, recruiting officer for Omaha, Nebraska, who was on his way to the training camp, also attended the meeting. Thanks to the incomprehensible hostility of Father Furman to the Polish Army, the meeting was not as well attended as it should have been, although there was a considerable number of serious-minded parishioners in the hall. The Reverend Furman's hostility to Polish arms was already pronounced during the discussions on the national tax, but it came out most violently after the speakers had finished their addresses.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>H. Lokanski spoke first, describing not only the beginnings of the Polish Army but its development, its estimated size today, and the reasons why every one of us should try to make this army as large as possible.</p>
   <p>Following this address, Wedda spoke, explaining more broadly why Poles ought to fight, how great their duty is to their homeland, and their responsibilities to posterity if the present chances for achieving the independence of Poland are not made use of to the best advantage.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kasparek then spoke, giving the opinions of the most prominent European statesmen on Poland. He told how these opinions ought to be upheld in order that the greatest national, political, and economic benefits may be gained from the war.</p>
   <p>All of these speeches were highly inflammatory and enthusiastically applauded. The Reverend Furman, who had evidently been sitting as if on pins and needles, arose to say that all this enthusiasm and oratory is superfluous, for the <span class="page-break">\3</span>Poles do not need it (sic!). Since the hall was quiet--obviously the quiet of displeasure--Father Furman, in order to defeat a good cause, first denied the creditability of two of the speakers, saying that he did not know them, that he had other information about them from highly-placed people, and that the Polish Army is only sending agitators here to mislead the people. If not for the fact that these words were spoken by Father Furman, if not for the fact that both speakers are very well known in St. Casimir's Parish, where Lokanski, especially, has spoken at various gatherings for many years and, after one of them, was even a guest of Father Furman at the rectory; and, furthermore, if not for the fact that both speakers took the term "agitators" as a compliment rather than an insult, since today it is an honor to work for the Polish cause at least as an "agitator," the priest's words would not have gone unanswered There was sufficient satisfaction for the speakers in the speech by Pijanowski, who thanked them sincerely and promised that the healthy seed sown by them would produce a hundredfold crop in St. Casimir's Parish.</p>
   <p>Father Furman did not stop at this, however, In order to prevent establishment <span class="page-break">\4</span>of a recruiting station in St. Casimir's Parish, he attacked the Polish Army, supposedly for the good of those who might be considering enlistment. He claimed that the soldiers in the Polish Army are not paid, that despairing letters come from the training camp, that these soldiers are not insured, and that they receive no care. Father Furman himself knew that all this was not true, but he made these statements deliberately, with the intention of lowering the Polish Army in the eyes of his audience and discouraging enlistment.</p>
   <p>Father i scandalous attack was ably answered by one of his younger parishioners, who arose and said that all these accusations were untrue, for he himself has a brother in the Polish Army who is already in France, and a friend who is in the training camp. Letters from them, he said, do not find words enough in praise of the Polish Army and the way it is conducted. He admitted that the Polish soldiers complain of the shortage of tobacco, but all the soldiers in France lack tobacco. After all, that is what our citizens' committees are for, to supply our boys with tobacco, for they lack nothing <span class="page-break">\5</span>else. The audience rewarded him with a storm of applause, which added to Father Furman's displeasure, although he toned down and thereafter attacked less sharply.</p>
   <p>Point for point, Father Furman's accusations were then answered. How, when, and in what amount the Polish soldiers will be paid was explained by Wedda. Soldiers' insurance, technical arrangements in the training camps, and citizens' committee regulations were extensively explained by Dr. Kasparek. The gathering accepted these explanations with approval, which discouraged Father Furman from further attack. Since the speakers left the hall after these explanations, we do not know what further arguments the pastor used against the Polish Army. We know, however, that, whether he opposes it or not, a recruiting station will be established in St. Casimir's Parish, for the members of that parish have recognized their duty to their homeland.</p>
   <p>We believe, however, that the Reverend Furman will desist in his opposition and give his aid in this sacred cause.</p>
