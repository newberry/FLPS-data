   <p>A meeting of the Polish Liberty Bond Committee was held yesterday at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall. It was attended by a considerable number of representatives of Polish organizations, of business, of societies, and of the local press.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Judge [E.] Jarecki, president of the Committee for Cook County. He explained the aim of this new Polish organization, namely, to develope a campaign for the sale of the Third Liberty Loan bonds on the broadest possible scale. The speaker emphasized the fact that for the sale of the first two Liberty Loan bonds, the Poles were not organized and so, although a great many Poles purchased bonds, official circles in Washington did not know for certain to what extent the Poles had hastened to the government's aid. We are not concerned with the amounts of the bonds that are purchased, but with the number of purchases made. The chairman also pointed out that we <span class="page-break">\2</span>have three representatives in the main organization for the sale of Liberty bonds: Judge Jarecki for Cook County, N. L. Piotrowski for the State of Illinois, and J. F. Smulski for the five states of the Seventh Federal Reserve District.</p>
   <p>In order to accelerate the work, Chairman Jarecki advised that the presidents of individual subcommittees call a meeting before Saturday, to complete their committees and to begin their work immediately. The speaker explained the reasons why we Poles ought to support this loan most earnestly; namely, that of all the nations participating in the present war, Poland stands to receive the greatest benefits if the Allies win the war. The speaker mentioned events of the Spanish-American War, when a German commander tried to prevent Admiral Dewey from shelling the Spanish fleet and finally gave in only when Admiral Dewey told him that if the Germans wanted war, they could have it immediately. After this incident, the German General Goetzen, aboard an American steamship, said that in fifteen years the Germans would begin a great war in which they would occupy Paris in a short time, and that they would not only crush England <span class="page-break">\3</span>but would demand a huge indemnity from the United States. The speaker pointed out that the Germans started the great war not fifteen but sixteen years after this statement was made by the German general, and that if the French had not stopped them at the Marne, who knows but that by this time the United States might have been forced to pay tribute. "Is it not better, then, to lend our government the necessary money with which to defeat this dangerous enemy rather than, in case of our own defeat, be forced to give that enemy everything we possess?" asked the speaker.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Stanislaus Szwajkart, editor of Dziennik Chicagoski and chairman of the press committee, who spoke in behalf of the Polish press. He promised that, as from the beginning of the war, so to its end, the Polish press would support the government, and that editorial departments of the Polish newspapers would publicize the Third Liberty Loan to the fullest extent. A meeting of the press committee will be called this week by the main Liberty bond headquarters.</p>

   <p>The next speaker was William K. Flamm, who emphasized the duty of all of the Slavic national groups to this country, for this country has been attacked by the greatest enemy of mankind, freedom, and progress. He went on to say that the Polish press is performing its task splendidly, but that not all Poles read the newspapers. It is these who do not read the newspapers whom the committee should try to reach.</p>
   <p>A discussion on the ways to sell the greatest possible number of Liberty bonds took up a great deal of time. Some of the speakers on this subject were: Alderman Stanley Adamkiewicz, Reverend F. Wojtalewicz, S. K. Sass, Joseph Magdziarz, K. B. Czarnecki, Reverend [L.]Grudzinski, T. Stan, and many others whose names we cannot remember.</p>
   <p>The main subject of these speeches was that the Polish committee should do what it can to convince Polish purchasers of Liberty bonds that they should insist that their applications be made on blanks from the Polish division. The Committee is also to arrange for meetings in all of the Polish parishes <span class="page-break">\5</span>of Chicago so that the Polish public in general can be properly informed as to the importance of this matter. It was also emphasized that the subcommittees should hold meetings as soon as possible in order to get the work under way. Efforts will also be made to win over the stockyard workers, among whom, as is well known, Poles predominate. The chief concern here is to see that their applications indicate that their bonds are purchased through the Polish division and not through the efforts of their employers.</p>
   <p>After acceptance of a motion that an executive committee be named to take charge of the entire matter, the meeting was adjourned. The executive committee consists of the chairman of the subcommittees.</p>
   <p>A mass meeting concerning the sale of Liberty bonds, will be held tonight at the parish hall in St. Stanislaus Parish. This meeting should be attended by the greatest possible number of Poles from St. Stanislaus Parish as well as from neighboring parishes, for the question is an important one, which concerns all of us. Let us show that as citizens of this country we understand our duties <span class="page-break">\6</span>and that we are supporting the government in this great World War, upon the outcome of which depends not only the safety of this country but the freedom of Poland, and the return of right and justice to the world.</p>
   <p>The meeting will begin at 7:30 in the evening. The speakers will be capable Americans and well-known Poles who will adequately explain the purposes of the bonds.</p>
   <p>An incident that occurred at yesterday's meeting must be added to the above report. The Reverend Wojtalewicz, in discussing the Third Liberty Loan, declared that the Polish press has not given this matter enough publicity. Stanislaus Orpislewski, editor in chief of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, took the floor, and in answer to this generalization, replied with equal emphasis that the Reverend Wojtalewicz's statement rather misses the truth, for the press (Orpiszewski had in mind the Alliance papers) has long and earnestly been recommending Third Liberty Loan bonds to the Polish public. To this, Wojtalewicz replied that he did not withdraw his statement, that the newspapers, instead <span class="page-break">\7</span>of paying fifteen and twenty per cent dividends to their stockholders, should hire more reporters. Since the Alliance papers do not pay dividends, and since they have no stockholders, the people being the owners, Orpiszewski justly concluded that the Reverend Wojtalewicz was not referring to the Alliance papers and said no more. This concluded the incident.</p>
