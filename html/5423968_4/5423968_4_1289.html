   <p>The colonization project for Poles on the Pacific Coast has created quite a lot of interest here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A group of Polish citizens under the directorship of Dr. Stupnicki have become interested in it.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stupnicki, accompanied by another person, will travel to the states of Washington and Oregon, to investigate conditions for settlers. The doctor will spend several weeks there and on his return will share his findings with those interested in this project.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stupnicki has also promised to send our paper a report.</p>
