   <p>On Friday afternoon, a meeting of the publicity committee of the Polish Liberty Loan Bond Committee was held at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall. S. Szwajkart, editor in chief of Dziennik Chicagoski, and also chairman of the committee, presided. In addition, the following members were present at the meeting: H. Lokanski of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, Z. Stefanowicz of Dziennik Narodowy, L. Lesnicki of Kuryer Polski, and F. S. Barc, who was named secretary of the committee. A delegation from the Union of Polish Priests, consisting of the Reverends J. Obyrtacz, F. Feldman, and Warakomski, also attended. Standing guard over [Polish] national affairs, this delegation justly maintained that such causes as, for example, the [Polish] national tax and aid to the Polish Army, are not given the popular support which their importance merits. These matters were discussed from all sides in the search for a remedy. It was finally <span class="page-break">2</span>decided that the press should give its complete support to these causes, even to the extent of subordinating other matters, in order that there may be no delay, and that everyone may be reached.</p>
   <p>In reference to the Liberty Loan campaign, it was remarked that the Poles, despite the fact that they are doing everything possible, are not receiving proper recognition in the American press. The secretary was accordingly instructed, by the consent of the administration of the Polish Committee, to communicate with the Central Liberty Bond Headquarters and demand that this condition be rectified. Eventually, he is to send information to the Central Headquarters on how Liberty bond sales are progressing in Polish communities. Every dollar spent to purchase Liberty bonds is a bitter, poisonous pill for the Kaiser. In this case, also, the Polish press will do its part, for it was agreed that during the course of the campaign, each newspaper will carry one main article each week in addition to smaller articles and the latest news.</p>
   <p>The Poles ought to participate to the greatest possible extent in this campaign.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>They should prove not only that they are loyal citizens of the United States but that they are also grateful for what our great President has done for Poland.</p>
   <p>In order to spread this campaign and insure its success, the secretary was instructed to write frequent press releases for the daily papers, not only of the campaign's development but of the results. In order to accomplish this, he must keep in touch with the Central Headquarters and the Polish headquarters; in addition, speakers and committees are respectfully requested to communicate their speeches and the proceedings of meetings to the secretary, at 3139 North Ridgeway Avenue; telephone: Monticello 1850; and he will submit them to the newspapers.</p>
   <p>We cannot neglect this matter. We must prove that the Poles are doing everything within their means to lead in this campaign.</p>
   <p>Our organization consists of twelve committees, each of which has many duties <span class="page-break">4</span>to perform in its particular field. We believe that everything will go well, for we have begun to work vigorously and energetically; the Polish section has more speakers than any other. Some of the speakers who are often heard on this subject are Judge E. K. Jarecki, W. Jozwiakowski, F. Danisch, B. Bisek, L. Myka, L. Lesnicki, J. Konopa, and F. Barc. Our agents are energetically at work selling bonds--to such an extent that Teophilus Weyna, for example, sold a five-hundred-dollar bond to a German.</p>
   <p>The Liberty bond office at 1543 West Division Street is a Polish office, conducted by W. Zwiefka and B. Mindak, who inform us that they have sold over ten thousand dollars' worth of Liberty bonds. Mr. Mindak requests that anyone who doubts the authority of a bond salesman communicate with the office; telephone: Haymarket 2596.</p>
   <p>There are a great number of agents of other nationalities pushing the sales of Liberty bonds and attempting to sell them to the Polish people. In fact, in <span class="page-break">5</span>many factories it is compulsory to buy Liberty bonds. Since we must buy them, let us remember to mark "Polish Branch" on the application, so that the Poles will receive credit and recognition.</p>
   <p>Day before yesterday the St. Helen Building and Loan Association, of St. Helen's Parish, held its annual stockholders' meeting, where a certain number of bonds were sold. The Association and the Reverend Pyterek, pastor of St. Helen's Parish, will take charge hereafter. At the meeting, speakers on this subject were the Reverend Pyterek, F. S. Barc, and J. Kempinski.</p>
   <p>In his sermons tomorrow, the pastor of St. Helen's Parish will urge the parishioners to do their duty in this important matter.</p>
   <p>F. S. Barc, secretary.</p>
