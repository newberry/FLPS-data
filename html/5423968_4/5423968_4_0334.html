   <p>Thousands of our countrymen have shown their patriotism by purchasing the First and Second Liberty Loan Bonds. It is also a certainty that now, by buying the Third Liberty Loan Bonds willingly and without hesitation, they will do a double patriotic duty to their homeland and to this adopted home-land--the land that received them so generously and now asks their co-operation in the struggle with a mutual enemy that threatens the existence and liberty of all peoples of the world.</p>
   <p>We call the attention of those of our countrymen who, without giving the matter any deeper thought, consider the purchase of one or more bonds an expense (some, in their shortsightedness, call it an unnecessary expense); certainly they would not even consider thinking of putting money in a mortgage on land or real estate, an investment legally protected and safer than placing money in a safe or safety deposit box, an expense.</p>
   <p>Certainly the purchase of a Liberty Bond is nothing more than the location of capital at interest greater than the banks will pay; it is a loan of money to a borrower who gives the best guarantee of all the borrowers in the world. Such is the financial side of the "business", a side which is considered most important by some people who cannot understand that the circumstances of the loan are also to be considered, that factors of far greater importance enter here.</p>
   <p>The American nation and government are struggling against a mutual enemy for their own freedom and for ours, for the freedom of all the peoples of the world. Money is one of the many weapons of war. So the available supplies of this weapon as are in our hands should be turned over for the use of the American nation and government in this struggle. At a time designated by the law, after this weapon has served its purpose, it will be returned to us with a profit for our own further use.</p>
   
   <p>By doing this, we are only paying a portion of the debt we owe our adopted homeland. For we do owe it a debt! Why are we here in this hospitable land?</p>
   <p>We did not come here as tourists seeking impressions, or simply to acquaint ourselves with American traditions and customs. We were all forcibly exiled by the bad conditions created by all three of the nations occupying Poland. We were driven away by the "well-meaning" Austrian government, which retarded with all means at its command the industrial development of a country so rich in natural resources. We were driven away by chicanery that was often senseless, we were misled by he ultra-loyal bureaucracy of the official classes; the pressure of high taxation effectively pushed us out of the country, across the ocean. Every stronger person sought a firmer foundation anywhere else in the world, for under the Austrian government, Poland was a hopeless, soggy bog.</p>
   <p>We were driven away by the Cossack knout and the grafting Russian officials, by the pointless cruelties of the descendants of Genghis Khan, by the slow torture to death without even the possibility of a single free thought, and by the constant threat, expected or unexpected, of being sent to Siberia. These are the things that drove us away.</p>
   <p>But we were driven most harshly by the crushing heel of the bloodthirsty Prussian, who in his vanity after Grauelotte and Sedan, has forgotten Grunwald, has forgotten how he knelt humbly in the Krakow market place, who has expatriated us. And nothing was left for us but to grit our teeth and wait here across the ocean--to wait here on this free soil of Washington and Lincoln.</p>
   <p>Then came the great moment in history. One enemy, in his senseless insanity, is spilling his own blood, while for the other two the day of punishment is at hand, punishment for the torture and suffering inflicted upon our nation.</p>
   <p>Our duty is to hasten the dawn of that great day when our dismembered homeland will be reunited into that long dreamed of independent country, so often prophesied by our greatest poets. The golden horn will sound and the bell of resurrection will ring.</p>
   <p>And then there will be no more of the lashing knout, nor the grinding heel, nor the soggy bog.</p>
   <p>We will then be a self-governing people, deciding our own fate and future on our own soil, according to our own will.</p>
   <p>But to that end, whoever can must aid in the mutual cause, for our cause and the cause of our adopted America are one. Every Pole who participates in the Liberty Loan becomes, through it, a member of the "American Legion of Freedom."</p>
   <p>This newspaper will hereafter maintain a permanent column under the above head, giving an accurate list of names of all those Poles who buy the Third Liberty Loan Bonds.</p>
