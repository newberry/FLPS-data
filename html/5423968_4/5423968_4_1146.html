   <p>In the newly received report from the convention of the American organization General Society, Sons of the Revolution, which was recently held in Washington, we find on pages 38, 39 and 40 a matter pertaining to the monument of Pulaski.</p>
   <p>Barry Buckley, delegate from the District of Columbia, turned the attention of other delegates to bill No. 16, which had been placed before the House of Representatives. The bill asks for the erection of a monument for Pulaski. Mr. Buckley spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"It is not necessary to bring before you the merits of this distinguished patriot. I wish to call your attention to only one of a few points. Pulaski arrived in Philadelphia in the summer of 1777. He entered the service as a volunteer, he served in turn under General Washington, General Greene, General Wayne, General Sullivan, General La Fayette, Lincoln and others. At the battle of Brandywine, where the first shots were fired for American independence, his foresight, perseverance, and bravery were so marked that Washington made him chief of staff and requested Congress to give Pulaski the rank of Brigadier General. General Washington stated: "This gentleman, the same as ourselves, took part in preserving the liberty and independence of our country and sacrificed his fortune for our cause. For this we owe him our recognition, which should be to his benefit, so far as the good of the service permits."</p>
   <p>It is interesting to know that Pulaski was the father of American cavalry and was justly called "the eye of the army." As none of the officers carried a title ranking higher than that of colonel, Pulaski was the first general of cavalry appointed in the American Army.</p>
   <p>"Now, Mr. Chairman, France has been exceptionally honored by the beautiful monument of La Fayette, which stands on the corner of La Fayette Square in Washington. France was further distinguished by the monument of Rochambeau. To the society District of Columbia came the thought that there could not be carried through a more suitable deed and there cannot be marked out a more desirable quota from Congress than that which would erect at the other end of the square one monument to Kosciuszko and the other to Pulaski. I recommend, therefore, that our society, through its own officers, demand of the conforming committee in Congress this bill be accepted, which will state the necessary quota for this monument."</p>
   <p>Following delegate Buckley, Abraham Charles Kaufman, delegate from South Carolina said: "As a citizen from South Carolina, but above all as an American, I am proud that I have the occasion to present to this great convention a motion that it unanimously confirm this resolution."</p>
   <p>Such is the essence of a page from the convention of an American society about our Pulaski.</p>
