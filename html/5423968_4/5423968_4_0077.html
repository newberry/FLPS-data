   <p>We read lately, in local American papers of the protests being raised by different industrial and business firms against the over-rating of properties and tax assessments. In almost every case the authorities acknowledge their error and reduce the taxes. This is particularly true when the big firms, the wealthy, and such intelligent people who know how to manage the situation, enter the play. But the small owner of real estate is even more unjustly imposed upon, especially those Poles who cannot help themselves with the excessive charge.</p>
   <p>It was, however, not compulsory that he pay without protest, but because of ignorance in such proceedings, combined with a limited knowledge of English, he submitted without objections.</p>
   <p>Polish citizens and realty owners of Wards four and five, in the community of Bridgeport, will not permit such unjust treatment. The Citizen's Club is a great benefit in their cause. We are informed by the secretary, Mr. K. J. Karpinski, 1058 W. 32nd Street that if any member having difficulties regarding his tax bill, will present it to Mr. F. R. Pruszynski, 946 W. 33rd. Street at the main office, the executive committee will deliver it to the proper authorities.</p>

   <p>The time for protest is short, therefore, we advice that excessive tax bills be turned in for adjustment immediately upon receipt of same. It is advisable that such clubs be organized in other Polish settlements for the benefit of citizens having similar interests.</p>
