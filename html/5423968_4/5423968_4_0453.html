   <p>A great recruiting rally was held yesterday at Slowacki Hall in Town of Lake, preceded by a parade and a banquet for the volunteers.</p>
   <p>At about eleven o'clock in the morning, the volunteers gathered in Davis Square Park, 45th and Paulina Streets, where they were drilled by Lieutenant Skarzynski. When the volunteers, numbering about thirty, arrived at Slowacki Hall, a dinner, arranged by the Citizens' Committee of Town of Lake, consisting of Vincent Wrzesinski, Joseph Kukulski, Stanislaus Jankowski, Edward Bradel, Roman Kowalewski, and Stanislaus Kleehamer awaited them. The food was prepared and served by Polish women of Town of Lake......The Polish orchestra, conducted by B. J. Zalewski, played during the course of the dinner.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the dinner, and after a short rest, Lieutenant Skarzynski <span class="page-break">2</span>ordered the volunteers, numbering over three hundred [sic] to form ranks for a parade which, with Zalewski's orchestra at its head, moved through the streets of Town of Lake. The able squads of volunteers made a very good impression on the people who lined the streets to view the parade. Lieutenant Skarzynski led the parade, followed by the standard-bearers of Nest 37, Polish Falcons' Alliance, and by the Town of Lake Citizens' Committee.</p>
   <p>After about an hour of parading, the volunteers returned to Slowacki Hall for the recruiting rally. The hall was already filled to capacity. In fact, there were so many people that all standing room was taken, and many had to stand in the corridor or outside the hall.</p>
   <p>The rally was opened by S. Jankowski, member of the Citizens' Committee, organizer of Nest 37, Polish Falcons' Alliance, and a loyal Polish National Alliance member who, in a short address, explained the purpose of the meeting and called upon Michael Perlowski, president of the Central Citizens' Committee, <span class="page-break">3</span>to act as chairman. E. Bradel was asked to serve as secretary.</p>
   <p>With his usual ease of expression, Perlowski outlined the early days of the World War, when the Germans marched into Poland, plundered and destroyed everything they could, carried Polish women off to Prussia, and so on. He described the fate of our homeland during the years of oppression, and finally told how the White Eagle, after so many years, has arisen for flight.</p>
   <p>"Every able-bodied man should enlist under our banner," said Perlowski," for only such are worthy of being called Poles."</p>
   <p>The audience listened attentively to the words of the president of the Citizens' Committee, who has already proved that he knows how to work energetically and to sacrifice himself for the cause. His address was rewarded with sustained applause.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Henry Lokanski, associate editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>He described the misfortune, destruction, and ruin in Poland. He then spoke of how the Polish Army was organized, of the views of the Allied governments on the Polish question, of how the plan to create a Polish Army was considered by the Allies, and finally, of the edict issued by the French government on the Polish Army question.</p>
   <p>The principal speaker of the afternoon was Lieutenant W. N. Skarzynski, recruiting officer for the Polish Army for the Chicago area. Skarzynski spoke at great length, and his speech was frequently interrupted by bursts of applause. He described how Polish soldiers served in foreign armies, how they had to fight under Prussian, Austrian, and Russian command, into which armies they had been conscripted against their will. He spoke of how Prussia, our greatest enemy, did its best to destroy Poland, how secret plots were made to undermine and destroy Polish morale and Polish patriotism among the people of Poland, similarly to what they are now doing in Russia. "But all of these plots failed," said Skarzynski. "They failed and the Poles will <span class="page-break">5</span>emerge triumphant from beneath their present misfortunes, for the Poles cannot be destroyed, the Polish nation cannot be subjugated or broken."</p>
   <p>He continued: "And now, when the hour has arrived for Poles to take up arms against the Germans, no able-bodied true Pole should stay at home. To arms, brethren, to arms!" And the hall rocked with cheers and cries of "Death to the Germans!"</p>
   <p>Following Skarzynski, Francis Perlowski, well-known Town of Lake businessman spoke, and he in turn was followed by Sankowski. Finally, Lokanski read a letter which he had recently received from one of the volunteers who is now in the training camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake in Ontario, Canada.</p>
   <p>Contributions for the Polish Army were made by the following?</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>[List of contributors omitted by translator. Contributions totalled $1,240.50.]</p>
   <p>At about six o'clock in the afternoon, Chairman Perlowski called upon the gathering to sing "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" [Poland is not yet Lost] and "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland], after which he called the rally to a close.</p>
   <p>The community of Town of Lake, and especially those who by deeds, rather than by words, proved their devotion to the Polish cause and their understanding that Poland needs the efforts of everyone, deserve the highest praise. They have set the example of how Poles should conduct themselves now that the eyes of the world are upon them!</p>
   <p>Praise is also due those who, whether it was with five cents or a dollar, or with a hundred dollars, added to the fund that will launch our brave soldiers <span class="page-break">7</span>across the ocean to stand face to face with the hateful German and to avenge the age-old wrongs perpetrated against us, the wrongs perpetrated against our mothers and sisters.</p>
   <p>All honor to those who arranged yesterday's magnificent rally and to those who have so raised their sons that those sons now answer the call of their homeland.</p>
   <p>It should be added here that a collection taken up in the hall netted $116.40.</p>
