   <p>In the Women's Section of the Dziennik Zwiazkowy we read:</p>
   <p>Again we have been defeated in the political arena. The cause of our equal political rights, which for a long time has been awaiting settlement, was lost by only two votes at the meeting of the Senate on October 1, 1918.</p>
   <p>Who is at fault? Not the women, we are sure. They have done everything to acquire the right to vote, which so justly belongs to them. Even if only from this respect, that not only financially and morally do we support the administration, but thousands of women are working in ammunition plants, farms, etc., taking the place of men who have been called to arms, so that our industry would not suffer on that account.</p>
   <p>Our women have pointed out also that they have grown up with the right <span class="page-break">2</span>of taking a voice in politics, because in those elections, where they were given the right to vote, they were not directed by political favors neither did they allow themselves to be bribed by grafters, but voted for those who had a clean political record and would work for the country.</p>
   <p>It appeared that this time the matter of equal rights was on the right road, because our great President himself took a voice in it, supporting our tendencies. However, even that did not influence some of the backward and short-sighted senators, who evidently are afraid to introduce into politics a new political element.</p>
   <p>The President believes that the right to vote for women is necessary in order to carry through to a successful culmination the present great war. If we are to be a true democratic country, we cannot treat women differently than men. He put up as an example, England, which so long opposed equal rights for women, where the suffragettes <span class="page-break">3</span>fought much less than the American women. With the outbreak of the war, however, seeing how the English women in everything are working harmoniously with the government, and having laid aside all political struggles, the government, in recognition of their service, has given them long desired equal rights.</p>
   <p>"Should we," cried out that nobleman of state, "concede to women only cooperation in suffering, sacrifices, and work, and deny them the right to take part in privileges and justice?"</p>
   <p>"The problems of women rest in the very heart of the war and this heart will beat with greater strength if you settle this just matter and show to our women that you confide in them likewise as much, in fact, as you are dependent on them."</p>
   <p>And those truth inspired words did not stir those backward senatorial minds and did not demonstrate to them our matter in the true light.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Really it is a shame that there are in a democratic and progressive America at the helm of state such stubborn and narrow-minded people.</p>
   <p>But that is nothing. Let us not lose hope because a good cause must be victorious. This time there were two votes short in order to put through the resolution. We can then flatter ourselves with the hope that the next time when the matter of equal rights goes to the Senate for deliberation, the majority will be for us.</p>
