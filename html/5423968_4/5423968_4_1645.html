   <p>On Monday, March 18, a special meeting of the stockholders of the Palatine Commercial Corporation was held in the large hall of the Polish Women's Alliance Building. Three hundred and thirty stockholders from all parts of Chicago and vicinity attended the meeting.</p>
   <p>"A year ago," said Joseph Mierzynski, president of the corporation, "fifty-eight persons attended the meeting, by July of last year, there were a hundred and twenty of us, while today, our corporation has 337 full stockholders and more than six hundred additional members who will shortly become full stockholders. In the course of a little over a year, our corporation has grown to a membership of one thousand, and is the largest Polish corporation in the United States."</p>
   <p>Francis Wyora, treasurer of the corporation, acquainted the stockholders with <span class="page-break">\2</span>a new corporation law, the purpose of which is to prevent the sale of worthless stock. The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> law, known as the "Blue <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Law", provides for very strict state control over corporation funds and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> control over the advertisement of the sale of shares; according to the law,no such advertisement can be published until it has been approved by the Secretary of State. The law also provides for a strict control of <span class="gap">[gap]</span>tock salesmen; every salesman must be licensed by the Secretary of State. The Palatine Corporation is the first Polish Corporation and one of the first American corporations to conform to this law, and it has already been authorized by the Secretary of State to sell shares. In order to give its shareholders still greater assurance of the safety of their investment, the directors and officers of the corporation have deposited their shares of stock with the secretary of State with a signed statement that they will not withdraw, sell, or transfer these shares until such a time as the enterprise is completely organized and paying dividends. The stockholders accepted this information with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The question of a name for the corporation was the discussed: Whether to <span class="page-break">\3</span>take a purely Polish name or to leave it unchanged; namely, the Palatine Commercial Corporation. The name "Palatine" is derived from the Latin title given to persons with royal rights and privileges in Roman times. After a short discussion, it was decided by a large majority to retain the name "Palatine".</p>
   <p>A longer discussion arose over the question of opening new stores. Some were of the opinion that the store on Milwaukee Avenue should first be enlarged and brought to perfection before opening stores in other communities. The majority, however, was in favor of opening new stores, leaving the details to the Board of Directors. The directors explained that a store can be opened in Hawthorne, since the corporation will have two hundred and fifty stockholders there. At present, Hawthorne has several score stockholders in this corporation and over a hundred members [persons paying for shares]. A store will also be opened in Town of Lake, for this community will have five hundred stockholders.</p>

   <p>The constitution of the corporation was supplemented by amendments and addition read to the gathering by Henry Niewolkiewicz, the corporation secretary.</p>
   <p>Before the close of the meeting, the question was raised as to whether the school of commerce, maintained by the corporation for the use of numbers, should be continued. Some of the stockholders were of the opinion that it should be discontinued since it constitutes a considerable expense and brings no profit. When the directors explained, However, that the school is attended by two hundred members, some of whom have already made such progress as to be qualified to conduct business enterprises of their own and could be managers of newly opened stores, that the school is preparing people for employment in the corporation which, with its steady growth, will need them constantly, that the school has offered to the United States government forty-seven trained stock and bond salesmen, which offer was gratefully accepted, and that the Palatine Commercial Corporation is the only Polish organization which prepares its members to take part in the building of commerce and industry in free Poland, The <span class="page-break">\5</span>stockholders voted unanimously that the school is the very soul of the corporation and should be maintained.</p>
   <p>After acceptance of a resolution presented by M. Matusz, F. J. Kowalczyk and J. Bergel calling for ardent and persevering efforts toward continued expansion of the Palatine Corporation, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
