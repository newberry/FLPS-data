   <p>Mr. Trygar's article published in Dziennik Narodowy contained bitter words of truth aimed at those "who stand at the head"--at the fathers of the nation and the leaders--and in general it criticised our politico-national policies in American and our inactivity and laziness. It is not a cry in the wilderness; it is not a lonely, lost voice which knows not what it wants: it is a powerful shout--the shout of thousands straining impatiently for action. It is a voice fully aware of itself and certain of the great echo of thousands.</p>
   <p>Truly, anxiety enters our hearts when we see these young men impatient for action-men who have written on the Falcon banners mottoes of serving the home-land and who want to live up to them. In vain they look to their leaders to give the word for action.</p>
   <p>The Falcon men, especially the young ones who are not tied down by family obligations, are preparing and standing in readiness, certain that at any moment <span class="page-break">\2</span>the order, as hard as steel, will ring out: To France! Battle to the death for the freedom of Poland and the freedom of nations!</p>
   <p>But peace and quiet continues and the weak and seemingly ambiguous motto of Caesar Borgia: Wait and hope.</p>
   <p>Our young men--these sincere young men ready at a moment's notice to sacrifice their lives on the altar of the homeland--cry out in bitterness:</p>
   <p>"What are they waiting for? Why, it seems that everyone agrees that Poland's greatest enemy, the enemy of the entire world--this monstrous Prussian militarism--must finally be crushed. The sooner this power is destroyed, the sooner we shall have peace and the sooner our unfortunate, horribly ruined country will rid itself of these vandals of the twentieth century, these executioners and barbarians. Over these, tens of thousands are being murdered. Over there, even more of our brothers and sisters are dying of starvation, cold, and disease. Meanwhile we argue politics and go to entertainments and balls <span class="page-break">\3</span>but cannot get together a legion of even five thousand men to avenge our blood-and fire-stained land.</p>
   <p>What are we waiting for? Are we expecting promises from France? What kind of promises can France give us when she does not know how many of us would be ready to fight? Besides, France would surely recognize us as a Polish Legion. For us Poles, one dominating aim should be the motor of action--the destruction of Prussia--because it is by Prussia, and the Counts of Brandenburg, that, ever since the times of King Mieszko and King Boleslaw, our destruction has been continually plotted, and there in Prussia it was executed. Prussia is the source of all our misfortunes in all three annexed sections of our country.</p>
   <p>What are we waiting for? For the war to end? For the fever to pass, so that we will not have to go at all, and thus will avoid a very unpleasant and tiring effort and the exertion of a great deal of energy? That is possible --but..it is not so long ago that, without asking for the opinion of the people in general, we offered thirty thousand Falcons for the war with Mexico.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Perhaps some people can look upon this as a good political stunt, although under a different set of political stunt, although under a different set of political circumstances it might have been an irrevocable mistake. Then what? We would have had to rush to recruit the number that we were short of having thirty thousand, of course not counting the Falcon women. Then, for some reason, we did not fear "needless display," nor bloodshed, nor the destruction of the finest young men in our ranks.</p>
   <p>It is true that conditions for forming a legion were entirely different then than they are now; but today's reasons for forming a legion under France's flag differ greatly from the reasons for forming a legion to fight in Mexico. Today this is our cause in principle, it is a vital question because it concerns the very reason for our organizational and idealistic existence. It is the crystallization of the finest Falcon mottoes announcing readiness to serve the homeland.</p>
   <p>This is how the Falcons view the matter--both those who are ready to go at any moment and those who for various reasons must remain here. Everyone asks, <span class="page-break">\5</span>"Why this inactivity which looks like impotence? Why this hesitation? Are they afraid that the ranks will be decimated of the best young men, so that there will be a decrease in membership, and a spiritual and moral weakening, of the organization? The good of the homeland comes before all else--before the good of every organization. The military spirit was called forth among the Falcons. Why? If we are to serve the good of the Poles in America, it would have been more than sufficient for the Falcons in America to remain a gymnastic and educational organization.</p>
   <p>Therefore?--To France! To the field of glory! Let us follow in the footsteps of Dabrowski to crush the Prussians and their Teutonic Knight politics, to bring freedom to oppressed countries.</p>
   <p>When we form a legion--when words become actions--we can then be sure of greater financial contributions from the Poles in America; their enthusiasm will be kindled because "our boys" from America are going to shed their blood for Poland's liberty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>It is possible that I am wrong, that I am being carried away by my enthusiasm, that political questions should be decided only by cold reasoning, but..I am only the echo of those who want action. I believe that the Falcon leaders know what they are about, but I will permit myself one more little remark, namely, that our organ, Sokol [Falcon], should explain this matter and set for clearly the leaders' reasons for their attitude, in order to calm the minds of those who are disturbed because the fighting forces of some of the minds of those who are disturbed because the fighting forces of some of the groups are abandoning their military training.</p>
