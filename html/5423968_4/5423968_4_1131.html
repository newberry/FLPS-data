   <p>Tomorrow, May the 30th, the people of the United States celebrate a national holiday called Decoration Day.</p>
   <p>This holiday was founded by the veterans of the Civil War, the semi-centennial jubilee of which we are celebrating this year throughout the United States. The Civil War veterans were the first ones to set apart one day of each year for visiting cemeteries and decorating with flowers the graves in which rest the remains of their fallen comrades. Later on this beautiful custom was adopted by the whole nation and proclaimed a national holiday. Now millions of people visit cemeteries on that day every year and spend some time in spiritual communion with their relatives and friends, who departed earlier than they from this vale of tears, troubles, and misfortunes.</p>
   
   <p>However, the basic purpose of this holiday, a day devoted to the memory of the veterans and heroes of the great war, has remained unchanged. In the cities there are parades on that day in which the still remaining heroes and the government and military authorities participate. The people take active part in these parades, for today the nation values more than ever the great deeds of her sons, who half a century ago answered the call of a great president and saved the country with their blood.</p>
   <p>The Poles living in America also unite with the whole nation on this day to pay homage and honor to our heroes who sacrificed all for the good cause. There were not very many Poles at that time in America, but those who happened to be here contributed also their share of blood and hardship, to prove to the world Lincoln's saying, "that a country founded on democratic principles is a reality and not a Utopian dream".</p>
   
   <p>Americans remember very well the name of General Krzyzanowski and they would find many more Polish names if they would care to search for them.</p>
   <p>The American Poles know very well why the Civil War was fought half a century ago. It was not fought only for the purpose of liberating the Negroes, since this issue came up in the third year of the Civil War, but for the purpose of preserving the Union of this great Republic, which was founded by healthy and wise men after being snatched away from the jaws of European despotism at the price of many lives. This great Republic remains whole and great, not divided in two parts or into many small countries. Poles remember that our greatest mind and purest spirit, Thaddeus Kosciuzko, had also acknowledged this great Republic as good and absolutely necessary for the benefit of humanity, and he confirmed it by joining George Washington's Army. The Poles also know that this hospitable land was made fruitful by the blood of another great Pole, Casimir Pulaski. The Poles living in this country are aware of the importance and necessity to humanity of a powerful and undivided United States.</p>
   <p>The Poles desire, probably more than any other nation, that the good example of the harmonious life of almost fifty autonomous states, of which a few are larger than some European monarchies, should be imparted to the rest of humanity. The Poles heartily desire that all European countries would also organize into united states, and they believe that this will happen when despotic governments are overthrown and the injustices committed against the small nations are compensated.</p>
   <p>The United States Poles respect deeply the memory of that great American, Abraham Lincoln, who at the time of national crisis supported with his shoulders the falling structure of the Republic and called his people to defend that which was created by two former generations.</p>
   <p>On Decoration Day, the Poles in the United States also respect the memory of the millions of unknown patriots who, at the call of their leader, left their homes and fields to defend their country. They were strangers to us by blood, customs, and language, but related by spirit.</p>
