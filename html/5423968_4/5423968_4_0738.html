   <p>The European War has made the entire world quake and now a strange state of vacillation--the necessary result of the war--is manifest in every phase of human existence.</p>
   <p>This vacillation is evident not only in the political and economic life of the nation, but in the formation of convictions and principles by individuals, especially those who give expression to public opinion.</p>
   <p>Every intelligent person must evolve his own point of view and base it on the developments of the war and their meaning for the interests of his nation, but no intelligent person can swear today that his opinions are unshakable or assert that what he believes today will hold true tomorrow. He cannot say that what has his absolute confidence today will not show itself to be the most repulsive quackery tomorrow.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Some people criticize a changing of opinion and even suspect certain individuals of the most odious betrayal and bribe-taking.</p>
   <p>Such hasty and unpleasant criticism deserves the sharpest condemnation. If a certain individual who changes his mind has logical reasons for doing so, one must not accuse him of lack of honor and faith, but rather grant that he is making an honest and sincere attempt to fulfill his duties toward society.</p>
   <p>At this time all political opinions formulated by intelligent people are based on events which have occurred, on the actions of the warring powers up to the present, on the changes of victory of this or that side, and on the good and sincere wish to serve one's country as best one can.</p>
   <p>There is no sage in the word who can now foresee the current of future events and cry out with a clear conscience, "Stick to this and nothing else!" Where cannons are playing, where diplomats vie with each other in an attempt to befuddle their opponents, no man standing on the side lines can discover bases <span class="page-break">3</span>for logical thinking and for making plans for the future.</p>
   <p>An editor, or any other human being, must accept facts in the light in which the war bulletins present them and must base his opinions solely upon them.</p>
   <p>Therefore, if certain facts which we believe to be true today show themselves to be false tomorrow or, what is worse, to be harmful to the cause which we are defending, it is the duty of an honest man to admit his mistake and retreat from the path of error as hastily as possible.</p>
   <p>Only those people who wish to take advantage of the times to further their own party politics, who want to annoy their opponents or to realize their "business" aspirations, consciously adhere to their false opinions. They do so at the cost of giving illogical and dishonest information to the public.</p>
   <p>These are not honest people, these are not champions of an ideal: they are falsifiers of public opinion and the worst sort of brawlers and disrupters of national work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>To support the above deductions--which are rather daring in view of conditions in Polish America--it behooves us to present examples. Before doing this, how-ever, we must repeat that in forming opinions on the present situation one must be guided by cold logic, a critical outlook on the events which have occurred in the arena of war, and a sincere desire to serve the homeland instead of one's party or personal desires.</p>
   <p>For instance, conditions in Detroit, Michigan, have recently taken an abrupt turn. Rekord Codzienny [Daily Record], which hitherto has been the blind defender of K. O. N. [Committee on National Defense], has made a complete change and at present has taken the only sensible stand, that of waiting until the situation clears.</p>
   <p>The Rekord Codzienny did not change its policy because of a change in its editorial staff or, as some people wish to believe, for "business" reasons. It changed its policy because this very Austria, which a month ago promised a mountain of gold, today looks upon the Poles as a good source of cannon fodder and money.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Rekord Codzienny defended its Austrian outpost for a long time, even longer than it was obliged to, but finally, after having carefully read the oath taken by the legionnaires, it understood that all of the crowings of the Temporary Commission of the unheard-of Austrian benevolence were in reality only the call to retreat from the battle for our homeland's real interests.</p>
   <p>The legions have gone to fight, it is true, but they have entered battle as an integral part of the Austro-German army. But not all of those victims for whom the American Poles are to provide, and should provide, have entered this fight.</p>
   <p>This is a fact of grave importance. We could keep sending money uncritically as long as the Austrian friends and their opponents had arguments of equal strength. But now we must not send money because we know for a certainty that every penny sent to the legion or the Committee of National Defense augments the income of the King of Prussia, the king who has perpetrated the greatest injustices against the Polish nation.</p>
   <p>Cold reason has now taken the floor and declared that Austria no longer exists, <span class="page-break">6</span>that Austrian armies are under Prussian command and do not deserve support because they are defending the interests of Poland's greatest enemy.</p>
   <p>We ourselves have had to change our point of view on the political situation since the outbreak of the war. From the first moment we were on the side of the declared opponents of Prussia, but we did not suppose that the Polish Legion, which expressed the impulse to deliver Poland, Would accept Austrian pay. We did not suppose that all of Austria would accept Wilhelm's command.</p>
   <p>At the moment that we read the oath of the legionnaires and were convinced that all of Austria was guided by the Prussian hand, we threw aside all legionary dreams. We do not hesitate to assert that Poland's happiness, her existence, and her freedom depend on the victory of the Triple Entente.</p>
   <p>Only the complete crushing of Prussia and Austria can give us the opportunity to unite to form one whole. This fact alone, the uniting of twenty-four million Poles in one unit, will be of great benefit to us.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Today, circumstances force us to desire the complete annihilation of Prussia and Austria. It is another thing that tomorrow these circumstances may change, and that we may have to give up today's conviction. Today, circumstances bid us adhere to them determinedly.</p>
   <p>Today, England, France and Russia are allied and have agreed jointly that Polish lands should be united. Tomorrow Russia and Prussia may come to an agreement and all of our plans and combinations will get it in the neck.</p>
   <p>Will you then criticize us for condemning the new alliance of the vulture and the bear and declaring ourselves for the other side? Surely not. Therefore forsake all combinations and vile accusations of accepting rubles, etc. Wait patiently, instead, for the time when you can send money not to Austro-Prussia, not to Russia, but to poor emaciated Poland.</p>
   <p>We may still change our opinions many times, always under the influence of the turn of events in Europe, which we as journalists are obliged to follow and for <span class="page-break">8</span>which we are not responsible. Perhaps in a few months our orientation will change in favor of Turkey, if this country produces a great leader to fight our enemies.</p>
   <p>Today we shall swear to nothing except relentless hatred of the Germans, of Prussianism, and of militarism. We are ready to support almost any action, but we will never sell ourselves out completely to the Austro-Germans, nor permit the complete exploitation of the vital forces of our nation.</p>
   <p>Therefore, dear friends, although you continue to be angry with us, we shall remain loyal to the principles which we have accepted: Not to befuddle the people but to sacrifice ourselves and admit our mistakes rather than waste the noblest impulses of the Poles in this country and to fill Wilhelm's pockets.</p>
   <p>We will not contribute money to K. O. N. [Committee on National Defense]. We will not support Prusso-Austrophilism, because we would rather all of Poland were under the Russian scepter than that it should groan under the yokes of three annexers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>We prefer this because united we do not fear the strongest enemy!</p>
