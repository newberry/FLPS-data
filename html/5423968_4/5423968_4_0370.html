   <p>The mass meeting that was held yesterday afternoon at the St. Joseph Parish Hall for the benefit of the Polish Army was unsuccessful, for the committee in charge, which was not even present itself at the meeting, had failed to advertise it in the newspapers, and, as a result, the general public knew nothing about it.</p>
   <p>L. Haduch, an organizer of the Polish Army made an hour-long speech to the hundred or so persons gathered in the hall. He spoke of the Polish Army and its task. The speaker said that he was pained to see that the community which had once been first in the number of recruits and amount of money supplied to the Polish Army is now so little interested in our homeland's cause.</p>
   <p>The second address was made by Sigmund Wisniewski, color sergeant of the Eleventh Regiment of the American Army and veteran of the Spanish-American War. He gave a few examples of the treacherous methods employed by the Germans in battle, and called upon the young men to enlist in the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>The meeting ended with the singing of "Jeszcze Golska Nie Zgingela" (Poland is not yet lost).</p>
