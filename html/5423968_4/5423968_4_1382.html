   <p>Yesterday afternoon, in the district south of 31st Street and east of the south branch of the river, at 883 James Avenue, a veritable nest of smallpox was discovered. Eight persons, including six from one family, were sent to the hospital and the ninth victim was discovered a block away, at 3244 Musspratt Street.</p>
   <p>The names of the victims are Catherine, Emma, Joseph, Sophia, John and Anna Dropski, Alfred and Ernest Chambers, and Lizzie Ordeska. These are all children under 13 years of age. Dr. Spaulding, of the Board of Health, discovered them about four o'clock in the afternoon; the doctor who originally thought it was some other kind of rash.</p>
   <p>The homes were immediately fumigated. Six doctors were rushed to the neighborhood to vaccinate all residents.</p>
