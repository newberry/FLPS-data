   <p>A new Polish bank is being formed in the Calumet district, which includes South Chicago, Hegewisch, and all surrounding manufacturing districts.</p>
   <p>It has been decided upon that the Union Bank of South Chicago, conducted until now as a private institution, should be transformed into a state bank.</p>
   <p>A month ago, Mr. Julius F. Smietanka, president of the Polish Depositors Trust and Savings Bank in Town of Lake, was called upon to take over the directorship in putting through the procedure of change. Mr. Smietanka found this bank in an excellent financial condition.</p>
   <p>The stockholders of the new state bank will be Mr. J. F. Smietanka, Mr. L. Paczynski, Rev. F. Wojtalewicz and other Poles. Polish stockholders will control the bank.</p>
