   <p>The name of George Washington, whose birthday is celebrated by the United States on February 22, is linked with one of the most important events in the life of humanity. He was, next to Franklin, the most outstanding of the authors of this new State, which today is the pattern for the future political composure of Europe and surely for other parts of the world as well. And he was not only one of the chief builders of this State, but also its most eminent defender in that most critical moment, when the problem of preserving the organic life of the nation arose--a nation as yet too disunited and too weak to depend upon its own resources in the first years of struggle for independence.</p>
   <p>The history of Europe is divided into three periods, namely the Ancient, the Middle Ages, and the Modern. The Ancient period ends with the downfall of the Western Roman Empire. The period of the Middle Ages starts with the building of a chain of half-barbarous new states, on the ruins of the Roman empire but having in themselves the needed germs for future greatness. The middle of that second period was interrupted by the Crusaders' wars, which divide that period into two distinct parts. The period of modern history starts with the time when the political and economic horizon of Europe became colossally broadened by the discovery of America and by the sudden forward jump of human thought due to Nicholas Copernicus' book on the system of the universe. That period is also divided into two parts--the first one filled with combating the remnants of the Middle Ages, and the second noted with the creating of a new life in accordance with the new forms and models. And, behold, it was in the beginning of the second sub-period of the modern history that the United States of North America were born. Such a Federal Republic composed of a number of independent states voluntarily joined into one political organism had already been known in Europe at a much earlier period in the pattern of the Swiss federation, although it was comparatively very small and very weak.</p>
   <p>To make sure that such an organism could exist on a large scale; that it could develop and expand; that it could defend itself and stand equal by its own power to the greatest powers of the world, there was a need for a great Federal Republic, one with confidence in itself and freedom from without. It would exist among such geographical condistions that would afford the opportunity to grow and to expand not by the cost of victories over her neighbors, but by the labor of her population, conquering and populating still larger areas.</p>
   <p>After two wars--one for independence in the years 1776-1781, and another for preserving the unity of the nation in 1861-1865,--this gigantic experiment became acknowledged as accomplished.</p>
   <p>Today there is no doubt that--to use the words of Lincoln--the deed of the authors of American Union shall live forever and the theory of the rule of the people, by the people, and for the people is not a utopian dream.</p>
   <p>The role played by George Washington in the insurrection and for the survival of the United States is of such unusual merit that he is justly given the first place in the ranks of the authors and defenders of the new state. As the chief commander of the army of the young political organism, George Washington excelled not only in military genius, but also possessed tremendous endurance against failures, of which there were plenty in the first period of the war for independence. The second period of the war, when the help from France had hastened the victory, was less heavy. However, without that endurance of the commander at the beginning of the war, the help would probably have never appeared. For it was after the victory at Saratoga that France decided to declare war on England.</p>
   <p>After the victory Washington worked with others as an organizer of the new state. His part in creating the state machine and informing the Constitution, which in its main outlines even today serves its purpose, is the testimony of a deep wisdom of the man, in whom they could see at the beginning only an able warrior.</p>
   <p>In the third period of his career Washington, as the first President of the American Republic, had the very difficult task of avoiding a new war which might have injured the work of enlarging the State within the framework designed by the Constitution. A prolonged peace of many years was absolutely necessary, and conditions at that time made it immensely difficult to sustain peace. It was this victorious warrior who knew how to resist with all his power the pressure of many occasions. It was he who left behind a completely well-ordered State, fully prepared for the future. None of the later presidents except Lincoln did as much for the stability of the United States as did Washington, the warrior, by securing peace, and as did Lincoln, the lover of peace, by carrying through a great war.</p>
   <p>Twice during his career Washington proved that he was free from personal ambitions and that he acted only for the good of the country. The first time, after the War for Independence, he reposed his authority in the hands of the Congress, rejecting the thought of a royal crown as suggested by the army; the second time, by rejecting the thought of a third term of presidency because he considered it a dangerous precedent for the future. On retiring, he left this advice for his successors, namely: that one of the best ways to keep peace is to be prepared for war; and that the policy of this country should be to avoid entangling alliances with any part of the foreign world.</p>
   <p>George Washington absolutely belongs to the small number of the greatest men in the history of the world, and he is reckoned among that category of great men, who, while serving their own country and their own nation only, have at the same time rendered a first-rate service fot the whole of humanity.</p>
