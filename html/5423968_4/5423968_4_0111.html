   <p>On last Tuesday, January 3, the Polish Army Veterans' Post Number Nine held its annual installation ceremonies, at which Diplomas of recognition for work on behalf of Polish veterans were presented to the Reverend James Skrzycki and to the members of the Citizens' Committee of the ward, Messrs. J. Kieradlo (president of the Committee), J. Wrobel, T. Wiertlak, M. Cichoszewski, K. Marcinkiewics, J. Cichoszewski, F. Romolewicz, W. Derdzinski, and M. Pawloski. These are the men who have steadily worked to help the Haller's army veterans from the time when they sent them in the days of the war to fight for the freedom and independence of Poland. They did not forget to give the veterans a proper reception on their return from war, and, they have continued to aid them up to the present time. When the diplomas were presented, each recipient addressed the meeting. The speech of the Reverend J. Skrzycki deserves particular mention; as first speaker he lauded our <span class="page-break">2</span>enthusiasm and devotion in our patriotic efforts. The next speaker was the director of the Polish National Alliance, Mr. Synowiec, who described in glowing words the experiences and the sacrifices of Haller's veterans and lauded their present activities, which deserve wholehearted support on the part of the Polish community.</p>
   <p>After several others had delivered short addresses, the Reverend Mr. Skrzycki, again took the floor and donated to the post twenty-five dollars for wounded veterans, for which he received sincere thanks. Thereafter Veteran Karpiszewski, formerly employed at the stockyards and now unemployed, received a gift of five dollars.</p>
   <p>The meeting passed a resolution to participate with the Citizens' Committee of the ward in the parish bazaar, and it donated a score of Hallerczyk (Haller's army veteran) calendars. After singing of several soldier songs, the meeting came to an end with the chanting of the patriotic "Oath" by the Polish poet Konopnicka.</p>
