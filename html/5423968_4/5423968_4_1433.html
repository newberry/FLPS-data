   <p>Dr. Stephen B. Pietrowicz, physician, who is well known in both Polish and American circles in Chicago, has been very highly honored. He has been appointed superintendent of the insane asylum at Dunning, a post for which he was nominated by Peter Bartzen, president of the County Board.</p>
   <p>Dr. Pietrowicz was the director of the Virgin Mary of Nazareth Hospital. Besides this, he was on the staff of the Oak Forest Infirmary where his work received recognition. He is a specialist in nervous disorders and psychiatry and is considered a good administrator.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Medical Society, together with Doctors A. C. Cotton and William L. Noble, endorsed the candidacy of Dr. Pietrowicz for the post which he has received. The County Board is confident that Dr. Pietrowicz will manage the institution at Dunning as it should be managed.</p>
   
   <p>Dr. Pietrowicz is still a young man. Now only 38 years old, he was born in Poznan and came to America at the age of ten. He has been practicing medicine for fourteen years. He is a member of the best clubs in the city. Though he has taken no active part in politics, he is a Republican in his political sympathies.</p>
