   <p>Yesterday, during a Polish meeting at Walsh's hall, the arrangers of the meeting allowed themselves to perpetrate a truly childish prank. They burned on the stage a portrait of the Tsar and one issue of Dziennik Narodowy [daily, published in Chicago], which some time ago openly stated that in the event of a general European war, the Poles should side with the coalition and cut down the Prussians.</p>
   <p>We are not entering here into the justice or the incentives leading to this manifestation. But we stamp yesterday's occurrence as an indication of the childishness of the perpetrators, who thought that they were accomplishing a civic duty.</p>
   <p>The only name for yesterday's performance is that of childish prank, because really one cannot call it anything else. By burning portraits of the Tsar <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and Polish publications, we will gain nothing but merely make laughing stocks of ourselves before others.</p>
