   <p>Marshall Foch, the great leader of the French and allied armies, will come to Chicago, Sunday, Sept. 6th. A massive parade will be staged in his honor.</p>
   <p>Marshall Foch is not only a representative of France, but as we know, is one of the best friends of the young Polish Republic; and for this reason, alone, the entire Chicago Polonia should be present in voicing their warmest greetings.</p>
   <p>A Polish welcome committee will be selected from one of the largest Catholic organizations, the Knights of Columbus.</p>
   <p>The entire manifestation if properly executed as we hope it to be, will then be one of our most glorious events.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hulihan informs us that over thirty-five thousand members of the K. of C. will take active part.</p>
   <p>We will have permission not only to display the American banners, but those of the other nations also. Everything will be allowed that will add to the splendor of this occasion. It will be a day of honor for the Poles. The time is short, so remember to do your bit.</p>
