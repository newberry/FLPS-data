   <p>On the eve of a great day, humanity needs great men. Nature, which in some almost miraculous way, manages to maintain some sort of balance, always gives a nation geniuses during times of great strain, so that, standing in the breach, they can direct the destinies of a given nation, not toward destruction but toward progress, happiness, and prosperity. It depends upon each individual nation whether these geniuses can guide it clear of misfortunes and civil wars. It is a fortunate nation that recognizes its leader immediately as such a genius, and follows him, throwing everything into the balance. And unfortunate is that nation which produces a genius, and underestimating him does not support him wholeheartedly, and does not follow him into battle against even the greatest odds.</p>
   <p>The twelfth day of February, though in different years, gave a genius to each of <span class="page-break">\2</span>two nations of the world: Lincoln to America, and Kosciusko to Poland. Each stood at the head of his nation during a great crisis, each led his nation into battle, each maintained his principles unswervingly until death, and each became a national hero to posterity. Only the conditions under which each man found himself were not alike. Kosciusko led his nation to battle in a struggle against an external enemy, while Lincoln guided his nation through one of the greatest civil wars, a terrible fratricidal struggle. But instead of winning, Kosciusko lost--instead of losing, Lincoln won.</p>
   <p>Why? Because Lincoln knew how to win the faith of the masses, and he had the means to do so. Then too, he could lead an army of millions into battle. Lincoln was recognized [as a great man] by the people of the northern states; they obeyed him and followed him into battle, plunging deep into the blood of their brethren--to triumph finally and to create for the future the greatest republic in the world, great enough almost to dictate to the world. Lincoln did not hesitate before this fratricide, though his country was in flames and flowed rivers of blood. He moved unswervingly forward, for he knew that from <span class="page-break">\3</span>this blood and conflagration would rise the prosperity and might of the nation.</p>
   <p>Kosciusko, on the other hand, was supported by a mere handful of his countrymen. Fearing to shed the blood of his brethren, weeping at the violence of the aroused people of Warsaw, who decorated the city's lamp posts with the bodies of renegades and traitors to the country, Kosciusko either did not know how or did not want to force the entire Polish nation to obedience, to seize it and lead it in force against the enemy, even at the cost of shedding his brethren's blood. Although he was a genius as a commander, he was too gentle, too idealistic. He wanted to see around him only such great hearts as his own, never thinking to force anyone to obedience to save the country. Thus, he lost, while Lincoln won. But for the same reason, Kosciusko lived to a venerable old age, honored and loved by all his associates; while Lincoln died a martyr's death at the hands of a countryman opposed to him.</p>
   <p>And certainly Kosciusko had certain conditions under which he might have been able to swing the balance of victory to Poland's side and win freedom for his <span class="page-break">\4</span>country. Kosciusko was as democratic as Lincoln, but of such a character that, seeing the evils of the nobles, he either did not want to or did not know how to remove them. There were occasions when a given noble, indignant that his peasants joined Kosciusko's army, brazenly dared to enter the camp and take back his subjects. Instead of having such a noble whipped or even hanged on the most convenient tree for interfering with his army, Kosciusko not only allowed him to go free, but gave him his peasants also. It is easily understood, then, that under such conditions Kosciusko's army could not grow to the necessary strength. The leader of the peasants did not receive the unqualified support of his people. The nobles were peacefully tilling their land while the destinies of the nation were being decided at Raclawice and Maciejowice. Had Kosciusko been Lincoln, he would have called everyone to arms, under pain of death for refusal, whether it were noble, townsman, or peasant, and would have marched to Moscow over the bodies of Russian soldiers.</p>
   <p>But Kosciusko's principles of personal liberty had reached an idealistic state and he would not go against them. He did not want to force anyone, knowing in <span class="page-break">\5</span>his own exalted soul that everyone ought to value and love his country and give his blood for it if necessary. With these conceptions, unfortunately, Kosciusko was generations ahead of the nation. He did not understand the people, nor did the people understand him. And so it happened that, unsupported by his own people for whom he heroically risked his life, he fell at Maciejowice, to find himself later in a St. Petersburg prison. Although he was freed, he never again drew his sword to fight for his country.</p>
