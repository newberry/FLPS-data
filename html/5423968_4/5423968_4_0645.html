   <p>The sinking of the "Laconia" has been decreed by Washington as an "overt act."</p>
   <p>President Wilson has decided for the present to adopt a policy of "armed neutrality" with reference to the Germans.</p>
   <p>This, of course, is only a temporary expedient, since the administrative measures which the Federal Government will undertake must lead to open war with the Germans.</p>
   <p>At present everything depends upon Congress. The President, however, is sure of himself, and believes that Congress at such a critical time cannot oppose his plans, and thus encourage the Germans, who are getting in ever deeper in their madness, and indulging in greater acts of audacity.</p>
   <p>Therefore, that which ex-President Roosevelt foresaw two years ago, when he <span class="page-break">2</span>urged the President to take a clear and definite stand in regard to the piratical methods of the Teutons, has taken place. Roosevelt urged that, since war with Germany was inevitable, it would be better to enter into it at once and thus shorten humanity's term of suffering.</p>
   <p>President Wilson, nevertheless, acted wisely, and gave innumerable proofs that "it was not he who gave causes for the war", and that therefore he can now face his people, who chose him for the most responsible position in the land, confidently, to tell them that he has been very patient, but that now all patience has been exhausted.</p>
   <p>We all understand that the present times are unusually critical for America and the entire world. The United States in open war with Germany will constitute a new and powerful ally for the defense of the good and just cause of the entire world. It is now no longer a question of American interests, as President Wilson emphasized, but of the rights of civilization and of the entire world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The [United] States is the spokesman and champion of these rights. As the spokesman it must see to it that justice is accorded to all, that there are none who, summoned before the highest tribunal, established to decide the problems of their liberty and future and the future of generations yet unborn, would find that they had been summoned only in order that a secret decree might be made behind their backs. President Wilson has already shown himself to be a tried spokesman for the world, and he will surely not abandon a stand once he has taken it.</p>
