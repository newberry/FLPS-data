   <p>The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States will cause a distribution of mandates for Congressional representative after each population census, which should be taken every ten years.</p>
   <p>Since the census of 1910 there has been no revision. The result is that each State has representatives in Congress, not according to the size of its population, or the 1920 census, but the 1910 census. If Congress adapted itself to the resolution of the Constitution, each State would be represented according to population, eight would have a greater number of representatives. while eleven would have a lesser number.</p>
   <p>Prohibitionists are crying about the necessity for respecting the Constitution, but remain silent on the violation of this important resolution.</p>
