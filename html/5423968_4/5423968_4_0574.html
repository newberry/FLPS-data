   <p>Due to the fact that in the past few days a great many requests have come to our office for information as to the results of the proposal made by the last special convention of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in the matter of raising the "Kosciusko Army", Circuit Number II can answer only that at the present time it cannot begin recruiting on a larger scale, until an official notice has been received from the War Department in Washington.</p>
   <p>Without an official notice, Circuit II cannot begin the work that should be begun the moment the request is granted. We must wait for the notice so as not to collide with federal recruiting authorities, who have already begun recruiting volunteers for the regular army on a large scale.</p>
   <p>This matter was discussed in detail at the last meeting of the Technical Commission of the Circuit, which decided to issue the following notice to the various Nests:</p>
   <p>"Recommendation</p>
   <p>"Until we receive an official notice permitting us to raise the 'Kosciusko Army' do not begin recruiting volunteers on a larger scale. If the volunteers themselves apply for enlistment in the proposed 'Kosciusko Army', co-operating with the United States Army, at the several Falcon Nests of Circuit II, these should be listed and training groups should be formed which should begin training at once.</p>
   <p>"The smallest of the training units is a corps composed of eight men. Each corps should be headed by a corporal. The commander of the Nest should appoint only such men as corporals who are familiar with the army drill and know how to handle guns.</p>
   <p>"The corps should be carefully drilled according to the first lesson sent to the commanders of Nests some time ago. The drills should progress slowly, with special care being taken to carry out each movement with exact precision. New subjects are not to be taken up until the one being practiced by the corps is thoroughly understood and mastered.</p>
   <p>"If any one of the commanders does not have the first lesson, he should come personally to the office and get it.</p>
   <p>"Further instructions will be issued later.</p>
   <p>"In the event that volunteers apply for enlistment, each commander, subcommander or someone especially appointed for the purpose should have a special book in which he should record the names of the applicants in accordance with the following questionnaire:</p>
   <p>"1. Name.</p>
   <p>"2. Address.</p>
   
   <p>"3. Date of birth.</p>
   <p>"4. Place of birth.</p>
   <p>"5. Married or single.</p>
   <p>"6. Dependents.</p>
   <p>"7. Occupation.</p>
   <p>"8. Are you a citizen of the United States?</p>
   <p>"9. Do you have your first papers?</p>
   <p>"10. Did you serve in the army?</p>
   <p>"11. In what branch of the service?</p>
   
   <p>"12. Education.</p>
   <p>"13. Are you physically fit?.</p>
   <p>"14. Have you ever been sick?</p>
   <p>"15. With what disease?</p>
   <p>"16. Have you got good eyesight?</p>
   <p>"17. What languages do you speak?</p>
   <p>"All those who enlist will be given a medical examination the moment our request is officially granted.</p>
   <p>"At this meeting the Technical Commission of the Circuit decided to begin recruiting as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>"An Officers Training Course</p>
   <p>"Therefore, all members of Nests of Circuit II who are familiar with the basic principles of army drill, should report to the office of Circuit II within the next few days.</p>
   <p>"This course will also be a preparatory course for the Officers Training School at Cambridge Springs, where those who meet the necessary requirements will be sent.</p>
   <p>"To the Poles of Chicago and Surrounding Territory</p>
   <p>"As has been stated above in respect to the number of requests for information about the 'Kosciusko Army', Circuit II of the Alliance of Polish Falcons cannot act upon the proposal which was passed at the special convention of the Falcons, until this proposal in all its details is officially accepted by the War Department of the United States.</p>

   <p>"At this meeting the technical commission voted to make the following request to trained army officers, inviting them to co-operate with us.</p>
   <p>"Trained Officers</p>
   <p>"It is known that there are many Poles in Chicago who graduated from military schools in Europe, and who have had practical training in active service. Therefore, in the name of the Technical Commission we turn to them with the request--if they want to serve our cause--that they call personally at the office of Circuit II of the Alliance of Polish Falcons of America, at 1063 Milwaukee Avenue, or telephone: Monroe 1477.</p>
   <p>"We believe that no men having officer's training will refuse our request, but will share their knowledge and experience with those who want to serve Poland's cause.</p>
   <p>"For the Technical Commission of the Circuit.</p>
   <p>"(Signed) W. Sulewski."</p>
