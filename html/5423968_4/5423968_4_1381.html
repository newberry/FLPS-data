   <p>Smallpox has appeared among the people living in the vicinity of the Isolation Hospital for the Poor, and there is fear that it may spread further. This hospital was built more than fifteen years ago, when the neighborhood was sparsely settled, but now hundreds of families, most of which are Polish, reside here. Since these families have built their homes here after a lot of hard work, it now becomes necessary to remove this hospital to a more suitable place. In the last few days, three persons died and over sixty, of whom thirty live in this locality, contracted smallpox.</p>
