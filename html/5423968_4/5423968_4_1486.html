   <p>It seems that the only firm that carries garments for the dead is the South End Burial Garment Shop.</p>
   <p>This particular shop is located at 2959 E. 88th street and was established by a Pole by the name of J. Zacharias, in April, 1934, and is growing very nicely. The shop has a complete supply of garments for the dead, for men and women; also other necessary articles used for burial purposes.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Zacharias employs four people.</p>
