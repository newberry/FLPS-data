   <p>A few days ago, we had occasion to see Dr. L. S. Szumkowski's model of an extremely interesting and, in our opinion, very important invention he has just completed. It is an apparatus that will extend considerably the use of the motor truck in farm labor. It consists of a simple attachment to the wheels of an ordinary automobile, that is, a rim with wide blades, which makes it possible to use the automobile as motive power needed in plowing. These rims are in two sections for each wheel and are screwed together in such a way that it takes but a few minutes to attach them to each of the four wheels. The blades are very strongly placed. A plow with one, two, or three blades is then attached to the automobile that has been thus equipped, and the hardest plowing job can be done, work which would require the use of four horses. It should be added that not much of the automobile's speed and power is lost at this work, and considering the fact that horses tire easily and must stop to rest, the use of the machine will greatly increase the output of work.</p>

   <p>Dr. Szumkowski plans to form a company for the manufacture of motor trucks with this adaptation to farming. Actually, he will give the farmer two machines in one: motive power for farm labor, and an ordinary truck for transportation of farm products, since the bladed rims can be detached and the regular wheels used on roads.</p>
   <p>Dr. Szumkowski plans to manufacture his new truck on a large scale, for exportation to Poland to facilitate the work of restoration. There can be no doubt that the machine will prove very useful in post-war farm work in Poland.</p>
   <p>In talking to us of his plans, Dr. Szumkowski said: "Concern with Polish affairs is the duty of every Pole. In fulfilling this duty, I stopped to consider how best to help Poland after the war is over, and I came to the conclusion that the best thing I can do is to organize a company which would undertake to export to Poland on a large scale not only these inexpensive machines but also plows, motor trucks, and so on, all of which will be most immediately necessary in postwar Poland if agriculture is to be renewed to a large enough extent to feed the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>people properly. I am not doing this for personal profit, and I will be ready to relinquish direction of the enterprise, even the few thousand dollars capital I have already invested, to any countryman, or, if at all possible, to any Polish firm that can guarantee export of at least five thousand of these machines to Poland within a given period of time, let us say, within a few years. I am willing to relinquish my patents also, since I will have attained my goal completely and achieved my ambition. To send five thousand such machines to Poland would not, after all, be anything extraordinary, and those machines could work enough ground to feed a million or more people! Taking this into consideration, one is willing to sacrifice, even to lose money, for the moral satisfaction gained is ample profit for the effort expended."</p>
   <p>We hope that Dr. Szumkowski's plans are realized to the fullest extent.</p>
