   <p>In Chicago there was organized recently a Polish Women's League, whose task is to unite all Polish women for the work in civic affairs and to prepare them to active service, and whenever summoned they would be ready for that work not only at the appeal of our fatherland, but also at that of our assumed mother, the United States.</p>
   <p>In its address to the Polish women calling them to the first meeting, the Polish Women's League mentioned that "without flowery expressions, without empty, meaningless phrases, but with the warmth of true sincerity and faithfulness toward those who do well towards us" one has to prepare himself slowly but surely for work, which undoubtedly awaits all women and therefore also our Polish women over here.</p>
   <p>This work should mainly be done under the banner of the Red Cross. The Polish women have comprehended that at a time when the whole United States is preparing for the day which is coming and will come, the Polish woman will not remain behind, but will take active part in these preparations and, putting aside all previous prejudices, stand under one <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>standard, the Polish Women's League.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Polish Women's League, which was held at the home of the Polish Women's Alliance, it was resolved to prepare energetically for work, and namely, to conduct a six month's course in nursing. This course will be composed of lectures on hygiene and surgery, conducted in the Polish language as well as in English by Polish doctors. The lecture hall will be open to all, and the lectures will be given four times a week during the afternoons and evenings in the Polish Women's Alliance Home.</p>
   <p>A series of motions, which were adopted by the Polish Women's League at this meeting, at the suggestion of Dr. W. A. ii, president of the Polish Physicians Association, convinces us that the Polish Women's League is preparing for work intelligently and with consideration. We believe that the Polish women may count on success in their work. We believe that the efforts of the P. W. L. will meet with due recognition on the part of society,and the Polish organizations will not deny their help, if they will see that this work truly finds itself on a good road.</p>

   <p>The only thing to avoid are those "flowery expressions and empty phrases." This work should not be conducted in an amateurish way or for sport because as Dr. Kuflewski plainly let it be known, the action of women devoting themselves to public service, is no play, but hard, painstaking work.</p>
   <p>If our women understand all that which was put together in the P. W. L., if they decide to proceed in the thought of this pure advice, if they think less about the external effects of their intentions, but will instead look into the depth of their project, then, without doubt, they will achieve great success in their work, and in addition the satisfaction of fulfilling their duty towards themselves, society and our fatherland.</p>
