   <p>The second general draft for the United States Army will begin toward the and of this month. According to General Grounder chief of staff, eight hundred thousand recruits will be taken, of which one hundred thousand will be sent to the American army training camps before April 4. Further assignment of recruits to training camps will follow at intervals of a few weeks, proportionately to the vacancies in the camps after the departure of solider; from the first draft for France. Since by the first of July, there will be a million American soldiers in France, all recruits from the March-April draft will be in training by that time.</p>
   <p>This second draft will take twenty-four thousand youths and young men who have no dependents from Chicago.Since in the first draft,nineteen per cent of the Polish youth were sent to Camp Grant, not counting the thousands of volunteers in other camps, this draft will take a full five thousand young Poles to serve under the Stars and Stripes,to find themselves later in France.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This is our first and most sacred duty not only as citizens but as residents of this country and as Poles. However, there are certain matters that ought to be clarified, so that those who are on the draft list and who must therefore join the army may properly guide themselves.</p>
   <p>Before the first draft, we emphasized on many occasions that Poles, either naturalized citizens or those born here, must serve in the American army. But those who are not citizens, especially if they do not understand English, since they must serve in the army, can enlist in the Polish army instead, for the American government has given it full recognition and supports it as an Allied army since it has the same aims as the American army.</p>
   <p>Despite these considerations, despite the directions given by us, instead of enlisting in the Polish army, a great number of Poles who do not understand English enlisted in the American army, and consequently are a burden to the American army, or others whom the army authorities, in consideration of the fact that they are not citizens, had to remove in great numbers and create <span class="page-break">\3</span>so-called patrol regiments, as in Houston, Texas, and in other training camps. And this was not enough. Since it was too difficult to become good American soldiers in a short time, many tried to save themselves by desertion, to their disgrace and the disgrace of the Polish name. It is well understood that these fugitives will be caught sooner or later; fortunate are those who, by special permission, were transferred from the American to the Polish army. Many, how ever, have not had such good fortune and are paying the penalty for their un-Polish, un-American, and un-soldierly act, as they justly deserve.</p>
   <p>In reference to the non-citizens and non-English speaking Poles in the American army, a great many changes have been made since the first draft. A great many officials in the draft commissions having come to the conclusion that a Polish recruit of this sort will be much more useful to the Allied cause if he serves in the Polish army rather than in the American, have, at the request of the recruit, transferred him to the Polish army, giving him not only the necessary papers, but transportation to a polish recruiting station as well. The officers <span class="page-break">\4</span>in charge of the training camps have done the same thing and thus many recruits arrived in the Polish camp in full American uniform. It is not the purpose of this article to enumerate every incident of this sort, for that would be superfluous. We will only mention an incident of the last few days. At Freemont, California, Andrew Przudzik, who had served in Jefferson Barracks, was transferred in full uniform to Recruiting Center II in Chicago, where, producing the proper papers transferring him to the Polish army, he was immediately accepted. In the same way, American police authorities, having seized a certain J. Baron for not registering for service in the American army, brought him to the Polish Army Recruiting Station II, where he was immediately enlisted and sent to the Polish army training camp at Niagara on the Lake.</p>
   <p>It is perfectly evident from this that those who feel that they would be burdens to the American army due to insufficient knowledge of the English language and who in any case must serve in the army, can apply for transfer at their district draft commissions, and instead of serving in the American army, can serve in the Polish army, in which Polish commands will enable them to <span class="page-break">\5</span>become useful soldiers rapidly.</p>
   <p>Whoever wishes, then, providing he has the right to do so as a non-citizen and one who does not know the English language, can profit by this concession the American government has made for the Poles. We call attention, however, to the fact that whoever tries to use these concessions in order to escape military service will be considered a deserter from the Polish army, and will be pursued by police and federal authorities just as if he were deserter from the American army.</p>
