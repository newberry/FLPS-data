   <p>Last Sunday afternoon there was a meeting at the Dziennik Ludowy, of the Polish Women's Socialist Party. After concluding current business the members selected new officers who have promised energetic agitation among the Polish women of Chicago. This gathering as we judge it, was of valiant women members, who beyond all question will reap great and helpful benefits for the workers cause. We wish them success, for the work our Polonia shall glory in.</p>
