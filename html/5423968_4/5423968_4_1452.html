   <p>Last week the Chicago College of Law (Lake Forest University) conferred lawyers' degrees on two young Poles--Frank P. Danisch, 733 Van Horn Street, and Joseph J. Nowakowski. The latter is a nephew of Clemens Bielinski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union under the protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Nowakowski was taken care of since childhood by Mr. Bielinski, whose name he has officially adopted.</p>
   <p>The two will open a law office under the title Belinski and Belinski at 186-188 West Madison Street. Residence address is 689 West Seventeenth Street. Mr. Belinski and Mr. Danisch are well known in Saint Hedwig and Saint Adalbert parishes.</p>
