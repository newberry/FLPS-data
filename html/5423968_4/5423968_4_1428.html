   <p>Dear Colleagues: We must admit that Chicago is second only to Warsaw, and is nearly on a par with it, in number of Polish doctors. Yet, despite the fact that our society has existed for several years, and despite the large number of Polish physicians in Chicago, we have been unable to organize adequately. The medical societies of other nationalities, which have existed only a few years, have organized all their physicians, and great benefit has resulted for their people and for themselves. Professional and medical matters are the main topics of our meetings. We have introduced a series of extensive obligatory readings, and that innovation is already showing results. We have relaxed the dissertation requirements for the younger doctors, who find it easier to express their medical reports in the English language. We are now introducing informal gatherings for the doctors and their families, relatives, and friends. We have undertaken lectures in connection with hospital clinics. We collect contributions and aid the widows and orphans of deceased Polish doctors in our homeland. In general, we wish to live up to the high standards of our mission and be worthy representatives of our profession. We therefore invite all our colleagues to join a co-operative work. We request all those who for some reason have kept at a distance from our society to enroll as active members. The monthly meeting will be held on January 28, 1915, at 9:00 P. M., at the La Salle Hotel, Room 104.</p>
   <p>Topic for the evening: Caesarian operation--lecturer, Dr. W. Kuflewski. Drs. Gieraltowski and T. Z. Xelowski will participate in the discussion.</p>
   <p>Dr. W. Kuflewski, President</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Pietrzykowski, Secretary</p>
