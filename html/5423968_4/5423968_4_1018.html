   <p>September 23rd the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association has sent out a delegation to organize Poles with the purpose of encouraging the Polish women in working together to get more rights for the women. It mainly concerns the new charter going in effect next year when the city of Chicago will be obliged to enact a law giving women municipal suffrage. Some states have had this law enforced for many years, such as Kansas since 1867, Iowa from 1894. Besides the two states mentioned, England, Ireland and Scotland have also similar law. The law granting full suffrance has been enacted up to this time in the in the following states: Myoming, Utah, Idaho, Oregon, Colorado, likewise New Zealand and Southern Australia.</p>
   <p>Petiti as will be sent out to the charter convention with the aim of securing the municipal law, to give the women of Chicago the right to vote.</p>

   <p>So far the woman suffrage law is limited to school suffrage, that is, letting the women vote only on school affairs. We regretfully admit that very few women benefit at present from those rights.</p>
