   <p>There are books for diversion and for learning. Why then read scandalous nonsense, which is of no useful value and gives you no satisfaction? It is high time for Polish women to start a war on such useless ten cent romances.</p>
   <p>We Polish women should endeavor to read as many books as we can, but good books, not moral rottenness and imbecilities.</p>
   <p>Particularly, you Polish mothers should watch what kind of books your daughters are reading. Thousands of girls have already fallen over a precipice thanks to reading criminal romances in ten cent story books. Do you wish your daughter to go the same way? A young and inexperienced mind graps everything it comes in contact with and takes it for good. Therefore you have to watch it so that it takes only that which is useful.</p>
   <p>Very often the girls read about different women of the streets who afterwards became "countesses." They judge that in the life of these dime <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>novels, some great millionaire will fall in love with them and they will be come rich ladies forever after. Many a ruffian can be found pretending he is some important man, who would stop at nothing. How many women had things upset in their heads due to these <span class="gap">[gap]</span> novels How many marriages have been broken up for this reason?</p>
   <p>Remember, a good book is a man's best friend; a bad book, his greatest enemy. Let us do away with ten cent romances sold to us by our enemies!</p>
