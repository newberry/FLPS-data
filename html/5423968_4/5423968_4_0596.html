   <p>The President of the United States has issued two proclamations to the people within the last few days--both very important and worthy of serious consideration.</p>
   <p>In the first proclamation--or rather appeal--the President calls the attention of the people to the fact that the time of trial for America has come and that, therefore, we must all co-operate. We asks all the people to put forth their best productive efforts and to exercise every economy in private life, because now the United States must provide everything not only for itself and its army but also for the armies and people of the allied countries, which, together with the United States, are struggling in the battle against the Teutons.</p>
   <p>By co-operating, by making the necessary sacrifices for the common cause, <span class="page-break">\2</span>by understanding that each of us is as integral part of the huge war machine and that by economizing at home--planting vegetable gardens, working intensively in factories and railroads, sowing, plowing, or gathering the harvest on the farms--everyone becomes an equally useful champion serving the ideals for which the best sons of this nation are now taking up arms and ready to sacrifice their lives. Without co-operation there cannot be a complete victory.</p>
   <p>We Poles, as part of this great nation, cannot remain indifferent to the efforts of this country. If not the first, at least we must never be the last! We must always remember that, in this gigantic struggle which is now entering upon its third year, our future is being decided; that in the complete destruction of the audacious Teutonic Knights of the Cross and in the victory of the democracies of the world--which are now united against the Teutons in a powerful alliance of Slavic, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon nations--lies our <span class="page-break">\3</span>deliverance, and that through it freedom will be granted Poland. Therefore, over and above our duties as citizens of this country, we have the duty of delivering Poland, for which today there looms the one and only hope of freedom.</p>
   <p>He who has double duties needs double strength to carry them out, and so he must consolidate and conserve his energy in order to be able to fulfill his duties adequately instead of falling by the wayside under the load. We still need a great deal of this strength in order that later we may breathe deeply and freely and enjoy the fruits of our present labors and efforts together with other nations of the world. Therefore, we should pay special heed to the President's call and prove that we know how to be intelligent when time and circumstances demand this of us.</p>
   <p>In the second proclamation the President takes up a matter closely related <span class="page-break">\4</span>to the first--the matter of protecting the country against internal and foreign enemies, in which task we all should co-operate.</p>
   <p>If we are to work hard at our jobs in factories and mills, we want to be protected. On the farms, too, we want the products of our labor to reach the consumers on time, so that the factory workers may not suffer hunger in the event that transportation of foodstuffs be disrupted by the destruction of bridges and railroad tracks.</p>
   <p>When a woman prepares dinner for her husband or son, she wants to be reasonably sure that he will come home to enjoy it, and not be blown up together with the factory in which he works of killed while working on the railroad as a result of some nefarious plot.</p>
   <p>If our soldiers or sailors go to war, they want the assurance that no one will betray military movements to the enemy and that no one will expose military <span class="page-break">\5</span>secrets to the world and thus cause the defeat of the entire army. And the soldiers are not the only ones who have the right to demand this--the people of the whole nation share this right.</p>
   <p>Because of the heterogeneous character of the population of the United States, there may be individuals who bear a greater love for their compatriots now fighting on the other side, individuals who would rather help their old country than the country in which they are now living. Therefore, it is quite possible that they may commit such acts as will help the enemies of the United States, acts which are universally considered as treachery against the state.</p>
   <p>It is against such individuals that President Wilson warns the nation--and he warns the individuals by reminding them of the severe punishment--the death penalty--which any sort of hostile action against the state entails.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>But not only those who commit acts of treachery against the state are guilty--also guilty are those who conceal these crimes, those who, knowing about the intentions or plots of the malefactors, keep silent instead of telling the authorities, so that these criminal actions may be stopped in time.</p>
   <p>To report to the authorities any activity of this nature is not an act of espionage. We would be a criminal and malefactor who would not report the plots or intentions of the enemies of the country to the proper authorities--enemies who dare to plot against the United States, and who, by all sorts of acts, would spoil the work which we all want to do jointly.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is now our duty not only to obey all laws and avoid doing anything which may even cast the slightest suspicion upon us of aiding the Germans and their allies but also to observe carefully everything about us. In the event of discovering anything wrong, we should inform the authorities <span class="page-break">\7</span>clearly and openly, in the knowledge that we are doing our civic duty not only toward this country but toward Poland as well.</p>
