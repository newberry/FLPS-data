   <p>We have pointed out several times with bitterness that the Carnegie Company at Homestead, opposing the workers who were on strike, was looking for scabs to replace the strikers and that several hundred Poles responded and were hired.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to demand that every Polish worker in America join a labor organization and support the unions' fight against capitalism. In many places such conditions exist that this is impossible. But certainly those who work as non-union workers should not take part in this battle by working as scabs, by replacing a striking worker and siding with the manufacturer to their own inevitable disadvantage. Such action is especially unjustified at Homestead, where the dispute between the workers and the capitalists has reached an extreme point of irritation.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>We are not concerned with the economic side of the question, but we are complaining about the action from the citizens' point of view. The Polish worker temporarily profits by accepting employment in a company where a strike exists, but he in turn helps to bring about lower wages and the deterioration of the American worker's standing. And he does, above all, draw upon himself the racial hatred of the American worker, a hatred which is being strongly and widely felt in labor organizations.</p>
   <p>This hatred falls upon all the Poles in America and is the cause of the bitterness against us. This was often pointed out. We wish, however, to point out once more that the temporary profit of the workers who replaced the strikers is not an advantage to them.</p>
   <p>The incident at Homestead is a good example. Out of the several hundred Polish scabs who were employed by the Carnegie Company, several were injured because of the lack of knowledge of the machinery which they had to operate. Many <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of them were beaten by the strikers. A couple of them were victims of poisonings. Finally, according to a worker's dispatch to the Pittsburgh Przy Jaciela Ludu (People's Friend), all the scabs were replaced when the strikers returned to their jobs.</p>
   <p>This is their entire gain. They were the tools which were used to an immediate advantage and then discarded. For many months they will be in search of work .... and will be shoved about. The only thing that will remain for them is the hatred of the American worker and the name of "scab".</p>
   <p>This lesson ought to convince the Polish-American workers once and for all that, as strangers who come to this country to seek material gain through employment, they ought to side with the masses of American workingpeople--and not stick their fingers between the doors, especially when they can be quite sure that their fingers will be injured.</p>
