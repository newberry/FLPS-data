   <p>During the World War the recruit in the United States was drawn to fight against the greatest foe of humanity, the Prussian. During the recruiting, a solemn promise was made about taking care of the families of the killed, disabled and, in turn, it was promised that a bonus would be paid to all soldiers. Terribly disappointed were our brave soldiers, who in defense of the most sacred ideals, laid down on the altar of that great ideal their blood and lives because they were being denied their promised bonus.</p>
   <p>Do we not owe a better recompense than we have so far awarded to those who have spilt blood for our cause?</p>
   <p>Every Pole will understand that the soldier who fought for the liberation of oppressed nations is worthy of a great reward. Each of us can understand that during the war he suffered privation, while over here many lived in affluence. The soldier each day was exposed to death or injury and for this he only received $30 per month, while very many of those who remained in America earned as high as $30 per day.</p>

   <p>Let Us Sign a Petition.</p>
   <p>The soldiers do not request money from us, but they ask for the promised bonus, which has been doing penance for two years in Congress. Let every citizen of Polish extraction sign the petition placed below, and Congress will be compelled to take care of this matter as soon as possible. If the treasury of the government has no money, as the politicians explain, then funds can be drawn from a general sales tax in a very moderate degree.</p>
   <p>We are opposed to heavy taxes, but a small sales tax can be levied and a bonus can be found from that for the heroes of the World War. Sign the petition and send it to the editorial office of the Polish Union Daily. We will see to it that it gets into the proper hands.</p>
   <p>To Congress For Action on Soldiers' Bonus, With Sales Tax for Paying It.</p>
   <p>We respectfully petition Congress to pass the soldiers' bonus act without <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>further delay and also to levy a sales tax to obtain the money to pay the bonus, for the following reasons:</p>
   <p>First. Public opinion throughout the United States is undeniably in favor of the soldiers' bonus, as shown by the decisive majority in every state in which a popular referendum has been taken: in Maine, by 3 to 1; New Jersey, by 3-1/2 to 1; New York, nearly 2 to 1; Rhode Island, 8 to 1; Wisconsin, 3 to 1; Oregon, 2 to 1; Washington, 2-1/2 to 1, and so on.</p>
   <p>Second. We believe that Congress, if permitted to vote on the soldiers' bonus will favor it with even greater unanimity, regardless of party, than the popular majority by which the people in twenty-two states have already approved it; we believe that the soldiers' bonus cannot and ought not to be defeated and the longer it is postponed the greater the injustice.</p>
   <p>Third. We believe the new tax scheme proposed by the ways and means committee is only a little less objectionable than Secretary Mellon's <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>proposal for 3-cent postage and for a new 3 cents a gallon tax on gasoline. Proponents of such taxes oppose any soldiers' bonus whatever and hope, by linking it with such new destructive and unpopular taxes, to kill the proposition altogether.</p>
   <p>Fourth. If the soldiers' bonus is not only right, but inevitable, and if the United States is not to lag behind England, France, Italy, Canada, and Australia, which have already paid liberal soldiers' bonuses, then our debt payment is already long overdue, not as a debt, for our debt to the soldiers can never be paid, but as a just tribute to the valor and the sacrifice of the men who won the war.</p>
   <p>Fifth. The only question that remains is: By what system of taxation shall the money be raised? Not by bond issues, because it is against the traditional policy of the United States to increase debts in time of peace. Not by any taxes irritating business or industry, because we already have too many such taxes. A small general sales tax will raise more than enough to pay the soldiers' bonus. It will bear heavily <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>upon no one. If the experience of Canada and our own Philippine Islands, where the sales tax is in operation, is repeated, the system will meet with such favor that it will become one of the approved methods of raising necessary revenue after the soldiers' bonus has been paid.</p>
