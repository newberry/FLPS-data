   <p>Note: Because certain sums have not yet been turned in, the Committee of the Polish Section is keeping the balance until it receives them. Then it will send the entire amount to the Central Committee for the relief of war victims in Poland.</p>
   <p>The sum of $21,034.73, which the Central Committee of the Allied Bazaar allotted to the Poles as their share, has already been sent to the Central Polish Relief Committee.</p>

   <p>If anyone--group or individual--is not sure whether his contribution has been handed over to the Committee of the Polish Section, he is invited to examine at any time the books and lists of collectors at the offices of the Polish Women's Alliance.</p>
