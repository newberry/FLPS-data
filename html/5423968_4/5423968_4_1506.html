   <p>The last day of the old year marked the celebration of the Albert Wachowski Building and Loan Association's silver anniversary at the main office, 3032 West 22nd Street. Many people of St. Casimir's parish gathered to congratulate the founder, Albert Wachowski, and to wish him health and prosperity for another twenty-five years. Along with these greetings words of appreciation were extended to the celebrant for his untiring work in the community, which has made it possible for thousands to own homes. Credit also was extended him for making possible the establishment of several Polish banks on the South Side.</p>
   <p>At a special reception, John Czekala, president of the Polish Building and Loan Association League, gave the highlights of Mr. Wachowski's career. It was a worthy tribute to this highly popular Polish financier.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"Mr. Wachowski," said J. Czekala, "well understood the plight of the Polish people, and he knew that only through savings could they find a place in the American scheme of things. That is why he organized a building and loan company, which enabled the Polish people to save money at a profit. In the twenty-five years of business, he has been able to build this organization into a million and a quarter dollar institution. True, from the beginning, like any other organization, many difficulties had to be faced, however, the future of this association was assured, for Mr. Wachowski knew how to convince the people of the necessity of saving."</p>
   <p>"Several years ago, this organization became the mother of two Polish banks; namely, the Marshall Square State Bank and the Brighton Park State Bank; he is president of both. And, indeed, it is an honor for me to present this esteemed Polish financier with this beautiful silver cup in honor of his many achievements," concluded the speaker as he presented the cup to Mr. Wachowski.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>

   <p>The third speaker was J. P. Grzemski, secretary of the Polish Building and Loan Association League. He was followed by Roman Cieslewicz, who spoke about the barriers encountered in forming the entire organization.</p>
   <p>"Thousands of persons have benefited by the generosity of Mr. Wachowski. Today, they own homes and other real estate property," pointed our Mr. Cieslewicz.</p>
   <p>The following speakers followed: Paul Andricka, of Kensington; Albert Mazur, of Phoenix; Paul Szepietowski; also of Phoenix; and finally the celebrant, who has been a resident of Chicago for the past forty-eight years.</p>

   <p>A Biographical Sketch of A. Wachowski</p>
   <p>Albert Wachowski was born March 15, 1858 in Stara Wies (Old Village) at Gniezno (Gnesen) in the province of Posen. He left his parents, Francis and Josephine (nee Kwapiszewska) Wachowski, after serving in the German army and sailed for America. He found his home in Chicago. From the beginning, <span class="page-break">5</span>young Albert followed the carpenter's trade. Soon after he became interested in the building trade, and later he became a merchant.</p>
   <p>For over forty years, he has occupied himself with the building and loan business. In 1892, the young immigrant organized the Pulaski Building and Loan Association at St. Casimir's parish. Seven years later, Albert Wachowski founded another such firm in Town of Lake under the name of Prince Witold (a famous Lithuanian prince). Two years later, he established the John Sobieski III Building and Loan Association in West Hammond, Indiana. In 1902, he incorporated the Albert Wachowski Building and Loan Association for ninety-nine years,with a capital of five million dollars. This organization played a big part in growth of Chicago and its environs. It helped many Polish people to build or purchase homes in Kensington, West Pullman, Blue Island, Phoenix, Harvey, West Harvey, South Chicago, Chicago Heights, and Posen, Illinois.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In Town of Lake, another loan association was founded by Mr. Wachowski in 1903. It was a Lithuanian institution and named for Fr. Vincent Barzynski. Another was founded in Gary, Indiana in 1911, bearing his name. During that same year, he was instrumental in establishing the Polish Building and Loan Association League of Illinois. At present he is treasurer of this organization.</p>
   <p>In 1906, A.Wachowski purchased a large tract of land on the Southwest Side of Chicago, called Crawford, and established a new community, Cracow. He also helped to found the parish of the Good Shepherd.</p>
   <p>On Feb. 24, 1884, he married Miss Constance Korzeriewski, daughter of John and Frances Korzeniewski, Out of this marriage, there were nine children, five sons and four daughters. His oldest son, Leon A. Wachowski, is an attorney and vice-president of the Marshall Square State Bank; his second son, Stanislaus A. Wachowski, is a corporal in the United States Army.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Eugene, his third son, is assistant cashier at the Marshall Square State Bank. The fourth son, Casimir, is attending Northwestern University, while his youngest son, Thaddeus, is studying medicine.</p>
   <p>Joanna, his daughter, is the wife of the manager and treasurer of the Marshall Square State Bank, Ksawery Czastka. Another daughter, Veronica, married Mr. Polczynski; Mary, his third daughter, has become Mrs. Windham; and his fourth, Gertrude, is attending a musical school.</p>
   <p>Albert Wachowski attained all his business achievements by working hard, and St. Casimir's parish can be rightfully proud of him for organizing the Marshall Square State Bank, 3113 West 22nd Street, and the Brighton Park State Dank, Archer Avenue, near Medzie. As we said before, he is president of both.</p>
   <p>For many years, Mr. Wachowski has belonged to many Polish societies, both <span class="page-break">8</span>national and welfare. He is a member of long standing in the Polish National Alliance and the Polish Roman Catholic Union. Since he came to Chicago, he has taken active part in Polish affairs. Recently, he has been distinguished by the Polish government for his work in Polish affairs during the World War.</p>
   <p>We hope that the celebrant will continue in good health, and reach his fiftieth anniversary in his organization.</p>
