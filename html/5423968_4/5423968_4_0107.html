   <p>County Judge Edmond K. Jarecki, with the assistance of Anthony Czarnecki, secretary of the Electors State Commission in Cook County, and Lawyer Freda D. Maguire, appealed to the president in the affair of the disabled World War Veterans, who are now being deprived of suitable care and are confined in crowded hospitals.</p>
   <p>Judge Jarecki informed President Harding, that since the year 1920, at least a thousand of these unfortunate veterans, who became mentally ill as the result of that horrible war, were placed in state institutions, which were already filled beyond capacity.</p>
   <p>During the past few days the number of patients has increased. Jarecki claims that for the past few weeks, he was forced to send these veteran mental cases in large numbers to these state institutions.</p>
   <p>President Harding instructed General Sawyer, the White House Physician, to <span class="page-break">2</span>undertake immediate action in this important affair presented by Judge Jarecki in the session, which is to take place on Friday.</p>
   <p>In his address to the president, Judge Jarecki cried out:</p>
   <p>"With the aid of records we may confirm that a large number of these veterans, who have lately been confined to these state institutions as mental cases, originate from good families. Until now the government has done a great deal for the veterans, who were wounded and disabled in the World War, but for the veterans afflicted mentally, the result of a distorted brain, suffered during the war, nothing has yet been done. For this reason, we must undertake immediate interest in this affair of building federal hospitals for these mental unfortunates."</p>
   <p>HOSPITALS OVERCROWDED.</p>
   <p>"Everyone is well aware of the fact that the present number of hospitals <span class="page-break">3</span>does not fulfill our needs. The state hospitals in Elgin, Kankakee, and Dunning are so filled that it is impossible for us to hospitalize any more veterans and give them suitable care, meanwhile, the number of sick steadily increases."</p>
   <p>"Everybody knows about it, and this fact gives a new argument against the government to the subversive elements and the instigators of revolutions. They stand upon corners and as "Soap-Box Orators", they make speeches to the youth, in which they hint at facts just previously explained and sow dislike for the American Government and its system of governing. In this way they poison American Society."</p>
   <p>A DEMAND FOR BETTER CARE OF VETERANS.</p>
   <p>"I, on my part, observe this to be my holy obligation to care for those unfortunates and demand for them justice, as well as provisions against the harm, which is being done to them. This is why I appeal to the authorities <span class="page-break">4</span>in Washington, presenting to them the entire situation and begging them to take immediate interest in this important affair. With my faith in the American government, I have assurance that my pleas and plans shall not be discarded."</p>
   <p>Judge Jarecki's appeal aroused great interest in administrative circles. We have great hopes that this magnificent work of Judge Jarecki will bring results, for which the World War Veterans will be grateful to him the rest of their lives.</p>
