   <p>In 1918 Mr. Joseph Slodkowski started a sausage factory on Commercial Avenue, and conducted it there until 1923. Then he moved to 2017-23 W. 18th St.</p>
   <p>In 1925 he started to enlarge the building, which he completed next year. His sausage factory now has a good appearance and it occupies almost a whole block.
