   <p>Every state has laws regulating child labor. These laws aim to restrict children from industrial labor. When employed at an early age, they are depreived of the education to which they are rightfully entitled, preventing them from taking their place in life. Children forced to labor when too young, do not have an opportunity of developing their talents; they are never given a chance to fit themselves for occupations to which they are best suited. Such persons are doomed to a life of suffering and drudgery. Their earnings are usually very small, therefore they are of little financial assistance to the family. But a child's earning capacity is increased with every year it spends in school and its chances for success in life are enhanced; and an education in the United States can be obtained almost without cost.</p>
   <p>According to the immigration laws, any one entering this country, when less than sixteen years old, must attend school until sixteen years of age. This applies to the native born as well as immigrants. The states have similar laws. In California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, the law stipulates that no one under sixteen years shall be employed in industry, unless they have a special employment certificate. However, this does not apply to youngsters on the farms, or those employed as domestics.</p>

   <p>No one under fourteen or fifteen years of age can obtain employment in the state of California and Michigan; they must be at least fifteen years old. Also those who have attained the age of fourteen or fifteen years, but have not reached a specified grade in school, are prohibited from working. For instance: California demands that they finish the seventh grade, at least; New Jersey insists only on the fifth grade; in the other five states, mentioned above, the sixth grade is required. In the state of New York, a child not fifteen years old, will not be permitted to labor in an industrial establishment, if he or she has not completed the eighth grade. Usually, a pupil advances one grade a year, or six grades in six years. Many who are backward study eight years to attain the sixth grade.</p>
   <p>Those not sixteen years of age, must submit to a physical examination, and a doctor diagnoses their physical condition before they can hope to receive permission to go to work. In the State of Michigan they do not always demand a medical examination. Anyone less than sixteen years old cannot be employed at night work, although New York and Michigan, under certain conditions and exceptions, permit it. In the states of California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York, those under16 are allowed to work only 8 hours a day. The State of Michigan stipulates a ten hour-day, and Pennsylvania nine hours.</p>
