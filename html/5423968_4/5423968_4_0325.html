   <p>Mrs. Wojtalewicz, mother of the first soldier from the city of Chicago, bought on April 6th at 9 A. M., the first liberty bond at the bureau of the director, Mr.Charles Folos. Her son, a member of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, fell on the field of battle in France.</p>
   <p>Accompanied by Dr. Schiller from St. Adalberts Parish and Mr. A. Czarnecki, Mrs. Wojtalewicz went to the bureau of the director and there gladly handed over the first $50 on the alftar of liberty. It is no small honor to Mrs. Wojtalewicz, and a much greater one to the Poles, who, as is now evident, are always first to take part in everything that is good and sacred.</p>
   <p>May this act of Mrs. Wojtalewicz encourage many more of our fellow citizens, both men and women, to buy liberty bonds. Show your true patriotism in this manner. Remember that every bond bought is a box in the ear for the Kaiser, that nightmare which has murdered our Polish people for years.</p>

   <p>With the help of the United States and the Allies, we must crush him to a pulp.</p>
   <p>Who will follow in the footsteps of Mrs. Wojtalewicz and buy bonds?</p>
   <p>To action, fellow citizens!</p>
